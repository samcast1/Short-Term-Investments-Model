2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a two night stay in Scranton and were very pleased with this lovely Airbnb. It is a beautiful historic home on a nice quiet street. We felt it was a great value for the money especially sine it was so much larger inside than we anticipated. Lots of space to spread out!  Had a few minor issues with checking in that were quickly resolved by the host. Communication from Esther was quick and helpful.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location was perfect for us since we have family nearby that we were visiting with every day. The apartment was inviting and equipped with helpful amenities. The cleanliness of the rooms and the linens really stood out. The apartment was very private and had an outside porch and patio.

2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Great apartment and location! It was missing trash bags, the tv in the living room didn’t work, and the half and half packets were spoiled.

Some things to note-
Getting the key fobs is slightly tricky but Esther was helpful
The shower is a bit cold bc of the different style of door. There is only one side. It doesn’t fully close"

It was the perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Highly recommend!"""
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It felt like home , very clean and beautiful home! Would definitely stay again when we are down in PA."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Farred was incredibly responsive as soon as we booked our stay and continued to be with any questions we had. The house is conveniently located to interstate 81, since my family is in Wilkes-Barre it made getting back and forth very quick. Pro tip, get some pizza in Old Forge! We will definitely return."
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Loved the stay here! Farrar was very helpful, welcoming and quick to respond with any questions and provided immediate points of contact. The house was also taken care of well and had great amenities, rooms were spacious and clean. The kitchen had many useful gadgets for cooking and cleaning supplies as well and bathrooms were well stocked for any necessities. Thanks for the great experience for my snowboard trip at Montage!!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a very clean and nice home. Farrar was amazing and very helpful!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Farrar's place was in excellent condition, especially the main bathroom, which looked as though it had been recently renovated. Every surface throughout was immaculately clean. The kitchen was stocked with plenty of dishes but lacked some basic cooking/baking utensils, so if you plan to do any serious baking, you should plan to bring your own. The microwave oven is only 700-watt, so you'll need to add 43% or 71% to the cooking times for a 1000- or 1200-watt oven respectively. The house has a tankless water heater, so you'll effectively never exhaust the supply of hot water. The water tastes pretty bad, so bring your own drinking water. The front door has a 7-digit touch-panel combination lock that was not working due to low batteries when we arrived, but Farrar was very quick to come over and replace them. The location is okay, ~10 minutes from downtown. The house is on a busy road that makes noticeable noise and is one-way, making getting to the house a tad inconvenient."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was clean and conveniently located. Three bedrooms and two full baths allowed us to all be accommodated comfortably. I left a cosmetic bag behind and the owner contacted us immediately which allowed us to go back and retrieve it before we left the area. We will definitely come back when in the area!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"thanks for the house and a nice stay, road is a bit busy at times but didn't disturb us. :-)"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cute house, recently remodeled. On a very busy main road. Yard & outside still needs work but the inside has been excellently updated. 2 bathrooms but one is in the basement. Beds and couches were comfy. Easy to get in. Could use a little more instruction on how to use thermostat, it was cold in there when we arrived. Also a little more info at checkout as to where to put dirty linens/towels/dishes etc. Overall very satisfied. Great location for us as it's super close to our family."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second week I’ve rented this home for work and it’s an excellent property, great location and we are willing to book again! Thank you for everything."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great space in this adorable town! Close to everything. Beautiful area. Host was accessible and responsive. Thanks for everything!

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a great value! All I needed was a place to sleep overnight for a work trip so unfortunately I couldn't enjoy the company of Dawn and Roger. However it was just perfect for me to get a good night's sleep and get on my way. The bed was more comfortable than just about any other Airbnb I've been in over the years and it is definitely in a quiet area outside the city. Will definitely be returning on my next trip through the area!

2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Dawn's place was as described in the listing. We had trouble finding the address as it's part of a condo/townhouse development and we didn't know to look for that as opposed to a stand alone house. The bedroom and bathroom for our use were very clean. It was a little awkward to be in someone's home while they are also there. If you are accustomed to that type of accommodation then there will be no problem. The two dogs were not any problem for us. It was perfect for a quick stopover for a road trip.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We only stayed for a night while travelling, but it was a peaceful stop on a long journey. Dawn was helpful and communicative. We initially missed their front door and had to double back. That said, it was in the middle of a storm and very dark, so that would likely not have been an issue otherwise."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Dawn and Roger were lovely hosts. My boyfriend and I were driving up for the holidays and needed a place to stay to break up the long 10hr drive. Not only were they excellent at communicating and welcoming, they very kindly stayed up to let us in and show us the bed and bathroom. The house was decorated absolutely beautifully for the holidays and the bed was incredibly comfortable. Their two poodles were well-behaved and adorable and we felt like we were at a home away from home. Can’t recommend this place enough. Thank you Dawn and Roger."

Highly recommend."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"There wasn't anyone even there for check-in OR check-out. This visit was more like a hotel, if you want to slip in and slip out again quietly. The room, the bathroom, the house, are all brand-new and gorgeously clean. And if you get a chance, take a walk up the hill in the neighborhood outside. The view across Scranton in the dawn hour was beautiful."

2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Dawn’s place was just what we needed for our night in Scranton. Communication was clear and quick. The place was very clean and comfy. It was perfect except for not having an en suite bathroom, which we knew going in. I did think it was going to be a bit more privacy for the bathroom but we never saw anyone. When I went to the bathroom during the night I was afraid I would wake our hosts up as their room was right on the other side. If this is not an issue for you then I highly recommend it. They even had snacks and water in the room which is a HUGE thing for us!!"

Great location, very clean, Dawn was super sweet and welcoming, and her dogs were so cute! The room is right next to her room. That was my only worry as we went out for drinks and dinner and came home later. I was worried we would wake her and/or the doggos up just by talking. Other than that, it was a perfect experience!"

There were instructions for using the TV (I didn't turn it on) and info for take-out food. The bathroom is right outside the bedroom door on the same level as the loft area.

There were snacks and coffee for us and we slept great!!!
Cari has thought of everything to make your stay relaxing and even if you forgot essentials she has you covered!
Lots of recommendations on places to go and eat as well.
We also visited Nay Aug , worth the visit.
It rained so we didn’t get in as much exploring as we had hoped. We will be back next year and I’m hoping Cari has an opening for us!"

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Inside the house, we could hear the people who live next door. talking. There is a doorway that looks covered with just insulation and fabric and it felt like we couldn't talk privately. But they were quiet neighbours. We loved the little courtyard. It was comfortable and the decorations were very cool. Again, the neighbours were just beyond the bamboo fence so although it looks private, we could hear them plainly so I'm sure they could hear every word we said."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great place!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is our second time staying at Cari’s place and it’s been one of our favorites. Cari has put so much thought into this space and it has everything you could need. Definitely recommend for your next trip to the Scranton area!
2024-02-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I stayed here with a dog for 4 nights. We loved the price and that Cari was always responsive. However, the experience overall was just Ok.
On my first morning there, I discovered that the smoke/CO detector in the room with the futon and kitchen appliances had been disconnected from the hard wiring and the batteries had been removed. Cari did eventually bring over a new smoke detector (her tenants were unable to get the existing one to work), along with a new fire extinguisher (there had not been a fire extinguisher in the unit prior). She told me that she knew the smoke detector was working 3 months earlier.
There were a few other things that made out stay less-than perfect. At times, the hot air system was blowing in cigarette smoke from the other half of the house. Doing dishes in the bathroom sink was a pain. The space is tiny and wouldn't be bad for a 1 night stopover, but I'd discourage anyone from booking a longer stay."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed it very much very close to montage mountain!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Overall great stay. Cari is very responsive and a great host. Perfect stay for a few nights.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I wanted a place to stay because we were visiting montage mountain. Everything was smooth, from checking in to checking out. It was in a nice area with a bunch of places to eat as well. Would definitely recommend!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is the second time we have stayed at Cari’s rental. It’s perfect for a one night layover in our travels - comfortable bed, clean and she accepts dogs. Nice small fenced in backyard. No frills, but all the essentials for a quick stay."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable, a little cold because of the heat source. host was very responsive, accommodating and friendly."
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Cute place; bit of a grim neighborhood.
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Convenient location and good value. I was able to walk to dinner and had off street parking. The outdoor area would be lovely in summer.
There was an issue with the gate but Cari immediately provided a solution.
The temp outside was in low 30s and it was a bit chilly, but the space heater and extra blankets made it cozy.
The bed room and bathroom were clean. The fridge was not clean.
Overall a good value"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Conveniently located, exactly as described with plenty of recommendations and a very cute backyard. Great stay!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute cozy and quirky place that was perfect as a stop on a road trip. We didn’t spend much time here but were happy with the stay.
2023-12-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"The suite is cute and eclectic. The only issue we had was we travel with our own food and some medicine that needs to be refrigerated/frozen. We chose this room because it included a full sized refrigerator/freezer. When we checked in at 11 pm, the appliance was not working properly. There were a couple of totally melted freezer items and warm refrigerator items inside. We contacted the owner, but it being so late, we heard back in the morning as we were leaving. We were initially told we would be compensated for the inconvenience, but later told that when she arrived to check on the issue the appliance was working fine and must've just gone through a defrost cycle or something. Ultimately we were unable to have what we needed."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Cozy spot for our short stay!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I will be staying there every time I come to the area! Great host and very nice apartment!

The place is perfect for a couple and it has an eclectic charm to it!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cozy, eclectic space that provided a sense of privacy even in a busy neighborhood. Thoughtfully decorated and immaculately clean. Our family felt right at home."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nice little place for a one night layover in our travels. Nothing extravagant, but the necessities for a comfortable stay. Decor was eclectic and interesting."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cari was wonderful! The place was clean and welcoming. Cari was accommodating when I had to chance the dates of my stay and responsive when I let her know I’d be arriving later than expected. She even went ahead and set up the second bed for my best friend who was traveling with me. The bed I slept in was the most comfortable bed I’ve ever slept in. It was warm and she provided a space heater to stay toasty. Everything was clean and comfortable and very welcoming. I will definitely stay again if I am in the area.
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Totally decent place for an overnight stay. Small but clean and great price.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great stay at Cari's Antoinette Suite. Cozy studio, set it on the back side of the house. You enter through the gate at the end of the driveway, and walk into the back yard which is made for quiet bbq's and sitting! Loved the backyard, just wish it was warmer to enjoy it! The Studio was small, but had everything that you needed plus! Definitely will be back"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"we will 100% be returning on our next road trip. if you love The Office, you will LOVE this place"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"As a customer who lived in scranton for 17 years, I've got to say this was amazing. I didn't feel like I was in Scranton. I felt right at home, and this will be the first place I look whenever I come to Scranton! Cari was amazing. The place was clean and private, and it was just all around wonderful. Thank You Cari!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,My family and I were very satisfied with our stay. Our dog enjoyed their time there as well.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute place to stop overnight on our way to New York. Really appreciated that we were able to let our dog roam in the backyard and stretch he legs off leash after a long drive. Cari was very easy to check in and communicate with throughout our trip!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay at Cari's place was smooth. The space is small but has all the amenities and is uniquely decorated. The location is on a street with busy traffic. The airbnb is in the back of the house with a private fenced area which made for a quiet and comfortable stay. Note, it was a bit challenging to turn the car around after pulling into the driveway due to the busy traffic on the street."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful home it’s beautiful I would recommend to anyone I would love to stay again.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect place to stay! Just minutes from Nay Aug Park, downtown and the Steamtown historic site. The space is small and adorable, perfect for a couple in town for a wedding. Cari is a great host—she’s friendly and helpful and made us feel right at home. Would stay here again! Thanks Cari!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cari was very quick to reply and her place was great! Lots of love and fun and humor went into the decorating, we had plenty of laughs! It's a small place, so I probably wouldn't recommend it for an extended stay, but for a night or two it's great and very cozy. I would come back!"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"was perfect for our stay, we were in the area hiking was very comfortable place to go back to after being out all day."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a great suite, loaded with amenities and artistic decor. I don’t think I’ve ever stayed at any place with such a unique character. It was well situated to check out nearby attractions and I’d love to return next time I swing this way."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cari’s place was a haven for my pup & I. The enclosed backyard felt secure, private and peaceful. Loved the sound of church bells and the train whistle every so often. House very cozy and comfy stocked with goodies which made the stay all the more special. Loved the unique decor inside and out. House was very clean and clean smelling. Check in was a breeze. 💗"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We came for an event at Univ..
Of Scranton and this was very
Close to the field. The outdoor seating area was
A huge plus! The whimsical decor was fun and made us chuckle. Thank you so much for a great night!!"
2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Very small space. Will work if traveling solo but a little difficult for two people. We had a lot of concerns BUT Cari was very nice and responded quickly with solutions.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Stayed at Cari's for one evening. Always a pleasure to stay at her Airbnb. Great place for a great deal!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I appreciated Cari’s pet policy, which allowed my dad to bring his dog with us during our visit. Cari also offered an early check in since we would be in the area earlier in the afternoon. She communicated promptly and was very helpful. The space was perfect for our stay between our hikes on the D&H Rail Trail. The outdoor patio is a nice touch and provided a cute, peaceful space for us to have dinner and relax. It was relatively quiet inside despite being on a busy city street. It was also convenient to local restaurants and the historical sites we visited. I would definitely stay here again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy nice place, would go again. Love the homemade things and outside area. You can also put car in the front of the house so it’s really convenient."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a great find! Cari has curated a cozy space that feels very peaceful and quiet despite being so conveniently close to downtown. She was communicative and had great recommendations of things to do.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a sweet place to stay! Very welcoming and cozy. I loved the artist style. Would definitely stay again when I’m in this area.
There is a washer and dryer available in the very next room. They use quarters to use them. I didn’t have any coins and wish I would have realized this ahead of time so I could prepare myself. So I’m letting y’all know."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cari’s place was perfect for our overnight stay with our dog!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just what I needed for a quick weekend visit! A quiet, private suite full of personality. The location is on a main road, but still quiet and close to a lot of fun local bars, restaurants, etc. The outdoor seating area was also super cozy. Cari was super friendly and accommodating, a lovely host :)"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cari's place was an amazing gem within Scranton. I loved the detailed care in decorations. Nice charm to the airbnb and would definitely return to it again. Highly recommended place!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The location is very convenient because it’s near the interstate. We also loved the patio.
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Cari did many thoughtful things like having dog treats. Coffee and a selection of packaged foods. The enclosed outdoor area was great for my constant companion Abby but she was slow or did not reply to questions

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cari is such an amazing host!! the yard...cute and a total vibe. The interior was a perfect spot to rest after a long conference day. I got amazing sleep here. if you know me, that means the absolute most."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We were so sad that we only had one night in Cari's sweet hideaway. It was perfectly positioned within the heart of Scranton and had so many creative touches inside that we felt immediately at home there. The beds were comfortable and we appreciated having a parking space off the street to make that process less stressful. We could have happily spent a long weekend there and would have loved to have made more use of the adorable seating area outside.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Needed a place to stay with our 2 pups on our way to Maine. Cari’s place delivered. We liked especially the nice, private backyard, and that we were able to walk downtown for dinner."

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We really appreciated the off-street parking. And after a long day on the road, the super-comfortable bed was great. Perhaps the best attribute of this Airbnb is the covered patio and private garden - the perfect escape place."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Apartment was as described and check-in was easy with the directions Cari sent in advance.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"we had an amazing stay at Cari's place. You can feel all the love and comfort through her art and detail that she put into the indoor and outdoor space. The place is quirky, fun and a perfect unique oasis. We did not have an opportunity to paint a rock because we were only there for one night, but hopefully we'll be back again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"After working on the road for 2 weeks at camping festivals, Cari’s place was the exact place I needed to be! It had all the charm and artistry to make me feel safe and peaceful, and you can feel the love her tribe feels towards others. Every time I come here, I want to stay at Cari’s."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cari’s place was great. A quiet, peaceful haven on a busy road. Lots of great art and plenty of snacks too. It’s clear much thought and effort went into designing the place. I’d stay again."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Needed a place to stay in Scranton overnight on the fly and was lucky to have been able to book Cari's great place. Cari has all the bases covered and her place is a great little haven in Scranton. Definitely will return when I'm back in Scranton.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cari’s place was perfect for what we needed. A fun and eclectic place to hang our hats for an evening as we did some waterfall exploring in PA.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Second stay at Cari’s Antoinette suite - 100% will be back again! Comfy bungalow with a great outback space !
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Charming and filled with thoughtful touches! We found the pictures very accurate to the vibe—art and humor everywhere, yet with peaceful restraint. Beautiful soft bed linens. Loved sitting in the garden with gentle night breezes. Our little dog didn’t want to leave! Would love to spend more time, as the Book of Stuff was crammed with things to do in the area!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a very relaxing and pleasant stay for the week. Cari has everything covered. Will definitely plan on revisiting if I return to Scranton.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great little quaint getaway with a nice backyard to relax in. Thanks for letting us and the pups stay. We would definitely stay here again!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cute place. It felt like home away from home. We loved the back patio area and inside the decor had us cracking up. It’s in a good location as well. Both me and my friend know if we ever come back to Scranton, we are staying here again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cari's suite was perfect for my trip home to Scranton - I moved away 24 yrs ago. It was a perfect jumping off place for me getting around to visit loved ones...handy places I wanted to go, to highways and stores. I loved her Boho vibe and she thought of everything - even dog treats! The backyard amenities were so much more than I could have imagined...loved sitting on her patio - perfect for the writing and flower arranging for friends I did while there. it was a treat to meet her before I left - she is kind, caring, thoughtful and an excellent host....really wants her guests to have a good stay. Though friends had offered me a place to stay, with my little dog, I was so glad we stayed there. Place is small but even with an out of town friend joining me on my first night, we were fine. Cari had the futon all made up for our arrival to give us 2 beds. I'll stay there again!!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great location with a lovely and fun back patio
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cari's place was great! I enjoyed getting an excuse to be creative and paint a rock for the backyard garden area. :) Plus, it was well stocked with coffee and some other tasty snacks. The only thing to be aware of is parking in the driveway. Moosik street can sometimes be busy, so backing out may take some time, but it is fine if you are patient enough to find the right opportunity to back out safely. (although, traffic could have been busier than usual due to the time of year I visited since there was a big graduation in town occurring near the time I was there)."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A cute little getaway in Scranton. Nicely decorated, had all the amenities for a short-term stay, and was less than a 10 minute drive from everything we did while there."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Your place was great. Keep doing what you are doing.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Was so great to stay here while in town for a concert. Carli was flexible and communicative and would highly recommend staying here!
2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Hostess is very nice! It is very small but a great price.
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The futon couch/bed was very uncomfortable had hard time sleeping on it. The bed was taken by my daughter so i took the futon couldn't get good sleep for 2 days. There is a bar across the futon even with the extra mattress she provided still could feel the bar in the futon. The bathroom sink did not empty well probably needs to be cleaned out. The door handle was loose and had hard time using the key to open and lock the door need to be fixed. My worse complaint was the Futon was so uncomfortable even to sit on to watch TV. All else was good. The bed in the bedroom was comfortable, everything was clean, my daughter loved the decor, wasn't my taste, the kitchen and bathroom was well stocked. Could use some decaf. coffee. Instructions were in 2 places had to read all. the first night had the netflex the 2nd night no netflex no streaming on any channel . Had local channels."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cari was a wonderful host. She was very kind, and accommodating! She left all kind of snacks and food in the freezer. Had all the small little items that you think you would need to bring. Although the place is small, it’s a great place to spend the evening. Carrie goes above and beyond for her guest! We would definitely stay there again when in town."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cari was an amazing hostess!!! The place was perfect in many ways - perfect vibe and perfect size.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Located just outside Scranton's downtown, Cari's spot is convenient and comfortable. Although it was too cold and snowy for us to take advantage of the fenced patio on our late December trip, we noted the gas grill, outdoor furniture, and dining area as nice (non-winter) features of Cari's place. We had a nice stay -- and considered the price a ""value."""
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Stayed while on a road trip cross country to visit family. Arrived during a snowstorm. Place was easy to find and right off the highway. Cari was awesome at helping us figure out how to get dinner. Place is very clean and great for a family traveling. We will keep it as a favorite for next time when traveling
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean and comfortable! Stayed after LASIK surgery and convenient location to the eye center. Cari was accommodating, and had good communication. Excellent recommendations for places to eat things to do."
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This was my second stay and just as cute and cozy as the first time! As always, Cari checks in and remains available for contact, if needed."
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"We liked our quick stay at Cari's and would stay again. It's on a busy street but you can't hear the noise from inside as you're in the back of the home. We greatly appreciated being able to park in the driveway but not sure this is always the case; we were blocked in by neighbors' visitors at one point but that was an easy fix with a knock on their door. I was worried about not being able to control the heat (it's controlled upstairs) but all was fine and comfortable. A space heater is also provided jic. Cari's thought of more than the basics for the small space which made it feel homey! Love that there was a fridge and micro with a few utensils. Our only difficulty was the lack of grass outside for our pup lol - it's small stones mostly, which she didn't care for, but the patio Cari has set up is really adorable. If it was warmer I definitely would have sat outside! I think this place is nicer than the pics give it credit for :) we LOVED being able to bring our pup!!!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is the reason airbnb.com is so popular. It checks all the boxes.
It is affordable, adorable, and clean. Host was amazing with both communication and hospitality.
Every type and style of snack and goodie is offered. She has thought of everything. Need a hair product, a dog leash, a bowl of oatmeal? It is there. A box fan for white noise while sleeping? It is there. Unfamiliar with the area? The is a white board and binder full of places to eat or visit. Hey, did you forget a book? She has a book shelf for you to take one. You will enjoy this cozy little bungalow. I promise."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Honestly everything was great. This place is clean, cute, and comfortable!

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful place for a quick stop over in Scranton with our 2 Welsh Corgis.

Only downsides were that backing out of driveway into city street was unnerving, we couldn't get Keurig to work (but other coffee maker worked well!), and shower liner was due for replacement. Otherwise, loved it! Thank you!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"WOW just doesn’t describe our experience! We were honored to be the first guests to stay in the Carriage Barn and we couldn’t have been more pleased with our stay. Matthew greeted us as we pulled in, took us on a tour of the Carriage Barn, informed us of different restaurants and activities near the surrounding area and was always just a call or email away.

We all loved the big dining room table where we not only ate but played cards and the great board games that Breeze supplied. Everything was spotless, organized and the home felt warm and cozy.

2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is a classic old Green Ridge house, well-designed and well maintained with smart updates. The back deck is where you will want to spend all of your time if the weather is nice. We enjoyed our stay and would book it again."
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Overall, the house was exactly what we needed as a family visiting from out of state for a family funeral. The space was wonderful for the 8 of us, including a toddler and dog.
Sunshine was very helpful when the freezer was leaking all over the floor, which it continued to do all weekend. Also, there was a bare minimum of linens. We could have use a few more hand towels and washcloths.
The big problem was that the oven was not cleaned from a previous renter and when we went to cook a meal, the oven was pouring smoke into the house and the grease inside caught on fire. I contacted Sentinel immediately and I got an inadequate response about the fan over the microwave working and then no more responses or help. We were not able to use the oven the entire trip. We purchased groceries to prepare meals that we were not able to use."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic home and extremely responsive host.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Cute house, worked great for our daughter's graduation.

The only downside we had at all was we had difficulty with the digital lock on the door. But once we downloaded the app and used that instead it was completely fine.
Thanks for a great stay."

Was a great place for a quick stay while in town for a wedding weekend. Thank you, Donna"
2022-12-01,4.0,Group trip,"We spent 2 nights at Sentinel's place in late December. We liked the house, especially the open kitchen area/living room and the TV space downstairs, where we all sit together. There are a washer and a drier in the basement, too, which is of big help for longer stays. Two big bathrooms with all things provided. And 4 bedrooms with very comfortable mattresses. The house looks like in the pictures, just a little darker inside but probably due to the winter weather. (There are big enough windows in every room, which is a plus.) The huge deck /patio in the back yard is a perfect private place to enjoy during
the warm season. ( We didn't have a chance to use it due to the cold days in December.) The house is on a peaceful street, very close to colleges. Walkable, safe location. Our communication with the hosts (Sentinel and others) was excellent.
The hosts were quick to respond, respectful, much accommodating, and very helpful.
Thank you so much for having us at your place!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome stay in Scranton while visiting family, would definitely recommend it!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This rental home is easily accessible to points all over Scranton, including downtown, Marywood University, the University of Scranton, and various other historic and interesting spots. Greenridge is a beautiful neighborhood. You could spend an entire afternoon walking or driving around to see the palatial homes and gorgeous estates.
The home itself is in a quiet, family-oriented neighborhood. Within easy walking distance are two excellent places for breakfast/lunch as well as what looked to be a wonderful Italian restaurant. It’s also in close proximity to the Lackawanna Heritage Walking Trail. Right out front is a pad of asphalt to park your car.
As we approached the house for the first time, we were met by the most delightful cat sitting on the porch. He was there greeting us each time we came home, and would be on the back deck staring inside whenever we were in kitchen. Several times we attempted to pet him, but he would always scamper off when the door was opened.
The interior of the home was clean and well organized. There were plenty of towels, blankets, space to spread out, and comfortable chairs and couches. The thing that impressed us the most on initial inspection was how well-appointed the kitchen and bathrooms were. The bathrooms had dispensers for hand soap, shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. The kitchen had a spice rack full of dried herbs and spices, paper towels, dish soap, hand soap, cleaning products, and dishwasher soap. In the basement was a washer and dryer with detergent and dryer sheets. In other homes we’ve rented, many of these things needed to be purchased separately at the grocery store, and we were really pleased to find all we needed here.
The bedrooms were quiet and had blackout window treatments for nice long sleeps. The beds were very comfortable. There was more than ample dresser and closet space for anything you bring with you on vacation.
The complaints we had about our experience were minor, and were greatly outshined by the pluses. The lighting in the home wasn’t great. I found several lightbulbs that weren’t working, and the lamps downstairs were harsh to look at when they were on and really didn’t provide adequate room illumination. There was no welcome packet advertising local restaurants, maps, or other attractions, and no pamphlet describing the rules of the property or the Wi-Fi information. There were no notepads or paper. We also like to write in a guest book and read entries written by prior guests. We didn’t see that either. The bathrooms didn’t have exhaust fans, which I understand isn’t common for these old homes.
All in all we loved our time in Scranton and will definitely return to 903 Richmont on our next trip to NEPA."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My two brothers and I stayed in this home for a week visiting our cousins. I would put this home on the top of my list of Airbnbs that we have stayed in.

Great location, close to everything you could possibly need."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable and spacious house. A very convenient location to everything in Scranton. The convenience of the check-in and check-out was great, dog friendly, with a nice porch and deck. Bedrooms were spacious and comfortable, 2 full bathrooms were adequate, kitchen was versatile and large.
Excellent house that provided a good deal of space for families and groups.
Excellent communication from manager and simple start to finish."

2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is a lovely home in a quiet neighborhood. It was perfect for our short visit to Dunmore for a family reunion. Would also be great for a longer-term stay. We didn’t have time to enjoy the spacious deck or to cook in the very well-equipped kitchen. Overall, perfect for a larger family."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful home in what seems to be a very safe neighborhood! It can get sketchy in Scranton, and being from out of the area I took a leap of faith. Thankfully I had no reason to worry.
Sparkling clean, easy check-in, parking for 1 car. Loved the second set of stairs off the kitchen. Washer and dryer came in handy.
The only suggestion I have is to update the sheets and blankets, which were low quality. Despite the air conditioning being on I woke up sweating in the middle of the night. Maybe it’s just me, but my bedding needs to be cotton, otherwise I get too hot.
All in all I would gladly stay here again."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place!!

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I was pleasantly surprised when i arrived with my family. The pictures of the house dont do it justice.

Having such a spacious and modern kitchen is a game-changer when traveling. The internet is fantastic and the large 4k TV is really nice. The place is well-taken care of and it’s obviously cleaned very thoroughly before guests arrive. They even thought of the small things you may need during your travels like soap and shampoo. The surrounding neighborhood is the best in the area. It’s very quiet, safe and located minutes away from downtown. Compared to what it would cost for a hotel, you’ll get way more for your money with this airbnb.
The owners were so helpful and responsive to my questions, and that just really brought this whole experience together for me. This place is on the top of my list for when I visit Scranton again."

2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great spot and accessible for a ski weekend at Montage. Property is as advertised, really enjoyed our stay."
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a cute split level house. The beds were comfortable. Lots of comfortable towels. It has been through some simple, but impactful updates - nice vanities, new stove, etc. The cabinets are the original ones with a layer of paint. The kitchen was fairly well equipped. There is a dual coffee maker than can use pods or grounds. The baseboard heat worked well.
My kids enjoyed the pool table in the basement, which gave some great entertainment on a rainy day. This was a very convenient location for skiing at Montage. Its under 15 minutes to the mountain. It is in a quiet neighborhood, which was a pleasant surprise as we thought it might be busier based on its location in the city. The host was very responsive to messages."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place! Rosalia always responded to any questions
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home. The pictures don’t due it justice . Large bedrooms. Spacious Kitchen.

2023-11-01,4.0,Group trip,We had a girls weekend with our mom. The home was clean and even decorated for Christmas. Rosalia answered questions very quickly. This was my first time using Air B and B. The home was a 10 to 15 minute ride from restaurants and the casino but close to I-81 and easy to find. We were looking for a checklist for closing up the home. When we couldn’t find one we did our best to leave the home as beautiful as we found it.
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Rosalia was a great host, the best I’ve had sense using AirBnB. We left early and I had told her we were gone. One of the guest had to come back a few days later to follow up on the work we did, and even though she had already cleaned the place, she let him come back for the days we had remaining and saved him the hassle of finding a new place. The house was clean comfortable and warm. Thank you so much Rosalia:)"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We will be back
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a short stay for a wedding but enjoyed our stay very much. The house was nice, clean, spacious and comfortable. One thing to note is there is no central a/c so the common area upstairs got a bit warm in the afternoon, it was 80 outside. But the bedrooms and basement had window a/c units so that made sleeping no issue. I wouldn't say it was a con, just something to note if visiting in the summer months."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and responsive host, replied whenever needed. Would highly recommend to anyone staying in the area"

Fits a lot of people and has many games and activities to do. Great place to relax, outdoors is my favorite, cooking hanging out, the house was very clean, the pool table the TV, the games, even there is many amenities close by. I just loved being in the house spending quality time with my family. Definitely will be back soon to continue enjoy the beautiful home and to go visit the places near by."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a great stay! We’re on a multi week vacation and the kids were disappointed we were only staying one night because it was so nice!
It feels like this is a new host who is still getting used to hosting so be prepared to ask about amenities etc. it was a bummer the clothes washer was broken as that was one of the things we looked for when booking. Easy access to grocery store.
WiFi cut out abruptly a couple of times.
Felt a little overpriced."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Comfortable and just what we needed. I would stay here again if going back to the area.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"""Staying at Elizabeth's place in Scranton, Pennsylvania was like stepping into the world of 'The Office' in the best way possible. The themed touches throughout the apartment were quirky, fun, and absolutely cool! The cleanliness of the space was top-notch, and the view from the back porch overlooking all of Scranton was simply mesmerizing. It was the perfect spot to enjoy my morning coffee while soaking in the essence of this iconic city. A truly unique and memorable experience!"""

-Plenty of parking out front
-Great instructions provided for entry
-Bed is super comfy, plenty of pillows, more hidden in nearby closets if needed.
-Plenty of outlets to charge phones overnight
-The building is beautiful, and well kept, exposed originally flooring.
- I felt like I was living in a well kept apartment from 1850 with good WIFI, a nice smart TV, decorated with an awful lot of ""the office"" memes.
I quite liked it I would 100% visit again.
Nicest AirBnB I've seen so far"

It perfectly encapsulated The Office while also being an extremely cozy one bedroom apartment. The kitchen was fully stocked with a full fridge which was super helpful storing our Alfredo’s Pizza (not pizza by Alfredo). There was a nearby park and cafe in the park that was no more than a 5 minute walk which was so convenient and a hidden gem. If we ever find ourselves in Scranton, we will definitely be staying again!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I've stayed in Scranton a few times recently since we're planning a wedding in the area. Elizabeth's place has by far been my favorite! The ""Office"" theme makes me smile every time I see a little decoration or reference to it, but aside from that, it's also just a really clean and well-kept place! I felt comfortable and safe the whole stay. In addition, I never would have expected ""gorgeous sunset views"" in Scranton but my goodness, that was the best part of my stay! The small, private back deck off Elizabeth's apartment has a stunning view of the sunset behind the mountains. I found myself delighted to be sitting outside to watch the hustle and bustle of the small city and the sunset (at least on the non-rainy days!). Such a lovely apartment - highly recommended!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A good airbnb. We'd stay here again. Accurate description and photos. Clean. Comfy. Good view out back.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was awesome to stay at for Office fans! It was super easy to find, there was always enough parking space on the street. Elizabeth made the check-in (and check-out) super easy. Right away we felt at home. The Office decor and games were the cherry on top! We were able to get to all of our site-seeing destinations in 15 minutes or less and there was a wonderful park nearby with a cafe and trail as an added bonus!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing apartment! The Office touches throughout are so creative, but the gorgeous old house is also amazing! Everything was clean and comfortable. The back porch with views of the neighborhood and city was my favorite. Highly recommend this place!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It’s the 3rd time I stayed at Elizabeth’s - for work reason - and it always feel like I’m at home!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always happy to stay at this Airbnb!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was super clean and beautifully decorated. Very short walk to a gorgeous park! Elizabeth was the perfect host! We loved our stay! We are definitely coming back!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at this AirBNB for my son's graduation from University of Scranton. It was a 10 minute walk from campus but also a quick Uber. I loved the office them, and it had everything we needed for the weekend. I would not hesitate to stay there again in the future!"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed this stay! There were so many cheeky Office references and memorabilia! Hosts were responsive, accommodating, and friendly, and checkout process wasn’t too intensive (wash your dishes and gather linens). The one thing we wished for was a thermostat we could control ourselves. We were way too warm at night, and the hosts did account for this with an AC unit in the living room or mention that you could message them for temperature adjustments, but we felt guilty cooling the whole unit when it was 40 degrees outside, we would’ve preferred to have been able to crack a bedroom window. Overall, we recommend this stay to anyone who is a fan of The Office and would enjoy the references! It was a great landing spot for our Scranton tour :)"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Steamtown Stay was absolutely the best Air BnB experience I've had so far! Elizabeth really had every detail covered, and I've never felt more at home. I visited Scranton with my 17-year-old son for a special senior trip before he graduates high school. He loves The Office, and everything about this apartment was absolutely incredible! This trip will be one that we will both remember for the rest of our lives! Thank you so much, Elizabeth! 💙💙💙"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Both Elizabeth and Marshal were always very responsive and went above and beyond to help us, especially when we were having car troubles. We also loved the house and the way it was themed. I would definitely recommend this house to anyone."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay in Elizabeth’s Office themed apartment! It was very very clean and the perfect size for two people. The office decor was spot on and it was a great spot to relax after a day of exploring Downtown Scranton and all of the Office spots. Located on a quiet street but only a few minutes drive to everything. We enjoyed walking to Nay Aug Park and having coffee at the Blackwatch Cafe. A great, clean place to stay!! If we’re ever in Scranton again, we would 10/10 stay again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If your as obsessed with the Office show as my fiancé, this is a must see city and this air bnb was a perfect place to stay. A lot of detail was put into the decor and even more time was put into preparing for our stay. All around fantastic experience that I would highly recommend to other fans!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed here for a business trip, to have this “at home” feeling, and this is exactly what I got! With the perfect amount of “The office” atmosphere :)"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend this Office themed airbnb for any Office lover staying in Scranton. The neighborhood was nice and quiet, street parking was always available and the check in process was easy and painless. The house itself was very clean and tastefully furnished and decorated. The Office references throughout the house were hysterical but it wasn't in your face or plastered everywhere. We really enjoyed hanging out in the living room and playing The Office trivia. We also appreciated the reccomendations Elizabeth left for us which included restaurants & things to do around the Electric City. ""You miss 100% of the shots you don't take -Wayne Gretzky"" -Michael Scott. Please listen to Michael and book your next trip at the Steamtown Stay!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great Stay! Office theme was fun and the place was very clean and comfy!

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment is perfect! We comfortably had two adults stay for a fun little office tour weekend getaway. Everything you could need during your stay- restaurants, retail shops, grocery, drug stores, liquor and beer stores, even hospital and urgent care- is within a 5-15 minute drive. Entry was easy and communication was timely and clear. The place was clean, had all the linens you could need (towels, sheets and blankets) as well as kitchen/cooking utensils and cookware. We loved all of the quirky Office themed items throughout the apartment. Andy Gavin’s was a delicious late lunch/dinner spot. And of course in true Office fashion we visited Alfredo’s Pizza cafe and they did not disappoint! We look forward to future visits."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband I booked our stay to celebrate our “paper anniversary” and what better spot than Elizabeth’s Dunder Mifflin Office themed Airbnb. We knew we had to stay here and we’re happy we did. Elizabeth was very accommodating and welcoming during our stay. All the essentials were provided just like when you stay at a hotel. The kitchen was fully equipped where all you need to provide is groceries. We cooked our breakfast and enjoyed it on the private balcony with the views. This was our first time booking an Airbnb and Elizabeth made the process and experience seamless. 10/10 recommend!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was perfect for The Office experience. It was very neat and clean. Everything you needed was there and location was ideal for all things The Office. Owner was very easy to communicate with and easily able to accommodate.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment is everything it says and more. From the moment we stepped inside until we had to leave, Elizabeth was a responsive and caring host. Thoughtful details such as letting us write our own “Roasted” stickie note for the wall wall and leaving out chocolates on the bed made this our favorite Airbnb stay to date! The location is perfect for anyone running through their ‘Office’ bucket list. Plus, we found a lot of fun non-‘Office’ places too. Black Watch Cafe by the park is a must for coffee-lovers and Noir Dark Spirits near the Steamtown Mall has a really unique menu and atmosphere."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great weekend spent in Scranton, PA you in the most adorable Office themed apartment!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The BAD: My son just finished 4 years of college in Scranton and I only NOW found Elizabeth’s amazing apartment.
The GOOD: I have another son attending school in Scranton so I can stay here again and again over the next few years.
This The Office themed apartment is a perfect place to stay for whatever reason you are visiting Scranton. It is larger than I expected, big rooms with high ceilings, and is SUPER clean. Plenty of cute, thoughtful touches throughout, and very fun if you are a fan of the tv show. Elizabeth communicated very well before and at the end our stay and check-in was a breeze. The place and our experience exceeded our expectations in every way! I’d give it 6 stars if I could."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay in Scranton for fans of The Office or just wanting a comfortable place. The decorations are great, bed is comfortable, shower has wonderful water pressure and an amazing view of Scranton from the back porch.
A 5 minute drive from Alfredo’s and Poor Richard’s, 10 minute to Steamtown Historic Site and a quick zip right down to downtown at the Penn Paper building. For those not wanting to only hit up spots from the show, you are only a 2 min drive/8 minute walk from Nay Aug Park which is beautiful. Be sure to find the Nay Aug Falls, probably the best “hidden” part of Scranton we found."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great place for fans of The office!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the absolute BEST place to stay for fans of The Office. Such cute, themed decor. The place was beautiful, had everything we needed, was located close to everything we wanted to see, and had a gorgeous view over Scranton. The host is super sweet and we’ll definitely be back!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is absolutely wonderful. It was well decorated, clean, and close to everything! I really appreciated all the little things they did to make our stay more relaxing (the drinks, the chocolates, and the cute note on the white board)! You can really tell the hosts put a lot of love into the place, and I cannot recommend this place enough. Also loved that the parking was never an issue! My boyfriend and I are terrible at parallel parking (like Michael when he says “not gonna make this one” and it’s a massive opening type of bad), and we never had any issues finding a place on the street to park lol. Thank you so much for the wonderful stay!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Elizabeth is a wonderful host .. her place is extremly clean .. well decorated[wish we actually got ""the office"" refetences, but we never saw even 1 episode]. She has all the basics there, bottled water, coffee, cleaners, shower stuff.. etc... definitely goes above & betond. The location was ideal as we were attending a function at Ney Ag Park.. & we walked there from the property. I highly reccommend this property if you are visiting the Scranton area"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Accurate pictures and descriptions. Easy access with available parking on the street. Comfy bed and great shower with thick towels. Spacious living area. The sleep sofa was a challenge. We brought a memory foam top because a previous review said it didn’t function that well when open. Our daughter found that to be true. The topper helped. It really works better folded up but only for one small adult. The decor made for great pictures. Obviously great care was taken with those details. Cute balcony but the weather prevented more than a short visit outside…gorgeous sunset one night and snow on the hills the next😍
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great clean place!!!! I would def stay here again!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing!! So clean and convenient, and perfect for any office fans!!"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for two nights during a weekend trip to Scranton for an Office Themed 30th birthday. One of the best airbnb's we've stayed it. Super clean, organized, simple, amazing themed call outs everywhere you look and Elizabeth was a great host with great communication. It was a cold weekend so we drove around most. of the time, but I can imagine in the warmer months the location is perfect for walking to downtown (and we LOVED the view of ""this city"" off the back balcony)."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If you love the office you will love this space. Tons of cute touches.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Must experience this Airbnb if you’re a fan of The Office!

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fun office themed Airbnb in the heart of Scranton. Perfect apartment for two people. Wouldn’t spend much more than a weekend here because we definitely ran out of things to do in Scranton!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Phenomenal setting. Even though I wasn't supposed to have the internet...connection for the tv Liz and Co. allowed me to use their setup which came in handy. Saw a very unique movie out of NIRe
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for a major “office” !
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are an Office fan and want to visit Scranton, this is the place to stay. Ample street parking, great location within a few miles of most of the locations you’d want to visit from The Office. Easy check in. Clean space with great attention to detail from the show."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Office themed apartment is perfectly quaint and is exactly as pictured. The apartment was close to downtown and the mountain we were snowboarding. Street parking was ample. The neighborhood was quiet and the view from the porch was stunning at all times of day. The host was easy to contact and willing to work with us in any manner. I loved the experience and I would stay here again.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay at Elizabeth’s House. Nice location- had great views of the Times building tower and all the Christmas lights. Close to Nay Aug Park, Steamtown Mall, Train Museum etc. House very clean and description is accurate."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place for Office fans!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Adorable apartment! Loved the attention to detail on the theme and cleanliness. The host was extremely attentive and quick to respond to our request to alter the remote thermostat when we needed it. Would absolutely come again! That’s what she said!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my first time using Air B & B and it was awesome. Elizabeth communicated very quickly when I had questions or concerns. The apartment was very close to downtown Scranton and all the sites I wanted to see. The apartment was clean. She had everything clearly labeled so you could find what you needed in the bathroom and kitchen. Could not be happier with my stay!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is such an amazing apartment!! As Office fans, we really appreciated all of the jokes and memorabilia from the show. And the apartment is a 5-8 minute drive to every place we went. Super convenient! The apartment is very clean and the hosts provided so many amenities like soap, shampoo, and make up removing wipes in the bathroom, and complementary water, eggs, milk, and butter in the fridge! We had such a great time! Thank you again for such a fun and comfortable stay!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved my stay! Would definitely recommend, very clean and definitely a cool theme!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The apartment is adorable. There are references to the office everywhere. My husband and I enjoyed our stay
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Liz and Marshall’s office themed apartment is a MUST STAY for office fans! The details in the apartment are great from little nods to various episodes and memorable moments of the show, to the boom roasted board and games to play. The apartment is on a pretty quiet street no more than 10 minutes from pretty much anywhere notable in Scranton. Hosts are wonderful with communication and the apartment is clean. My boyfriend and I couldn’t say enough positive things about it. We already decided we want to come back before we even left lol. Make sure to enjoy the back porch views!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I never once saw an episode of The Office. I booked because it was a great price and it had dates open that I needed. However, I did start watching it(binge watching it), during my stay. It made me appreciate how great this apartment is because now I can see the amount of attention to detail in decor that was put into it. I will continue to watch the show until the end.
I had a little problem with checking in. The other tenant in the apartment locked the downstairs screen door. After a long ride, I was praying this wasn’t going to be a big deal and it wasn’t. I contacted Elizabeth and the door was very shortly opened.
I ran the coffee pot, toaster, and microwave at the same time and blew the breaker. I contacted them and within the hour I was ready to go.
Bring hangers, as there is no dresser.
This apartment was absolutely spotless, plenty of room, it had pretty much everything you needed. The linens… something about the linens. I loved the towels, sheets, and comforter. The bed set up was awesome, perfect make up vanity in the bathroom, and adorable porch with a view of the mountains and Scranton.
Would I book here again? Absolutely. I loved it and can’t wait to come back.

Thank you, Elizabeth and Marshal!"

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I had a phenomenal stay! Elizabeth was a helpful and communicative host both before and during. The apartment was sparking clean with the Office theme creatively and thoughtfully curated. The furniture and mattress were comfortable for my picky lower back. We enjoyed easy drives to area attractions including Alfredo’s Pizza, On & On Antique Mall, and Cooper’s Seafood. Coffee on the balcony was a great way to start our mornings. It was helpful to have breakfast essentials provided. Would most definitely return!"

2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter and I needed a place to stay for a couple of nights while we toured colleges in the area. This apartment is an amazing value in a nice quiet neighborhood. Liz and Marshall provided everything we needed and stayed in contact with us throughout our stay. There was plenty of room for my daughter and I to find some space away from each other when we wanted to. We each had our own place to sleep... extra bedding was available for the futon. (It was more comfortable to sleep on in the upright ""couch"" position vs. the flat ""bed"" position.) I especially enjoyed sitting on the back deck with its captivating views of the city and sky. Highly recommend!"

Elizabeth also helped me setup a surprise for my girlfriend before we arrived by picking up a bouquet of sunflowers for her. Excellent hosts and an excellent AirBnb. 5 stars all around."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay! The space was charming and spotlessly clean in a quiet neighborhood. It was very easy to communicate with Chala. Very close to downtown Scranton and also served as a good home base for hiking at Lackawanna State Park.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have been to Scranton a few times, staying at Airbnbs each time, and Chala's is by far my favorite! Despite being less than 10 minutes from downtown Scranton, the secluded neighborhood made for an extremely quiet, peaceful stay. The space was truly unique- the touches in the hallway were fantastic. The bedroom, kitchen, office and bathroom were pristine, and it was clear Chala takes pride in the cleanliness of the space. I am always hesitant to check into Airbnbs past dark because it can be hard to determine the correct house, but the reflectors at the street and floodlights at the driveway made the check in process a breeze in the dark. 10/10 highly recommend and I hope my work brings me back to the area so I can stay in this lovely Airbnb again.
The recommendations on the fridge were great too!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Chala was super helpful and accommodating. I miscalculated my dates and she was more than willing to adjust my stay. Her place was clean and very comfy. I would defintely recommend and would stay here again.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Chala's City Seclusion and Creative Retreat on the Brook was the perfect location to escape for rest & peace and quiet. After long-fun busy days with grandchildren(toddlers & teenagers), it was such a pleasure to relax with a glass of wine & dinner at Chala's. The old school radio that allowed us to listen to music from my phone via bluetooth was a very nice touch. A space heater was provided if needed. As we are Floridians, we definitely used the space heater. Truly, all the little amenities made Chala's place enjoyable. Such as the wreath & poinsettia, the sound machine in the bedroom, the room fragrance, and the glow light, to name a few. If peace and quiet with ambiance is what you're looking for, The Seclusion on the Brook is the place."

Scranton is a small town and can be busy in the center but Chala’s place was just outside of town, still close enough to drive to everything but also so peaceful. We’d love to come back!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Chala and her place a great experience. It was our first time ever renting an AirBnB that’s attached to someone’s house like that and I will admit, we are awkward people and were worried about an awkward running into each other or interaction. But we had our privacy which is greatly appreciated. As always, we look for privacy, security and comfort over everything and that is exactly what’s Chala and her place provided. It was very homey and simplistic. The place was definitely bigger then we expected and gave real “Scranton” appeal (if you’ve been to Scranton, you’ll know what I mean). Definitely recommend the next time y’all are visiting for the weekend. We stayed to attend a show over at Mohegan Sun Arena and the drive was SO easy and convenient that we were away from the madness but close enough to not be concerned about time."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,We loved the place and the area and would definitely chose this place when we are back in the area for another stay.

It's a nice place in a great quiet neighborhood. Chala is very hospitable and quick to respond to any of the requests that I had (which was like 2).
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a GREAT stay! My boyfriend and I stayed for 3 nights and we felt so at home. Perfect sized space for 2 people, comfy bed, great water pressure in the shower, great kitchen stocked with cookware and a beautiful view of nature from the back porch.

2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Chala’s place was so awesome. The space was inviting, well decorated, and there were thoughtful touches throughout the space. A list of local recommendations for meals with descriptions of each place, local coffee, filtered water in the fridge. The bed was very comfortable.
Chala was very responsive to any questions.
The apartment is upstairs in her home, but you enter from an outside enter an outside entrance. There is a door that is locked in the space that separates the air bnb from Chala’s living space. I didn’t realize that prior to arrival. I am sure I just missed that information, but it did effect how I experienced the stay in terms of listening to music at a lower volume, not singing along, not hitting snooze so I didn’t wake anyone up if she could hear the alarm going off and it was early,taking my shoes off so I wasn’t loud walking through the space etc.
I would definitely stay there again. It was a great experience and Chala was such a kind, thoughtful and responsive host."
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I went up to Scranton area area for a long weekend, because I had classes up there and he kinda tagged along! We are from Philly in the city and wasn’t sure what to expect, a person wouldn’t think there would be much to do and on top of that, this was out first time with an Airbnb.
Omg! After staying here, we are never going back to anything else! Chala’s place was beautiful! From the location against the mountain hill to the decor on the inside! We felt at home. It was clean and beautiful and the bed was sooooooo comfortable. Plus, response times from host was almost immediate.
There are so many hiking trails all over and you are surrounded by nature and quiet...coming from the city we felt so relaxed!
We loved the keypad lock door and the zen room! We had a great yoga practice there and my husband enjoyed the afternoon lay down on the day beds.
There was so much attention payed to the little things. An air purifier, a britta filter in the fridge, a list of restaurants and things to do, toiletries that are plant based and ethically sourced and produced (I am vegan), a dyson space heater, a motion sensor hallway light, a Bose in the kitchen for music! You name it and Chala thought of it. Oh yes, the organic tea and locally sourced coffee on the kitchen counter looked like a present set out just for us! Ha ha ha!
The space gets so much light also!
We love it! Thank you Chala for an amazing stay!!! If we go back to Scranton we aren’t even going to look for another Airbnb in the area!"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy apartment and great location. Only 10 minutes away from Montage Mountain, about 25 minutes from Mohegan Sun, and 5 minutes from University of Scranton. Would 100% stay here again."

2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Chala’s place was the first experience my boyfriend and I had with Airbnb, I don’t know for sure but I’m guessing we really lucked out! Her place was spotless and super cute. The pictures don’t do it justice. It was more spacious than expected and her little decorative touches made it feel comfortable and like a home. She responded from the moment I requested a stay, answered any questions right away and kept us informed with everything necessary. I loved the private entrance, the secure locks (as my crime podcast obsession gets me preparanoid) and the neighborhood as well. Her place has the safe vibe you want anywhere you stay to have. The only thing we were initially bummed about was having no television but it actually ended up being one of my favorite parts. No TV meant more talking, more rummy, more exploring and less of the daily routine from home. I highly recommend Chala and her humble abode."
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was great place to stay at for the poconos. Chala was very communicative and also left the place great for us to check in. The place is not too far from a lot of things and Chala as well included a list on the fridge giving us some local spots like a coffee shop, restaurants, and shopping areas. She as well was attentive to inform us on events happening the day of. Honestly wasn’t expecting this great of a host but it turned out perfect. We enjoyed our stay and hope to come back here again. Thank you!"
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It is actually more spacious than the pictures show. Place was very clean, I would highly recommend anyone to book. I was there for a short trip 2 days, but it is the type of place you would want to book for longer, just had that instant home feel."

Chala did a great job communicating from the start while also providing some local tips on things to see and do while in town. The actual Airbnb was perfect for what we were looking for. Chala keeps the place nice and clean and provides all the amenities needed for a weekend getaway. The location is close enough to town to get there within 5-10 minutes and in a nice neighborhood.

On the fridge, she had detailed notes about the place as well as a bonus of suggestions in the area. The place and area itself is very quiet, expect to hear the littlest noise. But it’s fine.
