CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN!! When u walk into this condo the pictures do not do justice on what has been done♥️♥️ As we entered the building my kids were whispering going down the hall “mom this is sketchy”only because the building is old and the smells in the hall;) when I opened the door to the condo all I heard was wow, oh my gosh this is so nice, I’ld live here, cool ;).

One of the standout features of this place is its remarkable spaciousness. Despite being located within a large building, we were pleasantly surprised by how little noise from other residents we could hear. What truly sets Dot's Place apart is the meticulous attention to detail and thoughtfulness that Dot has put into making it feel like a home away from home. Dot has considered every little thing you may need during your trip, ensuring that guests have a comfortable and convenient experience. From the well-stocked kitchen to the thoughtfully placed amenities, we were constantly amazed by the level of care Dot had put into ensuring our stay was memorable. But what really sets Dot's Place apart is Dot's incredible sense of humor and creativity. The way she has decorated the place is both charming and refreshing. It's a breath of fresh air from the typical cookie-cutter hotel."

I'm sad that we didn't get a chance to utilize the pool, but it's such a great perk of this spot. It would have been nice if shampoo and soap were provided in the shower, but other than that, I was extremely satisfied with our stay. Dot was a responsive host and even messaged me to ask about an item that I had accidentally left behind. Thank you for being a great host!"

It is near the zoo and the big slide, which were two of the things we wanted to do. We didn’t want to use the pool based on our length of stay, so it wasn’t an issue for us, but the pool was closed. The building was quiet and clean. Would definately stay here again."

Our overall feeling from staying here was comfort and safety.
The quality of everything, from the beds/bedding to the kitchen, bathroom, and living room was extremely impressive.
We had been apprehensive about the risk of noise in a condo/apartment setting, but honestly, we never heard our neighbors.
The unit was very clean when we arrived. Check-in was easy - good instructions and backup keys.

The little labels where things were made things super easy to find which we loved. The neighborhood was quiet and friendly as well. The decor and cleanliness of the place was 10 star worthy atleast.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was a great stay. I love all the thoughtful touches and labels. The only tiny negative was a faint smell of smoke. Not like someone had just smoked in the house but like it was smoked in a long time ago and the smell is just in the floors and walls. I am sensitive to smells though and had read that on another review and booked anyways. And I’m glad I did. My children loved the place and we were all very comfortable!

The master bedroom behind the bookcase was enchanting. Thoughtful extras like bed rail for top bunk, fun games, courtesy snacks and K-pods for coffee were awesome. We loved the LED light strips throughout the house. Nice atmosphere for a relaxing family movie night on the comfy couch.
We would definitely stay again. Highly recommend!"

2023-05-01,4,Stayed about a week,"It was a cute little place. A lot of amenities for kids and coffee. There is a smoke smell stuck in the wood of the main bedroom that was awful to deal with. The neighborhood is a little shady, with constant people with backpacks across the street in and out. The place was clean and had everything we needed. It was good for single family with only one bathroom."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cheryl’s house is fun, filled with kitschy details. The ceilings are low, so if you’re over six feet tall you might be uncomfortable. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would rent this house again without hesitation!"

A high chair to use and a bed bumper in place of a pack and play. Everything was so clean and smelled so fresh. I loved the “treating it like a hotel” where you don’t have to strip everything down, do your own dishes, etc. it really was so relaxing and we’d stay here anytime we are in town. The added gift was a definite plus! Our kiddo’s 2nd Airbnb stuffie 💜"

I especially appreciate all of the little touches like coffee and hot cocoa, snacks, kitchen with all of the necessities, comfortable sheets, and cozy couch. Cheryl communicated very well when there was a huge blizzard with 17 inches of snow, letting me know where the emergency snow routes were and coming over promptly to shovel. Cheryl is such a friendly and lovely person. She even let me know that the next guest canceled because of the blizzard so I could extend my stay. I will definitely stay again next time I am in Bismarck! Do not hesitate to book. The value is amazing. You will be so comfortable and right at home at Cheryl’s place."

In addition, she is a beautiful and gentle soul who provided much needed kindness and compassion during a very difficult time, which called me from Colorado to North Dakota to provide support for my new college freshman. Her home was extremely cozy and inviting and provided so much comfort and consolation. The beds were extremely comfortable, and the living room was a delight. My 7-year-old who traveled with me enjoyed the arcade game and the back room with the double queen bunk beds. Cheryl even provided a stuffy dolphin for my 7 year old who absolutely loved it! There is no doubt that on our many trips to North Dakota to visit our College kiddo, we will be spending future stays at Cheryl's wonderful Airbnb!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We SO enjoyed our stay here. When we come back to Bismark we'll definitely be looking into staying here again.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is the best! It’s places like this one that are why airbnbs are so much better than a chain hotel. Quick and easy check in, great location, very clean, fluffy towels big enough to cover your whole body and it had everything me and my two kids needed and more.
This place is especially fun for kids between the pac man machine, lots of board games, very comfy big bunk beds, chalk wall and necessities like high chairs and kid friendly dishes. Loved the big comfy sectional to snuggle up on w my babies for a little movie night. So many soft blankets lol.
The beds were great and had very fluffy pillows. There were also some less fluffy ones for those who prefer that. I actually ended up in the bunk beds w my daughter bc it was really comfy and at least full size so more than enough space.
I’m sad it rained the whole time we were there bc there’s a great little deck out back and a big back yard. The kids loved the cookies Cheryl left for us. The best part were the special surprises for the kids to take home. We will be back!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent home. Very comfortable with everything we needed. It truly is a home away from home.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Couldn’t ask for a better place to stay. Cute place!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Super sute place great stay
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Everything was just excellent; the kitchen had everything we needed to cook; having coffee and hot chocolate every morning was such a treat and the work station and back deck made it easy to work and relax; a real vacation. The artistic touches made it fun and facilitated playfulness despite the serious circumstance that brought us to town. The thoughtful care and personalization to details emanated throughout the house and was tangible. Thank you, thank you thank you so much."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was a hoot! There was a special surprise for the kids in their room. They girls loved the loft bed. I liked how the kitchen was fully equipped with everything I needed including a crockpot. Cheryl had great communication, and give insight on fun things to do with the kids. We highly recommend the water park in Mandan."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,I booked this place a while back cause it just looked too cute. And it is! So many extra little touches kids and adults would love. Just as pictured and my kids were sad to leave. Thanks for a great stay 😃

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. I haven’t played Ms Pac-Man in ages!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing!! I don’t know what makes a “super host”, but this perfectly describes Cheryl. We loved everything about this booking. From the neighborhood, to the fun décor, to the amazing welcome basket, this was the best stay on out 9-day road trip. The kids loved the suspended bunkbeds, and we loved the coffee station. The hidden LED lights around the house was a fun discovery, and the patio was the perfect place for a nightcap as well as a morning cup of coffee. Cheryl clearly paid great attention to detail, and was always available to answer any questions or requests that we had.
The little touches really made this place special and memorable. From the books and games, to the secret bedroom entrance, this house was great. And, when I told Cheryl that my mom and my kids absolutely loved the book of jokes in her library, she insisted that we take it and enjoy it on our trip. I am not big on writing reviews, but this place, and our host, deserve it. I would to stay here again, and would whole heartedly recommend it to everyone."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Honestly the coolest air bnb we’ve stayed in!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cozy home with lots of unique touches. Had a great stay
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We had a great time staying at the Lamppost 15! The house was so clean, cozy and comfortable, especially the beds and pillows! The host is extremely creative and organized, having everything labeled and making sure that all the smallest details are taken care of. We all loved the games (including Pac-Man and the beanbag toss), the bunk room with the stuffed animals and blackboard wall, and finding all the other hidden surprises around the house!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was so fun! It was nostalgic yet all modern comforts, with entertainment for every age. My mom and I were just driving by on a long haul road trip, and it was the highlight of our adventure. Cheryl has thought of everything, the intention behind each detail really made the place feel special and welcoming. If you have kids, a staycation for a weekend here would be a dream :) board games and pac-man and hidden gems - what a treat."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cheryl's house is fun and quirky. It is a small place that is well organized allowing it to feel like a bigger home than it is. If you are traveling with kids, they are going to love this place. The kids bunk bed room was like a dream for our 4 and 6 year old kids. We all slept well and comfortably despite the outside temperatures reaching well into the 90s during our July visit. The house was very clean and has everything you would need for an extended stay. It doesn't take long to get to a good grocery store and is pretty conveniently located for a trip to the Dakota Zoo or the North Dakota Heritage Center and State Museum. Those places were a treat for our kiddos. Cheryl was great with communication and the check-in and check-out processes were a breeze. If you are swinging through Bismarck, see if ""Lamppost 15"" is available!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great home. Spacious. Comfy beds and furniture. Nice patio. We’ll equipped kitchen.
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"Very impressive home. Lots of unique ideas that the owner has done to this home and stay. We enjoyed every minute that we were there. Cheryl was very responsive, organized, and professional. Thank you!!!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow! More of and experience than just a house. From the hidden room, to all the quirky unique touches, the arcade machine and fun games and decor, my 4 littles and I were enamored by this house. We've stayed at almost 40 Airbnbs in the past and this topped all of them. Everything you need and more. We wish we could stay longer. The adopt a plushy was the sweetest touch too. Highly recommend."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed in this town about 6 times a year. Couldn't believe this one. It was my favorite. You can't go wrong , there is a lot of thought and care put in to this unit."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This sweet home was one of the cleanest places we have ever stayed in which is SO important to us!

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I've stayed at a fair share of places around the world, and Cheryls' place was one of the most inviting. Lots of thought and care put into it. Games for the family and kids; movies; stuffed animals. The kids loved the bunk beds. Cheryl was really responsive when there was an issue with the water. Everything was really great. Will recommend this to family and friends when they visit."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family loved staying at Cheryl’s place. It’s a tiny little home that doesn’t feel small at all. The place was spotless too, we felt very comfortable in her home! The place is very kid friendly…board games and the PAC Man Arcade game were a big hit! Thanks so much for the wonderful stay, we will be back…may be a couple years…but we will be back for sure!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Cheryl's house is super cute and very comfortable! I wish I had more time to hang out. I highly recommend staying here if you are in Bismarck!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cheryl's place is a hidden gem and a must stay! This home has so much personality and we loved it! Whether you're a couple and you want a home base to come back to or to just veg at or you're an entire family, this home fits the bill, for sure. It's cozy, spacious and honestly had everything we needed and more. The kitchen is well-stocked, it's incredibly comfortable, has several extra touches and Cheryl's communication is fantastic. The location is great, too. We found everything we wanted within a 10 minute drive (including the airport). We didn't have time to use the back deck, but it was lovely and we appreciated two types of coffee pots (grounds or pods). TV, games, movies and this is the only AirBnB I've stayed in where I got to play Ms. Pac Man, so that was a bonus. :-) I highly recommend this AirBnB. The bed was comfortable, quiet neighborhood and was everything we were looking for. Thanks!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"my friend and I had a lovely stay at ReNay's hobby farm. it looks like it's right from a picture book and it's taken care of with love. couldn't think of a more welcoming place.

Would definitely book again!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"OMG!, If you have the opportunity and find yourself in Bismarck you have to stay here! The cottage is just delightful, and the host is wonderful. The cottage is just as nice as in the pictures. My kids enjoyed petting the alpacas and learning about them from the host. Mrs. ReNay is just so sweet. We had no issue getting in to the cottage, communication was great. My family fell in love with the property. They had a blast being around the alpacas, feeding the highland cow and caressing the 3 kittens on the property. We will definitely be back next year!! Thank you ReNay for everything."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed ReNae’s cute cottage! The house was so simple but modern and cozy. Comfortable beds and atmospheres. Cute decorations were matching their alpaccas! Kids loved the bunk beds as well.
The alpaccas at their farm were so friendly and darling! Miniature cow was interesting! Chickens, and kitties and neighbor’s sheeps in the pasture. ReNae gave us the farm tour and it was so fun to see everrything. Little ones fed and pet all the animals, got to pick some rasberries and peas from the garden.
We sure had great time and would love to go back sometime! Thank you ReNae!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Do not hesitate to book the Apple Creek Cottage. This place is magic! Two adorable kitties greeted and when we opened the cottage door it was just as the pictures showed. It was clean, comfortable, well-stocked and has thoughtful touches like handknitted slippers, eggs in the fridge and a super sweet storybook on the coffee table. No ear plugs needed to sleep and we woke up to so much cuteness in the form of alpacas it was almost unbearable! We visited the chickens and picked raspberries in the garden that we ate with whipped cream while sitting on the back patio watching chickadees fly about. I will be looking for excuses to go back to Bismarck to stay here again!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying in ReNay's place. We only stopped for the night but wish we could have stayed longer. The unit is set on a lovely farm where you can visit alpacas, a cow and some chickens. Our nine-year-old loved the animals, especially the friendliest cat in the world. We appreciated that we had the freedom to explore the entire property. They even invited us into their garden to harvest raspberries. The unit was comfortable and spacious enough for four people. Very close to Bismarck but far enough to feel like we were in the country. We would love to come back."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Really enjoyed our time here. The grounds and cottage were so nice and enjoyable. ReNay was out of town so a friend of hers met us at the farm and showed us around. We loved interacting with the alpacas and chickens and picking a few fresh raspberries from the garden. The value was good and the cottage was so clean and nice. And we loved the fresh eggs!
Also appreciated having a full size washer and dryer to clean out clothes after spending a lot of time hiking the national park in the heat.
Had a wonderful stay and would definitely come again if in the area."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"ReNay and Don were wonderful hosts! Not only was their cottage clean and welcoming, but their property was breathtaking! We had everything we needed.
ReNay was so kind to take our boys to meet her alpacas (definitely a highlight!), and allow us to pick raspberries from her garden. Absolutely one of the top Airbnb experiences we’ve had!
We would highly recommend this home to anyone traveling through Bismarck, and hope to return in the future."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is perfect if you’re passing through. We were here in July and the AC was nice and cold. The beds were very comfortable and the whole place was clean.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This little cottage is a hidden gem. Everything about it was perfect. Owners showed us around the farm and gave us a lesson on alpacas. We were fortunate enough to been there, right after the alpacas had babies and let us hold them. Very friendly welcoming. I would recommend this place, five stars for sure."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"ReNays place was absolutely quaint and perfect for our stay in Bismarck for a wedding. The home itself had all the features we needed and even included fresh farm eggs were delicious for our avocado toast breakfast! The home was clean, quiet and peaceful, which was just what we needed. We were lucky enough to meet a day old baby alpaca which was adorable and Don even took us around the property sharing and telling about the history of the place and where Don and ReNay had made improvements which was very facinating! Overall, a wonderful place to stay with fabulous hosts! We are definitely planning another trip to stay again!"

10 out of 10 would recommend and plan on staying here again next year."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay! The people, alpacas, and cats were all calm, interesting, and friendly hosts.
I’m in my 50s and slept on the lower bunk. It was so comfortable I didn’t even hear the impressive thunderstorm that rolled through in the night - slept like a log.
The location is close enough to town to run in and get anything you need, yet feels miles away from any hubbub."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was one of the best experiences we have ever had. ReNay and her husband were lovely and they truly welcomed us to their farm. For hours the kids played with the alpacas, chickens and cats. I could not recommend this place more. We will certainly come back if we are ever passing through again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"ReNay's farm stay is a perfect place to escape. It's less than 15 minutes from the airport/downtown, but completely secluded and quiet. The accommodations were comfortable, clean, and inviting - it really did feel like a coming home or sorts.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow! Apple Creek Cottage exceeded all of our expectations. To date, this is our FAVORITE airbnb experience!

The entire farm is lovingly cared for & it was so special for us to enjoy this unique experience. (Confession, I spent hours online looking for a fun place for our girl's getaway & Apple Creek ended up going way beyond my expectations :))! We loved being in a rural & peaceful farm setting. We visited the alpacas & chickens, made a campfire dinner & hiked at a nearby recreation area. It was a quick drive into Bismarck where we got our fix of fresh coffee, bakery sweets, local beers and a little shopping. I just wish I lived closer so I could come back more often!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Peaceful, cozy and super clean! Loved everything about the cottage. We will definitely book again."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved our stay at the Apple Creek Cottage! The cottage was so cute & cozy & the views are stunning! We had everything we needed , wish we could’ve stayed longer! Getting to see the alpacas was a bonus. We will definitely be back during the warmer weather months to check out the property and the animals. Thanks ReNay!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,ReNay was very helpful in getting this place available to us at the last minute when the weather made traveling impossible! The cottage was gorgeous and very clean! The entire area was plowed out and well maintained! We would love to stay again when the weather is warmer!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I loved my get away at ReNay’s place. It was the perfect place to relax and rest. I look forward to being able to visit again!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"The cottage was spotless, cozy, and had fresh eggs and honey! (YUM!)
ReNay was very responsive with all communication.
Visiting the beautiful alpaca's and the sweet outdoor cats still has me smiling :)
I woke up looking right through the bedroom window out to the gorgeous morning light with the barn, windmill, and silo all perfectly framed within the window. Apple Creek Cottage is the quintessential country cottage, set in a gorgeous landscape! We will be back again."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We've had a rough fall and wanted to get away from the world for a couple of days! Little did we know we would stumble upon a little piece of paradise in North Dakota when we told AirBNB just to find us a place Thanksgiving weekend. A beautiful, prisitine cottage with a friendly hostess, amazing animals, near enough to town to get the supplies we needed, while still allowing us to snuggle down with Netflix, puzzles, and family. No intrusions from the outside world, ReNay was always available to answer questions, make suggestions, and introduce us to her animals. We came home refreshed and renewed, ready to face the holidays. Our jaded 13 year old was weepy about leaving, and we all agreed we didn't spend enough time there--next time at least one more night! :) Thank you for everything, ReNay! You and your home are amazing."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing. Everything about it was perfectly amazing.
Check-in: ReNay allowed us to check in 2 hours early. We had left early trying to beat a wind storm that was blowing snow around. She told us how to get in and asked if we had any questions to reach out. They have instructions and a guest book on the table.
Stay: as a family of 4 ( kids 5,2)the stay was perfect this house has everything you need. We enjoyed many meals at the table, watch movies, played games (some provided). They have a pac-n-play for littles. ReNay gave us a tour of the farm, introduced the alpacas to us, told us about her property. She took us to the chicken coop and let the kids feed the chickens treats. She got sleds out for us so we could sled on the hill in front of their house. She said we could help ourselves to visit the animals through out the week we stayed there.
Check-out: smooth and easy and ReNay reached out to check and say goodbye!
Great place to stay! We will return when we are in the area."

We could definitely tell how proud they are of their home and it shows, they put so much work into it and it’s absolutely beautiful!! All of the kitties, chickens and alpacas were amazing!

Such a GREAT find, and a nice little getaway for a weekend or if you wish to book for a photoshoot we HIGHLY recommend!!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful place just 10 minutes from downtown Bismarck. My cottage was immaculate, roomy, and had everything I needed. This farm is clearly a labor of love, from the extensive vegetable gardens to the chickens who would run out of their coop when I walked by and the adorable Alpacas. Most of all, ReNay’s hospitality was amazing. This is one of the most lovely places I have stayed and I would highly recommend to anyone wanting the peace of the country just minutes from the city!"

We look forward to going back the next time we are in ND."

The kitchen is fully stocked, linens were fresh and beds were comfortable. We will absolutely be back."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a wonderful cottage, ReNay and Don are awesome host! The farm tour was the highlight of our visit, we had the chance to feed the chickens and alpacas; got an egg from the coop and even had some asparagus spears from the garden - great memories for our family."
2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Quaint and relaxing cottage on a beautiful hobby farm setting! ReNay and Don were delightful hosts.
Great place to stay and cook your own meals and enjoy some breathing room from the city. We were in the area for a wedding and enjoyed being able to pet the cats, collect our own fresh eggs and have private outdoor space."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful and comfortable little place on Apple Creek to stay during a road trip! The bed was so comfortable—felt like Heaven when I crawled in after a long day of driving! The little cabin had everything we needed for our stay.

The old barn and lilacs were amazing! Would definitely stay here again!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This has been by far, one of the best Air Bnb experiences we've ever had! We traveled from Minot and came for Mother's day and it was great! The cottage is amazing! Very well put together. Super clean, very organized, and very modern with a farm feel. They had board games and smart tv with netflix. I am not much of a farm guy but this was absolutely amazing. The hosts provided us with a great barn experience. We were able to look, pet and take pictures with the alpacas. Not only that but we were able to feed the chickens and my daughter was able to collect some eggs. They also left a nice set of fresh eggs in the fridge so we can eat for breakfast. This is exactly the experience my wife wished to have with our 2 year old. The farm is outstanding and the welcoming message and instructions in the cottage made you feel right at home! They informed us with great local food spots and we loved it. We went to fireflour pizza.
The hosts are very sweet and nice. They were very thoughtful with everything and the attention to detail is bar none. We WILL be coming back and we hope for more than a day. I highly recommend this even if you live in Bismarck. The sunset views are absolutely spectacular! I want a farm now"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Sincerely hands down best airbnb stay ever. Such an impeccable farm, tremendous beauty (sunsets!) and warm generosity from hosts. Really enjoyed meeting them and their farm animals. Spotlessly clean quarters—a shock on a farm and contrast that I love. A true home is found here."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This property is everything it’s advertised as and more. The cottage is the perfect clean and cozy getaway with modern farmhouse charm and character to no end. The property is beautiful, the alpacas are so funny and curious (mostly about little kids ☺️), the chickens were chatty and social, and the kitties could not have been friendlier (and we are not cat people! But they were too sweet to not love!)! The barn is amazing and the family couldn’t be sweeter. I can’t say enough good about this rental!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little get away place! They were great host and showed us there beautiful farm. Would definitely stay again!!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best airbnb's we've ever stayed at. Cutest cottage on an amazing farm. Loved visiting with the hosts, alpaca, chickens, cats, and enjoying fresh eggs.

2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Adorable cottage! We loved the farm setting and alpacas.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"ReNay’s place has an amazing charm. The place was spotless and has all the modern amenities you could want, while offering the peace and privacy of a countryside farm. Very quiet area but close enough for easy access to anything you might need in town. The alpacas, kitties, and chickens were adorable and made my stay even more special. ReNay was a wonderful host and great to communicate with."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our 2nd stay, once again very clean and cozy! Although they were gone, they had someone there to show us the friendly chickens and alpacas. Thanks again."

2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"ReNay's guesthouse is an amazing place to stay.
A few miles from Bismarck allows for easy access to downtown and the state Capitol grounds and Heritage Museum, while the guest space on the farm allows for a true countryside retreat.
Staying here is both a cozy getaway as well as an actual farm stay. Our 3 year old enjoyed a tour of the 100 year barn, alpacas, cats and chicken coop when he ventured outside.
ReNay and Don are kind and thoughtful hosts who welcome travelers to their peaceful farm and guest house.
The guest house has so much character and everything that a couple of small family needs for a comfortable home base while in the Bismarck area.
Many Thanks!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful property! We were very impressed! We will be back!!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Apple Creek Farms is such a unique experience! Being able to pick fresh eggs from a chicken coop and pet alpacas and even feed treats to barn cats was so surreal. ReNay and Don are very hospitable, and the cottage is equipped with all the little details needed for one to feel at home away from home. We truly enjoyed our stay and we will be back!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"ReNay is an inviting, lovely and exceptional host. She is accommodating and her communication is excellent. This location offers so many different things, to accommodate what you're desiring for a variety of seasons. The property and cottage are exceptionally clean and welcoming. Thank you for an outstanding visit and i'll definitely be back."

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Greta place
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Can’t thank you enough for having us. So glad we made the decision to book so last minute!
I hope to be able to meet you, ReNay, next time as well! Don was wonderful and we appreciate the time he spent with us so much! We learned a lot about alpacas and just enjoyed chatting with him.
You’re home and entire farm is one of a kind. So beautiful and a “forever” dream place for sure! Can’t wait to be back!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful cottage with everything you need! It was very clean and comfortable! Great bed and linens! Eggs for breakfast! Hosts were very hospitable! The alpacas were a fun experience! Can’t wait to come back again!!!

2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is such a wonderful spot! Clean, comfortable, and convenient, but most memorable for the incredible farm surrounding, kind hosts and all of the attention they put into the details—from farm fresh eggs to the alpaca visits. Highly recommend (especially with little ones)."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,you can't find a better host she answered the phone right away and the place was awesome

This place is a joy."

Their place is super clean and peaceful.
The setting and surroundings are very nice.
We'd stay again for sure!!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"ReNay's farm was an absolutely wonderful place to cap off my trip to North Dakota. The place is very close to Bismarck, but is also far enough out to feel as if it's deep in farm country. The cottage is better than indicated in the profile, the grounds were beautiful and the barn cats were very friendly. I was also lucky enough to be on site for a farm to table dinner arranged in the barn that was amazing.
Thank you for a fantastic stay!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This cottage was a real delight. Quaint, impeccably clean and comfortable. ReNay and Don are perfect hosts and most generous. We came when garden produce was at a peak and ReNay let us help ourselves to some of the bounty to eat in the cottage and to take along. She happily answered our many questions about the alpacas, took us into their pen and let us interact and snuggle with them :-)) We were disappointed it wasn't available for our return trip :-( Highly recommend!!!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I can’t recommend ReNay’s cottage more! It’s beautiful, clean, peaceful, comfortable and the grounds are lovely - Their hospitality is unmatched!
Our stop here was during a road trip of the mid-west and what a lovey oasis along the road.
The chickens and alpacas and funny! The eggs are such a nice treat.
If you’re in the area schedule a stop in the cottage!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a delightful stay at ReNay's place. It is newly remodeled and beautifully appointed. Such a cozy place to be. ReNay is an amazing host! She showed us around the farm and introduced us to her alpacas. What an extra treat that was!! We hope to return again! This place is really above and beyond any other airbnb I have stayed at.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This cottage is by far, the BEST Airbnb booking that we’ve had. It is in a country setting but so close to the downtown area. The cottage is so “homey” and so relaxing. There is a barn with alpaca and a chicken coop…we had fresh eggs! ReNay is a great host!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I don’t have enough good words to say about it here! So many little (and big) thoughtful touches to the cottage and their hobby farm.
The home is very comfortable and has such good and warm energy. ReNay is so accommodating and it was also so nice to see the alpacas, animals and hobby farm! My daughter and I loved it!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Incredible! This was a stop on our way home from Yellowstone and I’m certain this stop was the favorite part of the trip for our kids.
The hobby farm is absolutely charming (just like the hostess). The cottage is perfectly updated and spotless! We enjoyed our time and will certainly be back if we pass that way again."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Had another amazing stay at Ms. ReNay’s beautiful cottage on the farm! Highly recommend this place for anyone staying in or passing through Bismarck!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely fabulous. We entered the beautiful cottage and soft music was playing and the temperature was perfect. Super clean and very comfy. Best night sleep on our journey. Hosts greeted us and introduced us to their alpacas and gorgeous garden.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is incredible and is one of our top airbnb experiences ever. ReNay and Don are fabulous, kind, welcoming hosts, and their farm is so beautiful--I can't begin to describe how amazing it is. We had a lovely, relaxing stay in the cottage (which is impeccably clean and comfortable) on our way out to Montana to visit family, and we're thrilled that we get to stay there again on our way back. I can't recommend Apple Creek Cottage enough."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Truly one of the nicest Airbnb’s we’ve stayed at, and quite possibly our very favorite. The cottage is so beautifully designed - a very sophisticated little farmhouse feel. Although we were just passing through on our way to Glacier, we regretted that we couldn’t stay and enjoy the farm longer (we’ve already booked it again for our drive back)! Ms. ReNay was also kind enough to take quite a bit of time out of her morning to chat with us and introduce us to her sweet alpacas. Her kitties were also some of the friendliest we’ve met! Thank you, Ms. ReNay and family!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The cutest cottage, and the best hosts! We loved our stay here. The alpacas and garden-fresh food were a bonus."

2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow! This is a wonderful spot! Chickens, alpacas, friendly cats and absolutely lovely hosts. The house is spacious, clean and comfortable. ReNay even sent us on our way home with fresh veggies from her garden. We hope to return someday!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is so awesome! My daughter wants to live in a farm now. The hosts are fantastic and took time out of their day to introduce us to the alpacas, let us feed the chickens and gather eggs, and we toured their beautiful garden. They also have adorable barn cats they will chase you down for attention.
The pictures of the cottage do not do it justice, it is bigger than it seems in the pictures.
Definitely book a stay here."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Adorable farm decor, met the alpacas, ate farm fresh eggs, toured the farm. A perfect stop over if you are driving cross country. Thanks ReNay."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful home great experience!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is an idyllic location and fabulous for families who enjoy animals and nature. Super clean and relaxed atmosphere. Only wish we could’ve stayed longer!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Renay's place was beautiful-the home was very clean and had everything we needed. The alpacas and giant garden were amazing and it was so nice of Renay to give us a tour. Both Renay and Don were very friendly and we loved learning about their life and the farm.We had the best corn on the cob that we picked minutes before! All in all a wonderful airbnb experience!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the most relaxing little trip for my family. It was absolutely beautiful out there. We didn’t want to leave. Thank you so much. Everything was perfect. Thanks Mike:)))

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an absolutely amazing place! Beautiful accommodation with great touches, incredible host, beautiful garden (with fresh veggies and eggs), and a whole group of alpaca friends! Can’t wait to come back."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We booked a single night here on our way home from a family road trip to Yellowstone. It was everything I hoped for - a clean, inviting place to stay with farm friends (alpacas and kitties) to entertain our 4 year old son who was ready to be home."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,we had a great stay. my son loves this farm and immediately wanted to go back
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,You don’t want to miss this sweet little cottage. It’s the perfect getaway.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This is without doubt our favorite AirBnb that we've stayed at while traveling across the country! Just a gorgeous farm with incredible hosts! I can't recommend highly enough!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,A family favorite…this place is what AirBnB is supposed to be!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Incredible! Perhaps one of my favorite Airbnb stays ever :) I loved ReNay’s tour of the barn and gardens. And the cottage is so perfectly designed. Everything is so well curated, down to a telidoscope just outside the cottage!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful 1 night stay here. Enjoyed the cottage and the location as well as the eggs and honey!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"An unexpected but unbelievable stay! ReNay and Don gave us the ultimate tour of their gorgeous property, took us to meet and feed all the animals, and even let us take some extra eggs from the coop. The cottage was impeccably clean, comfy, and had everything one could need. We hope to be back again someday!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,What a gem of a find on AirBnB. It was by far our favorite accommodations for the entire length of our great American roadtrip! Thank you so much for showing us such great hospitality!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is the perfect stay for any and everyone! ReNay and her husband are the sweetest and love sharing their beautiful farm with you! We loved hearing all of their amazing stories and meeting all of their animals, especially the alpacas! Very easy to communicate with her and she was very flexible with our schedule. This place is perfect!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,ReNay and Don are spectacular hosts. Our stay was wonderful! The land around the cottage is a great view and provides a great space to walk about. While we grilled dinner our children played in the grass in the back of the house following the cats around. ReNay gave us a tour of the alpacas’ barn and chicken coop which was the highlight for our daughters. They feed the chickens and collected eggs. Only regret is not staying longer!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is a gem and hopefully will be our annual stopping point when traveling between Montana and Minnesota. Gave us a new appreciation for Bismark. It is so close to HWY and town yet feels like another place all together.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"My girlfriend and I had a wonderful night's stay at this farm sanctuary! It was clean, very well decorated with lots of space and caring thought put into each detail. There was even music playing when we arrived and fresh eggs from the farm waiting in the fridge. The hosts are very gracious and kind, and the land is beautiful. Even the outdoor cats and the family of alpacas were welcoming and absolutely adorable. Definitely recommend staying here!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had such an amazing time here! It was the perfect spot for our very active young sons. They loved meeting the alpacas, cats, and chickens, and playing baseball in the large yard. We also appreciated the beautifully remodeled cottage and thoughtfulness of our hosts - ReNay was so generous with her time & knowledge. Highly recommend!!!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is an absolutely charming stay! The cottage is very clean, and the space is perfect for a small family. We loved the two bedrooms and separate living room and kitchen/dining area. The farm was a joy for us and our children, and the hosts are very kind and friendly! I would stay here again in a heartbeat and highly recommend it!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Strongly suggest experiencing for yourself. . . . I can't imagine anyone being anything but delighted!!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Too many good things to say about this place and our stay! Such a fun place just minutes from Bismarck. Our three young boys enjoyed the farm, seeing the animals, and the open spaces so much. It was a really memorable short getaway for us. Renay is a great host!"

Everything is easily walkable downtown and the surrounding neighborhood is very quiet and easily accessible to grocery stores, a gym and restaurants. The space itself is cozy, convenient and clean.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dot’s place is great for one person or a couple coming through Bismarck. The interior is very clean and comfortable. Traveling solo at the beginning of the week, I appreciated the extra safety measures Dot had in place including a ring doorbell at the unit and an extra lock inside the door. Something to keep in mind is that it is a little bit of a walk from the parking spot to front door of the unit (stair and elevator access) but is a similar distance as if you were staying in a hotel."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Outstanding place to stay.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was great and perfectly priced! We stayed in the area for a wedding and loved how close to everything we were. Dot’s apartment was super clean and had all the amenities we could possibly need. It’s a one bedroom but the living room chair pulled out into a bed that was big enough for our two young kids to share, complete with linens. We also felt safe with the automatic deadbolt and being on the 3rd floor. You could tell Dot put a lot of thought into what guests could need for their stay which made it very comfortable and accommodating (for example, a rolling laundry basket since laundry is down the hall & supplies for the pool). Overall fantastic place in the Bismarck/Mandan area. 10/10 recommend"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It’s a little awkward because it’s mostly a residential building- and it’s a little smaller than I thought from the pictures. But it did what we needed it to do, and the host Dot was very responsive when I messaged."

2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Kids loved the pool, and the apartment space was comfortable and had most of what we needed. Being on the third floor and a bit from the elevator was difficult just because I was traveling alone with three small kids. The only garbage was the small can in the bathroom, so we grabbed extra bags on our Walmart run.
Neighbors in the building were mostly welcoming and one even grabbed pool noodles for the kids to use. We booked purely for the pool and the kids were very happy!
Location seemed central for the sightseeing and zoo visit we were able to fit into our trip."

There is a visitor center just across the street, which was very convenient for us since we used the condo as a base camp for daily trips exploring North Dakota."

I am guessing that's because it's an indoor condo and other ppl in the building smoke. other than that, easy, close parking to the door, easy to find, close to the highway, and cute cozy space!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We have stayed in Aaron's house in Bismarck for our son's swim camp for 3 days. It was one of the best house we have stayed in of all the Airbnb's we have used so far. It was very nicely done, compact but enough for all the needs of a family of 4 with 2 teenager son's.
As soon as you walk in you feel the modern and clean lines of the house. Fridge was stocked with water and some soda's, there was a choices of coffe pods and breakfast cereal for the kids. Kitchen was nicely done and we utilize it during our stay. Bedroom's were nice and clean as well as the bathroom. there was even a oil diffuser with a lot of essential oil choices.
I recommend this house to all and we will definitely stay there again for the future swim meets."

it was a quick 2-day stay and I would return when I'm in town"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was my 1st day of work for some outdoor labor I never did before. So, after just 4 hours of this activity, I didn't know/couldn't anticipate that I'd arrive in such a mess. I felt bad. They let me do my wash; visited (""get to know""); and offered me food & coffee. EXCELLENT coffee, btw. Bed was amazing. I ""run hot"" and they offered a portable a/c that I didn't use, since there...only 1 night. I'd stay here again. And, while anyone would be most welcomed & feel comfortable at this stay of Mary Ellen's, I will highly recommend this environment to women especially. I do not bring pets however I think this is a pet friendly site (confirm for yourself). While awaiting for my next home to become move-in ready (which date keeps getting kicked down the road by the current owner), I couldn't of stumbled across a better people or place during career transition & relocation processes. Thank you."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Mary Ellen is genuinely one of the sweetest and kindest individuals I have ever met. Even though we showed up a bit later (and had two rats with us!) she welcomed us at the door like we were family, shared both dinner and breakfast with us, and personally led me and my partner to a lovely place to walk alongside the Missouri River. You can absolutely tell that she provides her service for the love of sharing hospitality with anyone visiting the area. Even though we were just passing through and needed someplace to rest our heads that night, Mary Ellen provided an unforgettable experience for us - Someday, we hope we may open an AirBNB just like hers! If we ever find ourselves in that part of the country again, there is nowhere else I’d rather stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Staying with Mary Ellen and Barbara felt just like staying with family! I felt right at home. We had great conversations in the evening and morning before I left.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mary Ellen was a wonderful host and the bedroom was so comfortable. I was able to get some much needed rest after being on the road all day. My dog loves her too! I’d definitely stay here again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Mary Ellen is one of a kind! After several flight delays and cancellations i never made it to Mary Ellen’s place. She was so sweet checking on me and offering my rides from the airport when and if I arrived. To top it all off Mary Ellen gave me a full refund. She is truly a special lady! Thanks Mary Ellen for all your concern and kindness YOUR THE BEST !!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Had a great time. She even gave me amazing birthday cake!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Mary Ellen is wonderful. She met us out front and helped us get our weary bodies inside. And she is wonderful to have a conversation with over her delicious homemade applesauce. She even accommodated our fur babies (1 dog 1 cat) giving them water and giving us dishes for their food. The room was cozy and comfortable, and even though a little snug with a large dog, cat, large husband and myself, we were perfectly happy. The bathroom was clean, shower/tub well equipped, and towels were plentiful. She even got up at 6am in the morning with us and fed us breakfast, with some food to take on the road. We couldn't be happier with our short stay, and would definitely choose to stay with Mary Ellen again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mary Ellen was amazing. She offered us breakfast and dinner both nights we were there. She was so sweet - giving us suggestions where to go and good food to eat.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was one of my best Airbnb host experiences. Mary Ellen offered me dinner when I had not eaten after a long drive and difficulty finding a good place to park with my trailer. She also is a great listener; if you have something bothering you, she will listen. She was willing to offer anything she could, including an ear if it would make you feel more comfortable.
Normally, breakfast might be a big add on. In this case it was just a natural extension of Mary Ellen's genuinely accomodative, serving attitude throughout the stay."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"No words can describe what an amazing host Mary is. She was so understanding of my travel plans being delayed and I immediately felt like I was coming home the second I walked in the door!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,I'm truly thankful that I chose to stay at Mary Ellen's place. One of the hard things about traveling for work is the loneliness and boredom one faces in a hotel. It felt so good on a sub zero evening to have someone waiting for me with a warm welcome and cup of tea and an offer of either ham and eggs or pancakes for breakfast. I'd have to say that my stay at Mary Ellens was just about the highlight of my trip to Bismarck.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,A nice home and a lovely lady who let me sit around for a few hours while AAA came to jumpstart the car from the cold. She was very sweet and made me breakfast and was always offering another cup of tea or coffee.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"the second I got there, I immediately felt right at home. Mary's home reminded me so much of my great grandma's home that I haven't been in for at least 20 years. she had so many homey touches like candy and snacks in the room, toiletries and she even offered to make me breakfast 🥹 I was able talk to Mary in the morning before I left and she is such a kind and interesting person. I know people often talk about southern hospitality, but I have spent the majority of the last year in the Great Plains states and I think the people here far outdo any southern hospitality I've ever experienced! If I ever travel through Mandan again, I would book Mary's place 100 times over!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice and affordable place to stay.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Mary is the kindest AirBnB host you will ever have! I am so glad I and my friend stayed with her. She welcomed us into her cozy home and offered us water and ice cream. Our room was comfortable and we were also offered breakfast. Mary is very kind and caring and we had a great time talking. Thank you so much!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We got into Mary Ellen's place very late after calling her to tell her about dealing with detours and road closures, only to discover she was waiting up for us! Not only that, she insisted on helping my disabled husband and fixed us a snack. She is a gem. Yes, her place is small, but quite adequate, and she is a priceless hostess!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The BEST Airbnb host ever!! I have stayed at over 100 Airbnbs, and Mary Ellen really is outstanding on all levels! I had some issues, it took an extra few hours to clear customs, pushing my eta closer to 12am and she waited up to greet me and make sure I got settled in. A meticulously clean and cozy room awaited me with snacks and a heated blanket. She welcomed my pooches with open arms and cuddles. She even made me breakfast and lunch! I then locked my keys in my car, and she was so patient and kind while leaving late, waiting for the locksmith to come. I absolutely love Airbnbs with exceptional experiences, and her energy is just that. A steal of a deal for how she goes above and beyond for guests and with such kindness. Very safe, quiet, and beautiful neighborhood. This will now be my official hub while on the road!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,She is a gem and she is worth the price of admission.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had such an amazing time staying in Mary Ellen’s home! It was a charming place, and although we were only there for a short while we felt so welcomed. And holy cow is it affordable! Mary Ellen was great with communication, and it was so clear that she cares for all the people who stayed in her home. And we’re not just saying that - she went out of her way to make us a breakfast and coffee, and sent us off with rhubarb desserts! Who does that?!? Someone as great as Mary Ellen, that’s who 😊 We loved getting to know her, and she loved hearing about our travels. The room and home had everything we needed, we got a great night’s sleep, and we enjoyed poking around Mandan. Sitting around the breakfast table with Mary Ellen and another guest made us feel like the early days of Airbnb - when it was centered in community and hospitable care. Thank you Mary Ellen!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Staying at Mary Ellen's felt like staying with a relative or friend. She makes you feel right at home when you walk in the door. Her home has not been recently updated, but the guest area is very clean and has thoughtful touches like restaurant suggestions and snacks. If you are looking for a sterile hotel experience with wifi this is not the place for you, but if you are looking for a kind and gracious host, stay here!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Mary Ellen was just fantastic. She was so accommodating and friendly from before we arrived, and it continued through the entire stay. She was also so welcoming of our dogs and treated us and them like family. She was just such a pleasure to share a place with for a night, not to mention the best deal you can ask for! My fiancé and I are on a long move to Oregon from Minnesota and this was such a highlight of my trip. If we ever stop through Mandan again, there is no one else I’d rather stay with!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We drew aunts and uncles from near and far for a daughter’s graduation week at the University of Mary. This property accommodated everyone; the community meals were easy to prepare and serve; the porch on the patio was a plus. A walk north brings you to the grounds of the State of North Dakota capital and the North Dakota Heritage Center (highly recommended). Heading south brings you to many downtown cafes and restaurants.

2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"Ann was very easy to get ahold of. The house was exactly like the pictures and was close to the curling club so just a short drive. We enjoyed the quiet atmosphere and was very relaxed after spending 14 hours at the curling club. There was plenty of room for everyone so everyone could have their own space. We appreciated someone shoveling the snow from the deck and driveway. Your place was perfect for the 5 of us. Nobody could say enough good things on the space, living area, bathrooms and the bedrooms. If we come for another event we would absolutely stay there again! 🥌🥰🥌🥰🥌🥰"

The only downside of the house is that it’s old and makes lots of noise as you walk around which can be a little tough trying to keep a 5 month old asleep ;) but that’s no fault of the house! Just an observation. The kids loved it, the family loved it, comfortable beds, clean linens. Was a very enjoyable stay and Ann was a gracious host who we always were able to get ahold of."

The house was in a great location for us and we got to spend some fantastic family time together there. Our running joke was adopted from one of the inspirational signs posted in the house, ""You call it chaos, we call it family!"" Amen to that. There was some unfortunate major city construction happening on the street just outside our windows, but that didn't stop us from having a wonderful trip."

2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly what we were hoping for, clean and affordable! Thanks Peggy!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You can tell Peggy has been a host for a while. Communication was clear and in multiple formats (Airbnb messages and written on a bulletin board inside the apartment). Little thoughtful touches were also present like a custom passcode for the door just for you and hand sanitizer key chain.
The unit is slightly odd and kitschy and I mean that as a complement. Many decors in Airbnb are predictable and forgettable. This place is a strange and welcoming mutation between your Grandmother’s house, a time machine back to the 90s, and something I don’t know what. It looks like this place has been renovated several times and the furnishings don’t match at all. There are 3 types of flooring, the refrigerator is in the living room for some reason, there is a mini secret passage way between two of the rooms through the closet, there are mirrors in odd places, the bathroom has Finish style sauna wood paneling....I loved it. They don’t make places like these. Everything is a mishmash. One room is like your grandmother’s parlor and another room has VHS tapes of your favorite movies from the 80s and 90s. There are two mildly creepy dolls in one room and a case containing old reading glasses. I feel that a very good “This American Life” episode could be made about this apartment. It isn’t ugly. It isn’t beautiful. It is what it is.
The neighborhood is about a block away from the Kiwanis park and it was nice to walk around after a long drive."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ad is straight to the point. Clean. Great location.

The bed was great, the shower was huge, and there were tons of little amenities (bath bombs, coffee, hair dryer, big huge towels) that really made our stay awesome. I had to take the futon, and honestly it was a bit uncomfortable- anyone bigger than me (5’8, 150lbs) would have a really hard time sleeping on it. But, that’s the nature of futons I suppose!
Thanks Peggy!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Mikaela has been a fantastic host and she has a beautiful property, that made our stay in Bismarck feel like a home from home.
The responsive communication and willingness to be flexible to accommodate our travel delays was above and beyond.
Mikaela was also very transparent on any updates on the property and helpful in reminding us on the procedures for check -in and check-out.
I would highly recommend a stay with Mikaela and when we returning to Bismarck we will be booking with her again, if the property is available.
If you’re looking for a property that has it all, then I would really consider this accommodation during your visit to Bismarck North Dakota."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful Stay for a Special Celebration!
We recently stayed at Mikaela's Airbnb to celebrate my son's accomplishments from United Technical College, and it was an excellent choice. From the beginning, Mikaela's quick responses to our questions made the booking process smooth and hassle-free.
The place itself was immaculate and well-maintained. We felt right at home thanks to the cozy atmosphere and excellent amenities provided. The kitchen was fully equipped, which allowed us to enjoy a lovely cookout with our family.
Overall, our stay was comfortable and enjoyable, making our special celebration even more memorable. Thank you, Mikaela, for providing such a wonderful experience! Highly recommend this Airbnb to others."

The location is a 5 min walk to the hospital and an easy walk to downtown restaurants. The neighborhood was peaceful and safe. The home itself is modern, clean and comfortable— it exceeded my expectations with comfortable bedding, a robust kitchen, a nice TV with streaming services, plenty of natural lighting and even a small backyard and garage. And the host is kind, respectful and proactive with any questions/requests.
I would be lucky to stay here again!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Typically I will only look at houses. Options were limited with late notice and it was a two night minimum even though I only needed one. The space was great! It really surprised me. Would love their builder info for my farm. Located nice and close to medical facilities if that brings you to town like it does me.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was my 2nd rental with Airbnb and it was so much better than the first. If you'd like to treat yourself to a pristine property with well thought out amenities, this is it. Consider it a home away from home and newly built to-boot. From the beautiful décor, lovely blackout shades on bedroom windows, a bathroom accessible for both bedrooms and washer + dryer, you'll have everything you need for a comfortable stay. Kick back and watch a movie, enjoy the array of things to do in Bismarck or enjoy a fire (wood provided) in the backyard to round out a great day. This host was very responsive, thoughtful and very friendly. Would definitely be my first choice for another stay in Bismarck!"

This home is designed for rest, comfort, and is a great a retreat for pampering yourself and loved one/s. The hosts are also very nice people who are available if you need them.

We all loved it and will be staying again! Don't hesitate to book this place. you will be happy!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mikaela is a great host and her house was amazing! It seems to be brand new and everything is very thought through.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was really amazing. For once, the actual property surpasses the photos. As the other group viewers have stated, Dakota really has a knack for decorating, the place looks like it belongs in magazine. It’s like walking into a museum and having a sensory overload because there’s so many things to look at. The kitchen was stocked with everything you could possibly need, including fancy drinkware for our bloody Mary’s and skewers for the garnish.
It was super convenient and close to everything, there was a problem with the automatic door lock but Dakota was on site to fix it for me immediately. This is a split level home with three floors and she lives in the basement, this wasn’t as weird as it sounds when I write it, we never saw her unless we needed her. The bed linens were extra nice, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. This gem makes Air BnB look good."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay here. Highly recommended!

2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Dakota’s place was fabulously decorated and clean. Very comfortable place to stay, but when we arrived we learned the heated garage was not included in the price (as advertised) and there wasn’t enough space for our vehicle (due to another vehicle being in the garage) even after we agreed to pay an extra fee. Overall, very pleased. We would stay there again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about our stay in this beautiful home was WONDERFUL! Right from the beginning Dakotah was communicative and very quick to reply and answer any questions I had!
Her home is beautiful with such fun decor! I was very impressed with the kitchen and available amenities! The home felt very private, safe snd quiet yet we were very close to “everything!!!
We will for sure stay here again when we travel to Bismarck if it’s available!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I simply cannot say enough good about Dakotah’s place. It was ‘magical’. Every time I turned around or looked in another corner, there was something interesting to see. The kitchen is stocked better than mine at home. I shared my time at Dakotah’s with two of my cousins who I haven’t spent time with for years, and it was a perfect home to do so. Great conversation seating, outdoor deck to enjoy coffee, wine, and conversation. Dakotah’s outdoor seating areas and unique ‘yard’ were amazing. I appreciated having direct contact with Dakotah and she was extremely responsive. Her interior decorating is amazing. I don’t know how many times my cousins and I said, “Can you imagine if we had stayed in two motel rooms for this visit.” AND, it ended up being less expensive (and definitely more enjoyable) than if we had stayed in a motel. THANK YOU, Dakotah, for providing us the perfect place for our wonderful time together."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was only my second experience to AirBnb, as my first was not at all what I expected. Dakotah has forever changed my mind. The stay was absolutely outstanding. She has the most beautiful and relaxing home, that was a much needed retreat after a day of work. The communication, ease, and care taken to pamper her guests shows. Thank you Dakotah for making a business trip an unexpected mini vacation."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This elegantly decorated gem is super charming and comfortable. We enjoyed our girls’ weekend with plenty to do nearby. If anyone in your party has an issue with stairs this may not be the place for you.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A hidden gem! From the moment you enter the door you are greeted with beautiful decor and thoughtful touches that elevate this home beyond expectations. It felt like walking into a chic Manhatten apartment or an Italian Villa in Bismarck ND. The garden and outdoor seating area was lovely, I was able to harvest few tomatoes and some lovely fresh peas. The host added lovely surprises throughout the home( hospitality basket on the kitchen counter, chocolates on the bed) I loved the collection of.cookbooks above the stove. The entire home was comfortable and inviting. The bed was amazing! Communication with the host was great, check in was easy. Dakotah was ready with suggestions for things to do in the area if needed. We go to Bismarck frequently and I will definitely look for an open booking in this home for dates we will be there before booking anything else."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, super comfy, relaxing space and the host has wonderful communication with you, from booking to check in and check out."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dakotah’s space is brilliantly decorated, and stocked with every amenity you could possibly need! She went above and beyond with so many sweet little details, and hers is one of the cleanest AirBnBs I’ve ever stayed in. The neighborhood is nice, quiet, and super close to a new housing development with sidewalks, great for running or walking! We didn’t hear the neighbors whatsoever, and the outdoor garden is pure serenity! We are so grateful we found her AirBnB!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a great place! We based out of there to explore & Dakotah provided great info and recommendations. Definitely would stay again 💕

2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Dakotah was very welcoming! She messaged me right away and also made sure my daughter had a pack and play to sleep in. That was very much appreciated because that was one less item we had to pack. The house is beautiful and cozy. The bed is very comfy!! My husband and I slept like babies!! The garage was very nice to have since the weather was very cold and snowy! We will definitely stay here again. Very clean and well kept.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were really, really happy with this rental and would definitely recommend and rent again. Host was very responsive and helpful and house was very clean. Did not hear any noise from neighbors, and development was very quickly plowed when we had several inches of snow. Great location for us. Easy to reach the interstate and major highway, but not so close that you could see or hear either. It was near a grocery store, gas, bagels, fast casual restaurants, pharmacy, etc. Good size for 2 adults and two teen boys. The house is very carefully decorated, so its not a place to rent if you are planning to party. Very, shall we say ""energetic"", little children need to be respectful of the house as well."
2021-12-01,4,Stayed about a week,Beautiful place
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You will not be disappointed staying at this property. Truly a gem of a property and one of the most memorable stays we have had. An ideal get a way where the host has thought of everything to make your stay a pleasurable one.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Dakotah’s place was great. Lots of room for me and my daughter. Very clean and the beds were really comfortable. Plenty of amenities for cooking but since it was just the two of us we ate out while there. Convenient to the interstate and stores but you definitely need a car. Would stay again if we ever came back to Bismarck.
2021-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,It’s evident that Dakota put a lot of effort into the place. I would encourage her to remove a few items just to make a bit more space on tables and counters in baths foe guests. Thank you for your prompt response to my inquiries as well.

2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Let me start out by saying that Dakotah was terrific. She was accommodating, up front, and attentive. The house was warm and welcoming, with small touches of Dakotahs' charming personality dashed throughout the house. The heated double car garage was heaven sent considering the sub 20 degree Temps. The residence is perfectly located near the main street but far enough away to not hear traffic. We will definitely look here first when we return to complete another project in the spring."

2020-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Dakotah's place is a sweet retreat. A we'll decorated home with amenities such as patio off the dinning room or the garden area patio with pergergola fireplace and outdoor grill. Dakotah was easy to contact and communicate with her place was a great stay with dinning shopping and parks near by, I had a great R & R and look forward to another stay."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Dakotah is a rare gem of a human who's warmth and kindness is always shining through. It was so refreshing to be able to meet such a wonderful person and build a friendship over the 6 wks I stayed at her beautiful, luxurious home. I had no idea what to expect when I arrived in Bismarck ND, but I can honestly say out of the many airbnb's ive stayed at across the country this is definitely one of my favorites. The home is very spacious, cozy, and beautifully decorated. It is evident that Dakotah took much effort in attending to all the minute details and making sure her home was furnished with all the finest amenities. I can only offer the highest recommendation for her place and Im so grateful I stayed here as opposed to a hotel."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is THE place to stay in Bismark! A nice quiet escape yet close to lots of things to do. Easy access to downtown for great restaurants and an easy drive to the Lewis snd Clark Interpretive Center and Fort. The townhouse abounds with special touches. We would love to visit again! Thank you Dakotah!
2020-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This place was super clean, central to a lot of standard suburban businesses (Walmart, Olive Garden, etc). The garden and deck are AWESOME spaces, super cute and lovely. The decor inside is...interesting, and maybe not everyone's style, but charming in a sense (peacocks are beautiful creatures!). Thanks for a lovely stay."
