2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time at Jay’s house in Pittsfield. It was the perfect setting for our family, ages 4 months to 82! The house is spacious and well designed to accommodate a family gathering. Plenty of bedrooms and bathrooms for all of us. The pool was a focal point of our activities and we also enjoyed using the kayaks on the beautiful lake. The kitchen was well stocked and had plenty of space for our supplies. Jay is a wonderful host and he and the property manager Stephanie were responsive to our needs. All and all, a wonderful way to spend Memorial Day weekend."

2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"One of the nicest airbnb I’ve stayed in. It was true to its’ description. The house was spotless and well organized. Everything that was needed was provided. We especially enjoyed the views of the lake, along with all the equipment provided for lake fun. Jay and Stephanie communicated quickly and clearly. Everything was well maintained and cared for. Great location for a piece of serenity.
Our only regret was that we booked too short a stay. Definitely hoping to be back again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and house. Beds are super comfy and pretty much everything you need for a comfortable and enjoyable stay. Would love to experience it in warmer and sunnier weather in the future to get the full experience on the lake!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Jay we have a good time at your house everything was nice and clean I love everything about it no complain
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house has a very calm, spacious feel with the welcoming feel of home. It is layed out to accommodate an entire family in one bedroom for those who have small kids who prefer to sleep close to their oarents. We all experienced good quality sleep. The view of the lake is up front and beautiful. It's clear that the home is well maintained and the owners were very gracious and accommodating.
The location is central, with bowling and a great kids play space a short drive away. It's a only a half hour drive to The Clark and Mass Moca and equally convenient drives to the Lee Outlets, farm-to-table dining in Great Barrington, and other key Berkshires attractions.
We would stay there again in a heartbeat!"

The house was perfect for all spending time together in the huge great room, being able to look out on the beautiful lake. We loved swimming in the pool, lounging on the deck, building a fire down by the lake , and taking the kayaks out on the beautiful lake. Check in was super easy and the house was immaculately clean.

The location is unbeatable if you’re looking for a place to relax on the lake, and Jay and team made it so easy to checkin/checkout, gave us a ton of recommendations.

We chose to stay at Jay’s Berkshire Lake House this year and couldn’t have been happier. The home absolutely exceeded our expectations. Plenty of parking, an open, spacious layout with plenty of natural light and gorgeous views. The home is newly renovated. The bedrooms & bathrooms are beautiful; the kitchen has great storage & counter space. Everything was spot less & with extremely comfortable furniture & beds. The dining room table was a great size for our family meals & game nights. We spent most of our days on the huge back deck overlooking the lake & beautiful mountains. We loved the pool; swam, fished & kayaked in the lake & enjoyed several evenings around the fire pit. Jay & the property manager were extremely responsive & helpful. All family members agree this was one of our best vacation homes ever."

The chickens were so funny to watch, and every so often we would see their lovely dogs! We played fetch with their corgi who is adorable. Definitely the perfect stay for animal lovers. The farm stand has eggs, and still had some produce at the end of October. We picked up some potatoes, peppers and hot peppers, acorn squash, an onion, and butternut squash!
Carla provided excellent recommendations (HAVE to get Betty’s pizza).
The room was nice and clean, and themed for the fall. Lil snacks and coffee provided! Roku TV, surprisingly good internet. We would love to come back someday!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We would stay there again because I loved listening to the chickens, who were not loud at all, after a day out running around It was relaxing and that is exactly what I was looking for.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a beautiful little studio amidst a working farm, with goats, horses, dogs, fresh fruits and vegetables, and a quiet country setting. The kitchen is well equipped and the location is close to Pittsfield, but decidedly rural in character. If you have a dog, or anyone similarly curious but incautious, beware of the electric fence around the pasture!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Terrific Airbnb with full amenities on a wonderful farm setting….the studio is in a fully converted barn (hostess lives downstairs) with a nice contemporary renovation. The studio is really well thought out and well supplied. It has a little kitchenette (with a full refrigerator not mini frig and little stove, not just microwave) that is supplied enough to cook a meal. It is truly a little apartment with a nice patio door and deck looking over the small farm and animals (chickens and horses) and beautiful views of the mountains. As rural as it is, you’re only minutes away from Bousquet ski and sports center, and the Pittsfield/Lenox area of shops including Guido’s, my favorite fresh food market."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Location: Very convenient to Pittsfield, Lenox and BNRC hiking trails. All within a 5 to 15 minute drive.
Property: They sell eggs and produce on-site. The plums were delicious! The chickens were fun to watch, and they did not disturb or wake us at all. The dogs were incredibly well-behaved.
Studio apartment: Strong WiFi with no issues with connectivity. (Note: we have Verizon and cell service was weak throughout the entire Berkshires.) The apartment was tastefully decorated, very clean, and Carla provided clear directions via the Airbnb app and within the apartment.
We had a cozy, quiet stay, and would recommend this place for couples."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carla’s place was absolutely lovely. It was spotless, so clean and comfortable. There was everything you needed to make a meal.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect place to stay. Easy to get, too. The owner, Carla, was great to communicate with and quick to respond back. Pleasant surroundings. Beautiful decor and very super clean. Everything was well prepared, and we couldn't ask for a better setup. It was great waking up to the beautiful scenery around the farm. A plus was the framstand. Thanks for holding 2 dozen fresh eggs for us, and the fresh flowers were perfect."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I absolutely loved staying here on Bittersweet Farms - a beautifully furnished and decorated studio in a beautiful surrounding on a working farm with a view of the mountains and water. The horses and goats in the pasture made it look like a postcard. Close to shopping and supermarkets and lots of hiking and Tanglewood. We went on some great hikes and saw Jackson Browne at Tanglewood right down the street. We will come back for sure!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved being on a farm. Used the AC fan to block out the early morning roosters. Seems newly remodeled. Although the only sink was in the bathroom it was designed for dishwashing. So me problem.

Carla’s farm stand provides eggs, fresh fruits and vegetables. Also great homemade muffins!
Light sleepers take note that the cocks crow everyday, yes, rain or shine, at 4:15am to start the day!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I visited the area with our baby and dog. The studio worked really well for our two night stay. It was very clean and had a very well stocked kitchenette. Carla and others at the farm were very friendly and gave us lots of helpful info about where we could walk our dog on the farm property and lots of recommendations about hikes and outdoor activities to do nearby. The studio deck looked out on beautiful area mountains, the chicken coop, stables, and farm fields. The veggies and baked goods at the farm stand were delicious too!

We will definitely stay here again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carla’s place was the perfect, quiet retreat I was looking for. Close to downtown and lots of other things, but far enough away to be completely serene, and with a gorgeous view of the mountains!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Carla’s. A calm, secluded place for a retreat: you can take in the sights from the second floor studio, including beautiful scenery and fun, friendly farm animals. It’s a really lovely, clean, peaceful place that is close to local attractions, hiking, and dining. We will definitely return."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carla’s upstairs suite was super clean, comfortable, cozy and well-equipped. We had everything we needed and more."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Frolicking goats, horses flicking their manes and tails at insects real or imagined; chickens pecking the grass in search of tasty morsels. Farm fresh eggs for sale. Quiet. Blessed quiet! We enjoyed every moment of our time here and in meeting friendly Carla and Bonnie as well as their 4 legged companions, Mazey and Trooper. The home was the cleanest Airbnb I have ever visited. Comfort and coziness was the main theme here with beautiful paintings and words of wisdom and welcome throughout. Carla clearly has a gift for decorating and making people feel comfortable.
Thank you, Carla for our wonderful time there. It was a pleasure to meet you and Bonnie and all of your animals. We wish you all the best and may God bless you all."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"this place was cute, charming, comfortable and exactly as described! it was the perfect little getaway for two people, and it was private and quiet. thank you for letting us stay here this weekend!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sweet little place with everything you need, very clean and comfy. I loved looking down on the farm field and chickens coop. Very quiet country area but close to everything you need. The river is right on the property too, very scenic. Lots of land to walk your dog if you bring one!
Karla and Tanya have two very sweet dogs too. Highly recommend!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved Carlas place, it was super clean, very comfortable for us, nice bed and linens, 2 comfortable recliners, lots of closet space, excellent bathroom with tall ceilings and loads of natural light.....super efficient lay out. Gorgeous view of pond and nature. Very friendly and communicative hosts."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Carla's place was a dream. Staying here brought me and my partner solace and allowed us to rest while we were recovering from a traumatic experience and couldn't be in our home. The farm is beautiful, even moreso than the pictures portray. The river brought calm energy along with the wide open sky. The hosts were responsive and incredibly kind. The studio itself was very comfortable: bed, two recliners all very cozy and we also loved the large bathroom. The kitchen is cute but not as cute as the dogs we saw playing in the snow! My only wish is that the sink were larger since there is only one. Overall, everything was so thoughtfully put together that we couldn't help but feel at home during our stay. Thank you all so much!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Stayed here while working in the area. Will do so again. Very sweet place.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Can’t say enough wonderful things about Carla’s studio! I needed a spot close to Kripalu during a weekend program- her place was easy to find(even in the dark) and had everything possible to make me comfortable. Very clean, lovely, and ease of entry made my arrival stress free. Very quiet and peaceful; my only disappointment was not getting to see the animals as it’s the middle of Winter but I would certainly go back."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Traveling for work. Perfect location to get a feel for the area.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great, clean space with amazing views of the farm!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Place is super cute and comfy! We loved the clever design of the suite complete with small/function kitchen and the fun fall decor.
Everything was immaculately clean and modern; thermostat in room to manage temps;
The view from the deck was spectacular in the morning with the sun coming over the mountains and watching the horses morning routine.
This was a real working farm — so we had the best fresh eggs and paired them with a freshly roasted, white acorn squash. A perfect fall weekend in a perfect farm nest!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect, in every way"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were so impressed with our stay. The reviews are spot on - and the animals and Carla’s famous muffins are icing on the cake! It is super clean yet still cozy. The sweeping views of the country are especially beautiful this time of year and the heat worked great - a necessity for a Florida girl leaf peepin’ in the Fall in New England! Every detail has been accounted for and we wish we could’ve stayed longer!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a lovely stay. Carla made sure there were little homey touches throughout the apartment. The baked goods she left were incredible. It was also great to be able to bring our dog and so nice that food and water bowls and a baby gate for the deck were provided. The location is ideal for many hikes in the area. Highly recommend!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Carla and her sister Tonya were so lovely!!!! We had a wonderful time staying at the studio. It was clean, well stocked with things you may need for cooking—and I appreciated the bathroom necessities since I forgot my shampoo lol! The studio is located near a lot of Berkshire activities and getting anywhere was very easy and a beautiful drive. Her guidebook was also very handy—plenty of fun things to do and great places to eat/drink on there!! We absolutely enjoyed our stay!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have been to many of AIRBNB's but this was by far the nicest place ever. Clean,Awesome view, and Great hosts!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The suite is excellent epuipped, you can cook and stay for two weeks without issues. The farm offes various vegetables and eggs. Location is very close to Hancock Shaker Village and not far away from downtown Pittsfield. Carla and Tonya are very kind and helpfull hosts."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,A beautiful and relaxing escape. Pictures don’t do it justice - even more beautiful in person!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We really enjoyed our stay. The place is quiet and cozy. The snacks and baked goods are a nice touch and so delicious. Nice spot for us to unwind after a long drive.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic space, clean and spacious. The farm is lovely and the vegetables were great for a farm to table dinner. Nearby hikes were great with the mahanna cobble. We also climbed Mt. Greylock which was about a 45 minute drive. The hosts, Carla and Tonya, were around and working on the farm and were very welcoming. Great stay!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect condo with great hosts. Well stoked with everything we needed for out little getaway. Wish we could have stayed longer. Carla and her sister were great host. PS don't pass on the baked goods at their produce stand. The Banana Chocolate Chip Muffin was amazing!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay, everything was great. Accommodation was wonderful. We never wanted for anything that was suppose to be there and the amenities were more than adequate. The hostess and was super friendly, and always checking to make sure that our needs were being met. Would recommend the facilities to anyone.
Charlie and Lisa"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The ladies there were great! What a peaceful place and wonderful property. Loved petting the horses and the dogs were real sweet!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is truly a special spot! We were the first AirBNB guests to stay here and it was just perfect. The first morning we woke up to mist rising over the small lake, hills in the background and horses running in the field. It set the tone for a wonderful and relaxing weekend. The farm itself is beautiful--there's a walking path around the farm where you can see chickens, goats, fields full of corn, flowers, squash and other vegetables. Carla and her sister also operate a farm stand and we made sure to do our veggie shopping for the week before we left, picked up a dozen eggs and also a few of Carla's homemade treats (if you're lucky, she may have freshly baked muffins for sale at the farmstand on weekend mornings!)
The space itself is clean and bright--we immediately felt at home. It has everything that you need, a full kitchen setup, the TV has Roku and there's a small outdoor porch for enjoying the view. It is well located with easy access to Pittsfield, Lenox and North Adams. We explored around Mt. Greylock, MASS MoCA and Pittsfield State Forest and it was a great home base. Carla and her sister Tonya were excellent hosts--easy and quick to communicate with and we enjoyed meeting them around the farm along with their dogs, Buddy and Maisie. We definitely hope to come back for another visit and would highly recommend it!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home with an incredible view! Kitchen was well stocked. Our host was proactive with communication and responded quickly to messages sent. Great find!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful winter stay at this lovely lakeside home. The hosts made us feel very welcome, gave clear directions on finding the home and were quick to respond to any questions that we had. It was so nice to come back and relax by the fireplace overlooking the lake after a day of skiing at nearby Jiminy Peak. The views from the great room were beautiful and it was neat to watch people ice fishing on the lake. We also visited MASSMoCA which is one of the many nearby attractions. We would love to come back again in the summer!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family stayed here just after Christmas to visit family. I grew up in Cheshire and Pittsfield and have family in Pittsfield, Dalton, and Lenox. This place is right in the middle of most of the other towns. 15-20 minutes to get anywhere. Walkable to Dunkin Donuts. :) Oh and Lanesborough pizza(My favorite)
We chose Joseph's place not only for prime location, but sitting in the great room drinking coffee as the sun comes up was the most relaxing part of the trip.
There is steep stairs to the property and to get to the bathroom and bedrooms doesn't make it idea for anyone who struggles with stairs. Our 4 year old did fine, but I wouldn't recommend it for any kids younger than that.
Joseph's place is full stocked, there isn't anything we didn't have there. If you are looking for a lake house to unwind, this is it! We loved it!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a wonderful stay! Highly recommended.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay at the lake house! It was perfect for our small family and had everything we needed to feel right at home!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Joseph and Jess's place on the lake is a perfect weekend getaway! The house was extremely clean and the personal touches were much appreciated! They have made a great effort to make the place feel like home with all essentials provided. We had a great time!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Joe and Jess went above and beyond to prepare for our first vacation as a family. I really appreciated how communicative, helpful, and accommodating they were. The house was very clean and the view of the lake from the deck, yard, and great room is beautiful!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great week at this location. The house is wonderful and had all the necessities and then some. Loved the view of the lake and spent most of my days working in the great room while enjoying the excellent view. The main drawback is that there is a main road right next to the house, which really takes away from the serenity of the location, but if you keep the windows closed, it's less noisy. The hosts were excellent, proactively communicating, checking in, and responding quickly to questions. Overall, a nice to place to relax for a few days."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Joe and Jess’ house is lovely and the view of the lake is beautiful. A few friends and I spent a long weekend in the home and were so sad to leave. It had everything we needed and Joe and Jess went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable. We will definitely come back!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Joe & Jess were amazing right from the first time I contacted them about their home. They were extremely patient with some of my pre booking issues! I am so glad we were able to work out some dates for my trip. The house was beautiful and Joe made sure we had everything we needed from start to finish! Thank you so much for sharing your home!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great getaway with lovely views and amenities
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Can't say enough about this beautiful place. It's even more peaceful than the pictures look. We felt right at home. Joe & Jess could not have been nicer and were so responsive throughout the check in process. They leave you with everything you need and then some! Can't wait to come back to this house and sit on this porch at night again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joe and Jess were great hosts and made sure we had everything we needed. Not only checked in when we arrived but also during our stay to see if there was anything we needed! Great place and waking up to the view of the lake was very relaxing, even if the weather didn’t communicate. Would recommend to others and stay with them again!
Thank you for sharing your home!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and would definitely stay here again. Absolutely relaxing and felt better than a resort.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We are having our home remolded and Joe was extremely flexible and made sure that we had every thing we needed. Didn’t need to take anything but toiletries and groceries. We will recommend this house to friends who have guests come to town that need a cozy place to stay. Balcony overlooking the lake is wonderful! Thanks Joe! and Jess
Pat and Laurel Carsell"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just as described. Beautiful, quiet, short drive from NYC. Close to ski and -restful. Fireplace overlooking the water was great. Thanks for having us :)"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Joe and Jess were great hosts and their place was great. We loved the views of the lake and watching the ice fishing.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow- Joseph’s place was awesome! It was very conveniently located with quick access to everything we wanted to do. The views were amazing!! It was so relaxing to wake up and have a warm cup of coffee on the front porch, breath in the crisp fall air, and look out over the lake. The place was very clean, well stocked with necessities-paper towels, plates, soap, toiletries, etc.- we wanted for nothing the whole week!! Joseph and Jess were very communicative and gave us their direct numbers in case we had questions or needed recommendations. It was if we were staying with friends or family! Check in and check out we’re easy and simple!! We’ll definitely stay again if we come back!! You won’t regret staying here!
The only thing I would consider for future guests is the fact that the stairs are a bit steep. It wasn’t an issue for us at all but I could see how if you have mobility issues, this could be difficult!!
Thanks Joe & Jess!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The home is lovely and the views are beautiful! Joe and Jess are superb hosts with great communication and attention to detail.

2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"Joseph was a phenomenal host. We absolutely loved the house, it was so charming and clean and had beautiful views. Was really close to everything we needed. Would a solidly stay there again."
2022-08-01,4,Stayed about a week,"This is a spacious partly renovated house. It does have breathtaking views , but the noisy highway between it and the lake moderates the serenity one might hope for in such a setting. Joe is a great host."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This home is absolutely beautiful. The sun room overlooking the lake is beyond your dreams. We spent time hanging in this room viewing sunrises, sunsets, and eagles over the lake. The house is a central location to many fabulous activities. We biked on the Ashuwillticook Rail Trail, went to Mass MoCA, Tanglewood, and Jacob's Pillow, ate at fabulous restaurants, rented a pontoon boat, and had an amazing week. The hosts were attentive and responsive while also respecting your privacy. This was our best Airbnb experience yet."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Great central location, no more than a 30 minute drive from anything you’d want to do in the Berkshires. Beautiful view of the lake and surrounding hills from the deck and great room, where we spent a lot of time. Great Wi-Fi and streaming to TVs in the kitchen, living room and great room. Joe and Jess were really attentive and thoughtful hosts."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place, would stay again"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We had an amazing week here! You should book this fabulous house with great hosts immediately! This lake house has it all! The view is beautiful and the house is immaculate. It is tastefully decorated, has a large kitchen with upgraded appliances and is fully stocked with all the cookware you will need. There are two decks, one overlooking the lake with table and chairs to eat at, the other with a fire pit and furniture to sit on. A large gas grill is also provided. Both bedrooms are of good size and have pretty furniture. The living room and sitting room / sun room overlooking the lake are comfortably furnished and each have a large tv mounted on the wall. The location offers the best of both worlds as you are able to experience some of nature’s beauty, but are also close to town, restaurants, and things to do in general. Joe and Jess are wonderful hosts and extremely responsive. They offered suggestions both before and during our stay and checked to see if we needed anything. It is clear that this lake house is lovingly maintained and that Joe and Jess care about their guests. Overall the house is comfortable, cozy, well maintained, has everything you need and has been the best Airbnb we have stayed at. We can’t wait to go back to the Berkshires and hope to stay with Joe and Jess!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great home! The hosts were extremely responsive, the house was clean and bright and well-stocked, and the view was incredible! We had a wonderful weekend and give this place a 10/10. If you have a chance to stay here, jump on it. You won’t be disappointed"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect cozy cabin on the beautiful Poontusuc lake located centrally in the amazing and breathtaking Berkshires. Beckie was a wonderful host and we thoroughly enjoyed the lakeside cabin, with a mix of rustic lake decor but with the modern essentials! A perfect getaway! Thank you, Beckie! Ps. An added plus was check out which did not include a long list of items while you are trying to pack lol!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Had everything we needed and such a beautiful setting.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was adorable! Very clean! Beckie had a basket of snacks and water for us which was great. Cottage is close to the road and other houses so not very private but centrally located to hiking, winery, breweries and restaurants. Spent our days outdoors exploring the Berkshires and had a comfy cottage to relax in at night. Thanks Beckie!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The ""Nest"" is beautiful inside and out, and super cute to boot! Mary is a great host with quick communication and thoughtful touches like putting out a crib and some toys for our baby. Thanks so much and we'll be back if we're in Pittsfield again!"

We definitely got a memorable first Berkshire experience with thanks to Mary and this home. We will definitely be back!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,All around amazing! Would reccomend
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Strongly recommend staying here! Exactly as pictured and very cozy and comfortable for two people. There were a lot of little details where you could tell the hosts went above and beyond to accommodate (like a tray full of snacks, and motion activated lights on the stairs for when you need to go downstairs to use the bathroom in the middle of the night). Also a nice little deck and other outdoor spaces to hang out if the weather is good. Pittsfield is less than 10 mins away by car, and it’s a good location to explore other nearby towns too."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow, I can't say enough about this Airbnb host and the space. I am a superhost myself and I was super impressed. The place is spotless, comfortable and without clutter. Mary has thought of everything when it comes to providing what might be needed for the stay, and the place was beautifully decorated. I forgot my toothbrush and toothpaste....... it was provided. There was coffee and tea, snacks, shampoo and conditioner. The bed was super comfortable. The surroundings peaceful and idyllic. Mary is a kind, warm and friendly host.
Hosts like this make Airbnb such a rewarding experience."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was such a great little space. Loved sitting on the balcony and relaxing after a week of road-tripping. Cozy and clean, convenient location to all the things we wanted to do, yet far enough away that you felt like you were away from it all. We enjoyed visits to Stockbridge and Naumkeag. Glad we found this little gem and would have loved to have stayed longer."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had a wonderful time at The Nest! it's a nice open 2 floor space with cute furniture and lots of beautiful plants around the space.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stop at Mary's was amazing. A magical moment of serenity, calm and a breath of nature in this new accommodation, very clean & very well equipped. The setting is incredibly beautiful, it's quiet, and nature is lush. Mary is a hostess of fantastic kindness. She touched us with her many touches (preparing the specific accommodation for our stay with our two-year-old boy, snacks, etc.), with his impeccable communication and sincere moments of sharing. We slept well in extremely comfortable bedding. Anyway, don't hesitate, you'll remember your stay at Le N 'est at Mary's:)"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect airbnb. Perfect blend of a cozy home with accommodation amenities. Feels very natural, and Mary has every bit of the stay thought out and covered (motion lights on the stairs, toiletries, snacks and drinks). Quick drive to the best of what Pittsfield, Lennox, and lee have to offer while situated next to farmland. Can't recommend enough!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Mary's guest cottage was lovely- quiet, and thoughtfully appointed for anything you'd need for a short stay in the Berkshires. Lots of pleasant touches and Mary was an extremely accomodating and communicative host."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful setting like being in the woods without actually being there. Grrrrr8 deck off main living area on second floor facing west overlooking Mary's yard and garden with bullfrogs singing in a bog on the properties edge. First floor kitchen and bathroom both nicely stocked. Easy access to Pittsfield and roads in all directions; N,S,E,W."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"Adorable little 'nest'....extremely clean and furnished beautifully. Snacks were a nice touch! Beautiful surroundings.

Thanks, Mary, for your hospitality!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,What a great find! Close to Tanglewood and just a great get away on its own. Mary has thought of all the small details that make a difference. We were so happy to spend a night this time and hope to make it longer when we come next time!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Mary's place was very cozy and comfortable. The Nest was extremely clean. We would highly recommend it!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful unit which looks relatively new on Airbnb. It's very private, on a quiet road, then down a driveway and to the back. Its most unique feature in the 12 legged greeting party - 3 of the cutest little dogs kept in a fenced-in backyard that ""greet"" visitors and ""say goodbye"" anytime there's movement in the driveway area. The unit itself is on 2 levels. Downstairs/main floor is the kitchen and bathroom. Upstairs is the bedroom/living area with a small deck. There's also a large above-ground pool with 2 deck chairs to chill out. Everything is in nice condition and well thought-out. A basket of cookies/chips/popcorn is a really nice touch. I highly recommend!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Welcoming environment, clean, charming and quiet.
Mary was a great hostess and helpful.
I hope to be back soon."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful modern and very clean private location. We were super impressed with such hospitality. From the snack left for guests to the balcony late at night where you can hear the frogs singing away. We truly enjoyed the comfortable bed and slept like babies. Wish it was summer and the pool was open. AC worked great though. We definitely will be back!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Really lovely space and a great jumping off point for the Berkshires. I wouldn’t hesitate to return for a longer visit to work/wrote/etc. Robert was helpful and runs a very cool antiques shop at the ground level. Recommended!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful 2 night stay
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great stay at Robert’s! The place was so beautiful and he was so accommodating.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was an adorable and lovely place to stay. I was there on business and this place was perfect. I loved how convenient it was to local places but in a quiet neighborhood. I would go back in a heart beat!

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved the apartment, the only draw back was didn't have control of the temperature.

The location was very convenient to many hikes and to Lenox where we enjoyed some lovely restaurants. The apartment was super clean, well appointed and stylish."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is just as nice as its pictures! Lovely sunny apartment, quiet street, nice finishings and everything impeccably clean. Close to Bousquet Mountain ski resort and downtown Pittsfield. We would definitely stay here again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Robert was a great host. Very nice, attentive, easy to communicate. The apartment was missing some cooking seasonings when we first got there and Robert brought everything we asked for right away. Really appreciate it! The place was nice, clean, big enough for four of us. Wish there was a dining table but the counter and stools were very comfortable to sit and eat. TV and couch set up was really great that we could relax together after a day of skiing.
Overall, we had a great stay and would definitely come back again.
Thank you Robert!"

Clean and comfortable!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Robert was a great host from beginning to end. He was always proactive in his communications so we have the right information before, during and after our stay. The apartment itself was extremely clean and well-maintained so we knew we had everything we needed for our weekend ski trip. Truth be told, this was not the first time we stayed at this location but it was the first time with Robert as host and we will not hesitate for a moment to book it again when we visit Pittsfield."

Highly recommend while staying in this area of the Berkshires.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Robert’s place. Stylish and spacious apartment with comfortable beds, a full kitchen and everything you need. Robert couldn’t have been kinder or more helpful. The weather outside was cold and rainy, and curling up on the couch in front of the fire was just lovely!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Robert’s apartment in Pittsfield was even better than the photos - beautifully appointed, great natural light, and modern amenities throughout including a dishwasher, in-unit washer/dryer, and A/C unit. Robert gave us all the info we needed prior to check-in. Would absolutely recommend staying here!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was a great landing pad for enjoying Tanglewood and the surrounding areas. Comfortable for two couples!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Robert’s place in Pittsfield was a very good base from which to explore the Berkshires. Lenox, Tanglewood, Stockbridge and Mount Greylock are all within about 20 minutes drive. The unit is exactly as depicted - spacious, sunny and with very functional and cleverly designed kitchen and bathroom. The beds were quite comfortable - just firm enough for us. It is also among the best equipped Airbnb’s we have ever seen, with not only a complete set of pots, pans and kitchen utensils but also the little things: spices, coffee and filters, cooking spray, and even a range of toiletries, which we didn’t need but could come in quite handy. Airbnb hosts would do well to follow his example with those small extras!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Had a very pleasant stay!
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"The apartment itself was very nice although there was limited seating in the living room. This might make it less comfortable for a longer stay. However, the back stairs are very steep and there was a strong odor of cigarette smoke in the hallway that seeped into the apartment a little bit. As stated, the area immediately surrounding the apartment felt a little isolated and somewhat depressed. Robert was very responsive which is always appreciated."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really, an outstanding place to stay! We would definitely do so again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This is one of the best stays on the site. Robert is a responsive and very personable host that answers all your questions and makes you feel at home. It was the perfect spot in the Berkshires as I attended an event nearby. I'll definitely be back!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were passing through Pittsfield and only had one night, but wish we could have stayed longer! Robert’s place is just lovely—beautifully designed and an oasis of calm. Every detail has been carefully considered for the comfort of his guests. The apartment is within walking distance of the town shops & cafes, and Robert was kind enough to give us perfect recommendations for other nearby places. His communication was excellent and he was an amazing host. We’ll definitely be back, highly recommended!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Love this Airbnb...this is our second time staying here. The location is great and the apartment is awesome. The beds are super comfy, great kitchen/bath and it was squeaky clean. Not to mention a reserved parking space. The host (Robert) is very responsive and always available if you need anything. We crossed paths with Robert a few times and he was very friendly and helpful. This place will not disappoint! We will always stay here when visiting the area (if its not booked up)!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very nicely decorated place with room to stretch out. We didn't really cook much, but the coffee was welcome and the materials are there if you want to prepare your own meals. We visited during a really hot and humid weekend, and the window AC units were enough to keep things cool and comfy. Robert was very easy helpful and easy to communicate with. (The neighbor was friendly, as well.) The location also made it easy to zip to Tanglewood or the lake or to Mt. Greylock, or just downtown to visit restaurants."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very convenient
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Robert's place was everything described on the listing and more. It was pristine. We met our daughter who is hiking the AT and she was able to do her laundry and shower.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We couldn't be more pleased with our stay. Robert is a wonderful host in every way. The place is impeccable, super comfy and all around lovely! Close to great places to eat and shop in down town Pittsfield. My sister and I came in for a show at Tanglewood. Coming down from this location brought us in right at the parking lot in about 15 minutes. We missed all the traffic to and from! We will absolutely be coming back!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Robert’s place was perfect for our trip to the Berkshires to hike and bike. Perfect location to walk to downtown Pittsfield for dinner. The apartment had everything we needed and more. Robert was a great communicator without being overbearing. We loved our stay and hope to be back!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Robert's place was well-appointed and central to Pittsfield amenities. We had a very easy check-in and found most everything we needed there. The beds were both comfortable and Robert was communicative about everything during our stay.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We were in town to meet our daughter’s fiancé’s family before their wedding this summer….Robert’s place was extremely comfortable and clean. He was also very accommodating by letting us check out a little bit later than planned. Highly recommend it!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Robert was an absolutely excellent host! His listing was amazing and just as pictured, if not better. He even provided a bottle of wine and chocolate for our stay! He met us at the location and helped us with the check-in and discussed different recommendations for us to go at night. The surroundings are beautiful with the river right next to us and everything was very quiet. If we ever come here again we won’t stay anywhere else.
Hannah"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The apartment was great. It was clean, cozy and very well decorated. It was truly the ideal spot for my girlfriend and I to get out of Boston for a weekend and explore all that the Berkshires had to offer. It was also perfectly located near the downtown Pittsfield restaurants.
Robert, the host, was awesome as well. He was friendly, responsive and provided clear/easy directions to check in and out. He also gave us some great local recommendations.
If we’re ever in the area again, I would 100% stay there again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Teresa was a great host. Her place is clean and the view was amazing. Great location.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Comfortable beds! Great view! Central location to the Berkshires!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Theresa’s place! It was beyond our expectations!
The apartment was very clean and comfortable.
We were 4 people staying for the weekend and we felt that there was a lot of space to move around and not be on top of each other.
The furniture and beds were VERY comfortable! We wish we could have stayed longer!
The day of check in Theresa was very proactive with communicating to ensure we would arrive and get into the apartment with no issues.
When we arrived the host met us to say hello and recommend some places to eat.
There are many restaurants and stores close by.
During our stay Theresa was very communicative and responsive when I had questions.
She even texted me during the weekend and checked in to make sure all was well.
We highly recommend Theresa’s place."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay while in the Berkshires. Will stay there again and again! Great host!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Teresa's place was very nice and affordable. Made me feel like at home.

Jimney peak mountain just 13 min away."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Teresa was a great host very proactive and helpful with very clear instructions. Her place was super clean, cozy, and warm. Location is great- 10 min to downtown Pittsfield and if we had gone to Mt. Greylock almost as close to there too. Great jumping off point for the Berkshires region. Beds were super clean and comfortable! Would definitely stay again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place is spacious and well equipted. Teresa is a very kind host!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay. Our goal for the weekend was to hang out and make memories as a family and that’s what we did. Very comfortable!!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. Would stay again! Host was wonderful and extremely responsive! Place was clean and comfortable.
(The apartment is underneath another living space just FYI so you may hear footsteps and such-but it wasn’t too loud! Just was not aware of that initially, but we still loved the place)"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"“ The Sweet Place” is exactly that! Teresa was a wonderful host who provided many unexpected items such as coffee pods, creamer and bottles of water! We arrived late so having these items was very helpful! In addition, the apartment was exceptionally clean and very comfortable! I would highly recommend “ The Sweet Place” for anyone visiting the beautiful Berkshires!"
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely little apartment, a perfect place to lay your head at the end of an adventure-filled day exploring the Berkshires. Only two things someone should know before arrival—there is only coffee pods, water, and a bar of soap. I always assume there will be shampoo and some snacks at airbnb’s so was a little unprepared, but no problem because there’s a target about 10 minutes away. Also it is on a very busy street so backing into the little parking space you get is a bit precarious, but backing out onto the busy street would be even worse if you’re not used to it. That said, as long as you know those two things, and go prepared, you will be stunned by the gorgeous views of the lake, and will love being a short walk from a lovely public park right on the lake."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cozy, clean and spacious, this space was perfect for our family of four. Located nicely between North Adams (Mass MOCA) and Stockbridge, this cottage has a great view of the lake. Teresa is a lovely host and the accommodations are well-appointed. We would definitely stay again!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If this cute place is available - commit to it! really nice stay at a well decorated, clean & cozy place. Teresa met me Fri to walk me thru a few things - remotes, fireplace, washer/dryer, ect. I travelled to Adams, Lenox, Stockbridge and Pittsfied to tour museums & see the downtowns. Very easy to get around from this location. Nice view of lake across street too. really enjoyed my stay here."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This Airbnb is terrific. It has everything you need. Theresa thought of everything down to the extra large coffee mugs. It has a Really comfortable king size bed.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Sweet Place is a 10/10. Clean, cozy, charming, and a great location. Teresa was so caring and hospitable to me and my toddler. We had a great time and we will be back!"

We enjoyed exploring the area by day and relaxing by night!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay. The place is spotless - not just clean but super clean. It's a very pleasant little apartment: fresh, bright furnishings, comfortable beds, cozy sitting area (TV, Wi-Fi), tidy kitchen with coffee etc. Teresa is a lovely person, very concerned with your comfort, very responsive and welcoming. The house is right across the street from Pontoosuc Lake - we were there in the middle of winter and could only enjoy the pretty view but in summer there's immediate access to swimming, boating, walking.

It rained quite a bit during our visit, so instead of mud-hiking one day I walked the Ashuwillticook Rail Trail nearby...beautiful paved trail! Teresa was a perfect host.

Thank you Zahirul"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,cozy as advertised
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great central location for home base while exploring the area. Easy to walk to anything downtown and having the gas station across the street makes late night ice cream hard to resist. I was able to work remotely at the house during the days w/o any distractions or troubles.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Zahirul was extremely proactive, placing a new space heater in the space just in case, and checking on me after my first night to see how the heat was. Later in my stay he brought by a fan as warmer weather was on the horizon. I would have preferred to have control over the radiators, but Zahirul was very concerned about my comfort.
The kitchen was well-equipped for one of its size, and the hot water in kitchen and bathroom was extremely hot."
2024-03-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"It was a pleasant stay. The host was very responsive, if not for the heating I would have give him all 5 stars.The heating is remote controlled so I felt someone else was determing what should be comfortable. The heater only worked for one night out of 5. I double blanketed and was ok.Though the neighborhood was in an older section of town , it was quite and there was ample parking."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Third time at this house; that should tell you something. The house looked just like the photos. Private and secluded on top of a hill with many trees just past the backyard. Sylvia is very responsive and accommodating to requests.
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Thank you for this Berkshire gem, would stay again!
5/5"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is my second time at the house. It's a great location next to the bike trail. I also like that is situated on top of a hill with many trees at the rear of the house. I saw a woodchuck as well as a deer in the backyard. Sylvia is very responsive to any inquiries. She allowed me to have an early check-in as well as the use of her bicycles.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely time at Sylvia's place! We were four adult friends visiting the area for the Plastic Bag Store show at the Mass MOCA. The accommodations were terrific for our trip. Everything in the house was as described and it was well-appointed. We enjoyed the woodland setting and enjoyed the fresh air and privacy on the spacious back deck. The mid-century modern furniture and decor were beautifully curated and very comfortable. Sylvia gave us some helpful pointers about grocery stores, farm stands and walking trails in the area -- all greatly appreciated. I'd love to bring my family next time!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"￼ Sylvia‘s is a sprawling home with mid century modern decor. It was exceptionally clean, compared to other Airbnb homes we have stayed at. furniture was new. It’s a fantastic location in the middle of the Berkshire’s natural woodland but not too far from restaurants, Jiminy Peak ski resort and shopping. We have a large family and prefer to prepare our own meals, so having target five minutes away, as well as Stop & Shop, made it very easy to grab beverages, snacks and dinner on the way home from the mountain. ￼ the kitchen had everything needed. Utensils, cookware, cutlery and pantry with dry goods make it turnkey so we only needed fresh produce, meat and dairy. We’ve already recommended Sylvia’s home to friends and will continue to do so."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I’ve stayed at Sylvia’s house twice. It’s a beautiful home and setting. Cozy and comfortable while close to skiing and restaurants. A gem in the woods.

This is one of the best stays I’ve had! Thanks Tom and Sylvia for sharing your home with us."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful and relaxing place to stay. Sylvia was a very responsive host with clear guidance and instructions. Would recommend to friends and stay here again in the future!

Sylvia's house is a dream. Everything is spotless, beautifully decorated, and equipped with all the essentials. They've considered every little detail. The beds are incredibly comfortable, and the living room is exquisite. We had the pleasure of enjoying the fireplace, and they even have a fire pit that added to our experience. The location is a great base for exploring the Berkshires, with the rail bike route conveniently nearby. We were genuinely sad to leave, and we would love to come back."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If I could give 6 stars I would! Sylvia's home is exquisite. The decor is simple but sophisticated and the space is beautifully designed to offer multiple options for gathering as a group or tucking into a corner (or a swing) by yourself with a book. The outdoor space is peaceful and private and access to the rail trail a short walk or bike ride away is an outstanding feature. Sylvia has provisioned, organized and labeled everything so the experience is user friendly whether cooking a full meal or making a pot of coffee. I cannot say enough about this wonderful house, book it today!"

2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"We had a wonderful reunion with old friends at Sylvia's immaculate peaceful refuge.
It was the perfect setting for accessing Berkshire favorites, Tanglewood and Jacobs's Pillow.

Probably our Favorite Air B&B to date (and we have been to many). 5 plus stars!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a lovely weekend at Sylvia's home! The house is beautifully decorated, immaculately clean, and perfectly set up. It looks just like the pictures and everything is exactly where you would expect to find it, and if it's not, there is a little label waiting to tell you exactly where you need to look. They really thought of everything. We are a family of 5 who rent Air BnB's often, and I have to say this has been one of our best experiences to date!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sylvia and Tom's home is truly lovely. The photos and description of amenities posted on the Airbnb website inspired me to select this property. The house is in a nice neighborhood with plenty of privacy. While relaxing on the back deck or in the sunroom you can hear the rushing waters of a stream. Very peaceful setting. The house is furnished in comfortable post-modern style. The kitchen is well-stocked for cooking at home, although there are plenty of restaurants and markets nearby. Would highly recommend Mezze Bistro & Bar. Plenty of spaces inside and outside for 4-6 persons to come together for meals, games or watching television or to enjoy alone time.
Sylvia is an excellent communicator - quick to respond to questions. We felt very welcomed. Would love to return for a longer stay."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time staying at Sylvia’s. The property was a home away from home for us. Secluded, private, mid century modern perfect!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location to explore the Berkshires. Easy access to major roads, but quiet and private. Very responsive and helpful hosts.
The house has a great set up for families. You can all gather/work together in the large kitchen/living/dining area. It also allowed those that needed to study or work to be semi-secluded in the family room or sun room."

The host was incredibly welcoming and responsive, and went above and beyond to make sure I had everything I needed for a comfortable stay. The kitchen was fully equipped with everything I needed to cook my own meals, and the bed was super comfortable.
The location was perfect for exploring the Berkshires. There were plenty of hiking trails and scenic drives nearby, and I also enjoyed exploring the local towns and trying some of the delicious restaurants and cafes.
Overall, I would highly recommend this home to anyone looking for a peaceful and relaxing getaway in the Berkshires. I can't wait to come back!
Best Regards,
Kwesi"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a fantastic stay. The home was beautiful, well laid out, peaceful. Thanks to the proximity to Jiminy, we were able to ski everyday and come home to the perfect winter getaway house. We would love to stay there again during any month of the year."

We had a great winter visit and I would guess that any season would be a good time to visit. The house has an open floor plan, is spacious, warm and welcoming. We had a few spectacular sunsets and sunrises through the pines. There is plenty of room for family meals, watching movies, playing games etc. The beds are comfortable and everyone slept very well during our visit. Also, for day trips we went to MassMoca, worth a visit and then over to Bosquett Ski resort. Of course we had to stop off at Guido's for their amazing cider donuts, incredible snacks and breakfast burritos. What an incredible spot that just feels like home with fantastic and responsive hosts. Thank you!"
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,We had a lovely time staying at this beautiful home. It was very clean and matched the pictures accurately. A peaceful oasis!

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family of 4 (kids 12 and 7), had an amazing stay at Sylvia and Tom's home! The location of the home is off of the main road in very peaceful surroundings. We arrived to fresh fallen snow and the kids immediately took advantage of the great backyard to play in. The house is set up really well, nicely designed, extremely clean and spacious. We skied Jiminy Peak which is less than 20 minutes away from the house and would also highly recommend it. We came home and enjoyed the fireplace and movie watching on their 2 large tv's with lots of streaming services. Overall we had a really great experience and would highly recommend!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We arrived in a big snowstorm, and the house was an unexpectedly warm and welcoming refuge. It was larger than the pictures appear, spotless and with clear labeling of light switches, thermostats, kitchen items, etc. There really was nothing we needed that had not been thought of. Although near Pittsfield, it really is in a forest of pine trees which were spectacular in the snow, more like northern Vermont. Sylvia was always responsive. We were concerned about whether we could get up and down the fairly steep driveway with the snow and ice, but we woke up to find that it had been ploughed for us without asking. Of course we had a pre-conception of what the house would be like from the listing, and it was better than we had hoped. We do not see how anybody could not like it."
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,This house is beautiful. It's located in a quiet neighborhood and surrounded by woods. The interior is spacious and unique with a Scandinavian feel throughout. It is very comfortable and fully equipped. The hosts gave clear instructions for checking in and out and quickly responded to any questions we had.

Very well equipped home with plenty of cookware, coffee, wood for the fireplace, games, etc. Enjoyed walking to the nearby rail trail during some clear patches of weather. An issue came up during the stay, but Sylvia was very communicative and understanding."
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,Clean and lovely home. The Berkshires are so beautiful in the fall!

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Scandi House is a lovely getaway for those looking to enjoy a lovely morning listening to the birds or spend a quiet evening in a relaxing and perfectly appointed home. My husband, our infant daughter, and I had the perfect weekend away. I highly recommend a stay here!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sylvia's home is lovely. The Scandinavian furnishings are beautiful and comfortable. The space was perfect for our stay as two couples. The property is in a lovely neighborhood and has considerable privacy. The backyard is serene. The rail trail a few minutes from the house afforded very accessible and scenic biking.
Sylvia was a superb host and very prompt and responsive with our communications."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful house, great location. Very quite with a lovely deck."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Scandi House is a perfect retreat in central Berkshires. The home is very comfortable, with a wonderful kitchen and four season room. Restful sleep on very comfortable beds. A highlight was the functioning record player. We enjoyed the quiet surroundings and watching deer in the backyard. So close to everything, yet you are surrounded by nature. Very easy travel to the south and north regions. The location is perfect to all the area destinations."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,The Scandi House is absolutely gorgeous and an amazing place to stay - such a beautiful setting and impeccably decorated. I only wish we could have been there longer.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My husband, 4 year old daughter and I just had a lovely visit here for our anniversary. The home was beautiful, clean and in a great location. The large windows and the gorgeous screened patio make you feel like you’re always outside in your own private wooded oasis! It was so close to everything including Mt Greylock for hiking (loved using the available book and maps in the house!) and so many stores and restaurants are less than 10 minutes down the road. Everything in the home was easy to find and use thanks to all the helpful labels and house guide. We loved listening to the vinyl and playing the vintage board games. Wonderful, responsive hosts even though we really didn’t have questions since everything was so well set up. We wish we could have stayed forever! We hope to come back again sometime soon."
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"Scandi House is an amazing retreat in the woods, perfect for unwinding in nature. The house is beautifully designed, full of light and trees and spacious. The location is excellent. Less than 10 minutes from major stores. Less than 5 minutes from a beautiful hick on a paved path- perfect for bikes and an easy walk. Lots of comunal space for hanging out with family. We will definitely return. Thank you Sylvia!!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"At Tom and Sylvia's property is more than you see în the description. There is a special wibe generated by the location, architecture, interior design and host's careness towards their guests."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful, relaxing home in a central location in the Berkshires, a perfect jumping off point for so many adventures. And Sylvia and Tim are great hosts!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family enjoyed a lovely few days at this perfect home! It was clean, spacious, and beautifully decorated. Very private peaceful setting where we could hear a roaring brook out back.
We especially loved the double sided fireplace while we played family games. The location was perfect as it was a quick 20 min drive to Mass MOCA and many other local attractions. The rail trail was awesome to hop right on and ride our bikes. Sylvia was an excellent host making sure we had everything we needed. She even left us a bottle of local maple syrup! We can’t wait to come back!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful spacious and relaxing house. We would love to rent it again during our next trip to Massachusetts.
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,"A beautiful place for a lovely weekend. Sylvia and Tim’s place was even better than the pictures made it out to be. Tucked away in a neighborhood, my girlfriends and I had a nice, relaxing weekend getaway at the house. We really appreciated the thought our hosts had put into labeling all of the items we may need around the place and would happily return."
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,Sylvia and Tom's MCM-furnished house in the Berkshires is beautiful and centrally located to both the Northern and Southern halves of the Berkshires. They are fantastic hosts and it made our trip a pleasure. I can't recommend their home enough.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful! Interior design is lovely and inviting. We had a great weekend just hanging out and loved walking down to the creek behind the house. The house is comfortable and just as described but better. We look forward to our next visit.
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,"This was absolutely one of our favorite Airbnbs! The house was stylish, impeccably clean, and very comfortable for our family of six. It felt cozy and spacious at the same time. We had a magical late-winter snowstorm and felt like we were inside a snow globe. Sylvia made everything very easy and was a great and quick communicator. We loved the games, the record player, and all of the other thoughtful touches around the house. We hope to come back for another getaway soon!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful house in a lovely, forested area. Perfect for a relaxing winter weekend getaway! We really appreciated Sylvia’s thoughtful extras like fully stocked firewood and toiletries, and her great recommendations for the local hikes and restaurants. The organic grocery store Guido’s was such a find!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Slyvia's home is beautiful and in a great spot to explore western ma. We came to ski in the area and lucked out with a winter storm. We added an extra night to avoid driving in the storm. Slyvia was so helpful and fast to accommodate! The house is on a street with other homes but they're all well spaced and being near the rail trail and town feel like great amenities!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home. Comfortable and clean. Half of us skied at Jiminy Peak (20-min drive), while half of us stayed in the house to relax. More than enough space for our family to spread out. Softest sheets I’ve ever slept on. Sylvia is responsive and kind. Would gladly stay here again."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Sylvia and Tom's home is lovely and spacious. We stayed for a winter family getaway and everything was perfect. From the seamless check-in, beautiful and functional spaces, and the fully stocked kitchen we couldn't have asked for more."
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,"We had a fantastic stay here. The house was well-equipped and exactly as pictured. We spent the day skiing at Jiminy Peak, which was just a short drive from the house. Sylvia was responsive and helpful, and we would absolutely stay here again."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sylvia's place was great very clean and spacious. The double sided wood burning fireplace was our favorite after a cold day of cross country skiing. Sylvia's was a great host and responded to any questions quickly. I would recommend a stay here.
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful house in a beautiful setting. The fireplace was super cosy and we were close enough to visit the museums in Williamstown. Would stay again!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tom and Sylvia’s home is so nice, so well-appointed, such a good place to relax and ease into a weekend. It was so cold outside when we were there but we kept the fire going, read in different positions on different pieces of furniture, and cooked in their kitchen. We took a great walk nearby on a loop trail that was snowy and perfect and watched an owl fight off some birds in the front yard. We were alone without our kids and Tom and Sylvia’s was a perfect retreat!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Really enjoyed our stay. The peppery is large, roomy, and well equipped, with clear instructions and communication from Sylvia. It’a close to shopping and Jiminy Peak. Would recommend for a weekend getaway or even longer stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lets just say the location of this listing is PERFECT! It has stunning views of the lake and close to several locations in the Berkshires. The place has all amenities, the kitchen was well stocked. It is also a kid friendly place for a toddler, my daughter loved it! Andrew was a very good host, he always checked in to make sure everything was okay. He was very responsive to my questions. The several guides that was on the kitchen island was also very useful for us to come up with our plans. In conclusion, definitely a place I would come back to and highly recommend for others! Thanks Andrew!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great lakeside location!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My wife and I had the fortunate opportunity to rent the lake house for a week. The lake is steps from the house and has its own dock. Very private and quiet. The house was well equipped with necessities, and very clean. The view of the lake is spectacular. I highly recommend this lake house. I think children would also love it. The water is shallow for quite a distance from the house, so lots of swimming and rafting. Have FUN!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very relaxing time in this beautiful space. It is right on the water and its placement facing the water make it private and quiet. Everything was modern, tasteful, and well maintained. Andrew was very responsive and anticipated our needs."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Andrew was friendly & responsive. The Airbnb was updated and so clean! Perfect quaint location on the water! Would definitely book again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Alison’s and Andrews place is a beautiful getaway in the Berkshire mountains! We found it beautifully decorated and had everything we needed for our vacation. This house literally sits on a lake that you can spend hours relaxing sipping your coffee or cocktails! I highly recommend it and plan on returning again!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The care that went into renovating the space is evident. The color scheme is restful and the living room is so comfy. The views are speldid and the lapping water is soothing. We spent a good time on the deck enjoying not only the views but the ducks and jumping fish . One morning we had ducks (Mr and Mrs) sitting on the dock - and I belive it was a blue headed mallerd and I got a great photo of a mom duck swiming along with her ducklings.
The kitchen was well appointed and had everything you might need to bake...I had forgotten to pack a pie pan, but there was one in the kitchen. And the shortbread cookies that were waiting for us when we arrived were beyond scrumptious.

There are abudent placed and museums to visit. If you like flowers The Flower Bridge in Shelburn Falls has go to be on your list.
Would I recommend this house to a frind? ABSOLUTLY. Would I stay there again? ABSOLUTLY.
You will enjoy the stay at the "" Lake House"""
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a great deal for those looking to tour the sites around Lenox, Stockbridge and Pittsfield. Very large, older apartment. Owners live downstairs but I didn't hear or see them after I moved in. Photos are accurate. Sparsely furnished but very clean and well stocked kitchen. Great shower. Comfy bed. Shampoo, conditioner and soap was provided. Just note that apartment requires going up one flight of stairs.
Because the apartment is old, there is one window A/C unit, and two free standing A/C units in the dining and living rooms. They worked well but were loud, and the one in the bedroom was a bit ""cranky"" sounding (but didn't stop me from sleeping because I travel with ear plugs). The TV's speaker was also poor despite being a flat screen so I ended up using closed captioning to help make out what people were saying. These are the only two relatively minor complaints that I had. I would stay here again, esp given the high prices of hotels in the area."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot for the price! Wonderful space with all the necessary amenities. Check in was easy. They even let us check in early, and provided a quick tour to get us started. Extremely responsive to communication via Airbnb messenger. Thanks!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my third or fourth time staying at Michael’s place. The apartment is clean and roomy and well furnished. The neighborhood is not super quiet but safe and convenient. I’ll be coming back when I have business in Pittsfield again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Michael’s place was great. The kitchen was better equipped than most permanent homes, and I only regretted not being able to spend more time in it. I was there in early spring and the heat was great, as was the hot water. The apartment was incredibly spacious. Communication with Michael was easy."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The apartment was spotless, everything was as advertised. Michael was very responsive and helpful!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,I stayed for about a month and felt right at home. The apartment was clean and cozy and bigger than I expected. Michael and Yuhong have thoughtfully stocked the space with commonly used products and the kitchen is well outfitted for long term stays. Parking was easy and getting in and out of the driveway was easy despite having to pull out onto the main road. Hosts were very responsive and kind. One of my favorite Airbnb stays thus far!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was great to find an affordable place to stay in Pittsfield. Michael was always asking if we needed anything, but really did not since place has everything for short or long term stay. Older house but well kept and all utilities working - good water pressure, hot water, heating. Michael is a great host and even helped us carry luggage upstairs. Would definitely stay here again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Extremely happy with our stay! Bed was super comfortable!
Very clean and convenient. We hope Michael’s place will be available each year we come back to visit family.
We didn’t have to ask for a thing."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We are so thankful that we found Michael's place for our Berkshires getaway. It was the perfect location where we could drive to various hiking spots within town and within a short drive outside of Pittsfield. Michael was very kind and greeted us when we arrived, showing us the various spaces within the studio apartment. The space itself was large, clean and cozy (since it was a very cold night when we arrived). I appreciated the night lights, well stocked kitchen (plenty of plates, bowls, cups, utensils and various cookware) with fridge and microwave to heat up leftovers. It was also great that we could watch Netflix after a long day of lovely hiking. Lastly, it was an easy off-street parking spot right on the property. Hands down we would stay here again!"

The in-unit washer and dryer was especially useful, and the air conditioners kept us comfortable even on a couple of sultry evenings. They house is an early 20th century building with nice architectural details. The rate was an excellent value and communication very clear throughout the process. Many thanks for a relaxing, safe stay."

Having grown up in Pittsfield, I was nervous about the location, but I must say that, while on a pretty busy street, we felt very safe and had great parking. It's an older home, which we love and appreciate, and it was good to see someone bringing it back to life. I loved the minimalist approach to decorating- no clutter while including things that made the house very homey and comfortable. I would book this apartment again in a heartbeat!"

2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"What a fabulous stay! The house was perfect for the six of us. It was really nice that Felyce greeted us as we pulled in the driveway. The house was spotless! Nice added touch leaving us a bottle of wine. Thank you so much, Felyce!"

2023-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"Although a bit pricey, the place was spotless and suited our needs for the group we had. There were thoughtful touches, including the music room, quality linens, and modern updates in the kitchen and bathrooms."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house is immaculate and well suited for a family vacation. I had mentioned it was my wife's birthday after booking and when we arrived, we found Felyce and Jia had some local chocolates and a macaroon cake left at the house for her. I had some issues with the internet right before the Super Bowl, and although they weren't on site, Jia gave me a call and the neighbor went to the local Hone Depot to buy a new cable so we had everything working again just in time. The game room in the basement kept my boys entertained the entire weekend. As a very tech heavy family, I was thrilled that there was charging available in nearly every room of the house for phones and tablets. Everything you need is within a 10 minute drive, be that a supermarket, coffee, or skiing. It was a lovely weekend. Thanks!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I could probably write an entire article about this stay, but I'm word limited. Let me condense details:
1. This place is a real person's vacation home and as such included pleasant personal details like good books, board games, game room. Host not only generously provided snacks / coffee / tea, but condiments you would find in a real person's home.
2. Fran, the next door neighbor who checked us in, is the property manager and Felyce's dad. He was incredibly gracious, a gem of a human, helpful to all. But there's never a sense that you lack privacy while staying in this space.
3. There is a piano onsite, freshly tuned on our stay. We appreciated the ability to practice. Note the piano does need to be unlocked for use.
4. Basement game room = fun. Darts, foosball, table tennis!
5. Water pressure great. Comfy beds (though unbreathable layer on mattress => sweaty).
6. Close houses, 12-15 min from Bousquet and grocery stores. Love to stay again.
Wish we could've had more tim"

We enjoyed the game room and had wonderful family meals in the cozy dining room. Felyce helped check us in and gave us a full tour of the house and answered all questions.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This beautifully renovated house is located in a quiet neighborhood and has lovely flower gardens. Felyce has thought of everything you could need or want including snacks and a piano for those who are musically inclined. Our favorite local activity was renting a pontoon boat on Lake Pontoosuc (make a reservation prior to your stay). In retrospect this home rates in the top 3 Airbnbs we’ve ever stayed in. Highly recommend.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Felyce is a terrific host- she met us to show us around, and was immediately available to answer questions later. The house is newly renovated and you can tell by the hardwood floors, kitchen and bathrooms. It is spotless, comfortably furnished with an excellent kitchen – new appliances, good knives and everything one would need. There were thoughtful touches like snacks for hungry travelers on arrival and two kinds of coffee makers. I love soft towels and comfortable beds and this house gets an A+. It’s a quiet neighborhood and a private driveway."

Check in was easy and all the info was very clear. There was great communication with the hosting team. The home is cozy and sparkling clean. All the beds are very comfortable. Exactly as described. The neighborhood is quiet with deer sightings. Everything we needed was in very close proximity. Groceries, dining, hiking trails, summer adventure park etc. The hosts live just next door. They can help you with any need on short notice. Highly recommend it ! It is definitely one of the best Airbnb homes we stayed at. We are very much looking forward to staying again !"

We will definitely come back again. Thank you!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house on the lake had beautiful views, was private, very clean, well equipped and so cozy! We loved the wood burning fireplace and cooking and hanging out in the kitchen. Everyone played ping pong and the availability of the bikes was terrific. The piano was also nice to have in a vacation home!
Kayaking on the lake was so tranquil and the kids loved the big swing. We shopped for groceries at Guido's Fresh Marketplace, (great selections)!
Nearby towns were full of restaurants and rich history. We recommend visiting the Pleasant Valley Wildlife Sanctuary. Our family of 4 adults and 3 children loved the nature walk. Speaking of nature, the views from every window in the house were lovely.
Our host was a great communicator and all instructions were well laid out. We highly recommend this peaceful property for your next family trip!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was fantastic! Great Lake views and all comfortable. And the owner was very responsive.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Paul’s home was perfect for our family getaway to the Berkshires. Not only was the home spotless, it was fully stocked - all kitchen needs, extra linens, games and activities, BOATS! With spotty weather, we spent a lot of time hanging out at the house and the layout is perfect so that adults and kids had their own spaces, but the communal space was large enough for all. It was one of the best airbnb experiences we have ever had!
Paul was both responsive and proactive, and we had wine and treats waiting for us upon arrival - a truly wonderful host!"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"Paul’s home is beautiful and a great location right on the water. The kitchen island is huge and perfect size for all of us to sit, chat and play games. We’re a big game night family.
Love the open layout to the living room and the couches are super comfortable! Couldn’t get up after a while because they were so cozy. Lol.
All of the beds and pillows were extremely comfortable as well.
Can’t finish this review without mentioning the steam shower and jacuzzi - incredible!! Especially after a day of snowboarding.
We were a group of 8 and the house was perfect for us.
The entire house is a 10/10.
Paul was super responsive, provided more than enough information about the house and the area, and the house was really clean.
We had such a great experience and want to come back in the summer to make use of the kayaks and paddle boards!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great house, even better than the pictures! House was fully equipped, specially the kitchen! Place was spotless in communication with you on our was fantastic! It is winter so we could not enjoy much the outdoors but the backyard has direct access to the lake so I am sure it has to be very beautiful in the summer!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at this beautiful home! The location is gorgeous and overlooks the lake. The home was clean, full of amenities, comfortable, and cozy. We appreciated the delicious cookies and bottle of wine left by our hosts as well. It’s conveniently located near Bousquet Mountain and we enjoyed a couple of lovely winter hikes nearby as well. The instructions and communication were clear and we hope to return sometime again in the summer to enjoy the lake!"

It was well stocked with everything we needed for cooking, exercising, and even playing board games! The scenery was stunning and the property felt very private. Paul was responsive before and during our stay and was super helpful answering questions that we had leading up.
I would absolutely recommend staying here! I hope to come back sometime in the summer when the lake isn’t frozen!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very clean, well maintained, communicative owner and met all of our needs. Would definitely like to stay again and would highly recommend to others!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Paul’s place was just as advertised, a modern updated home with fantastic lake access and a quiet, walkable community with great neighbors and nearby access to so many of the regions amenities. We loved the dock, pond and water sport crafts (paddle boards and kayaks) that Paul has available for use. The short walk to Balderdash winery was a nice bonus too as an afternoon outing to break up our fun on the water. A great place for families. We’ll definitely book again next time we’re in the area!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Paul’s house was beautiful and had everything we needed for a nice weekend on the lake.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home was awesome for our family vacation. The lake view is one of the best in the Berkshires. Tons of amenities. Bikes, kayaks, ping pong. Very very quiet location with a huge yard and private dock. We loved the smart tvs in all the rooms, the huge kitchen island, and the cold AC.
This is a fantastic home to stay in with a big group. The downstairs area has a really cool private apartment style feel with an amazing tub and steam shower.
We had 3 couples and one 3 year old at this house and still had an extra bedroom we didn’t use. So it felt really nice to spread out and have 3 bathrooms for each couple.
We will definitely be back and strongly recommend this airbnb if you want Lake access, fire pit, and privacy!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful lake front home with gorgeous views of lake and mountains.
2023-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Comfortable place for a few families to stay. Overall, felt the oven and grill didn’t work well and the lawn wasn’t very usable because it was covered in goose poop, but it was a beautiful view. Bedrooms were very comfortable and Paul was very responsive."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"The home was in a great location close to family that lives in the area so was very convenient We walked to Bartletts for apple cider donuts one morning which is very close to home. We enjoyed kayaking and paddle boards on the lake they provided! We had the great views of the lake from the living room and bedrooms. The bathroom off the master was a vibe! Aromatherapy, music, steam and shower was amazing. All of us ended up using it and felt rejuvenated. I accidentally locked the garage door and they were there with the key the same day. Super responsive. My husband forget his AirPods and they offered to ship back to us. Very kind! All in all we had great time!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing location and thoughtful host. Had a bottle of wine waiting along with some delicious cookies. House is beautiful, much larger than it looks in the pics. The lake is awesome and Paul provides plenty of kayaks and paddle boards. Great place to stay if you want to be right on the water."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,We shared the house with another family and our kids and had a great stay for a long weekend in February. The house was beautiful and the lake views were stunning.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Eileen's was just what we were looking for. She was flexible with the sign in time to meet our changing needs. The neighborhood was safe, and parking was easy. It was a very peaceful stay. We would stay again if in the Berkshires."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great two-night visit with Eileen and her two cats. We felt at home, and the house was spotless. Eileen was welcoming, with the right mix of friendliness and allowing us our own space. She was helpful with tips about the area and very accommodating. Our rooms were spacious, with our own den and comfortable access to common use sun rooms. Really delightful, and very reasonably priced. We felt like we made a friend."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My second time staying here. Even better than the first - just have to remember to take my shoes off before I walk in! not an issue though. The cats were super friendly and Eileen provides a sweet basket of treats, including homemade zucchini bread."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Eileen’s place is a gem.
Super clean, well appointed, private accommodation, with a nice sitting/tv area, access to the kitchen and all rooms on the first floor including the front porch. Nice backyard which is private with lots of seating including a patio with nice outdoor furniture. The small back yard is beautifully maintained with flowering bushes and plants. Parking is well off the street and adequately sized.
Eileen pays close attention to detail and the sleeping accommodations are comfortable with a memory foam mattress and pillows.
Eileen is a gracious host and conversation is easy. She has traveled, done interesting things, and she maintains a house with grace and deep sense of peace. Of course her cats, when they warm up to you, are curious, wonderful, playful and delightful to be around."

Will be a repeat guest with pleasure, thank you Eileen!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,Eileen was the perfect hostess. She was available to talk but also gave me my own space. Her place was in a great location and I love the fact that there was a separate entrance and that I had a separate wing of her house. I highly recommend her home for people visiting Pittsfield.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As always, Eileen was the perfect host. Her house is spotless and both she and her kitties are warm and welcoming."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Eileen was friendly, welcoming, and apologetic for some minor construction that was being done, which was a complete non-issue, as I didn't even notice any mess. Her home and yard are truly lovely-it's a shame we didn't get to spend more time in the house, taking advantage of her sunrooms, which we were welcome to make use of. We did get time to spend some quality time with her cats, Mia and Barrett, and witness Mia's skill with the paper balls! (All to a great soundtrack, playing quietly in the background) Would definitely book again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Eileen was a wonderful host, provided tasteful and immaculate accomodations, and went the extra mile to make us feel welcome to the Tanglewood area, which is only 10-15 min away. We look forward to going back again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Comfy bedroom with small refrigerator and coffee maker, private den and bathroom off the kitchen. Eileen is very friendly and also shared the common areas on the first floor. She prefers that you take your shoes off before entering the house and she has two lovely young, curious cats. Lovely neighborhood."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Eileen’s. The house is lovely, the Airbnb accommodations are super cozy and comfortable, even though it’s right in her house, we had a private bathroom and a whole private den with TV and cozy couch, in addition to the comfortable bedroom. She was very creative, she created a little coffee nook where there was a closet off the bedroom and it is very inviting and allowed us to make coffee first thing when we wake up which is something very important to us. She even put a fresh container of half-and-half in the mini fridge which was great, and something I don’t find hosts usually do!
Eileen is very friendly and fun to talk to, and welcomed us to use all of the first floor of her home including a lovely front porch, and a cozy, comfortable sunporch in the back of the house. She was engaging when we wanted to socialize and also very respectful of our privacy. This was a great stay and we would absolutely love to come here again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. Eileen was a delight to meet. Friendly, but also allowing space for privacy. The entire place was spotless and full of interesting decor. Two porches and a deck to relax and soak up the sun. Our quarters were comfy and well equipped. My son lives nearby, making it convenient for us. We will definitely book again the next time we visit Pittsfield."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Eileen is a great host. I will definitely stay there again if she has availability next time I'm in town.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Eileen's place is a great stay! Eileen is a very good host. She made me feel like I was her friend, who came for a visit. She was available, but completely non-obtrusive. The entire house is delightfully and tastefully decorated. The rental space is both connected to the rest of the house and also private. The room has a good lock. The space is ample; two large rooms and a bathroom, connected by a service hall. There is plenty of closet space, counter space and empty dresser drawers to unpack your suitcases completely. This reall adds to the welcome and freindly feeling. It doesn't feel like a rental. It feels like, well...visiting a friend."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect spot. Can’t wait to come back!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Eileen was a gem of a host: very friendly, great to talk to, respectful, and responsive. She also had no problems accommodating my late arrival, which I was very grateful for. The place itself is incredible. Spacious, spotless, sunlit, and with everything you need. And the cats are adorable. (You can close the door if you don't want them coming in.) I hope to stay here again next time I'm in the area!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing AirBnB! I went to Pittsfield on Amtrak for some hiking, and Eileen was super nice and drove me to the trailhead in the morning so I didn't have to take the bus."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We had a wonderful long stay at Eileen’s. The space was perfect for us. It’s clean, comfortable and beautifully decorated. The kitchen is very well equipped with every possible gadget. The neighborhood is lovely to walk in as well as convenient, very quiet and centrally located. Eileen is the perfect host. She’s interesting to get to know, and she takes good care of her guests including providing baked goods that are yummy. She anticipates your needs, and she provides the perfect balance of interacting with guests and giving them privacy. Her two cats, Mia and Barrett, are delightful and fun to play with. We are already planning our return."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Eileen is an excellent host. She goes out of her way to make her guests feel welcome in her cozy home and to take care of them to the highest standard. In addition, you will have all the comforts of home, with the full use of the downstairs rooms. With me, I feel she went above and beyond when she picked me up late at night from Tanglewood when Uber failed me! I cannot recommend highly enough a stay with her in Pittsfield, MA. On top of that, she is a great conversationalist!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"There is nothing not to love about staying with Eileen: prompt, clear and timely communication, two adorable cats, a spacious, quiet, and spotless home where one has the use of the whole ground floor including the kitchen. There is also one’s own bedroom, bath, and living area. In the bedroom is a fridge with freezer compartment. The bed is super comfortable! Eileen is a thoughtful host who respects one’s privacy and yet is great company. Her home is convenient to Tanglewood as well as to Williamstown. We can’t wait to return!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely host, beautiful house and the cutest cats! Loved getting to spend time here and chatting with the host in the morning. 10/10 would stay again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you could design the perfect AirBandB stay, Eileen’s would be it! Clean and spacious. Welcoming and quiet. Centrally located making area attractions under a 30 min. drive.
Eileen and her two beautiful cats were very welcoming and made us feel as though we were visiting a longtime friend.
The bedroom, bathroom and den are accessible in a private hallway and are exceptionally clean. Guests also have access to the front porch (lovely), back sunroom (sweet) and small back deck (beautiful flower garden!) Off-street parking in a quiet neighborhood. Can’t wait to return!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Eileen's Place is an outstanding destination. She is warm, welcoming, gracious and spirited with a vast knowledge on numerous subjects. Her place is cozy and decorated with objects from her world wide travels. She keeps her home immaculate.
A must stay if you are going to the Berkshires."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful stay! Such incredible hospitality and so much fun! I had a charming and comfy bedroom complete with my own little coffee area and fridge, plus access to the entire first floor (kitchen, living room and a study where I could look out on the garden as I worked). Eileen’s baked goods and breakfast treats were always on offer.
Eileen was a welcoming and easygoing hostess. We both had busy schedules but found time for some relaxing evening chats. I loved hearing tales of Eileen’s travels and her days as an Arabian horse breeder, and being entertained by her sweet and playful cats – ll-month-old Mia and 10-week-old Barrett. Eileen was a great listener too - and super-helpful. She made sure, and double-sure, I had everything I could possibly want or need as a guest in her lovely home. (She even gave me great advice on how to transport huge bouquets all the way back to New York without emptying a drop of water from the vase!)"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Eileen and her cat Mia couldn’t have been more inviting! The place is spotless and easy to use. It was the perfect location for me to vend at the Berkshires Arts Festival. I will definitely be back!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Eileen's home is clean, welcoming, and homey. The experience was perfect for my stress free vacation. If you're looking to visit the state parks the location is perfect. I would happily stay here again."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful Air bnb regarding all aspects you can think of.
We enjoyed the space, Eileen’s hospitality, playing with her cat; Mia and the location within Pittsfield.
She offered us extra warm clothing, blanket and umbrella due to attending a concert at Tanglewood in the cold and rain which saved the day. Thank-you Eileen!
Don’t blink…you might think you are staying in a top notch inn in Lenox."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem!! Can’t believe how much work has been put into this home in terms of decorations and atmosphere. If you appreciate these things, you can’t go wrong. Very private staying area, and great company from Eileen and Mia (her friendly kitten).
I suggest spending at least one night on the front (or back) porch with Eileen to talk life and experiences. She has so much to offer, and next time we are in the area - we will be back."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,Eileen is a wonderful host!! She is well traveled and her adventures are told through her photography. Her home is lovely and her cat Mia is a genius!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I highly suggest, if you are in the Berkshires, to stay with Eileen. A lovely home, quite accommodating, friendly, private to your liking, and easy access to all the local places of interest. She allowed me the use of a lovely kitchen, which was overly stocked with the details, those who enjoy cooking, would need, and provided all the bells and whistles as that of a lovely boutique space. There is little comparison of anything in her area that can compete on cleanliness, pricing, and value provided. Thanks Eileen. Smart and inviting. I will be back."

2022-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Eileen's place is one of the nicest, best located, and real value. The place was very clean, modern, had everything we needed to feel at home, and was an easy drive to all the sites we wanted to see including its neighboring states- New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, etc. Eileen's a great baker and a good cook as well. Enjoyed her cookies, fresh baked breads and lasagna. Communication was great too. Eileen is the perfect host- thoughtful, helpful and accommodating. I would highly recommend this wonderful place!"
