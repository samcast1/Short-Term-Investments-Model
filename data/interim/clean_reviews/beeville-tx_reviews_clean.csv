2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Always great to stay here. Jeremy and the family are very friendly and great hosts. We recommend them to all our friends in the area.
Their local restaurant is some of the best burgers you'll find."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. Very close to town but very secluded at the same time. loved it there and will be back many times to stay.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Highly recommend. Jeremy and Jennifer are lovely hosts. Great communicators and super helpful. A lovely place to stay. And make sure you eat at The Dinner Belle - the burgers are amazing.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It's a great little place, peaceful and convenient. The cabin is well built and well maintained, equipped with just about everything one might need. A huge variety of birds frequent the area and sitting on the porch overlooking the pond while listening to the frogs singing was very relaxing."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here! It was beautiful and peaceful and comfortable and we saw great birds on the property! (Blank bellied Ducks, Louisiana waterthrush, Couch’s kingbird, and painted buntings)The hosts were so friendly and the Dinner Belle was a great place to eat! Plus Aransas Wildlife Refuge is close by!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was just an absolute neat place. the history of how it started and how the cabin was built. Know the owner should be very proud. The view and the peace of it all was the best place I have stayed in Beeville. Can't wait to try their other places out. And the host (wife) was so kind and thoughtful. If you ever in the area, this should be on your list of places to stay. Thank you for sharing your place with me."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Thai was a wonderful gem! Great for a romantic getaway with super responsive hosts. Place was beautiful and relaxing!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved staying in the Cabin by the Lake! The scenery on the ranch was beautiful, and the cabin felt like a home away from home. The hosts were very friendly and sweet… super genuine! Overall an amazing experience… may have to go back again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful place to stay
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was really nice. Very quiet and cozy! Only problem was when leaving and coming back to the cabin. We had to open the gate and lock it. It was kind of frustrating especially at night no lights out there only ur vehicle lights. Everything else was very nice!!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Peaceful and relaxed place. I wish I could have stayed longer.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always a pleasant stay at Jeremy and Jennifer's place! Absolutely did not want to leave and can't wait to go back!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We love this AirBnB!! It’s quiet and private with great food not even 5 minutes away…most days of the week!! 🥰We came from the West Coast of Canada to go to Florida….but stopping for 3 nights at the Cabin by the Pond was an absolute must to start off our vacay!!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host and quite atmosphere. Fishing was slow
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time here. It was relaxing and beautiful. Exactly what we were looking for. The porch was amazing and fishing was fun!
2024-01-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Little small than expected, inside of the house is clean and good but surroundings of the house like pond and the grass around it is not matching with the photos means its not groomed and the pond is not clean and smelly its actually a stagnant water( not fresh water) pit. may be the rain water goes into it but dried grass around the pond is not maintained."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a beautiful location!! Very private, quiet getaway from the city. I took my daughter and we both had an excellent time, even got to see a baby cow right outside the window! The weather wasn’t the best, but that was out of our control. Despite that, the view was still peaceful and calm. I loved it and plan to bring my daughter back during a sunnier stay so we can fish! Thank you to the hosts who were very kind and responsive. The Dinner Belle had a burger that was so delicious. I loved the friendly staff and very welcoming environment. Highly recommend."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"friendly and responsive hosts! very accommodating and their property was gorgeous, felt very quiet & relaxing. just what we needed to rejuvenate for the year."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"I really enjoyed my stay at the cabin. It was very clean, well decorated and extremely peaceful. Check in instructions were clear and easy to follow. I definitely will stay here again if I’m in the area again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin on the pond was very peaceful, private, and relaxing. We enjoyed cooking over fire and sitting by pond. Having Wal-Mart and restaurants nearby was also helpful. Beeville has a small town atmosphere. Jeremy and his wife were always responsive and kind. We would gladly visit again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is the reason I do AirBnB. A unique place in a beautiful setting with interesting and responsive hosts, that do accommodate to reasonable requests.
We were here for a wedding nearby and decided to spend New Year’s Eve in the cabin, toasting the New Year by the fire pit. We were blessed by beautiful weather, and even fireworks from the nearby neighbors.
We had everything we needed thanks to our hosts!!
It’s also a treat that the property is on a working farm. So you do see the cattle moving about and one morning I was greeted by Jeremy as he was passing by on his tractor.
The cabin itself is just as the pictures show and it has everything neatly and thoroughly set out.
We are so glad we chose this place!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jeremy and Jennifer were easy to communicate with, they were very responsive to our concerns. The cabin was very clean, with quiet surroundings. It was perfect for winding down after the Christmas holidays. We highly recommend stay at the “Cabin by the Pond!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay. It was quiet, peaceful and private. The hosts were very friendly, respectful, and helpful."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Just what I needed to zone out!! Very relaxing. I hope i have an other opportunity to come here again.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The pond is literally just outside the door. Fishing off the deck couldn't be easier if that's what you enjoy. Water lilies in the pond were gorgeous! I have never seen pink lilies. We enjoyed watching the birds swoop down over the pond or the surrounding pasture. It was cold while we were there, but we didn't let that keep us away from the amazing fire pit that is next to the pond. Being serenaded by the frogs was hilarious. We also walked over to the other pond and enjoyed a fabulous sunset. We didn't fish while there, but Jeremy says there are quite a few fish in both ponds to keep you occupied for a while. We didn't get to meet Jennifer, unfortunately, but Jeremy was very friendly and helpful. We enjoyed hearing about his family and how our cabin came to be. We will definitely be going back. If you are looking for a lovely stay, in a cozy cabin, with beautiful views, look no further. You won't be sorry!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I know I may have been a little bit of a pest but Jeremy and Jennifer were amazing hosts. always made sure we were comfortable
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Couldn’t have asked for a kinder host with great communication. I will be back when I have plenty of time to enjoy!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were so delighted to rest and relax at the cabin by the pond. It was truly serene to be by the water and the gorgeous water lilies! We had such a lovely time we are looking to visiting again in the near future.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I am back at work today, but mentally I am still still sitting on the porch listening to the bubbler in the pond. It was peaceful and beautiful and I miss it already. It's lunchtime and part of me is listening for the green jays to come by and give me a hard time. I saw a hawk take a quick bath at the end of the pond. I saw the most amazing indigo snake sunbathing. At night it was quiet and it was too easy to sleep in. Go and experience this."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing place for a couple to get away for a few days. The bed was super comfortable and shower was amazing. Will definitely be coming back !
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place to stay and relax. Gorgeous porch to sit at and enjoy the pond right outside your door.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,It was beautiful! Literally everything you needed was there. From fishing poles to the tackle boxes to games and magazines. It was really relaxing
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay, and we are thrilled to have such a magical Airbnb in Beeville! Comfortable, beautiful, peaceful, and with lovely and charming hosts! Coming back to our hometown for Western Week has never been more fun now that we have found this idyllic spot. I will never get tired of sitting on the porch, overlooking the most gorgeous, lily pads, and enjoying the bird and animal life on the ranch. This time we saw a great blue heron, as well as a white and I saw a red tailed hawk, or a bigger version of hawk. I didn’t get a very good look. The rabbits were on the trail again when we were out for a walk. There were several great Kiskadee’s flying around and entertaining us also. We just love it here and feel very at home. Can’t wait to come back!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Rustic place out in nature. Husband enjoyed fishing in the pond that was right there off the deck which was wrapped around the cabin. Enjoyed hearing the cows and the chickens, something you don't hear in the city. Jeremy and Jennifer are wonderful hosts. If you get an opportunity you need to make sure you eat at their place called The Dinner Bell. They take great pride in what they serve. They raise their own beef which was absolutely delicious. It's a family affair! We enjoyed meeting a couple of their children. Thank you for your wonderful hospitality!!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a wonderful little spot on the outskirts of Beeville. The cabin is next to a lake in in the middle of a small farm. It is nice on the inside and the host is very generous with simple amenities such as coffee and bottled water. I would definitely stay again if in the area in the future.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay at Cabin on the Pond. The space was clean, comfortable and included thoughtful personal touches. The pond was beautiful and the lily pads were in bloom which made it even more scenic. We would definitely stay here again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jeremy and Jennifer's cabin was a beautiful peaceful place to stay! We enjoyed the rustic feel, and the amenities were perfect. The hosts were very responsive and helpful. I can't think of a better place to stay in Beeville, perfect if you are looking to get away for some peace and quiet. And all the shopping and restaurants were close by. We can hopefully return to this gem sometime!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jeremy and his family were fantastic hosts! The cabin was perfect for the two of us. The view from the porch was just beautiful. I hope to get to visit again!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,").
We had an amazing stay at the cabin. The hosts were outstanding in every aspect (friendly, generous, considerate, thoughtful, and great communicators).
Jeremy selected and prepped two steaks for us to celebrate my wife's birthday (his wife wrote us a very nice and personal greeting card).
These steaks were the best I have ever tasted - absolutely incredible steaks.
We also had fun fishing and Jeremy gave us some helpful pointers.
The cabin itself is great...very cozy, loaded with amenities and most importantly: good AC 🙂
This was not our first visit nor will it be our last."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have never been to a place so beautiful before! My husband and I were celebrating our anniversary and on the day of check out, we didn’t want to leave..We fished every day and made wonderful memories together! We will be back with our kids for sure! Highly recommend staying here! Jeremy and his wife go above and beyond for their guests!!!"

Highly recommended❤️"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My 12-year-old daughter and I stayed one night in the Cabin by the Pond on our way to McAllen for a softball tournament. We had a great time relaxing, fishing, and enjoying being outdoors. The cabin is comfortable and very clean. The hosts are super responsive and welcoming. We look forward to coming back."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Jeremy was very friendly and helpful. Will definitely stay here when I come back to town.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We spent our 50th wedding anniversary at The Cabin by the Pond & it was pretty perfect! They had prepared a beautiful cake, flowers, & hand decorated cookies, plus a card and a greeting on the wrap around porch. We had the best hamburgers on the planet from the Dinner Belle, & a great photo shoot with Madison. The cabin is charming, but the pond at the cabin is magical! In the evening all the water lilies opened up & we enjoyed them the next 2 mornings, along with an adorable whistling duck family. We were married in Beeville 50 years ago & have family in town, but finding this hidden treasure just made our visit & celebration so much more than we had hoped for! We spotted a Great Kiskadee on our walk to the back pond along with scissor tails, rabbits, & frogs. We will definitely be back! A very relaxing & private retreat, well done!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was amazing! Jeremy and Jennifer were the absolute sweetest and helped us with everything we needed, and then some. Their recommendations are spot on, and the steaks we got from them were some of the best we’ve ever had. They truly put their heart into this property and it shows tremendously through all of their little touches of love and attention to detail.
I already have my next trip booked and we can’t wait to make this gorgeous property a regular getaway. If you need somewhere that feels like home, but gives you peace and relaxation without the hustle and bustle of everyday life, go here! A million/10 recommend."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jeremy and Jennifer were absolutely great hosts. Everything was beautiful and it is so peaceful there. We will most definitely be back. This will be our go to spot when we want to disconnect from everything as well as fish.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jeremy and Jennifer are a wonderful host with very clear and easy directions. Any questions they promptly responded to. The cabin itself is nestled off the road making for a quiet and beautiful stay. I recommend the steaks and utilizing the grill for a delicious meal.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice little cabin to just relax and unwind. Well worth the trip. Cool campfire area and very clean and beat. So nice.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Felt right at home, Jeremy & Jenifer where very welcoming. It was nice and peaceful. Pond was so beautiful and made sitting on the porch drinking coffee and bbqing the spot to be"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second time staying at Cabin by the Pond. The first time we stayed, Sept 2022, my bf, Josh and I were determined to get out of the city and greet 2023 from Cabin by the Pond. Incredible doesn’t do it justice. “Like a slice of heaven” is how Josh described it. That’s closer what it feels like when you’re stepping out of the double doors of the cabin, as the sun rises or slips away to make room for the night and mere feet from where you’ll lay your rested head. If you’re lucky like we were, perhaps you’ll get to hear an orchestral event from the frogs and other nighttime fauna. Seriously, it was magnificent!
The time the Morris family has taken to create such a Texas country oasis is apparent in each detail of the cabin and the property. Built with their own hands, the entire family, even the children have created a “little slice of heaven” in Bee County, TX.
We extended our trip and extra day both trips! It’s like sweet tea, pecan pie, and Texas Brisket - a Texas treasure"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We arrived to a sweet personal message written on the chalkboard congratulating us on 26 years of marriage, which we were celebrating. We wish we had had more time to spend there, but one night was all we needed to get away and rest up and relax alone before Christmas with families started. We will definitely keep this place in mind for a longer stay and I’ve already recommended it to two of my Airbnb lovers as a place to visit!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place and wonderful hosts! Our little honeymoon couldn’t have been more perfect
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect romantic getaway spot when you want a spot to do absolutely nothing all day. The cabin is literally right on the pond so you can fish from the deck if you want to. There are a couple of super comfy deck chairs and fishing poles even provided for you. The walk in shower was HUGE and definitely a highlight for me. The cabin itself was small and quaint but had everything we needed. Just remember that there is no oven. Jeremy and his family were EXTREMELY accomodating and even had some of their ground beef and ribeye steaks for grilling ready for use in the fridge when we arrived. And they were WAY better than anything we could have bought from a store. We also ordered 4 bundles of firewood from him and he had it all set up by the firepit for us. Our goal was to literally do nothing but relax and sleep in and cook good food for 4 days straight and thats exactly what we did. It was absolutely perfect.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This cabin is the cutest place. We had a short stay and we were preoccupied during the day as we were in town for a family funeral. When we got to the cabin, everything was beautiful inside & very homey. I have family in beeville & everyone was surprised there was an air bnb in town. I even told some friends who have family bear by as well & they look forward to staying.
This is a very recommended place for a nice little get away or visiting family from out of town!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was an amazing place to stay deep in the middle of the country! The cabin was immaculate and so cute but most of all, the pond with the white and fuchsia water lilies was breathtaking! l will definitely be back!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We loved our stay at the Cabin by the Pond! Sitting on the back porch watching the happenings in the pond was wonderfully peaceful! We got to stay for a whole week and only heard our cow neighbours ‘moo’ once!!
The added bonus of this incredible cabin is that our hosts run ‘The Dinner Belle’ and serve lunch from 11-2pm from Wednesday to Friday’. The burger’s are the best we have ever tasted! I also learned that if you purchase a burger for your dinner, because you are having the prawns for lunch….and put it in the fridge in the cabin for later… you just need to put the burger on a paper towel and microwave it for one minute and it will be as though it was just served to you!! Trust me, we bought lunch and extra for dinner from The Dinner Belle on more than one occasion as it’s that good!!!
Enjoy your stay! We definitely did!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,perfect in every way
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is a must. Quiet but so close to town. The cabin is awesome. Hosts are amazing. Can't wait come come back for a longer stay.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our relaxing weekend at your ranch. It's a gem. The most memorable thing is how your entire family including your kids made us feel welcome. We loved the pond and the wrap around porch at the cabin. It was nice being so close to the cow pen -- we love animals. I am glad we sampled your cooking at the restaurant - the burger and fries was excellent. We will recommend your place and we will come back.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing. Worth the drive. Excellent hosts
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This man cave has everything you’ll need for the perfect getaway. Rustic retreat on the pond left us refreshed and rejuvenated. I highly recommend ❤️

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Cabin by the Pond was absolutely wonderful. The location with the little pond was serene. Perfect for sitting on the porch and relaxing. It's obvious how much thought and care went into the cabin itself. It felt cozy and like a warm welcome. I briefly met Jeremy as he was feeding the fish in the pond; he was very courteous.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It’s a very nice area to be in if you plan on trying to have a getaway trip. The place is a small home and is so cozy to be in. The walk around porch is great and nice to sit outside and enjoy the weather . There is a tv so you can still watch whatever shows you’re into. The wifi works great and the AC does too. Overall, this place is great to be with your significant other and enjoy quality time together."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cabin is well insulated, great furniture, everything works. We were worried there will be a lot of bugs and mosquitos but they r very minimal to almost none. But there are frogs. Rabbits, and other cool ones. Nice cows. There is plenty to do in Beeville and the farm is 5 min away from walmart and downtown.
Host are very helpful.
Great stay"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I was In Beeville on business. But this cabin made my trip feel like a much needed vacation. It is a very special place. The pictures and description of the property is accurate. But the peace that saturates the property can’t really be described.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay!
Jeremy and his family were all so nice and friendly and let us know what they could offer us food wise and knowledge about the property. The fishing for us was the best part we caught a big catfish and some perch’s. We had such a relaxing lovely getaway thank you for letting us make memories at this GEM!"

2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was such a serene, beautiful, and clean place to stay, and the hosts were wonderful. Was just looking for a quick getaway but found a place we weren't ready to leave! Fun fishing, a beautiful sunset and and the cutest, rustic cabin are just the beginning! Ate at the hosts' restaurant, The Stand, and cant get their mouthwatering burgers and fusion tots out of my head. 5 stars in every area and can't wait to go back!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I know people often say “this is the best airbnb I’ve stayed in”…. But honestly, this is the best airbnb I’ve stayed in!
The accommodation is REALLY comfortable, and the setting is very special. It was just amazing sitting on the deck, listening to all the wildlife around the pond after dark.
Although the cabin feels as though it is in the middle of nowhere, it is only a few minutes to downtown Beeville.
Jeremy and Jennifer were extremely helpful in the run up to our trip; check in was easy and even though the hosts live next door, we had total privacy in our space.
Thank you!!"

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This might be the coolest Airbnb in Texas. The hosts are fantastic. The property is beautiful. We’ve stayed at some really nice Airbnb’s, but this one was my favorite. Pro tip: the owner can have a couple of fresh steaks waiting for you in the fridge if you request them, and they have a nice Weber grill to cook them on."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved the cabin by the pond! Easy to find and close to food and stores. Jennifer and Jeremy were great host and made check in and check out a breeze.

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My teenage son and I had a wonderful visit. He fished and I enjoyed the beauty of the surroundings while sipping coffee on the deck.

Easy drive to San Antonio or the coast, too. The space is great, thoughtfully built and arranged, and the hosts were very accommodating. Very private and cozy for whatever sort of trip you’re lookin for. Highly recommend staying here!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I absolutely loved this charming cabin. It was very peaceful and you could not beat fishing right off of the porch whenever you wanted. We will be back to catch the big ones next time! The cabin allowed for privacy, which we loved. The bed was very comfortable! We also enjoyed getting to meet some of the family, who were very kind. I only wish we could have stayed longer!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Cabin by the Pond is a wonderful place to stay and relax. The setting on which it sits directly beside the pond and the cattle just inside the barn pen create a very ranch and farm feel . The cabin was built with much thought and creativity which is evident in the decoration inside and out. We truly were amazed and inspired . I highly recommend staying here. I will be back there soon.

Me, my husband and baby came to visit family here and we wanted a little space that felt like our own while we were here and this place was PERFECT! There are so many fine details in the cabin that add to its beauty. We will definitely be staying here again!
Also, the food at the Dinner Belle was spectacular! I got the fancy tots (can’t remember the name) and my husband had the craw fish Étouffée and it was sooo good. I wish we would’ve been able to try the gumbo and more menu items. We certainly will when we come back!
You will not regret choosing this cozy gem!"

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a amazing property perfect for a couple. It is the perfect size and absolutely beautiful property. It is close to town, we’ll actually in town but you can not tell. I have stayed in a lot of Airbnb’s and VRBO’s and this was my favorite place by far. The bed is very comfortable as well. The cabin was the cleanest of anywhere we’ve stayed and the AC/ heater is adequate for space. We didn’t have a chance to use the fire pit this stay but will definitely do so on our next stay."

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A vacation you don’t need a vacation from! We fished, we enjoyed fish tacos from the Dinner Belle, we grilled a Double J flank steak on the fire pit, we drank coffee on the deck every morning, we drank wine on the deck every evening, we watched movies, we slept in, we cooked breakfast in the cutest kitchen ever, we rested…need we say more? Just book your stay…you will not be disappointed!"

2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay. Loved the amenities with the peaceful location.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Let me start off by saying that I am not a country girl. I already live in, by my definition, a small town, so I like to travel to big cities. But after making it through COVID as a high school teacher AND grad student, I was completely ready for something different to get my stress level down. I wanted to go to the beach, but I also wanted to just be away from everyone and everything. This was the best of both worlds!! Secluded, cozy, and quiet, and only 50 miles from the beach. It was absolutely serene and beautiful. The hosts are good-hearted and accommodating, and their daughter did an amazing photo shoot for us. I’ve stayed in Air B&Bs all over TX and from here to NYC, and I have never been so overall impressed. I can’t wait to come back!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"A lovely cabin; simple enough to enjoy a slower pace, but comfortable enough to enjoy a great night's sleep. Wonderful amenities. The pond lilies are spectacular!!!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I'm still in amazement. Expect a rustic-chic cabin with ultra-modern showers/tech. These people are so sweet, thoughtful, and hard-working. Whatever you're expecting, this Cabin by the Pond will exceed it. I joked that I didn't want to leave a good review because I want to come back already. If you're still reading this, just book it before someone else does!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay here! If you love nature like we do, then this is the place for you! The decor in this cabin is amazing! You have to see it with your own eyes! If you thinking of booking this cabin, please don’t hesitate! It has so much to offer! It has birds galore, rabbits, cows, fish, butterflies 🦋 all kinds of colors, and at night the lighting bugs take you back to childhood! It was peaceful and quite! The hosts Jeremy and Jennifer were very attentive to the questions I had. We will be back!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jeremy and Jennifer were the perfect hosts and were extremely helpful and very available,"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place for a quiet getaway. If you love fishing please go it was so much fun to fish right off the deck and just relax. Lastly, if you don't feel like cooking town is very close and lots to pick from."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,I regret not staying for a longer time! Cozy cabin with all the modern creature comforts. The decor is really vintage/rustic. I also really enjoyed the hosts' personalized message and the fact that there's a small pond right outside the cabin for fishing/scenic entertainment. They even provide the rods! I was really delighted to discover this little gem and plan to come back.

2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Jeremy was very responsive from the start... good directions and he and Jennifer went above and beyond to make us comfortable. The cabin was just perfect for a little get away for the two of us to see our god daughter and our old college friend for the weekend. Even though it was a last minute reservation the place was super clean and they were very accommodating with making sure we had what we needed. Would definitely recommend this place.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our stay. Very comfortable and relaxing. Our only complaint was that we didn't see a lot of livestock. they must have been shy.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place if you’re looking for a quiet and relaxing experience. I will be visiting again for sure. The birds are just naturally perfect!

2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an amazing stay- the cabin was clean and rustic, with a beautiful view and lots of privacy. I loved waking up and drinking coffee on the porch and watching the ducks visit in the morning! Coming back to the cows having lunch was always a nice thing to see, and walks on the property were so beautiful and peaceful. If your here with a special someone, nothing will make you feel more romantic than sitting together on the bench under the stars and twinkling lights <3 great with communication, kind family, very accommodating and we even got steaks from their farm for dinner one day we cooked over some mesquite on the fire pit. Would definitely return when going back to Beeville in the future!"

2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is AWESOME! First I was having a bit of a time finding the place I called Jeremy and he stayed the phone with me until i reached the property. When my wife and I arrived there was a personal message welcoming my wife and I. What a great personal touch. I think that's what this place is about... the personal touches. There were flowers waiting inside for my wife to which she was very surprised. Extremely clean for a cabin, most cabins I've been in have been dusty but not this place it was clean. The pond with fishing another great touch to the place. I have already recommended this place to several people. If you're looking for a place to disconnect from city life then this is the place for you. Every enjoyable experience for my wife and I."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved it!

It was so peaceful and relaxing! My husband really loved going fishing at the pond too! He was able to catch 4 fish including the “goldfish!” He is so excited to go back. The cabin itself was so relaxing and perfect for a couple that just want to relax. Thank you so much to the Morris family! We really enjoyed our stay! We loved the cabin, the pond, and the cows that roamed around! Definitely recommend!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,This cabin is fantastic for a night away from the city; it was exactly what I needed and the space is gorgeous
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We have stayed here a few times before and as always we had a great time. The cabin itself is very comfortable (great AC) and it comes stocked with everything you need for the kitchen and bathroom. The surroundings are beautiful including the pond stocked with fish.
The hosts are very friendly and thoughtful and communicate well.
We look forward to our next visit."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved our stay at the cabin. I strategically picked it as my husband loves to fish. We stayed almost a week & it was wonderful! We made most of our meals on the stovetop burner & had plenty of room to relax. We will definitely stay again if we’re ever in the area!☺️

2021-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,wonderful place
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My fiancé and I had a perfect stay at the cabin. The space managed to strike a great balance between a remote nature retreat and a cozy home-away-from-home equipped with all the necessities. The cabin itself was completely charming, and Jeremy and his family were accommodating and thoughtful; if there was anything we needed or wanted, all we had to do was text. We always felt as though we had our privacy, but our hosts were available and willing to show us around their acreage and answer all of our curious questions - Jeremy even sent the cows up our way so we could say hello.
It's obvious how much time and care went into creating such a great little space, and how much dedication goes into making their guests' experience top notch. There were so many great little added touches - from jars of homemade pickles and jam, to the tackle and rods provided for fishing the stock pond. Their instructions and information was thorough and easy to understand, making for a seamless experience throughout - they really have thought of everything.
We could not have asked for a better weekend getaway, and we can't wait to go back."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Very relaxing and cute spot. Beautiful view and pond and the cabin was very homey and great decor. Check in/out was extremely easy and the hosts were super friendly and helpful.

Thank you to Jeremy and Jennifer for being such gracious hosts and for the sweet anniversary notes.

Lots of artistic touches in the space- Eric showed me their other properties and said his wife is all the ideas and he makes it happen. They’ve got a lovely little space overlooking the lake and have provided coffee and snacks for some relaxing evenings/mornings on the deck. There’s a gorgeous pergola that they provide chairs as well so you can sip a drink and chat or just enjoy the quiet. Well thought out, friendly, excellent place- highly recommend!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to get away from everything and relax…as soon as we drove up we were greeted by Eric and his wife, super friendly and helpful, they let us know what there was to do around the area. While talking to them I mentioned it was my husband’s bday and that’s why we were taking this mini getaway, later that night we were brought bday cupcakes to our door, what a wonderful gesture. We planned to stay there longer but due to a family emergency we had to cut our visit short, but my husband and I will definitely be coming back to this location. House was clean and cozy beautiful lake front view."

2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"Joan was excellent about communication. One of the motors for the heater broke and Joan quickly found a solution.
The house was just as described with high ceilings, large rooms, and vintage style. Oak trees with Spanish moss and deer on the grounds made for a picturesque landscape. The place gives you the feel of old time Texas. In keeping with that, the water will take a little while to warm up and toaster can be temperamental. Nothing a little patience doesn’t solve. Beds were very comfortable and WiFi worked perfectly.
We would be happy to stay here again if we’re back in town."
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"Our family traveled from 4 different states to gather in Beeville for Thanksgiving this year. This house accommodated all of us with comfort and ease. We loved the lovely home, its furnishings and the history of the house. There was ample room for the grandkids to roam on the grounds. Beautiful setting, great deck at the rear of the house for gathering in the evenings. The house was very clean, kitchen was perfect for all the prep and cooking done for Thanksgiving dinner. The house accommodated our large family on this special day with ease and comfort. We felt as if we were stepping back in time with present day amenities. Would definitely stay in this AirBnb again. The location of this home was close to town and yet we still felt we were in the country."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Extremely happy with the venue & service. The attention & care taken of the home was great. Highly recommend this place to everyone. Hope to return someday soon.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Again, Joan is a great host. Her home is beautiful and our stay was great."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joan is a great host, friendly and helpful with a beautiful home. Will definitely stay again when I’m in Beeville."
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,Great place! This was our second visit and we very much enjoyed the stay!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love it there.. very peaceful and quiet..
2023-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Our stay with Joan was absolutely wonderful! This gorgeous home sits in a beautiful, yet quiet part of town. Despite feeling like you are secluded in your own world, this property was practically hidden in the center of town; giving you a sense of seclusion while being 3 minutes from restaurants, bars, bowling alleys, shopping centers, etc.. Joan was a very inviting, accommodating and helpful host, especially when it came to finding local attractions. Plus, I can't forget to mention the adorable schnauzer puppies that greet you in the driveway anytime you pull up. Watching them run circles added to my enjoyment as I sat on the balcony, overlooking the property in the evenings. I plan to stay at Silver Oaks anytime I come to Beeville in the future. I recommend anyone else to do the same."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,Absolutely gorgeous property full of history! Central to all stores and places. Easy access to highways and downtown. Beautiful place inside and outside. We will be back! Loved it!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely wonderful! Everything was clean and nice. Great communication. It was a great experience. The grounds of the property are beautiful! The perfect place for my daughters small wedding.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Really enjoyed this stay. Very peaceful, isolated, and Joan is very responsive and respectful."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,The house is beautiful and takes you back in time even through it’s literally just a step away from the downtown area. My wife walked around the house admiring the antiques and I enjoyed just sitting out back in the morning listening to the birds and watching the squirrels while I drank coffee.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,A lovely and charming house. Spacious with a large yard and patio. Very clean and comfortable. Will definitely stay there again.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at Joan’s beautiful home was perfect! I look forward to going back. For other guests, if you arrive at night it is difficult to see where the driveway is to turn in. The bed was comfortable, the water pressure and temperature were fine. I had the entire place to myself. Only turned the tv in the living room on once but it as well as the Wi-Fi worked ok. The curtains were dark in my room so no glaring light if you want to sleep in. I had everything I needed. The property on the exterior needs a little repair and TLC but personally I prefer it over a brand new anything! It simply wreaks of nostalgia and leads the imagination to visions of the past when the home might have been alive and bustling with a sweet, hard working, growing family, delicious aromas escaping the kitchen, everyone sitting down for dinner at the table holding hands to give thanks with no distractions of electronic devices. Norman Rockwell could’ve been inspired there! The home was surrounded by huge, wonderful trees like you might see in a fantasia storybook and the grounds were filled with a variety of lush foliage. Joan was very responsive and attentive to my needs or concerns in spite of a recent accident she was recovering from. Next time I’ll take advantage of the grounds and maybe do a little bird watching or sip some herb tea on the deck with one of the interesting books in her collection! I wouldn’t recommend it for young children until some of the repairs have been completed. Otherwise don’t hesitate to book the Inn at Silver Oaks! I think you’ll be delighted!"
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,Everything was great!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this place. It was clean, private and nature great too! I highly recommend it and would definitely stay here again."
2021-01-01,3,Stayed with kids,This home would be great for a short weekend get away or to use for a shower but not long term like our stay was. Location was great for us and the property was wonderful!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Have stayed many times- there is NOWHERE Nicer in Beeville!!!
2020-11-01,5,Group trip,Joan was a wonderful host and the property is a little oasis just a minute from downtown Beeville. We had multiple Green Jay sightings as well as other lovely birds. The grounds are peaceful and beautiful... we all enjoyed morning coffee out on the deck. Rooms are spacious and beds all comfy - everyone slept great. What a discovery for us as we have family in Beeville and hope to return again soon. Thank you Joan!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Precious place and the absolute best location- close to town but gorgeous acres!

around;)"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joan is a great host, the house has so much charm and is beautiful!"
2020-07-01,4,Stayed over a week,"Pros-nice location, secluded with a big yard tons of space to run around with big beautiful trees, beautiful house with tons of antiques not a place for small children to run around in. Has multiple bedrooms and bathrooms to choose from big livening room/ dining room.
Cons- house was very dirty when I arrived mainly the kitchen and bathrooms and all high touch surfaces such as the light switches, door knobs which I wasn’t too happy about during a pandemic. But if you bring your own cleaning supplies and Lysol wipes should be ok.
Had no hot water during my two week stay as well lady tried fixing it but no luck."
2020-06-01,5,Group trip,Huge gorgeous area for running and playing! Absolutely stunning trees!
2020-03-01,5,Group trip,"Absolutely beautiful house set off the road in an private setting with old trees around it, yet close to town. The home has been updated and has very comfortable beds. Joan made us feel at home and made us a delicious beakfast. We would definitely recommend this home. Great for a large family."
2020-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Secluded and private though convenient to everything , Joan’s got the best place in Beeville!Beautiful oak trees, the house is amazing and comfy. Joan is lovely, warm and prepared."
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super-host is not enough to describe the warm hospitality of Joan during our weekend stay at her beautiful historic house. Joan was always available to help with request or small detail we needed. The house is so charming, clean, and spacious. The breakfasts she served were super delicious! After dinner, the fire pit behind the porch was so relaxing to chat and watch the evening pass by. Thank you Joan!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Joan is a stellar host and the property is peaceful, welcoming and comfortable. Perfectly lovely all around!"
2019-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,Joan’s place is hands down the best Airbnb I have ever stayed at.
2019-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,Amazing!
2019-02-01,4,Group trip,See previous review
2018-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Do you like old houses and antiques? This place is a beautiful old home, tastefully decorated with lovely antiques and an interesting history. It’s very comfortable and welcoming. Joan is an awesome host, feeling more like a favorite relative that you’ve come to visit."
2018-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fabulous Beeville gem! Joan took wonderful care of us and the house is gorgeous.
2018-12-01,5,Group trip,"This place is absolutely the best!!! Joan is an awesome host and the place is very roomy, cozy and is decorated with beautiful antiques. My husband is from Beeville and we were in town for our nieces wedding and we couldn’t have picked a better place to stay. We will definitely be back."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I travel to Beeville, TX, 1-2 times a year for family. I spent my summers there as a kid, so I’m fairly familiar with the area and the expectations. Joan’s inn surpassed anything that I could have hoped for! It’s a spacious house with 4 bedrooms and 5 beds. My nephews, niece and son LOVED the pool in the back as well as the swing. There wasn’t anything lacking as far as amenities or conveniences went. I hope that I can make the inn a regular part of my visit from now on!"
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If I ever again need lodging in Beeville, I would certainly book a stay at Joan's. The house was huge, with plenty of space for everyone. And, the bed was so comfortable it made me realize just how much my mattress at home is overdue for replacement."
2018-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Five stars across the board. The Inn will not disappoint. It’s home away from home and Joan is a fabulous host. Can’t wait until the next trip! Thanks Joan!!
2018-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"First, let me say this house ""Inn"" is quite old which is much of what makes this property so charming. Joan has done many renovations to the home but tried to keep as much of the original details as she could for that ""vintage"" feel. With that being said some of the small things we encountered were merely a result of the age of the home. It is very clean and well kept. There are many antiques in the home and if you have children beware this is not a place for kids to be touching things liberally. The beds are firm and comfortable and my family and I occupied the entire home during our stay. Each of the 3 rooms we occupied had TVs with smart devices to access Netflix etc however there is not cable or antenna for local TV stations. Joan was also kind enough to provide access to Wifi during our stay. The balcony is wonderful! A peaceful place to sit and enjoy a glass of wine and a good book. The property is close to a small beer garden/ restaurant and a short drive to grocery stores and several fast food options.
Jane is a great hostess. I had a small concern during my stay and she promptly addressed it kindly and effectively. She was a pleasure to talk too and her pups are precious. She is onsite and makes it a point to quickly respond to any and all communication. She even provided some pastries and yogurts for breakfast which was a real treat! I would definitely recommend the property to anyone who wants a quiet getaway."
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Anyone in town for baseball, this is hard to beat."
2018-03-01,5,Group trip,"This is the perfect setting for a large family weekend away. Our five adults had a lot of room, and the stay was very comfortable. A very well tended house with a large back porch and fire pit. Many antiques but usable - not fragile or too delicate. The beds were comfortable. Lots of room! If we go back to Beeville, we would stay there again.
The host (Joan) is very personable, open and helpful. She previously managed a bed and breakfast, and she knew just how much to be available."
2017-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Turn of the century home, with the perfect front and back yard for a relaxing get away. The house is a must see and Joan is great!!"
2017-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Joan puts tremendous thought and planning into being most hospitable host! I truly appreciate her attention to detail during our extended time in Beeville!
2017-10-01,5,Stayed one night,🎗
2017-10-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a Family Reunion at Joan's place. Everyone enjoyed the house\yard so much. Joan provides outstanding hospitality\service. We already plan to return.
2017-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Looking forward to returning!
2017-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Joan was amazing and the place was flawless, beautiful home inside and out. If you're looking for something quiet and comfortable to relax this is the place to stay! We will be returning hopefully very soon!"
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is so beautiful! It's nestled among a copse of oak trees, away from the main road.
The home was built in 1892, and changed hands a few times before it got to Joan, who has done a fantastic job restoring it to its former glory. On top of the four upstairs bedrooms, there are two large living/dining areas downstairs that compliment the turn of the century home. The floors are all wood, there are at least three bathrooms (can't remember because the place is so huge), there's and upstairs patio, a grand entryway, and the patio at the back entrance of the house could easily fit about 20-30 people on it.
Outside there are loads of flowers and wildlife; Joan keeps a few lush gardens. We saw many species of butterflies and birds, the hummingbirds were what I liked most! The big oak tree you see in the picture is estimated to be over 500 years old. It's simply stunning. Her pool is a converted cement cistern that is a consistent 6ft deep all around. The best part about the pool is that it's fed by fresh well water, so it's always cool even when it's 100+ outside.
10/10 would stay again. Joan is a great host, and even got us muffins and juice for breakfast!"
2017-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Joan was a wonderful host. I enjoyed my stay. The room was comfortable, great views, peaceful and I had all the accommodations I needed. This would be a great venue for a wedding, business meeting, family reunion, etc. They have cable Tv down stairs but not in the rooms. I look forward to staying here again when I am back in town."
2017-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a hidden gem for Beeville. The property is clean and very nice. I wish we lived closer to return more often.
2017-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely wonderful experience. Surprised my wife who flew in from out of town. Joan worked with me too create a romantic seeing with appetizers and wine on the front porch upon arrival and a candle lit dinner to follow. Everything was perfect. The house was decorated with antiques and the 29 acres of land was fun to walk around and explore. A must stay if you are in the area or want to get away from city life for a couple days. Would stay there again without hesitation.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, very nice"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The stay was peaceful and quiet. The rooms were clean and comfortable. We will definitely look to book again. Thank you so much !

This was one of the best stocked AirBnBs we have ever stayed at. She has thought of everything! It was immaculate and everything was comfortable! Truly enjoyed our time here and plan to go back. It was a group of 5 ladies and the accommodations were perfect for us! Thanks Jessica for being such an amazing host!"

This is our first time renting an Air B&B, and this place and host have really set the bar. Thank you so much for everything. If we ever come back to this area, we're checking to see if this place is available before any others, that's for sure. A+"

2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"This place is top notch, very well put together and very nice. Small and cozy but enough room for us! In the heart of town with plenty of parking for our boats on extra lot and driveway. This place has it all! Highly recommended"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really appreciated no big impositions at check out, like do the dishes, clean X, Y Or Z. That's a big plus"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,beautiful place. wonderful location and private family fun! we had a great time and the host were absolutely wonderful. we couldn't have asked for any better. Thank you so much!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed at Omar and Elizabeth's several times. The house is beautiful, furnishings are very comfortable, soft towels!, and well stocked kitchen. Drink bar is a nice amenity. The porch is big and roomy - wonderful to watch the sunrise and view the Lake. The pier is well built and maintained. Very quiet neighborhood. We will be back again!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,We had an amazing time! The place was beautiful and better than we expected. This is the first time we ever had rented from the air b&b app and it was a AMAZING experience! Fishing was great too! Water was a little low but we still caught fish! Will definitely rent again!!!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exceeded expectation, definite use this place again"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very responsive. Nice place. We'll be back.
2024-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Overall had a comfortable stay. The backyard facing the lake is very beautiful. The dock, patio, bbq grill were not well maintained. The fishing rods were for the most part broken. The two toilets inside were not functioning well and the dishwasher was not also usable. The bbq grill was pretty dirty and needed to be fully cleaned and was filled with leftover ash.
Had a good stay because of the company and location but would not likely stay again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We were In Omar & Elizabeth's house in a low season, and the place was silent and peaceful. The kitchen has everything that you need. The beds are comfy and big. It's a great experience to wake up and see such a beautiful lake view from the bedroom. You can also sit on a terrace, cook something on a charcoal grill, or just swing on a swing and adore the lake view, wild birds and fresh air.
The water level was low. So it's hard to fish from the pier, but you can do this from the coast. You can buy the live bait in the nearest local store.
We appreciated the detailed instructions and proactive communication from Omar and Elizabeth. We have rented different houses on Airbnb and can say that this house is worth every penny."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had an amazing time we loved our time there it was so peaceful and nice and we felt so relaxed it’s definitely a beautiful place to get away from the city and the noise and just be :) %100 would recommend to anyone in the area it’s worth it !
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was exactly what we were looking for
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thank you Omar & Elizabeth. We enjoyed our stay.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely wonderful home, it was a last minute booking, by the cleanness, home readiness and responsiveness of the owner you would have thought it was booked months in advance. Gorgeous surroundings, beautiful views of the lake. The outdoor space was perfect, fished from the pier and relaxed on the porch. We are already thinking of going back in the spring. Fantastic host, fantastic space"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We Loved this place! Peaceful, comfortable Beautiful scenery !! Would definitely like to stay again !"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Made great memories

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Everything about this place was amazing! the space was bigger than I thought it would actually be, the view was even more beautiful in person and it cozied up as the guest arrived and the sun set. 10/10- highly recommend!!!"

2023-08-01,5,Group trip,It was an amazing stay for a weekend of many memories. The family had a blast everything was very much cleaning and organized when I arrived. The view was amazing as well very nice home. Thank you so much can’t wait to go again!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great home! This was our second visit and we will definitely be back again. Omar and Elizabeth's home is so clean and comfortable, beautifully decorated, peaceful, and the amenities are a step above any home I've rented, had everything we needed for a little time away. The home is beautifully designed, the beds are very comfortable, the towels are so soft, and the walk in shower is very nice - those little things that guests appreciate. The back porch provides a great place to gather and a great view of the Lake. My grandson loved fishing on the nice, well lit, safe pier at night. A wonderful find!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house definitely deserves a five star rating because it exceeded my expectations. It was spacious, clean, and very beautiful. The view to the lake is gorgeous especially at night when the outdoor lights are on. The place is nice and quiet. The house itself has everything you might need and more to have a great time. Hosts were very informative and responsive. Looking forward to booking again in the future!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,House is beautiful and very relaxing. Furnished with many necessities. Fishing at the pier was great. Would definitely stay there again.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay at Lake Corpus Christi! We will definitely return!
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,We had a great time! Beautiful home!
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"we had a great time- truly enjoyed ourselves and appreciated being able to bring our dogs with us! the hosts communicated quickly and provided detailed information for our stay and answered any questions we had. the house also had everything you would need to cook which was awesome!
just something to note we wish we had known about beforehand- in order to get to the water, there are shells and rocks. the water level was around 70% during our stay as well and it was a bit of a challenge to get into the water because of this. not a negative thing, just make sure you’re prepared for it is all. there is also a small beachy area down the road where it is all sand when the lake is a little higher and you don’t have that luxury at the house. we still enjoyed ourselves and had a lot of fun, so don’t let that deter you from staying here. it’s just an fyi because we didn’t know about it until we actually got down to the water.
all in all, we would definitely come back and stay here for sure!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Will definitely be coming back. My husband and I caught so many different type of fish species, we loved it!"
2023-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This place is a great get away home for the family or just couples. Very cozy and good location. We only stayed 2 nights but we enjoyed every minute of our stay. My boys loved the bunk beds and my wife and I the open living room and kitchen. Liked sitting down on the living room couch and looking at the view to the lake. The reason for the 4 stars was the back yard was not cleaned before we arrived. A lot of dead leaves where the bbq pit is, an empty beer can was by the porch, empty snuff can was on the rocking chair. It wasn’t a big deal though. We grabbed the water hose and washed all the mess and threw away the trash. Also the pier is infested with spiders. Other then that, the house was clean with a few dog hair that I swept from under the sofas."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our second stay here because we enjoyed the peace and the home so much the first time. Everything you could need is taken care of and makes for a nice stay. The lake level was higher this year than last, so unfortunately the kiddos couldn't enjoy the private beach play. Otherwise everything was very comfortable and peaceful. We hope to return again soon!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,loved it!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Omar and Elizabeth’s home was exactly what my family was looking for. We took our kayaks and large water pad and spent many hours playing on the water. We played games, watched movies, fished and enjoyed the beautiful view from the deck. It was a nice get away!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot - clean, comfy"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Omar’s and Elizabeth’s home is a great find. The house is so very comfortable; the furnishings, decor, and the layout are all great. We enjoyed the big porch in the mornings and evenings. The pier is really nice. We enjoyed the fishing. The kitchen is well stocked. Everything we needed. The house is very clean and neat. The hosts gave us a lot of information before we arrived and responded promptly when we had questions. We are already planning another trip! Thank you Omar and Elizabeth for sharing your home!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our family had such a great time here. We were attending my nieces wedding nearby and needed accommodations for a two kiddos and a one month old infant- the house was spotless and spacious and nice decor- they even had some extras that were nice surprises. Our only regret was that we couldn’t stay longer. Will definitely return in the future as this place is set up to entertain!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful! Definitely a place I’d recommend for anyone who wants to relax! The home is beautiful and makes you feel so comfortable! By far the best beds/pillows I’ve ever had! The house was beautiful and perfectly clean! Everything about this was amazing! Omar and Elizabeth are great hosts and easy to reach with a quick response!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the quiet, peaceful getaway. Omar and Elizabeth have done a great job of making guests feel cared for and pampered. The house is decorated with attention to detail. The deck and views are wonderful and the private dock well appointed. We loved it!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,My favorite place to relax is at Omar & Elizabeth's comfy home. So beautiful and peaceful out there every time we go. We look forward to staying again in the future.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,House was a great find - everything was as described and communication with hosts was easy. House was well- equipped and had a very airy kitchen/dining/living area. Wish we could have spent more time on the deck with great outdoor seating options viewing the lake. Overall a great stay.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely beautiful and peaceful! Spacious with privacy overlooking gorgeous lake views. So amazed with the setup and the pictures just don’t do it justice. We have family in the area and I can guarantee they and I will be considering this as our go-to place. I have an elderly dog that cannot stay with other people so it was a bonus to be able to bring her.
Easy check-in.
Privacy and peaceful setting.
Lake side view with ample seating, plus a pier.
Clean and well-appointed.
Just wonderful!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This lakehouse was lovely, so well appointed with many extras which was a pleasant surprise after our last experience with a superhost in Maine. Nothing was lacking including paper products, coffee, spices, and MULTIPLE streaming channels. You can fish off the dock at the house or at nearby Corpus Christi State Park at the end of the lake. There are a few short hiking trails in the park. We spent a month here and you have to be prepared for a remote area. Texas is huge. A large and smaller grocery store are 20-30 minutes away, but there is a Dollar General and Family Dollar within a few minutes. Corpus Christi is an hour away. North Padre Island National Park a little further, but worth seeing. If you want total R&R, fishing, and kayaking, this is the place for you."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time in their lake house, it was very clean and very well equipped.
The area is very quiet and the sound of the waves is very relaxing.
They provided all things to make our stay perfect without having to ask for anything as all the things were very easy to find in the house.
We will definitely come back here!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"There is nothing negative to say about this place. The house is up-to-date with everything you need to feel like it's your house for awhile. The hosts went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. The view is amazing! The back area has a very large deck with very comfy rocking chairs and a sofa. There are levels that go down to the water. It was quite windy most of the time we were there but we were able to build a fire the last night. Too chilly to go into the water. If you want a place to chill out (I painted and watched movies and my husband worked and read books) and have total peace and quiet away from the crazy world, this is the place to choose. Thank you so much Omar & Elizabeth for allowing us to borrow your home!"
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,Very satisfied with the house. Worth ever penny paid. Will be staying agian
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This lake house was perfect, better than expected! Omar was very responsive and friendly. We can't wait to stay here again in the summer! :)"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great experience all around. Perfect place on the lake. The view is breathtaking, home was very clean and well maintained throughout with plenty of amenities and house items available to use. The backyard is very nice with a lot of space to relax and enjoy the water. Very impressed with this property, the hosts are very friendly, quick to respond, and go the extra mile to make sure your stay is stress free. Would definitely stay here again in the future, thank you for providing such a great place to stay!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great place off the beaten path of constant noise and crowds. We had a great time fishing on the private pier. If you like slow and quiet this is a great place for it.
2022-10-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"My family and I like it especially back yard morning and afternoon. Buy everything you need.
Thank you, Omar and Elizabeth"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This will definitely be a repeat destination for our family. We are living in an RV and our in-laws came to visit so in lue of a boring hotel we rented the lake house!. The house is clean and spacious! There are so many places to sit and relax that our 5 adults and 1 child never felt in each others way. I did absolutely nothing but sleep in, finish a good book, stare at the lake, and cook dinner!!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Lakehouse was great. We had a fantastic time. We made many memories, and we look forward to coming back every year."
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful place. We got some good night fishing in. Everything about the home was cozy and accommodating
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great experience everything was better than expected...we had a great time best lake house in south Texas by far will go there again in the future...house was very clean and everything accessible to you and alot of items were already available...great dock fish were biting my family had a wonderful time...thank you so much Omar and Elizabeth
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,My family and I really enjoyed Liz & Omar’s home. Really enjoyed the cleanliness and amount of space that was available for my family and I. My husband and father in law enjoyed fishing it was hard to get them off of the dock! Haha. My dog also enjoyed being able to run around. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that is in the area and needs a place to enjoy family time with a nice view! Would stay here again in a heartbeat!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great place to stay
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"Great location, amazing view of the lake, and overall a wonderful stay! Omar and Elizabeth we’re excellent hosts!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Omar and Elizabeth were great from the time we booked to the time we checked out! They provided such detailed information about their property and amenities. Top notch communication! Our kids loved playing on the shore and took full advantage of all of the toys the hosts provided. We also loved being just steps away from great places to fish. Would highly recommend for families with kids! Thank you, Omar and Elizabeth!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place!! Location is great for peace and quite. We had teenagers and they loved it!! The water is down but beach was still fun and owners have everything your kids need. would also be a great place for people wanting to fish. Huge skeletons of fish found on the beach and people down the beach were catching very large fish.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This lake home is just fabulous! Great layout to take in the gorgeous view of the lake, and the huge deck with nice sized yard was great for our pups. Every amenity you can think of is included, and the extra touches with marine decor throughout make the home very cozy. Perfect for our group of 6. We will definitely be back."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home was so much more than what we expected! It's a beautiful home! I definitely will be booking it again sometime in the future. The hosts are the sweetest! They left a kind gesture for my wife since we were going for her birthday. We literally didn't have to go anywhere for any necessary items, only for food. They even had a first aid kit! The kids had a great time, as well! We definitely felt at home!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We couldn't have chosen a better place to have a getaway with our kids and our dog. The house was immaculate and had everything you could need. There were even little shampoos, conditioners, lotions and soap to use in both bathrooms which was a nice touch. The water was right there and the kids loved playing with the sand toys provided and catching minnows and clams. The views were beautiful. I honestly couldn't say enough about how much we enjoyed our stay. Elizabeth and Omar were wonderful hosts and stayed in touch and were there to answer any of our questions. We will definitely be going back. Thank you both for allowing us to share your beautiful home and giving us a place to make many fond memories at."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had an awesome family vacation here. The house makes you feel right at home, and when your out back you feel like your in a different world. Thank you for having us, we will definitely like to stay here again."
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"We had a very good time. Very private, clean, and easy to get to. We really enjoyed our stay there. It was clean and we had everything we needed. The place was lovely."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thank you so much for your hospitality! We enjoyed our vacation! Your home is so lovely and had everything we could ask for. The kids enjoyed the bunk beds and the toys that kept them busy. Most of all we loved the scenery and the view of your backyard. So relaxing! We have created so many memories and we cannot wait to return! Thank you for all your help and quick response to any questions we had. Thank you so much!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beyond our expectations…. I almost don’t want to write how AMAZING our stay was so there is availability when we want to come back.

From start to finish, Omar and Liz were on point with their communication and the home even has little reminders of important/need to know info posted. The home itself… immaculate, clean, comfortable! The attention to detail was incredible. You will have everything you need at this home! The location… private, quiet and serene. Our kids (preteens) gave this place a 10/10 on the vacation meter and I believe it’s because they basically swam in the lake with our 2 golden retrievers the whole time and felt like they were on a private island. Sunrises and sunsets are stunning! We will 100% be returning and so thankful we found this gem!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Omar & Elizabeth’s home was just as described. Our family of 4 had a great stay. We loved being right on the lake, the home was comfortable and had everything we needed. We would definitely return!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great time here! The location is tucked away in a quiet area and the personal beach access is wonderful to have with little ones. The home was very well organized and it was very clean. The layout of the home was really nice for our family and everyone remarked how much they liked it. Hosts are very responsive and all of the informative they give is thorough and appreciated! We will definitely be visiting here again soon.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great location!!! We enjoyed our stay over the 4th of July weekend. The area was very quiet and tranquil. We mostly enjoyed our time in the water. The house has its own ""beach"" when the water level is low. We enjoyed hanging out all day in the water. The best part is the owners are pet friendly. We LOVED being able to bring our dogs with us. Our dogs never wanted to get out of the water. They enjoyed the deck as much as we did, just relaxing in the shade after a day on the water.
The house is cute and has a beachy/lake theme with a HUGE deck. The beds were also super comfortable, so we had no problem sleeping. The owners provided us with enough information that we never needed to contact them.
If you need a place to stay, don't hesitate on this amazing place!! We will definitely be booking here again for another lake vacation!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful home! Almost thought we were at the beach with the sand and waves! We were looking for a relaxing vacation which is definitely what we got. Omar and Elizabeth had everything at the house that we needed including a fully stocked kitchen, washer/dryer, and charcoal grill. The house and the view are even more beautiful in person. I would definitely stay here again and I hope we get the chance soon!"
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"This house was amazing. The pictures do not do the property justice, it’s so much better in person. The house was comfortable and inviting. The porch was beyond amazing. I felt like I lived out there on my 3 night stay. The dock was perfect. You could sit on it or better yet under it to escape the heat of the afternoon. The water access was by far the best. So much swimming and floating. And by the way folks, this lake has a sandy bottom!!! Totally unexpected. Early in the morning enjoy your coffee on the porch and watch the turtles walking around the shore. The games were a nice touch for my crew too. A total of 5 of us and not once felt crowded. The kitchen is well stocked for any cooking needs you have. What we discovered is that we packed too many clothes, all you’ll need are some swim clothes, shorts and tank tops. You’ll have no need to leave the property once you get there. The entertainment is right out your back door! :) The hosts were super quick to respond to all questions I had. Always super friendly in the messages. I’m already trying to figure out how I can do a repeat next year!"
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"Place was amazing and definitely a place we will like to go back too. House
Is fabulous and location is great."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Peaceful
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the second time we stayed on Lyn's alpaca farm, the first being back in 2018. We had very good memories of it and the place was still just as amazing now as we remembered it! The cabin is cozy, practical, well laid-out and very well decorated. It's like a little home away from home. The situation on the farm is what makes the place magical. The cute alpacas, the sweet dogs, the friendly turkeys, they were all so welcoming and made this such a wholesome little haven. The green surroundings and the friendliness of Lyn and her family, who invited us for drinks on the porch on our first evening, completed the picture. This is an absolute gem of a retreat and I would recommend it to everyone who wants to spend a relaxing weekend out in the country and recharge on plenty of positive energy!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lyn and her family were so welcoming! She was very helpful and supplied ys with lots of information. We found the cabins so relaxing and enjoyed the animals. The farm was very peaceful and everything we were looking for. We haven't stopped talking about our plans for our next trip!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Without a doubt our favorite Airbnb experience yet! We’re so sad to leave but will absolutely be back! We already miss our silly new alpaca friends. Perfect from beginning to end. We loved hanging out with the guardian dogs and experiencing all the fun little personalities and interactions of the alpaca, turkey, chicken, sheep, and cats. Very peaceful and comfortable. This really is such a cool working farm and what a pleasure for Lyn and her family to open up their space for us to enjoy. Andrew’s beautiful art and the fun things in the gift shop were an added bonus as well. Truly an experience we’ll never forget!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed the view and the animals on the property.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend!! Lyn was so extremely helpful and kind! She was always responsive leading up to and during our trip. The cabins were great and we loved the alpaca tour. We were having an organizational meeting nearby and when our location fell through she even helped us find another place.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was totally awesome and peaceful as usual. This is our second visit over the years. If you want to unwind and disconnect this is the place to be. The animals will take good care of you.😉
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful and decided. That’s why you come to a place like this - because of what it doesn’t have. Plus, the livestock dogs are big sweeties. Big, dirty sweeties, but sweeties. It’s a ranch, so you’ll see and hear and smell the Aplacas and sheep, and the turkeys and chickens. Lovely place. I’d come again without hesitation."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lyn was an excellent host. Friendly, responsive and caring. The place was as advertised and had a great time. Highly recommend!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Best stay away. This was our 2nd time to have ""granny camp"" at Gulf Breeze, and it was better than ever. The welcoming environment, hosts and animals, make for a wonderful, interesting, and relaxing vacation. Already my grand daughters are asking to come again next year. In addition to a great retreat, the chance to have fiber arts instruction with Lyn is a major bonus. Her generosity and patience makes learning a totally new craft pleasurable and productive. Highly recommend taking advantage of the chance to learn soap felting, crocheting alpaca bowls, and needle felting using the best materials from her herd of alpacas and Gulf Coast Sheep. Also the selection of items made from their fibers available in the shop make great gifts. Additionally, the close proximity to Lake Corpus Christi State Park makes this a terrific location."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,this place was absolutely perfect. it was friendly and very welcoming. I felt extremely comfortable the whole time we were there. it was also not confusing like some places.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Second time staying at the property. Will stay again for our annual family reunion next year. Our 4 year old really enjoys all the animals and already named one of the dogs “big ol’ dog”.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful, relaxing cabin. Friendly helpful host!"
2023-05-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"If you want a TRUE farm experience this is the place. If you’re scared of bugs/insects stay home.
Host was extremely responsive and helpful. Cabin was cozy & clean."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet, restful, comfortable location and accommodations. Friendly, responsive hosts. An all around pleasant experience!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a comfortable stay at Lyn's cabin. The cabin was clean and well arranged. The living area was very comfy and the bed provided a good night's sleep. There was adequate hot water and the shower was good. We had difficulty with the coffee pot but otherwise found the kitchen to be functional and stocked with what we needed. We felt safe while on the farm and enjoyed meeting Lyn and all of her furry and feathered friends. A good experience all around.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was very clean and charming and was furnished with everything needed for a stay.. The alpacas were beautiful and Lyn's tour was very informative and fun! Learned about the process of turning alpaca hair into thread and ultimately into hats, gloves and adorable collectibles. The turkeys and sheep and chickens made for great watching and the dogs were very sweet and visited our cabin frequently."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It's always wonderful staying out at the ranch, seeing all the animals and being in a very quiet and peaceful area. Looking forward to my next visit."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If you are looking for a unique place to stay, this is the place. We enjoyed meeting all of the animals and the tour Lyn gave us. I recommend taking the tour, it is very interesting learning all of the different things they do. If you fish it is only 10 minutes from Lake Corpus Christi State Park."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My kids really enjoyed the farm animals, and the availability of an air mattress and pack and play was great."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lyn was an amazing host! A wonderful place to visit, take the the tour, and see how an alpaca farm works. My daughter loves seeing the different animals and petting the alpacas. We’ll definitely be back again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Been here multiple times for family getaways! We always have a great time and our kids love the animals! Can’t wait to go again
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a nice, clean, affordable, peaceful, and relaxing place to stay. The animals on the farm add to the specialness of this out of the way retreat. I have stayed here twice and highly recommend it!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here, everything was so cozy and perfect for our vacation. Having the animals on the property was such a nice treat. Lyn was a great host and we will recommend her cottage to others. Easy check in and check out, Lyn communicates very quickly too. stay here, you won't regret it!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Thank you for being the best place ever.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lyn was a wonderful host and her farm was awesome! I enjoyed meeting all the animals and seeing where the magic happens with the sheering. Will diffidently be staying again.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The only issue was that we didn't get to stay for long enough to enjoy everything in the area and Lyn's beautiful farm. The dogs were incredibly friendly and the alpacas were amazing. I look forward to staying at Lyn's sometime in the future!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was easy and pleasant all the way from checking in to checking out. Lyn is an exceptional host along with her son. If the opportunity presents itself do take the tour at her ranch it is very informative, she explains everything so well that you leave with new knowledge on the animals she works with. She truly has a passion for her ranch and hosting people. You’ll love your peaceful stay at Gulf Breeze Alpaca Ranch!!
Thank you Lyn!!
Blessings,
Salinas Family
Rio Hondo, Tx"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great experience! Everything that’s posted is exactly how it is. Comfortable beds, clean cabins, peaceful, humerus animal antics, well crafted textiles from alpaca and sheep wool. It is wasp season so there are many nests around and the setting is rural. Many critters, large and small! Fresh out of the nest duck and chicken eggs for breakfast every morning, too!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,N/a
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,perfect quiet weekend
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time. This place is incredible. Everything is so clean and organized. Lyn is a great host. She takes the time to explain in detail all of the activities in her ranch specially with the Alpacas.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I cannot say enough wonderful things about this place. Also I do not believe I use accurate adjectives either. This place provided a quiet and restful place. I would recommend this place to anyone who needs to hit the reset button. Also you really can see the Milky Way at night and it’s magical.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It's always pleasant out at the ranch. I was able to see the lambs sheared!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is a must stay place. The working farm and friendly family environment can't be beat! I cannot wait to schedule another trip.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time at our cabin. It was just like a home away from home. Would definitely stay again.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,What an amazing place. The farm is scenic and peaceful. The property was very comfortable and well equipped. We hope to visit again.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We did not really know what to expect as we came down to the Mathis area for a wedding we were attending, but Lyn's farm and AirBNB helped make our stay extremely enjoyable. Waking up to all the animals, on top of the cute and cozy cabin, complimented by great communication made this an easy 5 star rating. If we ever find ourselves back in that area, we will definitely be staying here again."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The farm was awesome. The animals and alpacas were great and friendly. Lyn was great and full of knowledge. Will definitely visit again !
2022-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,Lyn and Mark are great hosts. We enjoyed our stay and we were very comfortable in the cottage. Everything we needed was provided which included some fresh eggs. The animals were incredible and the guardian dogs were an unexpected treat. They were very friendly but also always on duty protecting the animals at night. We would definitely stay there again.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time here at the Alpaca ranch. It was my wife and I and our 3 kids 4y, 19mo and 5mo plus or 4mo boxer puppy. We all loved it! Take the tour! There is so much about alpacas that we didn’t know!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lyn's place was gorgeous, comfortable and very warm. Simply put the cabin is wonderful and the people are great! We loved the insides of the cabin, the outsides, the farm and the farm animals, and it was wonderful speaking with Lyn and her son (who makes some really nice paintings). We had a great time and we will be visiting again whenever we can next!
We loved the cabin we had. The kitchen was nice and cute and had everything we needed. The cabin had seating on the outside patios, both on the east side and the west facing sides. The living space was wonderful with cute decorations all through. The living space had a recliner, which was a brilliant touch at the end to make the space really cozy. This is a very well thought out place. It shows how much effort and thought they put into little details to make the cabin just right.
The farm and the animals add to the charm of Lyn's place. You'll see the smiling Alpacas and some very curious Turkeys as well. We wanted to take some night sky pictures near the cabin, and the cutest part was having the company of Lyn's dogs during that time. Titus (one of Lyn's dogs) probably gave us the most company and really added to the warmth of our stay. We couldn't have asked for more."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,the cabin will include most of the stuff you will need but a heb is not far away and is well stocked. I highly recommend couples to stay for some alone time and to get away from loud and bright city nights. We will be back for sure!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everyone was so wonderful ! Loved the animals ! Where we stayed was awesome , Beautiful! Nice And Clean ! They were so friendly ! Great place and loved it all !"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pack bug spray, it's south Texas youre going to need it."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,an awesome place to stay definitely coming back
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an awesome stay! Comfortable, clean, and in an idyllic environment. My wife and I really enjoyed interacting with the animals and getting to know more about Lyn and her business!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect getaway
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome little get away in the country. This is a great place to stay for a week or a short get away. Mrs Lyn was very nice and even gave us some fresh yard eggs. The animals out there were awesome and very pet friendly if you have a pet that travels with you.
Thank you Mrs Lyn."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Marvelous place. Definitely recommended!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Being out in the country was a great way to say goodbye to 2020.
The stars light up at night and there's a fireput outside. The cabins are cute and come with everything you might need. Lyn is incredibly talented and showed us her shop and around the property.
The alpacas are sweet but the dogs are the best- very friendly. It's the perfect place to unplug and enjoy the silence."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lyn and Mark are great hosts, and Titus is definitely the host with the most. He slept on our front porch every night and was the sweetest boi. The property is a lot of fun, and the cabins are really lovely. The finishing touches like nice linens really put this stay over the top for us. We can’t wait to go back!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the best place in the area to stay. We LOVED our cute little cottage for the weekend. We can’t wait to come back in years to come!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a very cozy stay in cabin 3. Lyn was very attentive and thought of all the small things to make the cabin feel like home away from home. LOVED the farm animals and especially being escorted by Titus to our door. Will definitely return!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely LOVED staying on the farm!! Mark and Lyn were incredibly sweet and helpful. Directions were easy to follow and parking was a breeze. The cabin was perfect and fully stocked with almost everything we needed. We were able to walk around the farm and see the animals whenever we wanted to. It was peaceful, quiet and relaxing. This has been the best Airbnb stay we have ever experienced. We already miss Titus greeting us every morning!! We hope to return again!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful place to stay. Very clean and comfy. The animals were amazing.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lyn and Mark are one of the most hospitable hosts we met with. They introduced us to their lovely animals in their farm and gave us a tour of their alpaca fiber studio. The carbin we stayed for 2 nights are super clean and confortable. Lyn and Mark's farm are about 2 miles away from HEB so we can easily get everything we need. It is about 40 minutes away from Corpus Christi so a perfect choice for us to enjoy both a little bit farm living experience and an easy trip to Corpus Christi to enjoy the quiet beach there. We're very glad to stay on Lyn & Mark's farm and listen to their stories of how they gradually build up their great farm.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Definitely going back again!! It’s the most wonderful place ever!! Lyn & Mark are super sweet!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I throughly enjoyed staying here for a weekend getaway! The cabin we stayed in was very cute and the perfect size for the two of us. There was a small kitchen with all of the basic things you would need to cook, and several choices to choose from for a breakfast or snack. The living room area was comfy and included access to Netflix. And the bed was queen size and super comfy! The whole cabin was very clean and well taken care of. The back patio overlooked the field where the alpacas grazed throughout the day. An amazing sight, especially with the sunset in the background!
Lyn was a great host, and was very welcoming! She took time to walk us around the property, introduced us to the different animals (my favorite was the month old lamb named Skipper), and showed us the process from shearing the animals to producing products using their fleece. It was such a neat experience!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I am glad that I chose to stay here. Due to a hurricane Laura, I had to leave town and this was the closet option from me and farthest from where the storm was headed. The cottage is cute and comfortable and with all the animals around, it really does feel like you’re living the farming life. I would definitely come another time when I’m not running away from a hurricane hahaha and enjoy every bit of it."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay! Will definitely be back in the future :)
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lyn & Mark's place was absolutely perfect for a weekend staycation, especially while social distancing! The cottage is immaculate with a fantastic view of the alpacas and lake! It has everything you need from a full kitchen to Satelite TV when you want to unwind.
Lyn was very communicative prior to my arrival, which made me immediately feel welcomed when I arrived. During my stay, she invited me to see the animals up close during feeding, which was the highlight of my stay! Overall, the experience was amazing!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is an amazing place! It was so relaxing to be surrounded by nature! The cabins are top notch! They were 100% clean and decorated so beautifully! There were flyers to local sites too! I can't recommend it enough!
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always a pleasure when we stay here!
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The perfect place for a staycation in contact with nature and animals! Great hospitality of Lynn and Mark who improvised a patio party for our wedding anniversary ! Peaceful place to stay! Contact with alpacas and a free lesson on how to work the wool made this vacation very special! High recommended!
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We fell in love with the Alpaca Ranch! The cottage is so lovely and all the thoughtful touches made our stay so comfortable! The Alpacas are so cute and the dogs that guard them are full of personality! Fresh eggs from the chickens❤️. Lyn has a lovely gift shop that we shopped. It’s so peaceful here and the sunsets over the lake are spectacular! Just the R&R we needed! We’ll be back, for sure☺️"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Lots of fun
2020-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This rental is a wonderful place to relax, unwind and visit the surrounding area."
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a wonderful experience getting to meet Mark and Lyn and all the different animals they have there. The rooms were spotless and had everything you might need on a trip. Even farm fresh eggs in the fridge. Thanks again for a great stay.
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay. The cabins were very clean, especially considering where they are located... no dirt or sand on floors. So much fun to spend time with the animals. We left a pillow and charger in our cabins. Lyn was shipped those items back to us the next day. Lake Corpus Christi State Park is minutes from the property, so we were able to go and spend some time on the lake."
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was sparkling clean, super comfortably furnished, and well equipped with so many thoughtful touches throughout. The views and the peace and quiet were awesome, and it was a relatively easy drive into Mathis. I enjoyed sitting on the back porch and just relaxing. Hosts are very nice and there is a lot to see on the farm. This place had a lot of charm! Would definitely recommend this place to stay."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A real nice stay with lots of animals, quiet location and pleasant scenery. Hosts are very nice and there is a lot to see on the farm."
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The farm and all its inhabitants are kind, warm, and friendly. The cabin is gorgeous and cleaner than home. We fell in love with the place. Didn't want to leave. Will definitely be back."
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute and quaint
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Second visit- also had a great time. Mark and Lyn are great people, the friendliest and open hearted hosts, i ever had on airbnb. We had great days with em- can only recommend their accomodation. Everything is clean and looks like the cabins are brand new. The farm is cute and their animals also- had a lot of fun with them. The state park beside the lake is also a very nice destination which you can reach in minutes."
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This serene experience is the perfect place to stay for the far away from the hustle and bustle traveler. If you want to experience a small piece of heaven with llamas to boot, this place is the place. Had a great relaxing stay in the middle of the country. Thank you!"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great experience! The cabin was sparkling clean and there were so many thoughtful touches (we really appreciated the hot sauce and olive oil), and Lyn was a wonderful host. I loved meeting the alpacas, and learning about their personalities and what goes into their care. We will definitely be by again in the future. (:"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lyn was very accommodating. The house was very clean, the bed was super comfy. It was kinda hard to find, but once we found it we really enjoyed the quiet. The dogs were supper friendly and fun to be around. We were set to stay for 2 weeks but only ended up staying 5 night. We were sad to leave."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay from amazing hosts!
2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I originally booked this cabin for the Alpacas but once we got there it was much more. It is a warm, inviting working ranch with many different animals. My daughter adored the dogs and Lyn was exceptionally sweet to let the kids help her feed the animals in the evening. She took the time to show us her shearing room and even told us the name of each and every alpaca (there were so many!) Her and Mark were such great hosts. The cabin was so wonderful and clean, and it was great being able to have my dogs on our trip. Looking forward to spending another few nights here in the future!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you have a love of animals, scenery, fishing, stargazing or just getting away, this spot delivers. Clean and comfortable spaces with a world of wonder just outside your back door! Simply amazing."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I was so pleased upon entering the cottage. It looks exactly like the pictures. Everything was so clean & I really appreciate the items and condiments that were provided. I loved hearing Lynn tell us all about the farm animals and seeing her shop. Lynn kept us up-to-date on a maintenance issue that occurred and the issue was resolved in no time at all. My husband and I look forward to being repeat guests!
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a precious getaway for us. It was clean, updated with all the amenities. Very unique.
Will definitely stay there next time we go."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a hidden gem in the woods. Lyn and her family are wonderful hosts. The treat are the alpacas, horses, and their friendly dogs. It is so peaceful here. At night, you can see the stars and planet. Also the cottages are practically brand new fully stocked with everything you need - towels, dishes, fridge, stove, a/c"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had an amazing stay and enjoyed being surrounded by different animals. If you’re looking to spend some time with the Alpacas be sure to be available after 6PM as Mark does chores around that time and the Alpacas are much more social when he’s there. City life and beaches were 30 minutes to an hour away so be sure to plan ahead.
2019-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,great place to get away
2019-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great!
2019-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,A clean & peaceful stay
2019-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My out of state girlfriend was visiting me and I wanted to take her to a nice quiet getaway. I happened to stumble upon this bed & breakfast and it has become one of my favorite places I’ve stayed at! The hosts were very hospitable and even took us on a tour of their farm. I suggest being there by 5:30 pm since that’s feeding time. It will give you a good chance to see all the farm animals up close such as alpacas, sheep, turkeys and miniature ponies. The cabin itself had everything you could possibly need to cook, a smartTV with access to apps like Netflix, and great cell reception. I would highly recommend to any couples looking for a quiet getaway on a beautiful farm!"
2018-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I needed a place to relax for a few days with my newly adopted dog and other dog, and this little cottage was exactly right for that! The dogs could be as loud playing as they wanted to without disturbing anyone.
They thought of every little detail inside and provided things like silverware and cleaning supplies I didn't even realize I needed until the time came - having to clean up a few messes from dogs tramping mud back in, and the new dog spontaneously deciding to join me in the shower, and bringing food back to eat and realizing there weren't utensils. We spent a wonderful two nights here and slept very well. Thank you for having us!"
2018-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Very nice, new, clean, and homely cabin. Lyn and Mark were so friendly and accommodating. One month flew by. The aplaca, sheep, turkeys, and their cats and dogs were just an added bonus. Everything you need is in the cabin with a nice grilling area out back. The porches are perfect for relaxing in the evenings or early morning coffee. Beautiful, serene lake on the ranch as well. I highly reccomend staying here if ever in the area.
Thank you, Lyn and Mark for your superb hospitality."
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you Mark and Lynn for having us on your ranch. You've been fabulous hosts to us and we have loved every moment of our retreat. We will miss the alpaca therapy and please give extra pets, hay, love to Hans for us! This has been a spectacular Thanksgiving and we thank you so much for making it extra special. 🐾 Joel & Zara"
2018-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is amazing. From the smallest details to the welcoming hosts! The animals on the farm are friendly and so fun to visit. This Airbnb has taken in account everything to make your trip perfect! Thank you for an awesome trip, look forward to visiting again!!"
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,May be one of the best places We’ve stayed. Definitely will be making a return trip. The place gave a real “at home” feeling and that was well appreciated. Top notch hospitality as well. I definitely would recommend...✌🏾
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! We had amazing time at Lyn and Mark’s ranch. We felt like we were visiting friends. They have an amazing ranch filled with friendly animals, great stories, and incredible talents! The cabin is super comfortable, cute, and is stocked with everything we needed to cook and then some. Great views of the lake and ranch. Overall wonderful and peaceful experience. We would love to visit again. Thank you!"
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Friendly hosts and very clean cabin. They had thought of most things you might need and had them on hand. Lots of thoughtful little extras that most places I have been to don't provide.
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin and the view are beautiful and relaxing. There are many extra touches that made the stay extra special.
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exceptional. We are frequent ""AirBNB'ers"". This place was so special. Close to the beaches of the Gulf and right by a beautiful fresh-water lake. On a ""fiber farm"" which is just wonderful. Owners love the animals and the place is well manicured and cared for. A real retreat. Cabin was sparkling, new and very comfortable."
2018-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,The cottage was amazing! The ranch was awesome! My daughter had so much fun running around looking at the animals. We had a very quiet and relaxing weekend! We will for sure go back
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place nice and quiet
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was beyond our expectations, very modern and well kept. This stay definitely beats any hotel room by far, the thoughtfulness of Lyn & Mark to provide simple things like a bowl of fruit truly make you feel at home. We will definitely return in a heartbeat to this amazing farm!"
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lyn and mark were very hospitable and kind. We got into town at 3
In the morning and they made sure we had pictures leading us right up to where we were staying. The cottage was extremely clean and supplied with anything a person would need for a very comfortable stay. The ranch was beautiful and the animals were a great addition to have around. I very highly recommend this place to stay."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lyn and Mark’s place is a comfortable place to stay for what ever you have planned.
My wife and I had a very restfully time; even with all me had to do during or visit."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lyn and Mark place was a great place to stay at. They are both wonderful people, who answered questions when we had them. Would definitely stay there again! Had a great time at their beautiful cabin."
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed 2 days at the ranch. We loved the cabin - it’s a great size for 2, furnished and decorated tastefully and very clean! Then the location - quiet, on a ranch with alpacas, chickens, dogs, sheep, and cats. Lyn and her husband are very friendly and Corpus Christi isn’t too far away, with state parks nearby as well."
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great weekend staying at the ranch. The cabin was clean, and cozy, and has everything you need for a comfortable stay. Lyn and Mark are very kind and fantastic hosts as well. If you’re looking for a different kind of weekend get away, this will be perfect."
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place is great! Cabins are really nice. We were located in between the beach and corpus christy Lake so it was nice to have both options.
2018-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent get away for 2 in the country. The Corpus Christi lake is within view of the property. The location is quiet and peaceful.
2018-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alpaca your bags and get ready to ruffle your feathers. This is the best place you cud ask for in airbnb. In case of the alpacalypse, I'll be ramming my way through the gate to stay again! Shearly the best hosts around too, fur real! Just book it, then you'll understand."
2018-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place really is wonderful and quaint. In a really nice small town and the homes location is just 10 minutes from the state park with fishing, hiking, birdwatching, and water activities. The actual home location is beautiful and so is the interior of the house. The people who run this farm and put together the Airbnb stay spot are awesome friendly people. They took us out on their boat and even let us hangout and cook everyone dinner on their outdoor grill. Honestly I was a little put off and not sure what to expect from the pictures and I was worried about seeing three small units next to each other but it wasn’t an issue at all. The inside of the home is way nicer that I could tell from the pictures. My wife and I will definitely be back and be cause there are two units we might even bring some friends with us."

Claire & her husband were awesome great hosts. If you want to get away to the country this is the place.
J. Alanis"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing! Definitely bringing the kids next time. The property is something out of a Texas fairy tale probably the most peaceful place I’ve ever been to. We will be back!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,What a lovely place to get away from the world for a while. I spent a week with my dog enjoying long walks and afternoons on the porch watching collections of birds at the feeders. The host(s) were super responsive and helpful to everything i asked. Fully recommend for a weekend away or longer.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had so much fun exploring the property with our dogs! We loved seeing all of the wildlife, and we especially loved interacting with the donkeys. We also really enjoyed just sitting on the porch watching the birds and squirrels-- it was such a serene and peaceful place to spend the weekend. Claire was so friendly, and we really appreciated the hospitality! We can't wait to come back sometime in the future."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great secluded retreat! Claire was wonderful! Don’t miss the ranch tour, complete with beautiful mini-donkeys!! We will be back!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The hummingbird house is super cute and cozy. Well maintained and decorated the place looks much more attractive than the pictures! A great place to observe nature and wind down from the city. Particularly l loved to see the birds if you interested on it. We loved the donkeys and our overall stay. We most likely will be returning!
Claire was very nice and attentive to show the ranch around and provided a map so we could explore by ourselves. She is so knowledgeable that we felt in a guided tour with a ranger! We absolutely loved our conversations with her. It was super fun stay and to meet them. I highly recommend!
I stayed with my husband and dog. The porch is really nice and you can close it so the dog has some space to be without the leash. Trails are well maintained, easy and very accessible by walk or by car. There is place to barbecue and repellent for night is a must. HEB is 20min away in Beevile and you can find everything you need there."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Me and Jacob explored so much of this property and it was such a beautiful well kept place! We can’t wait to go back to explore more and feed those lovely donkeys.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is peaceful. Claire was great to work with us. The history of the house is interesting and I’m glad they are sharing it with others. We enjoyed the fire pit, hammock, birds, and over sized tub. (As well as a tour of the ranch.)"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband, pooch and I stayed in the Green Jay House. We loved it. The house was nicely cared for and comfortable. Had everything we needed and then some.
The porch faces out on shrubbery & trees, with several bird feeders spread out on the front area. It was great sitting out with our coffee and watching the variety of birds come visit for a bite to eat.
The property is extensive, peaceful, very natural and provides lots of walking paths.
The miniature donkeys came by the cabin to visit on our last day. They are very gentle and love to be petted. They also love carrots!!
Claire was a great host. Visited us on our first day to provide an overview of the land and to make sure we had everything we needed for our 3 day stay. She even came by on our last day and took me for a ride to visit 6 rescued min. donkeys that arrived that morning.
We would definitely recommend staying at one of the cabins at Claire's if you like nature and quiet."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Claire’s place is absolutely divine! So cozy and lovely inside and the outdoor porch is like a dream! There are so many different birds to watch and the hummingbirds are so fascinating! There are also tons of beautiful butterflies! My dogs and I had such a peaceful getaway and we will definitely be back. Claire is so warm and kind and made me feel right at home. The hammock is to die for and there was a perfect fire set-up ready to be lit in the fire pit outside! Thank you so much for a wonderful weekend in the country!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect retreat to escape in nature. This little nest was perfect for my dog and I. She had the best time! The spot has all you could need plus some extra special touches. Claire is so sweet and goes above to make sure you're comfortable and happy in your stay. The bed is comfy, the outdoor area is beautiful with a nice hammock and closed patio space, there's lots of land to explore. It's a spot I'd definitely book again! The only reason to stay away would be if you're scared of bugs and dirt because it's definitely and outdoor haven meant to be enjoyed as such!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyable time spent, 3 great relaxing days spent at Claire’s property!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Claire was so helpful throughout the booking. My friend stayed and had a wonderful quiet escape weekend. Everything was perfect and she enjoyed her stay so much! Highly recommend!

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is a wonderful little getaway! A great way to find some peaceful time.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"very peaceful, great place to stay."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So nice to stay in nature, away from city noise and stress. The Hummingbird House is the one on the edge of the big vista of flowers. trees, birds, and donkeys. We were mostly by ourselves on the property (no other guests), so it was very peaceful. I think it would have been anyway. We could open the windows and let in the breeze. You can even, privately, see the landscape from the big bathroom window. Of course there are also efficient shades in the house ofr privacy and dark sleeping.
We were only there two days, but we got in some big hikes, some donkey socializing, some enjoyment of rain, stars, and sunset, and some good naps.
The house has everything you could need---Claire is very thoughtful, providing it all, from very comfy mattress and organic mosquito repellant, to the makings of s'mores and an evening fire. It is also pretty, with nice old quilts, hummingbird art, and soft colors. If you are a native Texan from a small town, it may remind you of childhood."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Hummingbird House is lovely! The land is fun to explore and the actual house is packed with amenities. Claire is a great host.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at Claire’s ranch! The ranch was great, and we loved seeing the donkeys and birds! Road in property was easy to navigate. Overall a great place to stay!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the most amazing weekend at Claire's! To start, Claire was kind enough to update as to the green jay cabin as it was a very cold and rainy weekend and she thought it would be warmer. We were so cozy.
The birds were incredible and we say some new ones, like the green jays and golden fronted woodpeckers. We saw so much wild life as well as the sweet donkeys and Claire's dogs and cat. Claire told us some great stories about birds and land as well as took us on a tour. We will be back."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a wonderful place to relax and enjoy nature! The ranch is over 700 acres, which is bigger than some state parks I’ve been to. Claire and Wilfred were very welcoming. The cottage is very comfortable, has everything you could need, and is very clean. The bed is super comfortable, too. If you’re in the area, stay here! And if you’re not, it’s worth the trip."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved everything the ranch had to offer for the type of get away we needed. The Green Jay Cottage was so comfy and we felt right at home. The view of the birds from the porch was spectacular. If you're looking for a special and quite( except for an occasional MOO!) place to be at peace.. .. this is the place for you to say.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and relaxing retreat. Walking paths, ranch animals, very accommodating hosts! Even had fire pit ready to light! A thoughtful, personalized note written on chalkboard, welcomes you making you feel all the more welcome!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We originally had reserved the Hummingbird House for our honeymoon but Claire moved us to the Green Jay Cottage due to the weather so we would have a covered porch. This is a perfect example of how much she takes care of her guests. The love and care she has put into her property shows in so many ways. The bird feeding stations are creative and the miniature donkeys are so cute!
When we arrived she had prepared the fire pit for us so all we had to do was light it, and she even had s'more supplies ready to go. Everything was wonderful down to the last detail."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,amazing and relaxing stay!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,20 miles from any store.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was amazing! Once we found it there was nothing but options to explore! Had a ton of fun while here! If you are looking for a place to have some peace and quite this is the place for you! They accommodated us for any situation we had!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful and quiet farm stay is the best way to unwind the stress from work and life. We appreciate the generosity and hospitality from our host, Claire and Wilfred, that made our stay extraordinary. There was enough space to explore on their ranch. Our almost 2-year old daughter had lots of fun feeding donkeys and playing at the backyard. The drive to nearby towns is convenient with reasonable distance. Highly recommend to someone needs an internet free time to be with nature."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very beautiful property. Claire was very nice and helpful. Will definitely visit again.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot say enough wonderful things about this ranch! The owners Claire and Wilfred are so kind, welcoming, and just a joy! We stayed in the Green Jay Cabin, and lacked for nothing. The front porch with its rocking chair set in front of a tree filled with birds feeders was our favorite spot. We observed so many different species of birds, from tons of flitting hummingbirds to the green jays the house is named after. Each cabin has their own fire pit with everything you need to start a fire including the firewood. Each house has tree swings, rope swings, hammocks, lawn chairs, grills, our tables, and beautiful landscaping. The bath towels are plush and thick, the water pressure perfect, and basic shower toiletries provided. The kitchen here has everything you could need for a home cooked meal, including spices. The coffee, tea, and fixings are such a thoughtful touch. Everything here is a prefect little slice of country heaven. On a dark night you can go to the observation deck and even see the Milky Way. My favorite spot on the beautiful ranch is the pond where the donkeys hang out. The are the friendliest, cutest herd of donkeys I have ever encountered. I was definitely in my donkey heaven!
But what truly set this place apart from any other stay in my years and years of travel was the welcome and friendship offered by Claire and Wilfred. We spent a lovely evening with them, and both my spouse and I came away feeling we had known them and been friends all of our lives. If you are looking for an amazing place to stay in the Goliad area please do yourself and your family a favor and look no further, you have found a little piece of heaven on earth right here!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,All around good experience. Would come back again.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property is a real treasure. My mom and I spent a beautiful weekend in the cozy Green Jay cottage and enjoyed all the comforts of home and then some. We loved watching the birds every morning and the beautiful wildflowers. Though we didn't explore too much of the property this time, we enjoyed every bit of it. We enjoyed bright, beautiful stars at night and made a roaring fire. Claire and Wilfred are excellent hosts and go above and beyond to make sure their guests enjoy their time. I am looking forward to many more adventures at Barnhart Q5!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay at Claire and Wilfred's ranch was absolutely amazing! From feeding the donkeys to laying out on the star gazing platform and everything in between, it was the most serene trip we have ever been
on! There is so much to do and see that you really need more than a weekend to take it all in! Claire and Wilfred are by far, the most exceptional hosts that we have ever encountered, and we absolutely cannot wait to return for a longer
stay in the near future!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Claire was a great host she gave us a map of the land and let us use the club car to get around faster. She responded quickly and made sure we had everything we needed great stay
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the stay, the butterflies and the birds were amazing. The breath of fresh air from the every day monotony that life gets at times. It was great to have a little spot to get away to. Thanks Claire for letting us into your hummingbird cottage! Will be back soon!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place for birding!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,If you want some time to reflect or just need to get away from your normal routine this is the place! The property is amazing and the wildlife did not disappoint so be ready! With the opportunity to ride around the place in a golf cart day and night was just the thing we needed. We saw quite an array of wildlife and had so much fun!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to get away from the hustle and bustle. Cottage had everything we need and our hosts were very accommodating. We'll be back.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a lovely place. I saw so many different types of birds. The cows and donkeys were great. Claire was very welcoming, took me in a tour. Will definitely be back."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quite the hidden Gem!!! Claire and her husband are amazing. If you get a chance to talk to either of them I recommend it. This location was so lovely even if it did rain on us the entire time. With all that we have going on in our day to day and with wedding plans, this was the perfect retreat for both of us. It allowed us to enjoy some much needed one on one time and gave us time to discuss wedding details in a relaxing environment. The rain kept us indoor but allowed us to relax, play card games, talk, joke, and all sorts of things. The nights storm as chaotic as they were brought a sense of calmness to our spirit. This is a great place to disconnect from the crazy world and reconnect with ourselves or loved one and nature. The miniature donkeys coming by for their daily dose of love are amazing! The hummingbirds amongst all other Inhabitants on the property were great to see. We look forward to coming back again and bringing along others to share in the experience. We left this property relaxed, well rested and with joy in our hearts!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We don’t even know where to begin on reviewing our stay and to keep it short with words haha. We were celebrating our 17yr Anny and they made us feel so special even with a note a the fridge 🥰 This place was amazing. We rented their golf cart and ended up driving 23 miles total viewing all of the acreage going down every path we could take. To even have the opportunity on doing that is amazing in itself. Claire and Wilford were definitely the icing on the cake. We learned so much by chatting with Claire(taking up too much of her time haha) about their ranch and even surrounding properties. I’m saddened by the loss of rain they have had drying up so many ponds. Barnhart will stay on my prayer list to get enough water to return it back to its beauty. We absolutely loved the donkeys and waking up in the morning to see them all grazing in the pasture. Then feeding them carrots was an awesome experience. Thank you so much and we will be back with our kids!!
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Although I wasn’t able to make my trip due to some last minute things that came up, Claire was very fast in responding and very understanding and caring. I’ll be back soon, for sure!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Claire's 706 acre property is so beautifully taken care of. Critters of all kinds call it home, and the cozy Hummingbird House was my home away from home for a much needed quiet weekend under the stars. Definitely off the beaten path but with all the comforts of home, Claire has truly thought of it all. I can't wait to continue visiting this beautiful gem!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing weekend Barnhart Ranch! The space itself is so cozy and inviting, but the outdoor was our favorite part of the stay! There are so many things to see and do on the Ranch (meeting the donkeys was a highlight!) and then Goliad is also a short scenic drive away. Claire and her husband were helpful and so nice. Can't wait to go back!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place, clean it has everything you need to send a great outdoor time."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This piece of heaven is out in the country where peace, relaxation and sanity can be found. The breeze and lack of humidity made sitting on the porch a relaxing time. The variety of beautiful birds sing lullabies that calm the soul. The night's basin of stars caused us to fall in love all over again, so be careful because it may do the same for you! Claire made our stay great. Her sweetness was the icing on the cake."
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is fantastic for a peaceful stay in the country. The Green Jay House is just right for a couple or a small family. The place is neat, clean and has all the essentials for a relaxing stay. Birds and wildlife are right outside the front door. Claire is a terrific host providing quick responses to any request. Wilfred's tour was a fantastic way to get the know the property. Goliad is less than 30 minutes away and provides a lot of Texas history as well as couple nice restaurants. Try the Empressario Restaurant for a good dinner at a reasonable price."
2018-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful little place in the country! We enjoyed the peace and tranquility so much. And Claire was so helpful, kind and sweet about everything! We wish we would've had more time to explore the property, but figure this gives us a good excuse to have to come back. I think we spent the most time on the front porch in the rocking chairs. If you're looking for a quiet getaway, with beautiful stars at night, this is an awesome option! And, those donkeys.....adorable little guys!!"
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I spend parts of 3 days at the Hummingbird House at Claire's place. As advertised the Hummingbird House is very small but nicely furnished... and has a nice, large porch area in front with table, chairs, and benches. We grilled for two meals and had both fire wood and charcoal provided. We much enjoyed Claire's taking us for a tour of the ranch and her introducing us to their miniature donkeys... wonderful! My wife and I like nature photography and we saw/photographed 18 different species of birds including American Kestrels, Green Jays, Couch's Kingbirds, Cara-Cara, Pyrrhuloxia, Blue-gray Gnatcatcher, a number of different hawks, etc. Claire and her husband are great hosts!"
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great weekend at the ranch. We loved the donkeys, cows, hummingbirds, driving around the property, star gazing, and evening bonfires. Can't wait to come back and visit!"
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Claire is awesome, it's refreshing to know people like Claire exist! The experience was like a trip to sanity...nature at it's best. We will be back, hopefully many times. Thanks for the tour of the ranch & the sweet considerations!"
2018-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved my stay at the ranch - my only regret was that I couldn't stay longer (but I'll be back for sure!) Claire and Wilfred were so kind and welcoming, and the whole experience was a balm to my soul. From touring the ranch to meeting the donkeys to stargazing to lots of hammock/porch time...it was all just perfect. The Green Jay Cottage was lovely, too!"
2018-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great hosts, great place, great peace and quite, great everything. We will definitely be booking again in the future!"
2018-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is easily my favorite AirBnb I've ever stayed in. Clair is the best host ever, so welcoming and friendly. This was my third time staying there, and each time, I wish I could stay longer! The lodgings are wonderful... clean, nicely furnished and decorated, very comfortable. The ranch is an oasis of wildlife. Just a peaceful getaway destination that I love!"
2017-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice retreat from the city. A great place to relax, renew, and rebalance life priorities."
2017-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This a great location to enjoy open space and nature.
2017-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay has been wonderful, and it's not over have decided to stay on a few more days to enjoy the scenery while I work"
2017-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"It has been wonderful staying at the Humming bird house. My dogs and I have loved our time in the country away from all the lights and noise, so you can see the stars!"
2017-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Barnhart Q5 Ranch and Wildlife Preserve was much more than I expected! With no phone, internet, or TV, I thought it would be hard to fill the hours. The complete opposite was true! Bird watching, hiking, seeing the wildlife and miniature donkeys made it a great retreat!
Claire was the most gracious host I have ever had on airbnb (and I've been to a few!). She made me and my 80 year old mom right at home. She gave us a tour of the ranch, told stories, and was generally just so kind and friendly.
The accommodations were very nice. We stayed at the Green Jay cottage, and it was perfect! Loved sitting on the porch in the rockers, watching all the birds come right up on the porch rail and on the feeder.
Stargazing there is unbelievable... you can see the Milky Way galaxy from right outside your cottage. There is also a stargazing platform -- I will definitely check that out next time I go there!
Overall, this was a great place to stay and get away from it all. I will definitely be back... soon! My mom is already asking when we can go back!"
2017-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, plenty of room, and just what we were looking for. Kids and dogs had a great time"
2016-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the most beautiful time. There are so many animals -- donkeys, birds, frogs, bunnies, cows, bats, even a wild pig -- all roaming freely and in harmony. We walked up to the star-gazing platform each evening and stood for an hour, watching the sun set and the moon come out. So relaxing, such a pleasure, every minute. Thank you, Claire! We will be back."
2016-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My family and I visited Claire's amazing hidden gem this past Memorial Day holiday. It was so much fun to spend some quiet time in nature. My almost 4 year old nephew had so much fun running wild and petting the adorable miniature donkeys.
The town of Goliad was also fun to visit. It was a holiday so most of the town was closed but we managed to have a nice walk around the historic downtown. Presidio La Bahia has a neat history of Texas.
Claire's house had everything we needed to have a great weekend. The house was perfect and the history behind it is very interesting."
2016-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Barnhart Q5 Ranch is a hidden treasure in TX! What an amazing spot for our family to spend four days. We can't recommend it enough. Claire is an amazing hostess and we felt family staying at her place. The Green Jay cottage was perfect for our 4 person family (3 year old and a 9 month old baby)- and we hope to come back with friends to stay at the main (bigger) house. The cottage was cute, cozy, clean, and had all the amenities we needed. The miniature donkeys are peaceful, beautiful creatures who did not mind at all while our children petted, shrieked and jumped around them. There is also a swing set (with a baby swing!), a cow roping setup for the kids, and endless animals for them to spot. We also spent a few days in Goliad, touring Presidio la Bahia, and caught a livestock show and a carnival. This small town has a lot going on and kept us remarkably busy for 4 days. We're home now and already miss the ranch!"
2016-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I enjoyed a two night stay here at the Q5 Ranch, and it was one of our most magical stays at a B&B. Claire is so warm and friendly, and she made us feel like friends. We got to stay in a beautiful, historic restored farm house set in the South Texas hills. We hung out with the resident mini donkeys, hiked and explored, bird-watched, star-gazed, and really got a chance to disconnect from our phones and reconnect as a couple. We played board games and cooked in the full kitchen instead of watching TV or looking at social media. It was wonderful to be awakened by birdsong and to enjoy the stillness of the country. We got to tour Goliad before our stop here, and once we got to the ranch, we didn't want to leave! We will definitely be back. Don't miss staying at this beautiful place!"
2016-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a fantastic time at the ranch! Claire was so wonderful and showed our kids all the sights and sounds including a cattle round up! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and plan on going back as often as we can.
2015-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything at Claire's ranch was incredible. If you are looking for the perfect relaxing weekend getaway, come here. The cattle & donkeys on the property were so nice! We will definitely be back."
2015-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Clare was an extremely generous and caring host. The Barnhart Ranch was idyllic- we entered the bright green fence everyday to find grazing cows and then a lively group of donkeys up the path surrounded by cute dogs, a cat with a unique personality, and tons of rabbits. The houses we stayed in were gorgeous, neatly decorated with a southern country flare, and kept extremely clean. We were impressed that there were minimal insects living inside the house and extraordinary outdoor insect and bird watching. We saw the neatest spiders, bees, ants, and even went horny toad searching. The property had a multitude of paths that led to a stargazing platform and peaceful edges of the property where we were completely surrounded by trees and wildlife. Clare always answered our questions, was great to chat with, and became a good friend. We will definitely stay again soon. Five stars all around!"
2015-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An absolutely wonderful experience. I have to admit we were a little hesitant this would be our first airbnb experience. We arrived finding gracious hosts and left feeling like we had found friends. Our little cottage was perfect for our get away. We needed so much to unplug for a few days, reconnect and recharge. All that was accomplished and more. All you need to pack are your clothes, toiletries and food. Everything else is there when you arrive. The ranch is beautiful, so much fun to explore. My personal favorite were the donkeys. I'm spend the last three days trying to talk my dad into selling his cattle and getting donkeys. Love, love, love!"
2015-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our little family vacation to the ranch was just perfect! The house is incredibly beautiful and special - had every creature comfort but still felt like stepping back into a simpler time. Claire also has impeccable design sensibilities - everything is just beautiful and thoughtful - down to fresh cut wildflowers from the ranch. Claire couldn't have been a more gracious and graceful hostess - she made us feel so at home! We hope to be back time and time again. This is a real gem!
2015-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a wonderful stay on a beautiful ranch in south Texas. Horny Toads, fishing, harvester ants, a huge variety of birds and butterflies, about 35 great little donkeys, wildlife, cattle, and a really nice working ranch. Add to this we stayed in an outstanding house built in 1877 and so nice that you just want to live there, and now. On top of all of this, Claire Barnhart, a fantastic Texas lady and conservationist that was our host! She took us on a tour of the ranch and told us everything we wanted to know and didn't rush us through it. My three granddaughters really liked and appreciated Claire. She is just the best. What a place this was. We had a bedroom that was almost 60 x 20. What a comfortable bed! The kitchen was really fun to cook in. We are going back and can't wait"
2015-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our visit to Claire's ranch was truly amazing..it was beyond our expectations!! Claire and her husband are just lovely..the wildlife..donkeys..dogs..cat..all just so wonderful. We came at the absolute best time of year, wildflowers in bloom everywhere making the trails so beautiful. Our house was perfect and we can not wait to find time to vacation here again!"
2014-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Far and away the best place we have EVER stayed on Airbnb--and we've stayed in a lot of places. The cabin was beautiful, Claire was an amazingly generous, kind and patient host. It's hard to think of what we DIDN'T do while we were there: We went on a cattle round up, played with the donkeys, hiked, had our own golf cart, watched movies, played board games, bbq'd, had a fire in the fire pit, did some target practice, visited Goliad--a beautiful historic town from the 1700s a half hour away, cooked, relaxed, even got some work done. And the price? This place is a deal.

We will definitely be back again."
2014-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a great time during our short stay at the Q5 ranch, Claire and Wilfred have created a true sanctuary for people to unwind in and we left feeling happy and refreshed.

The guest houses are impeccable and we found everything we needed to grill up a nice dinner to enjoy as the sun set out on the porch.

I can't wait for our next visit to the ranch-- it's a real gem of a place :)"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"My partner and I were in town for a paddling race on the San Antonio River. This was the perfect getaway to unwind after the race!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you are looking for a quiet place to stay, with millions of stars in the sky, that’s the perfect place.
Richard and his dogs are so friendly and we felt welcome in the very first minute.
A clean apartment with all you need.
Sadly we were just staying for one night. I really would’ve loved to stay longer. But sadly our vacation has to end sometime.
Richard, God bless you and your family."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay at Richard's place. I was perfect for our needs on our particular trip.

2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay. We were looking for a quiet place and found it. Richard's place was great. There are amenities on site I've not seen before for a small Airbnb (pool and gym). The owners live on site - the Airbnb is above their garage attached to the house, so not the most private location, but it wasn't an issue for us. They had two sweet, vocal dogs who greeted us one afternoon, and a cat watching from afar. Overall, we liked our remote Goliad weekend getaway!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Hands down best deal on Airbnb in this area. My only regret is not staying longer.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a great location. Good experience.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"My wife and I stayed her for one night for our anniversary. It was great. Richard is great! He was easy to work with and flexible. We enjoyed the inside and outside, including the dogs and seeing the chickens, and walking the property. We enjoyed the balcony for star gazing and for the solar eclipse that happened while we were there. The kitchen was equipped for our needs. Would definitely go there again. Many thanks to Richard for making his place available and being very welcoming."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved my stay and hope to stay more often this year! Definitely recommend! 10/10!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for a cozy comfortable and peaceful accommodation, this is it! Richard has a treasure of a place that feels like a home away from home. You won’t be disappointed! I would not hesitate to stay again or recommend to family and friends."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We booked this little garage apartment for its solitude & privacy over a hotel in town. Richard’s place is quiet, clean, private and far more cost effective than staying in town.
I took a dip in the pool after my coffee and then we got to meet Richard as he walked his property feeding his animals. He was so friend and gave us 5 fresh eggs for breakfast. Yum!
Wish we could’ve stayed longer but this was a quick trip. We’ll definitely be back since we have friends just down the road.
Thanks for the hospitality Richard! Many blessings.😊"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,all I can say is... I'm not a nature or wildlife person but I was very comfortable and at peace.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place to stay!
Just what we needed for our brief visit. Hope to stay longer another time. Very comfortable setting, felt right at home. The cleanliness was divine. The host was splendid. No flaws. And the sweet greeters Mel and Thor…loved it. Thank you!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great place! Great host!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The place was very wonderful and clean and cool! (the last isn't always a given in the middle of Texas!)
Richard was absolutely wonderful and very flexible. I had been in the area because my grandmother had passed away, so was more than a little frazzled, and had to do some major last minute rescheduling because of all that. Richard was very understanding and kind the entire way, got me a refund for the days I didn't end up spending there, and that was it.
The eggs are real and delicious, and the dogs he has are in fact friendly, although they will run up to you. Let them sniff you a bit and it'll be all good. I mention only in case somebody else is like me and a bit nervous around dogs. :)
Definitely recommend."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Appreciate Richard’s hospitality!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay here and would definitely recommend for a relaxing, peaceful getaway. We appreciated the thoughtful touches that Richard provided- including fresh eggs for breakfast! We felt very welcomed."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend , Josh, and I cannot say enough wonderful things about the hospitality of Richard and his dogs Thor and Mel. I’m from Goliad, I said I would never move back, yet staying here made me immediately reconsider. Richard instantly reminded me of the down-home friendliness this community has. Since it’s been a while since I’ve ventured about town, he offered the perfect dining suggestion (La Terrazza) for my boyfriend and my parents to break bread together.
Greeted by the friendliest dogs you’ll ever meet, don’t let the initial light growls scare you. They are puppies in big dog suits. The bright and open space within the garage apartment makes it feel like you’re sleeping under the stars. Believe me, I found myself lost staring up through the large windows of the A frame space. The fresh eggs left by Richard were the perfect inspiration that lead my boyfriend to treat me to a midnight dish of steak and eggs - consumed, of course, under those beautiful stars. Perfection!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Always a great rest on my stop-overs here. This apartment has absolutely everything.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a wonderful private, peaceful retreat not far from town. Everything was manicured outdoors and immaculate indoors. All is well furnished...we had the choice of 3 different kinds of coffee pots! Everything we needed was provided even paper cups for teeth brushing. The balcony was the place for incredible star gazing. Richard was a gracious host who made us feel at home. I wish this place was closer as I would spend time in the pool relaxing and enjoying nature."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,It was really nice wish i would have booked for a longer time
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was very nice, peaceful and quiet.. I would definitely stay here again."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is a gem. In the middle of nowhere but close to everything at the same time. It’s clean, cozy and perfect for a gateway. My daughter and I enjoyed our stay here. Thank you Richard."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,exelente place exelete alfritrion
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The stars at night were beautiful. The place was perfect for coming in and staying to see family. We will be back!

2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is beautiful and quiet. Richard is a great host. You will not be disappointed. we had a great stay. Thank-you. well be back.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Richard was super welcoming and accommodating even with a last-minute booking! He met us upon arrival and showed us where to go. The property is beautiful! Everything was nice and clean! Would definitely stay again if we are in the area!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,We arrived late and Richard was on site with some friends. They were very friendly and helpful. His dogs were super friendly and adorable! The apartment was very cozy and exactly as described. We had a fantastic stay!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay here. It’s the third time we’ve stayed here and we’ll keep coming back!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very nice accommodations in a safe, rural setting. Host has provided plenty of amenities with an abundance of extra pillows, linens and kitchenware. There is a well maintained above ground pool and exercise equipment you’re welcome to use. We particularly appreciate the lack of light pollution and enjoyed sitting out on the balcony porch later in the evening. We do not have small children, but many safety precautions are put in place in case you’re traveling with some."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Richard was great and we loved the doggos!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This was my second stay at Richard's place to extend on my first night. Would come again.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Richard's place, The Engine Room had everything we needed for our trip. The place had an instruction manual that made it easy to find what we needed. The spot was secluded and quiet and we all got a good night's rest. There were also some friendly dogs on the property that greeted us the next day. I would recommend this spot and would likely visit again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Off the beaten path . . . BUT super quiet and relaxing. This place is a real gem. Will stay again when I am in the area.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place. Clean and well maintained! A+ in my book!
2022-10-01,4,Stayed one night,Everything was great. Loved the dogs and the hummingbirds in the morning.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful place to stay. Richard was a great host. The place was just as pictured. Quick drive into town when needed. Sitting on the porch at night you can see so many stars, and the sounds of wildlife around was nice to listen to instead of city traffic."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful stay in a very quite and clean place. Everything was perfect. Richard was a great caring host.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Richard's place was restful, quiet & peaceful. Thanks
for having us."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Exactly as described. Very clean
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay! We loved the cozy space and the porch. Host was helpful and we had no issues. Feels like you are far out but was only 10 minutes to town. We pass through all the time and hope to stay again.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Quaint and super comfy! This place was perfect for me and my 2 kids. Richard couldn’t have been nicer and his hospitality is genuine. I’m thrilled that I no longer have to stay at the Best Western Plus when I’m in Goliad!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is the best place I’ve ever found! Richard is so nice and communicative and their dogs are so friendly. I would definitely come back this place soon!!
2022-07-01,3,Stayed one night,"While the home and land were beautiful there were some serious issues we had. I feel like if a renter says they'll be in late, you should turn on some lights to see especially when it's women traveling alone and its as dark as it is. I also feel like, if I've messaged you immediately after booking about you should message back at least to let me know you won't be there or that you got the message. Check-In directions weren't very clear and the communication could have been much better. I can say that once he did message back he was very nice but the communication was lacking, especially compared to the last two times I used AirBnB and the owners were amazingly communicative. Other issues were that the dogs were barking at 6am and woke us up and since we got in so late it would've been nice to sleep later than 6. Then when I went outside in the morning the black dog was snarling, growling, and biting and lunging at me and while I understand that dogs are protective of their food, if you have a dog that behaves in this manner, they shouldn't be allowed out where paying guests can come across them. Thankfully, I've been around dogs my entire life and knew to stop moving, avoid eye contact, and back away but I was TERRIFIED of being attacked, especially since I was out there alone for no one to help. I ended up walking around the garage and approaching the door from behind so that I could get back in without crossing in front of the dog. There was also nothing at the end of the driveway to make it easier to spot the driveway in the dark. Reflectors and a solar powered landscape light would go a long way in helping renters find this place in the dark bc it's BLACK out there where it's so far out. Again, the home was beautiful and extremely clean but the experience wasn't as pleasant as we'd hoped. I honestly would LOVE to come back with spouse because I know he'd love this place but I'd like to see these changes take place before doing so and then I'd be more than happy to leave a 5 star review. For anyone reading this review, while my star rating is not high, I can say that if you like the way this place looks and really want to stay, reach out to the owner to see if these changes have been made bc if so, I think you'd really love it. Also, remember Texas is summer is swelteringly hot. We live in Louisiana so we're used to it but people who aren't from the south aren't and it's tough. I hope that this review helps effect the changes that are needed to make this place go from OK to GREAT bc it's potential is definitely great."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great stay we definitely recommend booking! Richard’s property was exactly what we were looking for. A nice getaway on a real Texas ranch. Richard was communicative and inviting. He easily accommodated adding a second night to our stay. The internet/tv connection was slow but i think that’s to be expected out in the country. The farm fresh eggs were a lovely touch!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Richards’s place is a hidden gem. In the middle of beautiful Texas ranch land. But close enough to nearby city. Richard and his dogs were very welcoming. I highly recommend staying here if you’re in the area or just cruising by.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,The host and location were wonderful. We were down for a ghost hunt and they accommodated our late check in graciously.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The space is very cozy, it’s very well equipped, the bed is comfortable and Richard was a great host. My dogs had a great time playing in the huge yard and we enjoyed the balcony at night, please don’t forget to look up at the night sky, the stars look AMAZING!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved this stay so much. A wonderful rest stop on my road trip. This space is clean, comfy, and has everything you need. Star viewing from the patio off the apt and from the whole property is INCREDIBLE if you’re into star gazing."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Whoa, absolutely PERFECT. Blown away at what a value this was, what you don't get in ""being around amenities"" i.e. near bigger cities"", you more than make up in scenery and accommodations. if I were a Batchelor, I would have really enjoyed renting the guesthouse on a longer term basis. very clean, felt very secure, excellent privacy. I wanted to explore the grounds and see what else was around the property but didn't want to bug anyone, even though the Hosts seemed very accommodating to requests. one of the highest recommendations I would give, absolutely no complaints. I made sure to clean up after myself, it's not a place you would feel good about leaving messy.
thank you for hosting, the level of Care and consideration you show are reflected in the rental. to whomever is reading this, you are making a HUGE mistake if you stay at a hotel over this gem!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Super hospitable and welcoming. A great location near historic Goliad. We had a great time!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We arrived on Richard’s beautiful, country side property late evening on our way to Tivoli. We got good dining options 3 miles away from the property. My daughter loved Richard’s friendly dogs while my son had a time of his life in the pool. Fresh eggs from the host were a treat. The place is immaculately clean and very comfortable. We would love to be back and stay longer."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The stay at Richard's place was amazing! It was spotlessly clean and comfortable, and he provided a lot of extras. We were greeted and given the royal treatment. Do keep in mind there are stairs to climb, but if you need to stay in the area or go to the close by Goliad State Park, don't hesitate to stay here in this quiet country place. If Richard isn't around, his friendly pups will be more than glad to give you a welcome!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice place. Will stay again.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Richard's place is super cool and he is super respectful and let us do our thing at the same time offering from him if we needed anything! I'm in wow of the experience
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Richard’s place was more than what I had anticipated.
He’s a very gracious host and the place is immaculate.
His welcome committee of canines make you feel relaxed and at home. The privacy is great and going for walks is also serene.
Easily accessible and less than 15 minutes to Goliad.
I highly recommend if you’re in the area.
(*Stairs to loft may be an issue for mobility if climbing is a challenge.)"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed staying at this cute house very much! Our dog also enjoyed her new playmates!! It is centrally located to Texas historical sites, and was very comfortable and clean. The fresh eggs were a nice surprise!!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent stay. Very clean and the host is incredibly friendly!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Goliad is a beautiful area to visit and rich in history. Richard's place is perfect for enjoying the best that Goliad has to offer. It is impeccably clean, well managed, super-organized, and above all else - peaceful. It was quiet and relaxing and a most welcome escape from the pressures of day-to-day life."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,About as good of a place you could stay off for it being off the beaten path. Would rather stay here than in a hotel 10 days out of the week.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Very friendly host. When we first got there he was outside and helped carry things up the stairs and was very helpful with everything. Beautiful land. Beautiful dogs.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place to stay. It’s comfortable and peaceful. It was perfect for our outings to the Goliad SP and everything close by. We slept well and enjoyed the friendly dogs every time we went outside.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"The trailer we were towing had our race car, tires/wheels, fuel etc. so we did not want to park it at a hotel. We were able to park on Richard’s property and have absolutely zero worries that our stuff would be messed with or stolen. The property is amazing, with beautiful, mature live oaks, and the guest house was very comfortable, clean, and had everything we needed. We will be staying here again in the future."

It was well stocked in every area, linens, cookware and utensils, extra toiletries. Good book and game selection, comfy furniture.. This has been my favorite Airbnb!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our trip to Victoria was further enhanced with our stay at Richard’s farm house in Goliad.
Richard was very accommodating with our last minute booking. The home was perfect for our family of four. Very clean, spacious, and with the tranquility that comes along with farm living."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The Airbnb cabin was as described and worked well for my family! I have stayed in many airbnbs around the United States and this location was one of my favorites. The land and sunsets were amazing.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This spaces is exactly what we wanted and need. A place to rest and relax WITH our dogs that wasn’t an outrageous price.
We are so thankful to Stephanie and Jason for their place.
We will DEFINITELY be back and HIGHLY recommending this place to friends and family on their visits to the area. Worth every penny."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Where do I begin? This place was just like the photos, and very clean! My girls and I had such a great time feeding the cows and felt so at home while staying at cabin. The beds were very comfortable as well.
Will definitely be booking again in the future! Our host also did such a good job communicating back and forth with me❤️"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you to allowing my husband to have his getaway ! Beautiful place with beautiful animals ♥️
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here for 3 days to relax, heal, pray, and get to experience a farm life with my 2 littles. We are fortunate to see some farm animals walking by the cabin! My 4 year old loved feeding the catfish at the pond early mornings after breakfast. Also, they have the friendliest cattle dog, Buddy, who accompanied us during our afternoon walk. This place is a gem! absolutely recommend Stephanie & Jason’s cabin and will for sure stay here again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is our second time out to this Airbnb and it was just perfect for a quick getaway. Always peaceful and quiet. Best way to destress and relax. We will definitely be back.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Everything was as promised. I would stay there again in a heartbeat.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Das Grun Haus is the cutest tiny home. It has everything you could need and then some. It is in a very peaceful location. I loved it and plan on staying there again. I highly recommend it!

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,100% would recommend to anyone traveling to Victoria! Will definitely be here again next year! Thank you!!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our family needed to get away or a little while and this tiny house was just what we needed. The house is very cute, with space very efficiently used, and well-stocked with supplies. We appreciated the sturdy ladders going to the lofts for their stability and safety.
The hosts were very responsive for the few questions we had. They had left food for us to feed the animals with (labeled, which is very helpful!), which our son loved. My wife loved the farm eggs they had left for us in the fridge. Very thoughtful (and tasty)!
It was exactly what we were looking for: a nice, cozy place out in the quiet country where we could go and rest. We'd love to go back the next time we need to unplug!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"AMAZING! no words for it. cows came right up to the fence, watched them from the patio half of the days, beautiful sunset. beautiful environment. I was in town for a reason, but I would travel cross country just to stay here a bit longer and have a fire and make some food on the grill. it's the perfect example of the simple beautiful pleasures of life..
there is a cabin next door, but you can't see them at all from your porch. it feels very private. I was hesitant to book initially for that reason, but i still felt like I was alone out there."
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,tks for everything
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay here. We don’t visit my sister as much as we’d like due to space at her place. Now that we’ve found an Airbnb that we like, we plan to visit more. Thank you for a great stay!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a beautiful place!! Stephanie was so helpful and accommodating!! Hope to be back soon!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Dear Friends
Thank you for opening the doors of your charming country house to us. Every corner reflects the warmth and dedication you have put into this special place. Our stay here has provided us not only a respite from the daily hustle but also unforgettable memories. We appreciate every detail thought for our comfort and well-being. We look forward to returning soon to this paradise in Texas.
With gratitude,
Familia Bastidas"
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"We couldn’t have asked for a better location, as we were in the area for an event at Schroeder Hall and Stephanie’s tiny home is just minutes away. That being said, we wished we’d planned to spend another day or two to relax and unwind in a peaceful, quiet setting; the stargazing was an unexpected perk. The accommodations were a bit tight for the six of us (it is a “tiny home” after all, and we knew that when we booked so we planned accordingly), mainly due to our two lively youngsters, but the beds were so comfy and Stephanie had provided everything we could have possibly needed and then some, plus we loved being out in the country! The kids were really excited to sleep in the lofts. We’d definitely stay here again when in the area."
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"We really enjoyed the place, so much so that we would even stay again in the future. It is very quiet and very cozy, but in this season it is very cold for me then if you have to bring blankets."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I stayed at this charming Airbnb for a family Christmas getaway, and it was truly a delightful experience. Nestled in the midst of a serene ranch, the small house we chose was a perfect escape.
The highlight was the opportunity to interact with the resident cows. We were provided with food to feed them, making it a unique and enjoyable experience for our entire family.
The presence of a friendly dog and catfish-filled pond added to the overall charm. Our love for animals was well catered to, creating a peaceful and joyful atmosphere throughout our stay.
What made our experience truly exceptional were the extra special touches from the hosts. It was evident that the hosts went above and beyond to ensure our time there was truly special.
For my animal-loving mom, this getaway was a perfect gift. The blend of nature, animals, and thoughtful gestures from the hosts created a unique and heartwarming Christmas celebration. I highly recommend this Airbnb."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful oasis, and great people and animals! My children loved the lofts!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay here so much. The full sized stove allowed us to make an intimate dinner, and the surroundings offered the perfect setting for a peaceful weekend getaway!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"If you're looking for peace and quiet where you can relax sit back enjoy nature and surroundings without hearing city noises ie traffic/sirens/ neighbors/ this is the place watch the cattle , horses, and deer amble by from porch while enjoying the solitude . For pet lovers . Secure fenced in large yard for fur babies ( wouldn't leave out after dark) great hosts and owners"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I love this place,we will be becoming regulars,we took our kiddos and they absolutely loved it!!This place is a must stay and it's a great getaway just to recharge!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stephanie's tiny home was welcoming, cute, and very clean. Although the common space was ""tiny"", there was plenty of sleeping space and the bathroom was full-size. The kitchen was clean and stocked with all of the essentials. The farm was pretty and feeding the cows was a lot of fun for everyone. Both Stephanie and Jason were very accommodating, responded quickly to messages, and made sure we had everything we needed. We would recommend this property to others."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very nice and helpful hosts. Place was in a great location. Tiny house was lovely.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My kids and I had an amazing time together!
They ran free in nature, sat around the fire and hung out with the cows,
so peaceful and quiet and away from it all, exactly the experience I wanted for my children and I .
The tiny home was immaculate with plenty of cozy space for me and my six kids, everyone had a great time!
Thank you so much for the opportunity !"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"They had a cute little tiny house to stay in. It was even supplied with eggs and had some outdoor cooking supplies and a fire pit to enjoy the outdoors with, along with a picnic table. We enjoyed the cows and a white dog we named Ghost who would pay us a visit. The first morning there we witnessed and encounter with one of the calves with some visiting deer. It wasn't our destination but a stopping place we wanted to try out. Do keep in mind, this is a tiny house and the loft only allowed for sitting up in the middle of the loft due to the slopping roof line, but there was a lot of space up there otherwise. We enjoyed the quiet and seeing the stars at night. I could even faintly see the Milky Way, which I haven't seen in awhile. This place could be a quiet get away to unwind from a very busy life and recharge."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful place! Will be staying again. Very peaceful place to just relax.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"if you looking for a place in the country to relax and unwind, this is definitely a place to try out."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Stephanie & Jason’s place made me and my little family feel right at home! From the beautiful setup, the thought process of all the little details and they have everything you could need for your stay! A tiny home that’s not so tiny! Slept us all comfortably and enjoyed cooking the farm fresh eggs in the pretty good sized kitchen! I recommend this to ANYONE who wants to indulge in nature by feeding the cows, going to feed the catfish and see the awesome scenery! Thanks again you guys! We will be back, again and again!
Also, perfect weather right now for a fire and s’mores and gazing at the stars. Loved it!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great place if you’re looking for peace and quiet! Owners are both very responsive and friendly, highly recommend."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Convenient and close to town
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Great place to stay for a family get away or a guys trip, which is the reason we went. Beautiful home and property, lots of games to occupy our time and the range is a great way to blow off some steam!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful property and perfectly maintained. I would definitely recommend Russ’s ranch for anyone looking for a quiet, private getaway. Hope to return in the future."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"""We rented this for family during their stay here and it was absolutely fantastic! The place was quiet and beautiful, with plenty of space to relax and have fun. The host was amazing, providing excellent hospitality throughout our stay. I highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a great experience. You won't be disappointed!"""

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful home. Very serene and peaceful. Just what we needed. An amzing experience for our first Airbnb.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing! I rented this house for work. We are a metal fabrication company that does a lot of mobile site repairs and this house was exactly what we needed to relax in peace after long work days. The pictures listed are great but honestly pictures can't capture how awesome this place is in person. Russ was a great host and very helpful and responsive if I needed anything. Even the cleaning crew was very nice and helpful. I will definitely be coming back to the house when I'm not working to fully enjoy what it has to offer. You will not find a better place that has private country living vibes that is also immaculate inside and out. Thank you Russ for a great place to call home for a week.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Our group had a New Years getaway here and it was everything we hoped for. The ranch was spacious and secluded which made for a really nice experience with our group. There were lots of games to play and our dogs enjoyed the space too. The ranch was very nicely decorated and extremely clean with lots of outdoor space and areas to explore. Would highly recommend for anyone looking to get out of the city and just relax.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was ready and welcoming. Comfortable! Room! Beds are FANTASTIC! I recommend this for anyone's visit to the area.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect little place for us to stay while in Beeville for a funeral, much better than a hotel with all the home amenities (bedrooms, full kitchen, and private backyard area)
Thank you for keeping everything so fresh & clean!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Nice house
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Pros; This place was very clean, very modern, beautiful, as described, convenient and had all the features you need! We would certainly stay here again as long as the items in the cons list below were addressed.
Cons; the door locks. I did not have a confident feeling of safety here due the old door locks on the doors of the house. The house has been upgraded significantly but these issues are easy to remedy."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Relaxing place. Very comforting. Thoughtful amenities.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was a gem in the heart of my hometown! Squeaky clean and newly renovated. We were so grateful to have been able to visit family and have a great place to stay while doing so.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,home is practically a brand new remodel with some of the original vintage charm. I was happy that my family was able to stay here.

The house was awesome. It was described as it looks.
Very nice and peaceful
If in the area we will be staying again thank you so much, Sheri…"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our little cottage stay at the Alpaca farm! It was clean, comfortable and had everything we needed. We enjoyed our personal escorts (the turkeys), the alpacas (of course!) and the gift shop had such a great selection of items! It was a pleasure to meet Lyn and we hope to be able to visit again soon! Highly recommend!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our couples getaway at the alpaca farm! Lyn is kind, helpful, and just joyful to be around. I truly loved our farm tour and the animals are very entertaining! We can not wait to return! 💜💚🦙🦃🐓🦆🐏🩵🩷"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location very friendly hostess and a great variety of animals :)
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The farm is exactly as described in the listing. Very cool setting, nice accommodations, my only complaint (which is noted in the ad, so I was forewarned and booked anyway) was that I did have hard time sleeping with the dogs (who were doing their job) barking all night. I’m a very light sleeper, but my bf didn’t have any issues staying asleep 😆 the screened in porch was lovely for evening drinks and charcuterie and we loved being able to meet the farm residents! Such a cool stay!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, and even greater host! The animals were friendly, the view is amazing, quiet, and remote. Truly a wonderful time."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This has been my ""stay at place"" in the Mathus area for several years. Enjoy walking around and seeing all of the animals."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lyn was such an amazing host, it felt like we were being welcomed by a relative we hadn't seen in a while. Everything was amazing, better than described and what we could've imagined. Super peaceful, relaxing, and informative, it was everything we imagined and more. No issues whatsoever, definitely planning to visit again in the future!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As you might gather from my other two reviews on her other cabins, we looooved it! Lyn was so extremely helpful and responsive, she went above and beyond to help us check in and make sure we were comfortable. The cabins are cute, cozy, and clean, and the animals at the ranch make it a unique and memorable stay! Make sure to ask her to show you around, our tour was one of the best parts :)"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It’s difficult to pick my favorite part but I’m going to give it to the turkeys, they are so much fun to watch. Lyn had given a tour of the farm that was very informative and both Marc and Andrew were great with answering questions. Everyone one respected our space but was always eager to chat when we were walking about the farm. I’m looking forward to booking again hopefully to bring out the nieces and nephews."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lyn greeted us as soon as we arrived and was very friendly. The cottage was clean and had everything we needed and more. We had a very relaxing stay!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our weekend in the country. The animals are so fun to watch and interact with. Andrew hosted and he was so kind to answer all our ranch questions and showed us around the ranch. The cabin had everything you need. It's the perfect little get away location.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a private and cozy getaway. I know she mentioned the farm animals may get noisy, but I hardly noticed them. Everything was very clean and comfortable. Lyn was extremely helpful and responsive! I look forward to booking again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved every minute of it! Lyn and her son were very attentive and responsive. Beautiful place
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay. Very clean, A/C worked great. 😊"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is just what you need for a weekend getaway to disconnect from everyday life and just enjoy the little things. We loved our stay here getting to see the animals. We will definitely be back.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lyn was a fantastic host. Very responsive, very I teractive but respectful of our time. I absolutely loved the animal...especially Silas the great Pyrenees guardian dog. The accommodations were, in my opinion, fantastic. Description was accurate and extremely clean and well presented. The screened in porch amd night sky made this place pure heaven. Oh! Be sure to check out the store and learn about the alpaca. Definitely worth every cent"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay on the farm :) our vacation weekend turned out to be full of hospital visits, but it was nice to come to the beautiful cabin and rest after a long day."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was everything described and more. The cottage was clean and looks really nice. All of the animals are super cool to be around and the guard dogs are really cute and friendly. Lyn offered some tours and I was able to walk around with her and see the animals. The night sky is amazing and I would definitely want to come back just to stargaze.
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Lyn was a great host, the cottage was quaint and peaceful. The turkeys are intimidating but won’t get near you, the alpacas were sweet and oh so cute! Our 4 year old loved all of the animals. We did find two scorpions inside our cottage (you are at a ranch after all, pests should be expected) and the linens could have used a refresher, but other than that we had a great stay. Would go back, just take linens and make sure to keep shoes on at all times."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place never disappoints! My 4th time staying here and it’s just as magical as ever! 🙂 thank u lyn and mark for everything!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,our second visit and it was as amazing as the first one. will surely come back again! Thank you!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,nice!

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had an almost smooth stay and I would recommend this place to anyone wanting to spend a quiet time away from the city.
There was a bit of a problem with the wifi but it's not a real concern as I easily connected to my 5G phone to work remotely.
The location near Lake State Park and day trips to Corpus Christi made my stay very enjoyable."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved all the animals, the dogs were super friendly. Very clean and comfortable."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,5th stay here and pleasant as always.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay! The land was beautiful and we enjoy watching the animals on the property.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Forty years ago I raised three small children and a bunch of heifers on a ranch in TX. Staying in the cabin took me back to those precious times. I loved looking out the windows and seeing all the animals at this Airbnb! I even enjoyed the occasional dogs barking at night because I knew they were on guard and protecting everyone and everything. This is a special place with a very special host. I drove to Mathis in the dark, got lost, and Lyn came and got me so I could follow her to the cabin. If you’re looking for a country retreat, this place is perfect!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Friendly responsive host. Cozy comfortable cabin. A great place for an out of the way getaway!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lyn is friendly and easy to communicate with. This cottage was perfect for our needs. It was cozy, very comfortable and quiet. Check in and check out was easy. Our only regret was that we were too busy visiting family that we didn't have time to really enjoy the view of the lake, the sunsets, star gazing, and the alpaca farm. We will definitely plan on staying here again in the future."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was great! It was nice, quiet, peaceful, and we really enjoyed staying with the wildlife on the farm. It was well worth the money and a relaxing time."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Gulf Breeze Alpaca Farm is a delightful place to stay if you are visiting the South Texas Coastal region near or around Lake Mathis. Although the Farm itself does not have direct access to the Lake the State Park is only a short distance from the front gate of the 40 acre farm. And Lake Mathis is visible through some of the South Texas shrub brush from the cabin.
However, the assortment of not only Alpacas, but Gulf Coast Sheep, Ducks, Chickens, Roosters, Nargansette and Red Bourbon Turkeys enhance the landscape and create the total experience of farm life. In addition there are the gorgeous barn cats and the friendly, spectacular guard dogs of both the flock and herd. The dogs greet you coming and going and are irresistible to not spend time petting.
This farm is far enough from the lights of Corpus Christi to enjoy the amazing big night sky of Texas and quite for a restful evenings sleep on a good mattress in a well appointed bed."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Affordable! Comfortable! Peaceful getaway site! Friendly, helpful host! A little out of the way but Lyn gives accurate directions for finding the place. Just follow the directions exactly. Even the guard dogs are friendly! I thoroughly enjoyed my stay!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about this place was perfect! Privacy, cleanliness, and most of all peaceful!! We will definitely come back again and stay! Lyn was there to meet Amy and all needs for us! The farm was amazing! The only thing was the Texas heat! If I wasn’t such a sissy to it I know I would have spent way more time with the animals and on the GORGEOUS screened in back porch!!! This is definitely a place I can’t wait to enjoy during the fall or winter! Everything is there for down time… Satellite TV, puzzles, microwave, and fridge."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome location! If you really want to get away from it all and relax how relaxing should be, this is the booking that you need. There are literally no complaints. The alpacas are adorable along with all the other animals including the superstar Titus. I highly recommend this and their other bookings! You won’t regret it."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was comfy, cozy, and had all the creature comforts necessary for a stress-free stay. We really enjoyed interacting with the animals and exploring the farm. Out host was super friendly and was happy to provide some impromptu farm show-and-tell sessions. The farm is about 45 minutes from Corpus, making a very convenient day trip. Absolutely loved it here!"

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peace & Quiet. Our cabin was clean and super cute. In the mornings we would walk the farm with our coffee and say good morning to all of the animals. The property offers spectacular views both early morning and dusk. I highly recommend staying here. The experience is memoriable.
Lynn and her son are sweet, very accommodating and really care about what they do. We will be visiting again soon."

2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Gulf Breeze is a hidden gem, but it's not too hard to find. The cozy cottage is clean, comfortable, and has everything you might need. With a simple, but thoughtful breakfast provided, you can start early or sleep in. Nice that the coffee machine uses K cups!
The animals are all really neat, we met turkeys, chickens, ducks, sheep, cats, dogs..... and, of course, the Alpaca, which are definitely a favorite for us.
Lyn is extremely knowledgeable and open to explaining everything that goes on. We also met her son, who is an exceptional artist!
In a nutshell, Gulf Breeze is the place to stay in the Mathis area, and we look forward to any excuse to return."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice and comfortable accommodations, within driving distance to Corpus Christi beaches and activities and the lake nearby. My kids loved visiting all the animals. We'll surely be back soon!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay, very clean cabin, nicely decorated, fluffy white towels were amazing. Very peaceful place to getaway.

Must: sit out on the lawn to watch the stars: STUNNING!"

The cabin was cozy and had everything we needed for our stay. The host was happy to give us a tour, helpful with questions, and very hospitable. We highly recommend Gulf Breeze Alpaca Ranch and can’t wait to come stay again!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a unique place to stay! My mom and I had a wonderful time celebrating our birthdays here. We loved the enclosed porch for morning coffee and tea and evening wine. It’s a wonderful farm atmosphere and loved touring the farm. Lyn is very knowledgeable and we soaked up all her information she shared. Highly recommend!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing!!!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"10/10 this was the best AirBnb experience I have ever had! Mark and Lynn are very welcoming and stayed in communication with us which made check in easy and straightforward. We were able to chat with them a bit during our visit and I loved hearing their stories and seeing their passion for what they do.
The animals are of course the highlight of this trip! The dogs are brilliant, they are so sweet and do an amazing job protecting the livestock. We fell in love with them instantly, Silas will forever have a place in my heart.
The alpaca are precious and the turkeys are hilarious. There was never a dull moment!
The cabins were extremely clean and comfortable, exactly as described.
I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a truly unique experience and anyone who loves animals!"

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a really nice stay at the farm! We got to see and interact with lots of different animals (alpacas, turkeys, chickens, dogs and cats). The dogs are really so friendly and gentle though they're big in size, and of course the alpacas were the stars of the show. Every animal had a name and an interesting story! The cabin itself was clean and cozy and we loved sitting out and reading at the screen porch. It's definitely a great experience to have while visiting Texas!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay! Super clean and comfortable cabin and highly recommend. Loved every minute and appreciate Lyn's knowledge and time on my farm tour (while my husband enjoyed hanging out with the A/C in the cabin!).

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great time we had! My son and I truly enjoyed our little get-away, exploring, and meeting all the animals. My son particularly enjoyed the fresh eggs and English muffins on the back porch.

2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lynn and Mark's place is marvelous! It's like back to a home (on a ranch with alpacas and all kinds of cute animals). I already started looking forward to our next trip there!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to enjoy solitude and see all of the animals at the Alpaca Farm...
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second stay at the ranch, we all had a great and relaxing time! Lyn and Mark were extremely helpful right from booking all the way to check out. Went above and beyond to help in all ways. The cabin is clean, cozy and comfortable, location is perfect for a getaway from everyday life."

2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time. The cabin is very comfortable and spotlessly clean. There are thoughtful touches, like snacks, coffee and breakfast food provided. We loved the screened in porch with views right onto one of the alpaca pastures. All of the animals were so lovely and well cared for - it’s clear that Lyn and Mark do a wonderful job with them. We especially enjoyed the very friendly dogs, including Titus who calmly greeted us and checked in on us frequently. Lyn also generously took time out of her busy day to give us a tour of the farm. Overall a fantastic stay!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing experience!
Animal lovers will go crazy at this ranch - there are many different farm animals. All are friendly and used to people. You can tell they are raised with love.
The cabin is sparkling clean. We especially enjoy the screened back porch because we can have dinner while seeing alpacas chilling outside.
While Lyn was very busy preparing an annual big event in the weekend, she and her beautiful family still spent quite some time with us, showing us around the farm. They stopped by our cabin to say hello when they took the baby sheep out for a walk.
Because of their hospitality, it almost felt like we were visiting in our aunt and uncles farm. It is nice now there are still Airbnb hosts treating their guests like friends and families instead of just paid customers. Would recommend to everyone."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lyn & Marks farm stay was a 10/10 experience. The airbnb itself was so cute, clean, and cozy. Lyn provided some snacks and breakfast which was a nice touch. Lyn showed us around her farm and we got to see all the animals, it was all very interesting! I would love to return to their farm. If you book with them you won’t regret it!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed two nights at Gulf Breeze Alpaca Farm cabins and thoroughly enjoyed the accommodations. Lyn is a great host and our cabin was cute, clean, and comfortable. Breakfast was provided for us in the kitchenette - English muffins, butter and jam, orange juice and coffee. We loved seeing all the animals and felt safe under the watch of Titus, the guardian dog. When we first arrived, we didn’t remember which of the three cabins was ours. Titus knew, and showed us the way to our cabin. What a champ! At night, he was posted up on the picnic table to keep away wild animals. And he did it all with a smile on his “good boy” face. Thanks again, Lyn, we’ll definitely stay here again when we visit my mom in Orange Grove."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Far better than what is advertised. Cozy cabin with all amenities. Lyn and Mark are the best hosts and they will take care of you. The animals are all very friendly. If you lose your way at the first day when you check-in, the guardian dog would guide you to your place.
One last thing, don’t forget to pet Mr. Truman if you are a cat person."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"As advertised, and they respond fast if you have any questions."
2024-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Plenty of activities, responsive host, cozy home, great place to sit back and relax."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a great stay. Our boys enjoyed fishing off the dock and playing some games in the yard. It was overall a great stay!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We booked the weekend to celebrate our son’s 16th birthday. There was so much to do! You can swim in the lake right off the property, fish off the private dock, collect shells and build sandcastles along the shoreline and enjoy the spacious hot tub. The outdoor shower was a nice way to clean off after swimming in the lake. I wish we would’ve brought water shoes because the lake bottom is a bit rocky at first but has a soft sandy bottom further out. We watched a couple of storms roll in which was really exciting to watch. Our kids enjoyed using the kayaks and we enjoyed the Wii, darts and cornhole as a family. The stars are abundant! We did not leave the house for the entire weekend and had plenty to do. We would definitely book here again!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Freddy and Angie are some of the nicest hosts I’ve had the pleasure to rent from. They really went all out, everything from a perfectly clean home to the little things, board games/ arcade games/ yard games, aromatherapy oils for the hot tub, they even had a local stores number with food service. They really thought of it all plus you’re right on the lake with beautiful views and a private dock. Hands down a 10/10 stay, highly recommend."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place cozy and on the water could not have picked a better place
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"We absolutely loved the place! We have 5 teenage boys and a baby and there was plenty of space for everyone to sleep. The best part of the stay is the peace and beauty of the lake. We had plans to do a couple of things in San Antonio and Corpus but we decided to stay at the house for the rest of our trip after a day at the beach. The hosts are very helpful and worked with us with our check ins and out times. The night breeze and the lake was a perfect combination to hang out by the fire pit, I think everyone forgot we had cellphones for the weekend. We will definitely stay here again probably for longer if given the chance. Thank you so much for hosting us!"
