House is walkable to front street and all there is to see and do there. Janice's communication is excellent. There was an issue with the air-conditioning for one of the rooms.

2024-04-01,5,Group trip,A really nice place. Easy walking to dining and front street activities and shopping. Hosts are very responsive to questions and needs.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing experience! Everything was top teir design and spotless! Stayed for a week and didn’t want to leave! Very specious and the owner super responsive to any and every question. They’re nice beautiful souls! Even bought the children of the house Easter gifts sent by Walmart! We will be doing this trip every year
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay in Janice’s beautiful AirBnb. Gorgeous interiors and you can tell every detail was very well thought out. Very comfortable for all of us, plenty of space. I only wish we had flexible check-in because we arrived 4 hours early with a newborn, one pregnant woman and 4 kids under 5, and we had to just wander around town in the heat until 3pm. With that said, it’s ok because I understand hosts aren’t always able to accommodate special requests. Janice was extremely responsive and clear in her communication and also reached out when she found some items we left behind. She was helpful and available to coordinate a pickup of our things a few days later. I really appreciated that! Overall, wonderful stay!!! Definitely recommend !!"
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,Worked very well for 7 people. Clean and close to everything.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My sister, nieces, and I stayed here to be close to Front Street for Christmas on our girls' getaway. It was very convenient, beautifully decorated, and comfortable.

We will definitely stay there again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at Shanda's place . It was exactly how we wanted to spend a long, quiet Memorial Day weekend.

We spend a lot of time in Natchitoches, and we would stay here even more often if it were pet-friendly."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was truly a slice of heaven. Christmas decorations were still up which made our stay even more enjoyable since we came to see the lights downtown before the 6th of January when they ended. Was very clean, made us feel right at home and could not believe all the amenities in the kitchen. We enjoyed the beautiful walk into town across the bridge and the local downtown was like a walk into the past. Highly recommend!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location was walkable to all the shops and restaurants on the river. The fireworks show was easily seen from the balcony. The unit had everything we needed plus hot cocoa station (major plus for me) and decorated for Christmas.
We were looking for a Christmas experience and this did not disappoint. Hope to return next year.
The only downside were parts of the unit that have original wood floors. They are beautiful but we all felt like we were making too much noise walking around since it is an upstairs unit."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My daughter and I enjoyed our accommodations. It was everything we had hoped for and more. We especially liked that it was within walking distance to town and local restaurants.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"GREAT location, minutes to Front Street which was a huge deal for us! Covered, off street parking was nice too. Although the home is beautiful and very comfy, and we would rent again, just a few things to mention. No place to unpack or hang clothes (closet/dresser space), or mirror for dressing in the small bedroom. There is only one TV in the master bedroom. One for families to share in the living room or sunroom would be great."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Shanda was extremely helpful and patient when we needed help entering because I had not read her email with the entry instructions. The place was spacious and beautifully decorated with a fall theme. My husband and I were looking for a place to relax for a few days and everything to make us feel right at home was there: extra blankets, comfortable furniture, a fully equipped kitchen, and games. Meanwhile restaurants, shops, and fun activities were within walking-distance."

Could not have been a better location very close to the Cane River and Front Street, yet quiet and private. If we make it back to LA, we will definitely stay there again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Shanda’s place was amazing! It was very peaceful and relaxing. We had every thing we needed and then some!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Came to Natchitoches for Jazz Fest. We found Shanda's place and couldn't believe how inexpensive it was compared to what the hotels were gouging, I mean charging. We booked it immediately. Since it has two bedrooms we asked another couple to go with us. The place was extremely nice, extremely clean, and had plenty of room. We loved the sun room. The location was great as well. I didn't time it, but it only felt like a 5 minute or so walk to Front Street where all the festivities were. Shanda was great at responding quickly to any questions I had. The place was very comfortable, quiet, and very well supplied for all of our needs. We did not need to contact Shanda for anything, we had everything needed for a two night stay. I definitely recommend this place for your stay in Natchitoches.
The Manasco's"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Shanda was an incredible Host & her beautiful Natchitoches Louisiana historical heritage home was to research our French-Cajun-Creole Family Geniology in Grand Ecore.
My Sisters from Oregon & Arkansas, & my wife & I from California made the long-ago planned trip. Our AB&B must have been Blessed by God, & I will remember our experience there as Half-Way-To-Heaven.
Locals in Natchitoches were also very genuine, kind, & helpful in helping us in our family history research. Thus, we will make the trp again next year for more, & will book with Shanda & AB&B again.
Bless you Shanda & Thank you from us all."

Block to Bridge if want to walk.
Only tv is in 1 bedroom.
High cleaning fee for short stay.
Some Airbnb cleaning fees & chores driving us back to hotels. Or bed & breakfast.

The location is great and we look forward to going back soon."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable and a short walk Across the river from Front St. Just two houses down from the bridge taking you to the heart of Front St. Food, Fun and Shopping. You will definitely be in the mood form Christmas with a well-appointed Christmas decor in every room throughout the house. We were there the first weekend of the Christmas Lights Festival.
Literally 2-3 minute walk to the heart of the festival could have enjoyed the firework show from the balcony if we needed. Easy access with ample parking. Coded entry. Safe neighborhood. Easy access to shops and sundries without having to cross the river and deal with Festival traffic. Make sure to check out Grason Barbeque in Clarence LA. Short 12 min drive but worth every bite. Ask about their leftover Ham Bones to take home frozen to add to your next recipe of beans. Their pecan pie is second to none. No TV in the main room of house only in master bedroom. Not an issue for us but could inconvenience some."

Host is easy to work with, we made adjustments to our reservation several times due to changing plans and it was no problem. Highly recommend!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My sisters and I stayed at the Belle Vue Guesthouse for our annual sisters weekend and we all loved this Airbnb. The decorations, all the windows with the abundance of natural light, the location, all of it. We especially loved the hammock swing chairs in the back yard and visited them every chance we got. It was a cozy place to sleep, visit, and play card games, and the walk across the pedestrian friendly bridge was pleasant and quick. We parked our cars upon arrival on Friday and never moved them again until we checked out Sunday morning. Our time in Natchitoches was full and fun and we all said we would love to stay at Shanda’s Airbnb again in the future. I think all four of us said, “I could live here” during our visit. I highly recommend this place."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such an incredible location and the owner took great care and love in the design. So very comfortable and relaxing. Walk to Cane River and downtown shops and dinning. We give the home 5 stars +++++. We will be back! Thank you for everything!!!

Convenient to downtown, NSU, and other businesses such as pharmacy, groceries, etc. Peaceful, quiet location, comfortable furnishings, lovely decor, and a beautiful upstairs sunroom and front porch where you can see the riverfront through the trees! Our favorite hidden gem in Natchitoches!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent accommodations and convenient to downtown area! Loved our stay!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of the cutest BNBs we have ever stayed in. Shanda made it feel like home and by day 5 we hated to leave. Natchitoches is the greatest place to relax, learn LOTS of history (even Steel Magnolias movie sights) and this house was about 2 blocks from historical Front street. It rained much of the time we were there but we enjoyed going to magnificent restaurants and plantations so we were rarely in the rain. Thanks Shanda, for being such a great hostess!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Shanda has created an inviting, delightful, and tranquil “home away from home.” The house far exceeded our expectations and we would definitely welcome the opportunity to stay there again in the future."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Conveniently located and perfect for a couple or small family. Full amenities and beautiful space.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time at the Airbnb! The location was great! It was very cute and comfortable!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a really cute option to the typical b n bs that are in town for couples. We stopped into town for a softball tournament and needed the two bedroom option. Very accommodating. And oh so cute and close to the historic district-just a block from the river!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Belle Vue was Lovely. Cozy, comfortable & so convenient. It was beautifully decorated, with every amenity we could think of. It was perfect for 4 ladies on a “girls trip.” Location was amazing! We could easily walk downtown, right across the bridge, and enjoy beautiful scenery along the way, not to mention the views from the upstairs porch. Highly recommend."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our 3rd stay at this beautiful, comfortable, and convenient guest house, and we could not be happier with our stay. The kitchen is well appointed, we had everything we needed to prepare breakfast before heading out each day. My favorite spot in this home has to be the sunroom where you will find 2 super comfortable swivel rocker chairs and a lovely view from the 2nd story windows. Grabbing food from any of the restaurants downtown near the river is easy, you can walk or drive and be there and back in no time. Check in and out is a breeze, house rules are easy and in line with every other property I’ve stayed at, and the host is easy to reach and very quick to respond. We think of this as our home away from home in Natchitoches, and we look forward to staying again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful and comfortable way to visit Natchitoches. It's a short and pleasant walk across the Cane to downtown. The lodgings are spacious, beautifully decorated and very well provisioned. The privacy and quiet were additional pluses. Very nice!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home in a great location. Clean and very tastefully decorated.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was my family’s 2nd time staying at this Air B&B, and it was perfect again!

This charming rental is becoming our home away from home, we are looking forward to staying here again next month!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great place to stay!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved this Airbnb!! It is so beautifully decorated and within walking distance to the river.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place to stay and we will most definitely be staying here again. Very convenient to downtown. Parked our truck and walked everywhere downtown. Enjoyed the Jazz Festival and the weather was great!!!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the BEST time at Belle Vue Guesthouse last weekend. This place is exactly as pictured. It is clean, charming, and so close to all the downtown action. We literally walked across the bridge to all the shopping, eating, etc… Shanda is so easy to contact and is so quick to respond to any question you may have. If you are looking for a place to stay in Natchitoches, this is it!!! You will not regret it!!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,So close to downtown with comfortable furniture!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at BelleVue guest house during our mother/daughter trip to Natchitoches.

We enjoyed our afternoon rocking chair conversations in the sun room and on the large balcony. We will return!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It’s a lovely place, very well outfitted and beautifully decorated. Terrific location. Our visit was peaceful and relaxing."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Shanda’s home is a gem!! The decor is beautiful and welcoming. The beds are very comfortable and the two bedrooms with the Jack and Jill bathroom are great for friends or families traveling together. The modern kitchen is spotless and has anything you could want for preparing meals.
You can’t beat the location either. It is quiet and peaceful, but you are a very short and easy walk over the bridge to the restaurants and shops on Front street. Shanda is a gracious host and was quick to respond with local suggestions. I have traveled to Natchitoches yearly for the past 20 years and this is by far the most convenient and comfortable place I have stayed. I look forward to staying again next year!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and cute house!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fabulous host, adorable place. The decor was so charming and relaxing. The place was immaculate, but had wonderful little amenities that made us feel welcomed. Shanda was very responsive and went out of her way to make sure we were able to make the most of our stay. And the front porch- there is nothing quite like the feel of sitting out on the porch on a sunny day. Best Airbnb ever."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful trip! We enjoyed every second at Belle Vue. So convenient to the heart of downtown with great walkability. A delightful place and we would stay here again.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This Airbnb is in the cutest! Shanda did a beautiful job decorating the space. Everything provided is very thoughtful and it’s extremely clean. The house is spacious and it’s located just minutes away from all of the shops and restaurants. We will definitely be back.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect place for a stay in Natchitoches. I was impressed. The cottage was spotless, well-decorated, comfy, and only a 4 min walk across the pedestrian friendly bridge for shopping, dinner, and drinks. This place is going to be the hotspot for the Christmas festival, so snap it up while you can!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautifully decorated and perfect location! Charming older home completely renovated. Shanda was so helpful. Will definitely book again.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is wonderful! Our family of 3 was incredibly comfortable and we had everything we could have possibly needed for a long weekend visiting NSU. It was so convenient to be able to run back to the house in-between activities, the location is perfect for anything a visitor could want to do in Natchitoches. The host went above and beyond to help us when we decided at the last minute to book with her, and the communication was excellent throughout our stay. Highly recommended, and we look forward to staying here again, hopefully for a longer visit!"

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So happy with our babymoon destination choice! My wife and I were looking for a quiet getaway over the holidays and this spot was perfect! We went over New Year’s weekend and thoroughly enjoyed walking to downtown multiple times a day for the lights, music, and festivities. We stayed put on NYE having a feeling that we would be able to see the fireworks from the balcony and we were not disappointed! The downtown area is well within walking distance with minimal traffic and a sidewalk the entire way. Plenty of food and drink options downtown and others within a short driving distance."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our first time using Air B&B and it was a wonderful experience. The location was perfect, price was great, and the guest house was decorated beautifully for Christmas! We brought our 3 year old and 7 year old and the house had stocked hot chocolate with marshmallows and several games for them! It was so wonderful! We’ve recommended this location to several people and we would love to come back again."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We walked into our own winter wonderland. The decorations were immaculate and we even had fresh baked cookies waiting for us. Shanda was an amazing host with fantastic communication and her rental is in a prime location! I will surely stay here again!! Thank you Shanda!!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"One of the best places I have stayed in, beautifully decorated for the holidays. It felt like home away from home, but without the daily chaos. We definitely plan to return as Natchitoches, LA will forever be part of our family and we love it there. So glad we have now found the perfect place to stay."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you want a private getaway within walking distance of downtown Natchitoches with plenty of charm then this is the place for you. Beautifully decorated, convenient and clean."

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Belle Vue was everything it was advertised to be & just what I needed for my weekend away. Just a short walk across a beautiful bridge and you are on the historic Front St. Such a cozy space that made me feel at home. Shanda was an amazing host & I can’t wait for my next visit! I know this gem won’t stay hidden for long!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"the best kept secret in town, spacious, well-decorated, and a great deal!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful, comfortable space! We have been using Airbnb for years, and this is the nicest, cleanest, welcoming home we’ve stayed in. It exceeds the photos and description. Shanda thought of everything to make the guesthouse feel relaxing and user-friendly. It’s a great location, an amazing value, and somewhere we would definitely return. We came to escape the aftermath of Hurricane Ida, so all of Shanda’s extras and thoughtfulness in outfitting the space was truly appreciated."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is an amazing place to stay. Shanda is most kind and a very gracious host. Belle Vue is home away from home. You feel right at home from the minute you walk in till you leave. We didn't want to leave. Everything from the cozy sun room to the total furnished kitchen not to mention to great porch which we loved. The decor is outstanding and you have everything you need for a wonderful stay. Sit and relax on the porch and your only blocks from Historic Downtown Natchitoches. Your host even brings you unexpected treats. You feel total welcomed and very pampered. Everything you need or ever wanted in a place to stay is offered at Belle Vue. Shanda truly goes out of her to accommodate her guests and it shows. We will definitely be back many times in the future. Thank you Shanda for having us and making us feel so welcomed. Blessings!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The most AMAZING airbnb it was like walking into a HGTV show... We walked in and were in awww decorated beautifully, fresh cookies, fresh linens, bed was amazingly comfortable, but most of all we had the best host Shanda she is PRICELESS... So looking forward to going back someday. Thank you Shanda for everything"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved staying at Shanda’s place! It immediately felt like home as soon as we walked in. The decor was amazing. She even baked us fresh cookies!! It was in walking distance to everything you’d need to do in Natch. She even left amazing recommendations and guides for us. Very communicative. Perfect stay for a weekend! So much space. I could go on and on. Can’t wait to come back!!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. I would recommend this place to anyone. My wife and I can not wait to stay again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed the cabin for our 36th anniversary. Would stay again, very nice and location was awesome"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cozy , clean cabin met all of our needs , the screened in porch w historic view , calm peaceful river , dock with fire pit was spectacular , we enjoyed the games basket( we added a puzzle for you ) fishing off the dock was relaxing. We will return for another visit . We enjoyed the tours, the horse carriage ride w Steel Magnolia tour , the shopping was great ."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Couldn’t have been better!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our 4th time at the cabin and we came for our 41st anniversary. We absolutely love staying here!

I must add the porch is our favorite place in the cabin to sit and relax!!We can’t wait to come back!!! Thank you again for sharing your cabin!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my second stay at cabin and just as wonderful as the first trip. Cozy cabin with great porches and a wonderful wharf that we caught some fish from. Great for viewing and being a part of the annual Natchitoches Christmas Light Festival. Host Darrell always provides prompt responses. Cabin has hots of amenities and thoughtful touches. Will be back!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect spot for enjoying the Natchitoches Christmas Festival! Unique and charming, stocked with everything we needed for our stay."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Really enjoyed the home and location. Great host. Perfect size for our family. Watched the fireworks from the deck
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed this quirky historic cabin, especially the screened in porch. The Christmas lights were already on in early November which was an added bonus. We loved sitting on the porch and watching the view of the river and birds. The downstairs kitchen was well stocked and charming. The stairs leading to the kitchen, however, were a challenge and could benefit from more light. The pullout sofa bed was not comfortable."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed the place and rhe proximity or front street is perfect.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved the cabin and location. Many of our famiky members have been curious about it and we were excited to be able to stay there.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had no issues while there.
Heard about it and decided to try it out. No regrets.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place. Screened in deck and the dock by the lake are tremendous. I would definitely recommend this place.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location.
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The location and the cleanliness of the cabin was wonderful. It was the first week in June and it was extremely warm in the cabin. It took at least 4 hours to cool the cabin to a moderately comfortable temperature. As lovely as the cabin is, it is not suited for tall people. My husband and I are average height and hit our heads numerous times on doorways. Overall enjoyed"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had the best time at Darrell's place. We were able to walk over the bridge to all the shops & restaurants then come back & just kicked back with a good drink
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cute place! I loved being right on the river where I rowed with the MSU Crew Club for Spring Training in 1997. Being there brought back great memories. And Natchitoches has done a fantastic job with Front Street. We walked everywhere! The location was fantastic.
My 6 foot tall teenagers struggled with the low heights inside the cabin but they loved it nonetheless. They loved the dock and the porch. I enjoyed the quaintness and having coffee by the water. Thanks for a lovely time!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent location and great little cabin with an awesome view!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband rarely gets a weekend off, so we wanted to do something fun and relaxing. I stayed it this cabin about 15 years ago, so we picked it! It was so nice, cute, and cozy! We loved the deck and the screened in porch! Thank you!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our 4th time to stay at Darrell cabin! We came for our 40th anniversary! We absolutely love staying here!!! Darrell is an amazing host and has thought of everything for you to have a wonderful stay! I can not say enough about the cabin so comfortable and close to everything! Thank you again Darrell for letting us stay in your amazing cabin and we can’t wait to come back!!!!

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place to stay to watch fireworks at the Christmas Festival. Walkable to lots of shopping and food. Enjoyed the firepit and boat dock. Would recommend for a nice weekend visit to Natchitoches.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks Darrell. Enjoyed your place. Great little spot. Two thumbs up!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is located in the perfect spot. We loved being able to walk to the downtown area, and we loved waking up to the pretty Cane River scenery. Darell was very responsive when we had a small mishap and we were able to enjoy our stay without inconvenience. We definitely recommend this spot when visiting Natchitoches!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place. Location is perfect...easy walk to all the local shops, restaurants and activities. Wonderful view overlooking the river. We really enjoyed the dock for early morning coffee and evening refreshments. Inside the cabin has a fun, rustic vibe. Feels like a flash from the past but conveniences offered for normal ""today"" life. No detail overlooked from Q-Tips to ice in the freezer. For a unique and memorable experience, this is the place. We’ll definitely be back."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place and good value for the location!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,nice place and a great view
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We love this little log cabin. This was our second visit. This time we brought the kids. Honestly, I think it’s better suited for just a couple as the kids didn’t love sleeping on the fold out couch. It’s a perfect little spot to enjoy the views and away from the crowds."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Worth the trip
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Private and cozy cabin right on the Cane River! I am so happy we found the Log Cabin for our Mother’s Day trip and we were impressed by how perfectly placed it is along the Cane River. Check in and check out were a breeze and our host Darrell communicated easy directions for us on everything to know. There is enough parking in front for two cars or perhaps three of you have smaller cars parked close. The screened porch in back had a nice breeze but we also brought our fans for extra cool air while we relaxed out back. It was easy to make yourself at home since the cabin is well furnished and provides a nice, clean supply of linens and towels. The full kitchen has everything, even a Keurig! I will agree with other guests that the inside steps to go downstairs can be tricky for anyone with mobility issues. We never had any issues and just took our time going up and down. The bathroom was large and had a nice size tub that was perfect for baths with amazing water pressure for showers. The walk across the river bridge was less than 10 minutes to get to lots of food, stores and even scenic tours! We decided to take a carriage ride which you can see parked across the river. The Cane River Queen also passes by multiple times a day and there is lots of river life especially during the May weekends. We were fortunate enough to sit on the screened porch and enjoy a concert at the pavilion across the river on a Saturday night! The dock was perfect to use our stand up paddle boards we brought and also in a ‘no wake zone’ so we could tie to the dock and float to relax. My mother, sister and I had a peaceful visit and look forward to returning to this Natchitoches gem!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a good time,"
2022-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Booked this cabin for a weekend getaway for me and my best friend. We chose it for the location and the listing looked perfect. We found it very charming, clean, and peaceful. As other reviewers have noted, the stairs to the bottom floor are a bit tricky and would be inaccessible for anyone with mobility issues. The screened in porch was perfect for morning coffee. The dock with fire pit was perfect for an evening's relaxation. I liked that the bathroom was large. Some have mentioned the low ceiling in the shower, and I can see that anyone over maybe 68 inches may have trouble. We did not use the kitchen, so I can't comment on the ease of use or available kitchenware. I would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to see the local sites and experience the character of the city."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cabin has so much character and style. Great views. The bathroom was surprisingly large and super clean. I would love to stay here again.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is the perfect location for a having a great time - shopping, eating and relaxing get away. With two porches and a dock on the water you have multiple places to enjoy and soak up the slower pace in a town with tremendous character and history. One thing to keep in mind is the stairs in the cabin can be a little tricky but if you pay attention it is not a big issue."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,This cabin is wonderful! It is extremely cute and the host has thought of every thing to make it like a home away from home. The location was perfect for the Christmas lights festival. We are really going to miss the screened in back porch!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cozy cabin is on a beautiful spot on lake right across from shops, restaurants, and pavilion in short walking distance. It has wonderful amenities including fire pit, rocking chairs on porch, and screened in upper porch. Darrell responded quickly to answer our questions. Will definitely come back"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is wonderful!
Great views
Scenic location and completely cozy!
Christmas festival in Natchitoches was perfect from this unique place!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The log cabin is the perfect place for a weekend getaway. We had a great time watching Steel Magnolias on the large tv upstairs. The location is absolutely perfect! We enjoyed a campfire on the dock one night after shopping in downtown. This place would be perfect for a hallmark Christmas weekend trip! We all want to make a return visit
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The location is fabulous! The beds are comfortable and the kitchen is well stocked with everything you need to cook and eat. The only thing I would note is that this might be hard for people over 6 ft. The stair ceiling is very low and winding to the second level. Unless you are comfortable bending way over to clear the ceiling it might be a bother to you. I'm 5'8 and my son is 5'11 . The shower head is very low as well. The dock and being on right on the river across the Front street main pavilion was a huge bonus. I especially loved the history and original log cabin charm of this place. I would totally stay here again.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great time. Easy walk across the river to downtown. Would recommend for a fun and unique get away.
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Cute little cabin on the river! Like previous reviewers stated…ceilings are very low. My husband is over six feet & had a really hard time getting down the stairs & using the shower.
No door separating the down stairs & up stairs so be mindful if looking for privacy from children sleeping on the sofa sleeper.
The location is perfect any time of the year but would be absolutely perfect for Christmas!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Easy walk to downtown area. Place was clean and well kept and as good as advertised.
2021-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Cute little place & everything you need! Just a narrow stairway, but we had no problems with that"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and the cabin was awesome! Lots to do right across the river. Easily can sleep 4, the couch turns into a bed."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved our stay here! It’s absolutely adorable and the pictures don’t quite capture how great it is! Everything we wanted to was in walking distance and that was just the cherry on top. We will definitely be back!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, clean log cabin with a great location & view. Easy walk to the historic downtown."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time in this cozy cabin. Everything you could possibly need has been provided - and the view is spectacular! Thanks for a great stay!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect location along the Cane River. Steps away from restaurants and live music Spend your time relaxing on the dock watching boats pass by. We had a lovely time!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This cabin is the perfect quaint get away stay for two to three people. The cabin’s old charming architectural features are still in tact and the cabin is clean and well maintained. My favorite features are the upstairs porch and deck on the river. It was peaceful and a perfect location. I loved sitting on the deck in the morning drinking coffee and watching the downtown area open up and watching the boaters and kayakers cruise by. It was the perfect place for our mother-daughter weekend. We will be back!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing getaway for yourself or with a loved one!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this place by the river! We have already recommended it to friends and family. It’s perfect for a couple wanting to get away for a few days. But, we plan on taking the kids back. We know they’d love it!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful scenery, amazing view of downtown and Cane River."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I loved this cabin! Its truly a one of a kind stay.
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Darrell's place was perfect for a cozy and relaxing getaway. The proximity to the historic downtown district was awesome. Even though we could see the lights and bustle of downtown, the river's separation made it quiet and peaceful. We plan to visit again!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The river views from the porch are beautiful and the boat dock with fire pit is a great way to spend time on the water. The cabin is very comfortable and a great place to spend time. You are in short walk from the main shopping and dining area. The kitchen is well stocked and the beds are comfortable.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin is super cozy & has beautiful and amazing views of Front Street plus it is nestled right on a Cane River. We really enjoyed the Christmas lights and our view was perfect! The location is perfect because you can get any place quickly. Darrell was responsive to any questions or needs we had. Looking forward to a trip again in the future!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and walking distance to town. Darrell was prompt with response and adorable space.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute cottage on the water super close to everything you will need. My husband is over 6' tall and had to duck inside so definitely be aware that if you are tall you might bump your head. Very charming home and I would return.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect views of the river and historic Natchitoches.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow! We cannot recommend this comfortably rustic, unique, hobbit house, more!
So many special touches. Perfect proximity to the historic downtown area. Absolutely loved the screened porch and spent most of our time either lounging there, or reading in the perfect ambiance of the cabin bedroom.
Our young children absolutely loved the space as well and we were treated to live orchestra music during from across the river on one of our nights.
Highly recommend this unique space!"
2020-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful view.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Live the fire pit on the dock amazing
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect location to enjoy downtown Natchitoches. A cute little house for a nice little weekend getaway.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Natchitoches is known for it's hospitality and it's beautiful historic river front - the Log Cabin gives you both of these at your fingertips! It's an old house - full of charm and quirks - it's what makes it a great place to stay! The screened in porch on the upper level is the best spot in the house! You're right across the river from the best part of town, and it's a quick walk across the bridge to all the shops and restaurants. Kitchen is old, but sparkling clean and well equipped. They hosts have also taken extra care to provide hand sanitizer, cleaning products, and plenty of papertowels! The bed is comfortable, wifi is fast and good, and its a completely charming cabin. The only thing to note is the stairs from the bedroom/bathroom (upper level) to the kitchen/living area (lower level). They are narrow, old, and winding. Anyone with mobility issues might have trouble navigating them. It's a great house - I hope to stay here again the next time I'm in town."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This little cabin has so much character! The space is small, but it has everything you need! We spent most of our time on the deck, enjoying the view of Cane River and Front Street. The walk over the bridge was quick and easy. The only reservation I would pass along is that if you are a tall person, you may bump your head on the ceilings, doors, or stairway. We are all short, so we loved it. It felt like a little hobbit hole, and I mean that in the most charming way! LOL!"
2020-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Saturday morning we took a short walk across the bridge to the Farmer's market and the waterfront downtown area. Amazing coffee view from the back porch rockers and the water deck. The house is more or less 3 levels with stairs so be aware when booking the staircase from the main living to the bedroom area is a bit narrow. We loved it because it was quirky! The cottage has lots of charm and actually well laid out for it's size. We plan to be back. Thanks Darrell.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The log cabin is so fun and unique. It's location could not be more perfect. We enjoyed fishing off the dock, sitting in the screened porch and walking over the bridge to downtown. Off street parking was nice. There were thoughtful touches throughout the cabin such as bug spray, snacks and beverages. We watched the 4th of July fireworks from the dock, walked to the shops and restaurants and enjoyed the cabin. It's an old cabin but everything was clean and nicely decorated."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sandra and Tony were so kind, friendly, and thoughtful. The rooms were so nice, clean and nicely decorated. We had everything we could want. My wife and I were very comfortable and felt right at home. We definitely would recommend this place, and look forward to staying again in the future!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sandra and her husband Tony were excellent host and referred our living space as “our home away from home” and we most definitely felt right at home! They’re very friendly and family oriented and flexible with our check-in and share multiple attractions and restaurants within less than a 1/4 mile away. We not only highly recommend Sandra and Tony as a host but also built a great relationship with them as well And always respecting the privacy of their guest. So anyone planning a trip to Natchitoches, LA you definitely want to consider this location!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sandra’s place was absolutely wonderful. Perfect location, pristinely clean, a great little treasure in the town of Natchitoches. We will definitely return to stay once again at this lovely little retreat."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic place and wonderful host.
Couldn’t ask for more. I recommend this place to anyone."

2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"A 6-minute walk to downtown Christmas festivities! Very comfortable King-size bed, reclining sofa, large bathtub (perfect for a relaxing hot soak, or a quick shower) and well equipped kitchen! Thoughtful hostess was quick to respond to questions, provided cold water, snacks, coffee makings and a charming Christmas tree to enjoy!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in the area for a friend's wedding and booked Sandra's place to stay for the weekend. Sandra was very friendly and provided everything we needed. Her place was extremely clean. The location is close to the river (a 5 minute walk), which was neat since we were able to walk to restaurants without having to find a parking spot. As an added bonus, we were able to see the first firework show of the Christmas season on Saturday evening! The only thing that was an issue for us was the bedroom ceiling fan. It made a loud noise while it was turned on. Otherwise, perfect stay!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful host and so thoughtful! Extra treats, water, umbrella, etc. help so much with getting settled in to a place. Great location for walking Natchitoches’ Front Street area!! Super comfy bed and couch recliners were amazing for relaxing."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay with Sandra. She was so accommodating and was always responsive to our needs.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sandra was a wonderful host, from before my husband and I arrived until we left. She was flexible, helpful, and went the extra mile in giving us suggestions of things to do and places to dine. Her home was comfortable and had everything we could need. There was even a welcome goodie basket for us when we arrived, and water in the fridge She had emailed me ahead of time to ask what I put in my coffee, because her husband was going to the store. When we arrived, there was milk in the fridge for my coffee and bags of coffee in the cupboard. My husband and I would definitely recommend Sandra's place and a visit to Natchitoches, a very cute little town"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sandra’s place is a great place to stay in Natchitoches. It’s centrally located to downtown Natchitoches sites and restaurants or if you want to stay in it has all the amenities of home. Sandra and her husband were wonderful and attentive hosts. They were quick to respond to questions about anything. The house was exceptionally clean, the bed was comfortable, and the bathtub/shower has plenty of hot water so that you can relax after a long day of shopping and exploring. Will definitely stay here again."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We stayed here for about 2 weeks and we're very happy we chose this place ! From the very beginning Sandra was very friendly and up front about everything. She met all my needs and was so sweet ! While there she was always available if I needed her and the house was super cute and cozy .. we had a great time !
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Vanessa and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The location was ideal and a quick and easy walk to the activities we were interested in.
Sandra was a proactive host, and was very helpful in getting us checked in."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and a great host! All the little details really made the place feel like home. Will be using again!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was perfect for my wife and me. It is close to the main drag without the noise. Clean and comfortable. Check-in was easy and communication was fantastic. We will be back.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You will not go wrong with your stay at Sandra's As soon as I walked thru the door, it was if I stepped back in time to a place forgotten but cherished in my memories! The colors of each room were so calming and the bed was so comfortable. We were close enough to front street we walked to the Jazz & RB Festival. Sandra is very easy to contact and responds quickly! This is our first Airbnb stay and we will
Be back!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very good place to stay. Beautiful paintings on the wall and very nice people as well. Was also not far from anything very centrally located
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sandra and her husband are great hosts! We enjoyed the time we got to visit with them. This place was perfect for me and my husband over a 4 day weekend! We were able to walk all over the historic district of Natchitoches from the duplex.
Don’t let the drive up appeal mislead you…they are a sanctuary for honey bees and monarch butterflies so they let their yard be “freer” than most.
When you enter through the garage, you step into a brightly colored living space with a small kitchen fully stocked! The couch is so comfortable! Go down the hall to the master bedroom with its king size bed and feel at home! Then step into the retro bathroom that reminded us of my husband’s parents house!! A fantastic value for the area!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So close to Front Street shops and restaurants!
Sandra gave us wonderful tips on where to go for local music, etc. We didn't have to drive anywhere and our stay was so relaxing!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You can’t go wrong with this choice. Excellent location! So convenient to town, but with all the comfort of home. So, if you don’t want to go out you don’t need to. Very clean. Very comfortable. Easy to communicate with the host. I would definitely stay again."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very charming, spacious spot in a fabulous location right next to down town. Sandra was so friendly and very responsive. We had a wonderful stay!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying here is as refreshing as the time away itself. Sandra and Tony were instant friends as we invited them to stop by to meet them.
Very gracious and hospitality-oriented, they prepared, created, and maintained a very comfortable, invigorating time away. They were there when we arrived to offer a brief greeting and welcome. It was just right.
From the initial contact we had with Sandra, the communication was excellent. Replies were quick, thorough, and addressed any questions we had.
They were very reasonable about ensuring that our stay would be worry-free and hassle-free.
Kindness and generosity - in a world filled with a “mob hatred” mentality – is a breath of fresh air. Sandra and Tony made this a reality for us.
You would do extremely well to stay at this location. It was more than a “place to stay.” It was a pleasantly joyful experience.
We will be coming back here more than once as vacancies allow!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family enjoyed their stay. Great place.
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"We had a wonderful Christmas vacation! Overall, the place and scenery were great! We felt at home. Would rent it again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The property was amazing and even better than advertised! Beds were comfortable. The house was clean. More kitchen appliances than I needed as well as a grill and a griddle in the back porch! Views were amazing. Morning coffee with the sunrise was awesome. 10/10 will rebook!! Loved it!!!!!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful place to stay
Very relaxing and peaceful!
Will definitely be back!"
2023-08-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Unfortunately it just didn’t reach expectation.
Whilst the inside of the property was lovely the outside was dirty, in places unsafe (broken sunbeds, porch swing had nails sticking up so couldn’t sit on it, parts of the deck were coming up)
The reason we booked this house is it had a hot tub when we booked which when we arrived wasn’t there anymore, the listing had been updated since we booked and a hurricane had taken the hot tub away a couple of years before. This was very very disappointing for us. Without loungers to use or a hot tub we spent zero time outside and that’s the main reason we booked the house. Melissa was made aware of the situation but I guess there wasn’t anything she could do.
The location is beautiful and tons of lovely places to walk and eat in town about ten mins away.
We wouldnt return unless the whole of the outside had a massive update which is sad as we was so looking forward to it.
Melissa was very easy to communicate with"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Melissa is always a great host. We definitely will be back again and again
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful property. The perfect weekend getaway for our family. We did some dock fishing and caught lots of bream (FYI they liked crickets more than worms/nightcrawlers) and 2 huge bass.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice property. We enjoyed our stay. We will return...
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot. Clean. Good AC, TV, & kitchen. Medium sized bedrooms. Fantastic view of the lake/river. Very quiet. Peaceful. Perfect view of each days sunrise on the water. Host was very responsive and quick with replies to any questions."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Melissa was awesome and extremely accommodating. If you are looking in this area I highly recommend.
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"The house was absolutely great. The beds were nice and firm, the bathroom in master bathroom was beautiful, i loved it had an extra bathroom downstairs, the deck was great for us to hang out and chill. 1 house had a griddle and the other house had the bbq grill. The kitchen was large enough for a big group. The 2nd house was an added bonus since we had alot of my family coming and we were able to book both houses and they were side by side. The kids had a fantastic time, we fished, relaxed, enjoyed family time and wish we could have stayed longer. We will definitely book again if we come back to Natchitoches. Melissa was very responsive and was a super laid back host which I love.☺️🤗"

Beds are all comfortable too! The sunrise over the river out the den windows was SO AWESOME! We loved it! Melissa was a pleasure to work with! Hope to go back SOON!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful views and great communication. We had an amazing weekend!!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We travel a lot as a family and Melissa’s Airbnb was one of the best places we’ve stayed. The location is perfect, the views are beautiful & the home is just steps away from the water. There was more than enough space for our family of 6 and Melissa included so many thoughtful details.
The kitchen was well equipped and had everything you could possibly need to cook meals. There were more than enough towels, pillows & bed linens. The sofa and recliners were so comfy and the deck outside the living room is perfect for family meals. All the bedrooms have private entrances making it easy to access the decks without disturbing other guests.
We also enjoyed fishing late into the night from the deck. We caught blue gill, striped bass, bull head and channel catfish. There was even an electric filet knife to prepare our catches for dinner! We enjoyed the fall festival downtown and food from the local restaurants.
Melissa is the host as well as the owner which made communicating far more pleasant and easier than dealing with a private management company. She was attentive to our needs and gave great recommendations on things to do in the area.
This place truly has everything and we will most definitely be back!"
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,Very relaxing with everything you need for perfect get away. Would highly recommend would definitely stay again!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful place! Melissa was kind and responsive and helped us navigate a tricky situation with care and understanding.

2021-09-01,5,Group trip,I stayed here for a small birthday dinner with a few close friends and family. The home is just as pictured. Very rustic and cozy. The kitchen literally has everything you could possibly need and more. Comfortable furniture. My husband fished from the boat dock area at night and caught some HUGE catfish. We would definitely stay again.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome Hosts! Great place and we will be back.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great time. Close enough yo town to be convenient to everything but far enough away for peace and quiet. Great house with a nice dock. Good fishing!!! Very clean.

2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Outstanding accommodations and wonderful, responsive hosts! This place was the perfect retreat spot for a tranquil time of much-needed R & R of fishing, boating, and just relaxing on the deck. There are multiple deck areas to find a peaceful spot alone in nature under the trees or to hang out in conversation. The cabin allows spacious room for guests to gather intimately or spread out in the kitchen and den areas. The balcony areas outside each bedroom were awesome for star watching. The hosts were wonderful and provided comfy little touches that make the cabin feel like home. We hated to leave and look forward to a return trip!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking for peace and quiet, this is the place to be. It is right on the water, plenty of large and small appliances to accomplish any fun project, and well stocked minus food products, to make you feel right at home."

2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"House was beautiful! All of the patios and balcony’s alone are the perfect place to sit and read or just watch the boats go by. It was an amazing property, sitting out watching the sunset on the river was so peaceful and relaxing. Everything was close to town, easy drive, will definitely book here again!"

2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What you may expect - everything in the listing and more. Melissa was so kind, understanding, accommodating, and very quick to respond - even after we arrived much later than expected. Her place is darling. The layout is super cool lending privacy for sleeping and spacious enough to gather the family. Sunrise on the river is beautiful, inviting just one more cup of coffee before starting the day. It’s the kind of place that makes one “smile all the way home!”"
2020-02-01,5,Group trip,"Thomas and Melissa are wonderful hosts. This house is beautiful, cozy and made me feel so at home. Thank you!!!"

We will be back, for sure!!"

2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Rachel’s place was wonderful. Everything was beautiful. Communication was wonderful. We would definitely stay there again.
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"We were supposed to have seven ladies staying in Rachel's house, but, it ended up that only five could come; therefore, we really had lots of room. Each of us had our own bed, as the house was so large. The house was very clean with upscale appliances. Our location could not have been better. We enjoyed walking in the neighborhood and walking across the bridge to downtown Natchitoches. There was an unbelievable amount of parking spaces which we didn't need, but would be great for some. Rachel always answered my texts when I had a question. We had a wonderful time in our ""home away from home"" and would certainly go there again"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,We loved our stay here! We will definitely be back on day!!
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"A beautiful home in the perfect area! Extremely clean, lots of extra towels, pillows and blankets. Everything smelled freshly laundered. Walking distance to downtown and a very short drive to NSU and LSMSA. Big, fenced in backyard perfect for playing and grilling. A separate, little game room area for kids to escape. The easiest checkout procedures of any Air BnB I’ve stayed in. Rachel was so quick to respond to any questions I had. Definitely putting this Natchitoches gem on my list!"
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The house was beautiful and exactly as described. I gave four stars (instead of five) because we had issues with the alarm system. Just an unfortunate fluke and Rachel (host) was super responsive. After a bit of back and forth and a few visits from the alarm company, it was all resolved. Otherwise the stay was perfect!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful property right across the street from cane river. Peaceful and beautiful property. Would definitely stay again!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved staying at The Cedars. There was plenty space for our family of 7. The home is welcoming & decorated beautifully. Everything was pristine!
We will definitely book again!"

Rachel was so helpful and the home was perfect for our family!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was great very nice house and area would definitely go back
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,My husband and I both attended Northwestern in late 70’s and had 3 years of the Christmas festival together. This past weekend we had our family of 11 go to see how wonderful Natchitoches still is. What a perfect home to share with them. All the conveniences and so tastefully decorated for the Christmas season. Walkable to downtown and comfortable after all of the festivities. Our host was so great and responsive. You won’t be disappointed if you choose her lovely spacious cottage!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Another great stay at the Cedars House, our second this year. Everything from my previous review can be reiterated here: an absolutely beautiful home with ample space and very comfortable, with modern amenities but still retaining the charm and character that these lovely homes have. What was new for us is the beginning of the Christmas season in Natchitoches. Rachel decorates the home for the season, and the kiddos were delighted to see the Christmas tree and the lights.
The location is phenomenal for both walking to Front Street and participating in the many Christmas activities, or for staying at the house, pulling up some chairs and watching the fireworks. In my group, which is three generations of family ranging in age from late 60s to 5 years old, every single person just loves staying here. Natchitoches and the Cedars House are a new family tradition."
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Such a charming place to stay. There were nine of us in our group and we were all very comfortable. The house is super clean and very spacious. We didn’t feel crowded at all. Such a beautiful city and we can’t wait to come back!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We made reservations for a girl’s weekend in Natchitoches, LA. I contacted Rachel month’s in advance and she patiently worked with me as I coordinated dates with my girlfriends. Once at the property, we found the amenities to be everything promised and much more. Everything was clean, with plenty of towels and the kitchen had everything needed! And, it was very spacious! We had an excellent experience!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was amazing. Very clean and user friendly. We had to alter our visit and Rachel, our host made arrangements to accommodate us. We will be staying there again.
Thanks"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"This home is absolutely beautiful and a perfect house for a great trip to Natchitoches! The rooms were clean and large, big open spaces for visiting with family and friends and a perfect outdoor area. Comfortably and easily slept multiple couples and kids. Rachel was easy to communicate with and assured we were settled and comfortable for our weekend. We loved this house and will absolutely be back again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very charming and beautiful cottage! The place was very clean and cozy, perfect location to downtown. The layout of the cottage was great for a large group and was the perfect place for our girl’s weekend! The host was extremely helpful and responsive, lots of amenities to help make it feel like home, plenty of space, organized and very welcoming. We will definitely be back! Thoroughly enjoyed our stay!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Rachel’s house is very pretty, very comfortable, very clean, and more spacious than it even looks from pictures. We had 12 people including kids getting showered and ready for several events over 3 days and it worked great. Relaxing times were easy between downstairs and upstairs sofa and tv spots. The house is located in a pretty neighborhood, and just across the River (5minutes) from the beautiful downtown where we spent most of our time. Thank you Rachel, and we would definitely come back!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Very great stay! Rachel was super responsive and helped me from check in to check out. You can’t beat the location ! Literally walking distance from river bank and downtown area. Big beautiful kitchen and spacious rooms. Will definitely stay again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home with both old and new charm! Everything was well organized, clean and a peaceful setting. Rachel is very professional yet with a warm welcoming touch. This home is unique, comfortable and conveniently located to many of the sought-after attractions in the historic town. I would definitely stay there again and highly recommend to anyone else looking for a quality place to stay in Natchitoches! Thanks again Rachel for allowing us to book and experience your lovely home during our visit!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home. The host was very responsive. Excellent stay.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Rachel was so helpful. I had a lot of questions beforehand, and she was always so quick to respond. The house is immaculate and has plenty of towels, kitchen gadgets & comfortable furniture. We had a pretty bad storm roll in that took out the electricity, and not only did the house generator immediately start up, but she reached out to check on us. I highly recommend!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house is adorable!! Very clean and comfortable!! Plenty of space to park with great outdoor space and very roomy inside!! Our family enjoyed hanging out together as well as cooking meals together!! All the beds were very comfortable with good privacy!! Love this house and the location!! Rachel was very responsive and accommodating. Would only be disappointed if I couldn’t stay again on any return trips to Natchitoches.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderfully cozy home with ample space, comfortable beds, full kitchen with plenty of dishes and cookware, private backyard and a great little game room for the kiddos. Our group had eight people, five adults and three children, and everyone felt right at home. It was the first Airbnb experience for the other adults and they couldn't have been happier. They originally had planned on staying at a local motel but our stay at Rachel's home made the trip so much more enjoyable. Being centrally located near the Cane River meant we were able to walk down to Front Street easily. The internet/wifi is fast and reliable. Rachel provides clear, helpful guidance on how best to enjoy the home. Will definitely book another trip here again!"
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,Lovely clean home! We had an amazing time!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This cottage was perfect for our group and very short drive to Northwestern’s campus. Rachel answered all of our questions before our stay, and we had everything we needed. It was very clean and the beds were comfortable. Highly recommend!"

You will want to stay here, trust me. It is a roomy house and didn't feel crowded at all even with 8 adults and 4 children. It was very clean and beautifully decorated. Even the dishes were beautiful and all matched. My family and I don't have anything bad to say about this place!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great Location, Safe and Comfortable!!! Clean! Clean! Clean!! Did I say Clean! Lol! I am so impressed with this house it is adorable. I love every thing about it. It exceeded our expectations. We travel a lot and use VRBO & Airbnb often. This place was perfect for our family we made life long memories here. Thank you for your opening your home. I appreciate everything so much!"
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"The house is very well located, a short walk from town and close to the grocery store and restaurants. We stayed during the Christmas festival and watched fireworks from just down the street! The beds and furniture are all comfortable and roomy. Our group of 12 never felt cramped. The host was thoughtful and communicated quickly. Super cute Christmas tree and wreaths on the front windows. You will need to bring your own seasonings, and I suggest bringing your own towels along with a few extra dish towels and a corkscrew. We would certainly stay there again if in Natchitoches!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,So clean and new! Rachel was really kind and responsive.
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"This house was so cute!! Very spacious and clean! 3 min away from front street aka shopping, food and bars! Rachel was fast at communicating. We def plan on staying there everytime we visit our fam in Natchitoches"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A great home that is close enough to front street to easily walk and enjoy the sites, shops, and restaurants! Also a comfortable home that was easily accessible. Would definitely stay there again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"These are quiet and cozy cabins surrounded by big shade trees. Out on the back porch you can relax on a porch swing and see the river flowing and hear the birds chirping. There is a small fire pit and a small charcoal grill right off the deck. The floating dock is great for fishing and is next to a private boat ramp. The gar were rolling and we reeled in some blue catfish.
Andrea was very responsive to our questions and concerns and recommended a few local restaurants to check out during our stay."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Andrea was so easy to work with! Her cabin was so peaceful and in a beautiful location! We will definitely be back!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome host… Very relaxing and peaceful!!! 10/10
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at the cabins on Horseshoe Hills Ranch! Very cozy, clean, looked just like the pictures. Loved the porch in the back to relax and sip coffee. Would totally stay here again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I loved the cute little cabins. They reminded us of dollhouses. It was so peaceful and beautiful. My guys loved fishing from the dock . It would be a great place to launch a boat for bowfishers because the gar were rolling everywhere. We loved all the dog friends that came to visit us and my daughter and I bought carrots to feed the donkeys and the horse. We had a great time. If you love the outdoors and love animals, this is a great place to visit."
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice peaceful cabin in the woods
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time staying here. Would love to see it with leaves on the trees.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely little cabin and close proximity to Natchitoches and the wonderful historic downtown area with Christmas lights.. Enjoyed the local plantations - great base for seeing the area. We want to visit again in the spring.
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Enjoyed my stay. Very nice management. Animal lover. Enjoyed the farm 💕
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great quite and peaceful place.
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,This place is so peaceful and beautiful!! We loved our stay. Definitely recommend 👍🏼
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a long weekend for me and my friend to meet up for time together. She lives in Texas and I live in Alabama. The cabin was just what we needed. The area surrounding the cabins was impressive with the fire pit and swings around it. There were lots more to explore but we were also there for the Christmas Festival. We had a great time! We would definitely come back!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location and cabin was great. Only thing needed is new toilet seat and mattress on double bed. It sinks in middle and is very soft. Everything else was wonderful!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We booked this cabin because we definitely don’t like the bed and breakfast or hotel atmospheres. We were pleased that the cabin was close enough to all of the Natchitoches attractions but far enough away to get away from the crowds. We would definitely stay here again! Thanks again for a peaceful getaway!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our cabin was extremely cozy! It was peaceful, quiet, and excluded but yet close enough to town. We came down for the Christmas lights, it was perfect. Great space for kids.The beds.. WOW comfortable. The shower was nice and hot. The swing on the back porch was a perfect touch. Had all inanities to feel at home. The heater kept the place very warm. It felt as if I were in the heartland with the water and horses nearby. Sweet pups and a cat greeted us. Andrea responded in less than 30 seconds EVERY time.
Thanks to Andrea for the stay. We will be back."
2023-11-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Our stay started off a little rocky. The cleaning service had not cleaned the cabin before our arrival at 3. Andrea was quick to respond and allowed us to stay at another cabin that was available. This cabin was very cozy and clean. The beds were very comfortable and she had all of the amenities one might need to cook a meal. We enjoyed drinking our coffee on the patio and hanging out on the dock. There were two dogs who roamed freely who played really well with our pup. We also walked one of the trails which was really peaceful. We even lit a fire in one of the fire pits one night which was nice. Would definitely stay again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabins are very nice & cozy!! Will be staying again anytime we travel to Natchitoches. 10\10 recommend.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place and responsive host.
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"This was the cutest cozy cabin! We have a friends weekend here and will definitely be coming back with our families!
If you are looking for a peaceful getaway spot this is it!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the Cabin. Will definitely be back!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Andrea was a great hostess. We were able to get in touch with her for questions and received answers in a professional prompt manner. Everything that was promised as part of our stay was above expectations. We will be returning in the future and know that Andrea will make our stay pleasurable.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cabin was a little smaller than expected from the pictures. It had very basic kitchen needs/supplies, but that was listed in the description. It was in a very quiet, secluded location. I was there on work, so it was exactly what I needed during my stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,The property was exactly as described. Andrea was very responsive and accommodating. Would definitely stay here again!
2023-10-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"I was somewhat disappointed at how ""used"" the appliances were. Although each of the downstairs appliances worked properly, they looked very ragged. The upstairs television never did work properly--the volume couldn't be raised beyond a whisper. The real frustration for me was the condition of the sofa and chair in the living area. They were so used, there was no way to sit on them without pain. They clearly need to be retired. Everything else about the property was excellent. Andrea was nice and responsive. Most of the furnishings in Cabin # 2 just need replacing. (Bed was fine.)"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great Stay!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow, what an absolutely gorgeous spot. The cabins are cozy and inviting. They sit atop a hill and overlook the river. There is an awesome fire pit with swings all around it. The whole ranch is beautiful and thoughtfully laid out and designed. Our stay was wonderful. We would definitely come back!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Small cozy cabin. Was a brief but great stay.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great host, very peaceful and comfortable, will definitely return!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Cute rustic cabin set off in the woods. Awesome little dock with great fishing! Caught perch and brim. Would be an amazing place to garfish.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed cooking a meal and not eating out. So quiet and pretty. Love the swing on the porch with our coffee.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was a pleasure to stay at. I loved the access to the fishing dock and having the capability to build a bonfire.
Great hospitality!"
2023-06-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"If you’re looking for a secluded area to stay with peace and tranquility, this is the place for you. This is the type of place we were looking for. Our only disappointment was that this cabin had not be thoroughly cleaned in a very long time. The bathroom shower doors and shower wall were dirty and dusty. The bath rug was dirty. Cabinets in the kitchen were dirt and dusty. The entrance door glass was spotty and dirty as it is the first thing you see when you get to the door. Bushes were dead at the front porch. How uninviting. Porches had but been cleaned in a long time. Dusting had not been done in a while. I don’t know what cleaning service you use, but they should be fired. This place would be a 10 if it would be cleaner."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Great location, quite and beautiful scenery."
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The cabins are so beautiful! The scenery is also amazing. We truly enjoyed our stay at a beautiful ranch! Only concern was the wait at the access gate (was scared since we were coming in late the gate wouldn’t open) and the door on our cabin didn’t lock from the outside. Other than that we loved everything!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We have stayed here many times, it never disappoints!"
2023-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,Great place to relax!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved this place
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely peaceful place to chill out for a couple of days. Had lots of visits from the dogs and the friendly cat was a visitor that never left!
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,Very nice with a secluded feel but not far from shopping and eateries. Five “old friends” gathered around a fire pit enjoying an Beautiful Cool Evening. Very Relaxing. Thanks Andrea for making this a great booking experience.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Hidden Or
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful Cozy Cabin in the woods. 12/10 Highly recommend for anyone wanting to relax or just some peaceful living.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,My wife and I had a great weekend stay with our pup! A short drive to the stores and restaurants downtown- highly recommend!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very peaceful, quiet and clean. There is also a boat launch i wish i would have know about. I recommend and will be back when it warms up with a boat"
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was very quiet which is what we were looking for.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lovely scenery and a peaceful, well-kept property. My entire family (and pups) enjoyed our stay."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an awesome time as usual. Wonderful little get away.
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,Highly recommended
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the cabins. We enjoyed how relaxing and comfortable they were. We will return soon.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little cabins in the woods. Everything you need for a little getaway.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is a hidden gem! Arrive during the daylight or look very closely for the cabin numbers on the Pillars on the porch they are black and hard to see. The hosts have phenomenal communication and are pretty much always available to help with anything. The cabins are basic and clean. Perfect for a getaway. we came from California to visit friends in Natchez and this was perfect for our family of 3 adults and 2 kids. There’s plenty of porch swings we spent one evening hanging out at the cabin with our friends before going to dinner and everyone loved it the kids ran and played and we sat and chitchatted. This place is the definition of peaceful and beautiful!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is place is so charming. Andrea and her husband were so nice and welcoming. We will return.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We truly enjoyed our stay. We just needed a weekend getaway and our sons had an absolute blast. They have nice trails and beautiful set ups. Perfect for a reunion or just big group. The deck was so much fun we fished and swam.they have horses and we enjoyed the friendly cats and dogs on site. Definitely not disappointed and we will be back.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,great place to stay. has everything you need and it's exactly as advertised. bring your fishing pole and tackle box
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great spot for a family
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved the seclusion of the cabins but the closeness of town and other attractions. Everything was as described. Check in was easy. Anytime I contacted Andrea about/during our stay I had a response within an hour. We enjoyed our stay at the cabins and hope to be back in the future.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,It is cute cabin. My older kids enjoyed walking the trails. The view of the river is beautiful.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute and secluded place! The hostess is very kind, accommodating and attentive. She responded to messages immediately. If you like a secluded, natural setting, but close to everything, this is the place for you!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Staying at the cabins is always a lovely and peaceful experience!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very calm and relaxing place to spend family time or a quiet getaway.
2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Cabins were as advertised, Rustic, Small and Quaint! They are fairly close together, similar to a camping ground. The area was quiet and the grounds were well maintained. Bathroom is downstairs from the bedroom if stairs are an issue for you."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"These cabins are awesome! We throughly enjoyed the location, the remoteness, the back porch swing, the ease of entry/instructions for coming/going, etc. Beautiful, well maintained property/grounds, etc. We were 10mins from most things which was accessible but kept us feeling out of town, which we loved. It was quiet, peaceful. Highly recommend!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Andrea’s cabins are absolutely wonderful! Beyond cute and have all the amenities you’ll need. Plus, the location is peaceful! Highly recommend and will hopefully be back!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A very clean and quiet cabin. Location is very nice and not hard to find.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is amazing! The facilities and cabins are clean. I would recommend this place for a family reunion or a family trip.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to relax and unwind from the hustle and bustle of Dallas! Nice scenery, quiet, and peaceful! I highly recommend!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great place!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We would definitely stay again. The place is super cute. Loved sitting on the swing and drinking our coffee.
If you happen to be allergic to cats you will need to find a different place. We loved spending time with the cats. Feeding the horses was amazing."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Charming cabin in a very beautiful setting. The beds were super comfy, and we really enjoyed our quiet time. We would 100% stay here again.
Some notes before booking: The cabin is one of 6 in a semi-circle, so it's not isolated - you have neighbors. This would be a fantastic location for a family reunion with its multiple cabins, pavilions, etc. Also, bring anything for cooking you may need (including salt and pepper, coffee, wine opener) as there are only some basic utensils, pots & pans. The same also applies to toiletries - bring everything you need. The fridge is a mini-fridge, so prepare accordingly."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This cabin was perfect for our trip. It was clean and cozy. We were greeted by the sweetest little cat that the kids temporarily named “Elvis”. We even got a little surprise when we noticed the large open field with cute little fishing dock behind the cabin. The kids and dog got to run free and they absolutely loved it.
2021-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great Location… quaint cabins… Natchitoches is such a great place to vacation!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you want a nice and quiet place to stay, this is the place for you. No hustle and bustle of the city anywhere to be found. Cabins are cozy with beautiful scenery."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was perfect! It was clean and spacious enough for 3 women. The location was close enough to downtown for shopping and eating out, but far enough to also have peace and quiet (away from traffic and noise). Andrea answered my questions in a timely manor. I would definitely recommend staying at this ranch."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved the cabins and the setting. It was quiet and peaceful. A great family weekend!
2021-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The ranch is a great, affordable getaway that gives you that mountain feel even though it’s in Louisiana. We enjoyed seeing the horses and making use of the trails on the property. The listing doesn’t mention it but our cabin had mini fridges so keep that in mind if packing food. Andrea was quick to answer messages."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great, relaxing time at the cabin. The 30 acres had nice scenery, trails to wonder around on, nice floating dock on the bayou. cabins were just what I needed. Would stay here again."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The cabin was cute and the surroundings were quite serene, and the location was close enough to the town, very convenient. The property was also very neat, and would recommend it for a stay. The only issue was the barn cats that refused to leave the cabin."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Andrea has a beautiful property that is located close enough to town that going is very convenient but far enough away that you feel like you are one with nature. It's quiet and peaceful. Bring some peppermints just incase because the horses are very friendly but I'm sure look forward to their treats. Some people spend a good portion of their vacation eating out and sightseeing but if you plan to spend any time relaxing and cooking at the cabin you'll want to bring the necessities plus a can opener, corkscrew, or whatever for your specific needs outside of the normal kitchen ware. My husband didn't get to do much fishing but said the little he could was quite nice, especially so if someone brought a boat. If you have the chance the horse and buggy ride and trip down the river were very interesting and well worth doing 👌 I would definitely recommend staying at Andea's to anyone considering."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful location. The property is well maintained. I love when I get to stay in Nachochies !!!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was so cute and adorable, that we are rebooking it again!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,10/10! Would come again!
2021-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Only issue was barn cats trying to come into the cabin.
2021-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The cabin was good my family enjoyed it, just did not like there’s not much privacy. The cabins are a little close. Other than that we loved fishing and walking around out there. My kids loved the animals. We will come back!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,A wonderful hidden gem! The sweet animals made our trip extra special. We can’t wait to come back!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family of 5 spent a week at the cabins and we had a wonderful time. We hiked the trails in the woods, fished off the dock, and my kids enjoyed petting and feeding the animals. The cabin is clean and cozy and we fit comfortably with our young kids. I appreciated being able to use the laundry room whenever we needed.
The cabins are near each other but there is still plenty of privacy. This would be a perfect location for a family reunion!
Andrea is one of the most genuine and kind people I have met. The hosts are available if anything is needed. We had a great stay!"
2021-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The few days that we stayed where great the cabin was very comfortable and peaceful.

2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great time and enjoyed the peace and quiet.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely loved our stay at Hidden Hills Ranch! So many things for a family to enjoy between the hiking trails through the woods to explore, to fishing in the Bayou, to visiting the horses and donkeys or relaxing on your private back porch on a swing or by the campfire right outside your door. We were so happy we brought our dog to run and play with Addie the farm dog. she literally came to the front door to get him every morning! We will definitely be back for another ""unplugged"" adventure with the kids."
2021-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Perfect size for two people looking to get away. Nice fishing area and trails. There is only a mini fridge and the bathroom sink is very small. Not great water pressure in the shower. The cabin is small, clean, and quiet. I would recommend staying here and would stay here again."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and relaxing location. Very quiet, apart from the occasional other cabin guests. Lovely walks in the woods. Conveniently located near the charming town of Natchitoches."

2021-03-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Cute place in scenic location, but expect rustic and nothing fancy!"

2020-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a woodsy adventure close to town, this is the place! We had access to a large fire pit/swing area, a boat ramp, covered dock with swings and a crow’s nest, and a compact cabin that was plenty roomy for our group."

2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a good time and enjoyed the cabin. Since both my son and I have allergies, we were super happy & thrilled about the cleanliness of the cabin- we had zero allergy issues. Our host was super responsive when we had gate code issue to enter and cable issues in the morning. The cabin was exactly like in the pics. We did cook breakfast and dinner – the pots/pans & silverware were sufficient. Our dog was comfortable and enjoyed playing with Addie the friendly dog on the grounds!
We wish we had more time and had planned for a horse/donkey ride earlier as my son really wanted to do that.. I would recommend others to reach out in advance to plan ahead of time; I will definitely plan in advance in future.
We will definitely be coming back again as the location was perfect to explore around the area and walk some good trails around Kisatchie as well as Natchichodes river walk."

2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for our little family of 4. It’s only 10 minutes from Front Street, but I felt like we were on a little nature retreat. The cabins are well designed, and we barely heard our neighbors. Nice view from the back porch."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The cabin was cozy and the property was beautiful. We went fishing, played with the puppy, pet the horses and went on a hike. It is the perfect place to bring a family. We were worried that the cabin might be too small but there was plenty of space for our family of 6."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was so relaxing and fun. The property has a private boat launch so we were able to bring our boat and fish the bayou. The cabin was bigger than we expected. We had just the right amount of room with us and our 2 dogs. We will most definitely be back!!

2020-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This is a really cute spot just outside of Natchotoches. We made a fire, sat out of the back patio, and went down to the water where there are a horse and donkey. Our kids had a great time feeding them the peppermints provided.
The only thing I would say is bring your own kitchen supplies like seasonings, EVOO, coffee, sugar, etc.
Thanks for having us, Andrea!"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is perfect if you love to take in nature and all it has to offer. It’s very quiet, the landscape is gorgeous and the cabins are just precious. I will be back to HRH as often as I can"

It was very clean and we were provided with everything we needed to feel right at home. I have to say the beds are so comfortable! The amazingly beautiful view of the bayou and the wooded area around was just the best therapy for us. I highly recommend staying here. The host are welcoming, kind and very quick to respond to any questions you may have. They are doing a great job!! I can hardly wait to go back!"

2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"We really enjoyed our stay. The home is perfectly appointed and very comfortable. Bring some bubble bath because you will want to soak all your troubles away in the amazing soaker tub in the master. The kitchen was the main spot for us, cooking was fun and made for great entertaining for our family. The backyard sits a good bit off the river, so I would feel very safe with smaller kids out there. The river traffic was plentiful but nothing outrageous or loud. Mainly families cruising in pontoon boats.
The beds were extremely comfortable, I know I slept great. I do love a foam mattress. Everything was lovely, I highly recommend staying here."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Janice and Jonathan are the ideal hosts; communicative, gracious and accommodating. They’re content to give you your privacy but are also there to chat if you’re feeling social. The kayaks were a thoughtful addition that allow you to experience the area from the water. Janice and Jonathan were happy to help us get in and give us the lay of the land. (There’s a restaurant/bar that you can paddle up to and stop at). We didn’t see gators on our excursions but don’t be surprised if you do! I was reassured that they were more frightened of me than I was of them (unlikely), so no worries. 😉
The room is tastefully decorated and delightfully functional, not to mention refreshing and a perfect place to clean up and recharge after a day in the hot, humid air.
I can’t recommend this place enough. I’m jealous of the people checking in after us! We will definitely be back soon."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cane River Living is on my list of places that I want to visit every summer. The cottage is comfortable, clean, beautiful and has everything that we needed for our stay. The view from the dock that is available was STUNNING! We saw several sets of egrets and herons flying over the lake. The outdoor spaces include a lookout point that is at the top of the hill with seating and then downstairs at the dock there are chairs and fans, which made watching the sunset near the water comfortable. It was so nice to enjoy the waterfront in a private setting.
The house is really close to the historic downtown, so it only takes a few minutes by car to get to the brick streets and traditional views that you expect from Natchitoches."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a gem. The location on the Cane River, the proximately to the historic district and the décor of the unit itself was amazing.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you are ever looking for a place for stay while visiting Natchitoses, Cane River Living hits the spot! It is a delightful little bungalow for two with an amazing outside area from which to enjoy view. The quaint shopping/dining area is less than a mile away. Janice, our host , was most accommodating from the time I made the reservation until we left. Every thing we could possibly have needed for our overnight stay was provided.

So quiet, the river views are amazing, the private dock has chairs AND a fan, the fire pit area is beautiful…….and everything is super close, on the riverfront …. Coffee shop, candy shop, restaurants, pub/bar, boutique etc. FYI being on the water expect a possible slithery visitor while fishing…. That can’t be helped this place is literally right on the water. Loved it."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really did our research before choosing Cane River Living & Wow...We made the right choice! ""Peaceful & Private"" were our main search criteria. Janice had Every Detail covered, from q-tips to bedding & cleanliness was beyond 5 Stars. The square footage is small but very well designed. A wonderful brick sitting deck with a fire pit / grill was the perfect place to watch a beautiful sunset. At water level is an awesome covered warf / boat shed where we caught plenty of brim, perch & catfish. Downtown Natchitoches was 5 minutes away. The perfect couples getaway & we can't wait to visit again. Thank you Janice for thinking of all the small details that made our 4 night stay Phenomenal💯"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place and great stay. Super clean and cute. I didn’t realize it had a home on property and this bnb was in the back and had a shared drive way. I may have missed that when I looked at pics. Wasn’t a big deal we enjoyed it!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful experience overall.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I were in town for my sister’s wedding on Front Street. Janice’s place was conveniently located just a mile down river - very easy to find and access. Although the place is small (about the size of a standard hotel room), there are many details that make the space both functional and cozy - especially the sliding overbed table and the dressing bench in the bathroom. There’s a beautiful view of the river and the neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. Perfect place for a couple’s getaway! Would definitely recommend."

The space is small but somehow it doesn’t feel small. It sits nestled next to Janice’s property, but it is very private, with a beautiful river view. She and her husband were friendly and warm and available throughout our stay if we needed anything."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great location! Easy to walk to downtown restaurants and shopping. House had everything we needed! We really appreciated that they provided local restaurant recommendations (many of which we tried)! I was also super impressed when the host found out that we’d be arriving late due to storms during travel, they even provided restaurants that they knew were open late! So thoughtful!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Walter was great host. Everything that he had described about his home was correct. What you saw online is what you saw in person. The home was very comfortable and welcoming. It was in walking distance of downtown Natchitoches. He made himself available for any questions that we have during our stay. I would recommend this home to anyone who is looking for a great weekend getaway. I hope in the near future to return to The Church Street House.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great experience!

2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful, peaceful retreat! Girls trip with friends. This was perfect for our group of “girls”. (All over 60 years of age). Comfortable and very nice! We couldn’t have asked for more. Beautiful sunsets over the lake in the evening and coffee on the deck in the mornings. Close enough to tour Natchitoches, but private also. Nicole checked on us several times, and was very responsive if we had a question. We will be back! Thank you!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautifully updated cabin on the river. Very clean and comfortable, and the outside spaces are wonderful. Lots of room for kids to play inside and out, and we really enjoyed fishing off the dock. Easy ride into town on a main road with shopping and restaurants, but far enough away to be quiet and private.
Plenty of seating, very cold AC, and great parking. A great fit for our group of seven."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This is one of the best airbnb in Natchitoches. It's just far enough away to be nice and quiet. There are plenty fish in the bayou, and the back porch is comfortable. The AC in the house is also very cold. We really loved this place."

So many amenities, fully stocked kitchen utensils, super comfy beds and linens, plenty of towels, plenty of space. The back porch/deck, backyard and pier were fabulous. Even nice outdoor furniture and electronics. She had kayaks to use but we didn’t have time this trip. They’ve truly thought of everything you could possibly need. We can’t wait to stay here again. Nicole was even kind enough to allow an early Checkin since the home was ready early, and a later checkout since the house wasn’t rented for the day we were leaving. Such a nice bonus."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home was perfect for our family to have a quiet weekend getaway!
Nicole thought of everything! From the fully stocked coffee bar to life jackets for the kiddos!
The beds were so clean and comfy and everything was spotless and tidy!
The whole atmosphere of the home was overall positive and encouraged family togetherness. Even the wall decor was comforting and inspiring.
The kiddos enjoyed fishing and kayaking (yes, Nicole even included a kayak!) during the day. We put our feet up to watch the sun go down in the evenings.
I would come here again and again! There’s something magical about this space!"

Local decor was on point as we are from Louisiana and appreciated the authentic feel. The location was excellent if you want to take a couple minute walk to enjoy on the riverside view and boutique shops/restaurants of Natchitoches. The host Brennan was extra responsive for any questions we had and we would absolutely stay here again anytime we want to visit!"

Beautiful, warm and inviting home with spacious rooms and a pristine interior. Lots of extra snacks and amenities too (thank you!). The patio out back was so beautiful and serene. Enjoy morning coffee or tea on the porch while watching the river float by along with local wildlife. The evenings bring beautiful sunsets and peaceful vibes. Friendly neighbors, quiet neighborhood, and it’s close to Natchitoches- only about 10-15 minutes away from the historic district and other activities. We slept well too - beds were so comfortable!

Treats were perfect after a long drive. Body wash when you’re like me and forget to pack. Cozy blankets everywhere to cuddle up on those cold nights in Natchitoches. Will definitely be back to this cozy spot.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Home was as pictured. Everything needed for home away from home visit. Plenty of kitchen items for cooking during our stay. Michael and Michele very accommodating. Only note, tv does not have local tv channels but does have all other smart tv channels. Will definitely stay again."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We recently had such a nice family stay at the townhouse located on the river.The back patio is located steps from the water. Having breakfast on the porch along with morning coffee was a plus. There are many historical places to visit and the town is so quaint and welcoming. Michael had treats waiting for us which was so thoughtful! I want to go back soon!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place right by the water. Very clean and organized. Home was exactly as described. The back porch is awesome!! 2 adult couples stayed and there was plenty of room. Maybe a 10 minute drive to downtown Natchitoches and well worth it. 5 minute drive to Oakland Plantation, great place to tour by the way. Michael was very responsive and pleasant, even when I thought I couldn’t get the code to work and even when I accidentally called him once. Great communication! Would definitely stay here again if we return to the area!"

Thanks Micheal.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Michael did amazing as a host. The home was spotless and was a beautiful location. All of the amenities are available for anything that you want to do. I would absolutely stay here again!
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"1) This listing is actually in Natchez, not Natchitoches as listed (outskirts of Natchitoches). The location is perfect for peace and quite, but inconvenient if you need to be in town for an event. I would definitely take advantage of the peaceful scenery if you ever need to just get away.
2) The water was Luke warm at best. After that cool shower the night before, my best friend got up the next morning with sinus pressure and congestion. Although she missed the Mardi Gras Ball, she caught up on much needed rest in that comfy bed! The hosts sent someone to cut the heat up on the hot water tank and we were pleased afterwards!
3) The housekeeper came over and re-cleaned the bathroom after I found hair on the counter. She was so nice!
4) There was hair on the sofa that wasn’t visible to the eye because of the color of the sofa. We didn’t notice until it was on our clothes. That was an easy miss that I believe would’ve been addressed if caught early on.
**We still enjoyed our stay!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Michael and Michelle provide a rival for quality hotels in a peaceful and serene environment. Lots of extras. Respond to questions and helpful with directions. We will be back many times.

Everything else was great!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Home was located off a main road & while it was not in downtown action it was very close to it. We felt at home & not like a hotel. Beautiful decor, thoughtful snacks, very clean & peaceful surroundings with the Cane River outside the back door. The covered patio with outdoor furniture was a bonus & nice place to relax & read a book or take a nap with the birds & river sounds in the background. Highly recommend & will stay here again on next trip."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay. Close to Natchitoches, which was the purpose of our visit. Extremely clean, welcoming, and a beautiful view of the Cane River. Highly recommend. Felt right at home."

2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"Oak on the Cane was the perfect getaway for our family for Thanksgiving weekend. The house was beautiful and spotless. The location is peaceful and just close enough to Natchitoches to take in all the holiday festivities. The amenities were great and the home was well stocked. The view from the back porch is beautiful and is perfect for grilling, which we fully enjoyed. After a day of shopping in town it was nice to wind down and throw some steaks on the grill and just relax. We can’t wait to return and enjoy another relaxing weekend."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Michael and this home were WONDERFUL!!! The river and back deck had everything you could need! Such a gorgeous view to wake up to in the morning! Super comfy beds, all toiletries were available, nice, big TVs… A plus for my hubby ha!
We called him about an issue we had with our family (needing to add someone and come sooner) and he was so kind and helpful!
This is a BARGAIN of a place, right down the road from some of the old plantations and super close to town. Thank you so much for sharing your home!"
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"We had an amazing stay, and loved this beautiful home! The host was always readily available to answer questions as well."
2022-10-01,4,Group trip,"This was my first time booking an air BNB. Checkin was super easy, however we did not have water for the first night of our stay because it was turned off. Every time we contacted Michael he was extremely quick to respond and tried all night to get the water turned back. Michael booked a hotel for us to stay while the water was off but it was 6 of us and we couldn’t sleep comfortably in 2 beds. The water was restored the next day and we were able to enjoy this very beautiful home. My review reflects the stress of our first night and having to stay in a hotel with 6 people because the house didn’t have water. The days actually spent in the home were lovely and peaceful. I would definitely rebook if I come back to the area."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is. perfect! the view of the river and beautiful oak tree are breathtaking! The home is furnished for comfort. The beds are so comfortable, we all agreed that we had the best sleep we've ever had on vacation. Michael thought of everything a family could possibly need, including snacks and drinks. We felt right at home. Our trip was amazingly relaxing and fun. We never had to travel more than 10 minutes to find restaurants, shopping, touring the movie films paths, and history of the beautiful town of Natchitoches. I wish all of our Airbnb vacations were this wonderful."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This house was an amazing home to rent! Everything was so clean and new! So many great little touches from the soaps in the shower to the pottery barn throw blankets! So cozy and well decorated! Not to mention the view is incredible! We spent most of time sitting on the cute patio drinking coffee watching the boats out in the river. Can’t rave enough about this rental!

Great staycation and close enough to the little town to go back and forth with ease.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So happy we took the opportunity to spend the weekend at this beautiful air bnb! The location is absolutely gorgeous, it’s right on the river which makes for a great view in the morning & late afternoon.

It got into the high twenties one night and we were not cold and did not lack hot water! We will be back. We would love to enjoy the lake in the summer time! We stayed for two nights and have 0 complaints. Everything was expected and better. Only complaint is we didn’t stay long enough!

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Can’t say enough about this hidden gem! Not only does the drive up to the lakehouse allows you time to take in the trees covered with Spanish moss and a view of Black Lake, but you are able to take in this view from the large deck. When you enter the house the first thing you notice is the welcoming scent throughout the house. We stayed during December, it was thoughtfully decorated for Christmas throughout. You could tell attention to detail has been put into every part of making this lakehouse our number one pick of places we have stayed. Every amenity to make this a great place to stay was provided. It has a spacious/comfortable sectional, tv with Netflix and Amazon provided. The kitchen has a large table to seat everyone. It was very well equipped with all the necessary cooking utensils/appliances/supplies, but also had lots of extras, which we appreciated. Wonderful coffee bar! Beds are just right for a good night sleep. Hosts were amazing and were quick to respond."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was so amazing! When we got there, Corey had put the a/c on which felt amazing compared to the Louisiana heat. During our stay, the power had gone out unfortunately. Corey and Rachel were very helpful and did everything they could to make sure we had the power back and communicated thoroughly. Luckily the power came back on that night! Everything about the house was great. I have no complaints what so ever."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay for the small amount of time I actually got to enjoy the beautiful scenery and peaceful quiet.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Rachel provided so many things not usually found in an Airbnb including hand soap, dishwashing soap, paper towels, toilet paper, laundry detergent/dryer sheets, seasonings, wood for a fire, charcoal for the grill, etc. All we really needed to bring ourselves was food, so that was impressive!
Also appreciated the a/c units and space heaters in each room."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Making this an annual trip! We planned a girls trip (with the kids) and had a wonderful time! The cabin was not too far from Natchitoches so we were able to go enjoy the Christmas lights and town. The property and cabin itself was cozy and a perfect place to relax even with a 3 & 7 year old! They had a tree swing across the road that they were able to enjoy! Also on our way out one the ladies veered off the road and got her car stuck! The owner of the cabin left work and came to pull her out! We highly recommend this cabin and will be returning!!

The owners even have an insane coffee bar! I'm giving this Lake Cabin 5 STARS!☆☆☆☆☆"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Rachel’s place is located in small,private and secluded area. Perfect for those times when you want to get away from it all.

2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Magnolia Lakehouse is everything you’ve ever wanted in a stay to relax, unwind, and enjoy some quiet time.
The location is about 20 min NE of town, on Black Lake, and a private road w/no one to bother you while you chill and recharge your mental batteries.
The amenities in the house are amazing. The coffee bar rocks. Tons of selections to choose from including hot cocoa! The AC units are cold which is a big deal here in Louisiana during - well, almost all year long. Ceiling fans are aplenty, too, both in all bedrooms and living area. Speaking of which, the couch is the most comfortable couch I’ve ever laid on (seriously). Plus it can fit at least three people laying down comfortable if you and your family members all want to crash for an afternoon nap.. The beds are very comfortable and the bathroom was fantastic. Our family of six was more than comfortable. Plus, the kitchen and dining room table were all more than sufficient in size for all of us during our trip. Everyone had plenty of space.
Rachel and Corey went out of their way to make sure we were accommodated for anything we needed. Their swift replies to our texts and needs were met immediately. It was nice to chat with them and to get to know them during our stay. In such a nice area with such great hosts, we hope to make a return trip sometime in the future. Thank you, Rachel and Corey."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Urbach house is neat, comfortable and attractive -- but also livable. We had children 9 through 14 who loved being outdoors, playing in the game room or watching television. They could be themselves in a space that felt welcoming as well as stylish with antique, historical photos and items, like vintage cameras, that went perfectly with the historical nature of the house itself. We walked a couple of blocks to the St. Patrick's Day parade, to the river, a neighborhood park and to the historic downtown. A nice central location."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,We thoroughly enjoyed this quaint house! The outside surroundings off the back patio were so peaceful! The game room was an extra special treat and really helped keep the kids occupied. They had games for all ages. The grandparents (80’s kids) especially enjoyed the archade game! All the necessities were there in the kitchen to be able to cook while there. My daughters and I were able to have quality time cooking together. Just can’t say enough about how much we enjoyed our trip. We will definitely be back!
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Great host!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect house and stay for our first time trip to the Natchitoches Christmas Festival. We were able to walk there with ease, as it was only about 10 mins. The house is located on a nice quiet street with friendly neighbors. We felt right at home. There was plenty of room for our group of 6! We renamed the house “The Gingerbread House”, because that is what it looked like at night all lite up with Christmas lights. So cute! The Christmas decor inside was simple with the most perfect touches of crawfish ribbon on the garland above the fireplace and on the Christmas tree. We highly recommend this precious home and will definitely be returning!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,The Urbach house was absolutely lovely. We loved the details in each room and all of the decorations. My nephew had a blast with the game room. We all loved the hot cocoa bar. The creek right out side the patio was beautiful. Andy was very helpful with suggestions for restaurants and places to watch the fireworks. We are looking forward to planning our trip back next year! Highly recommend this house for anyone staying in Nachitoches.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay this weekend! We loved the decor and all the little touches that made us feel right at home!! Would definitely recommend and hope to stay again next year!!

2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice accommodation. Original and in painstaking nature allows you to appreciate the surrounding nature. The housing is clean.

2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The property has a modernized interior and a rustic Lake-house exterior. You can sit out on the deck toward the river and have total privacy. Very scenic also! There are no significant negatives regarding the property.
My wife and I stay at numerous properties every year. This was the first property we have stayed at where the host did not communicate at all after we sent her our checkout email. To our knowledge we did things as necessary for checkout."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Bird's Nest was wonderful! My husband and I didn't want to leave (but we missed our 4-legged child). The lake house is directly on the Cane River and is so peaceful. The inside is nicely decorated which makes you feel right at home. We never got to fish, but poles were available if we'd had the time. We plan on going back to the 100th anniversary of the Christmas Festival and The Bird's Nest will definitely be the first place we look to stay!"

She had snacks and coffee ready for us. What a great time we had! She made sure there was a dvd copy of “steel magnolias” because she knew we would be taking the aforementioned tour. We stayed the same weekend as the meat pie festival- yum! Sleeping was great. I took the loft. Cousin got the bed and mom got the fold out couch. Plenty of room for us all. We enjoyed doing crafts at the dining table, seeing the alligator in the evenings and watching one of her dvds at night. Come, stay and relax!"

2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time fishing, it was peaceful. The inside of the Nest was very nice and clean.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Birds Nest was exactly as described. It was very relaxing and close to historic downtown.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A GREAT place to stay, but watch the steps going up stairs to the second floor in the house. I would stay again beautiful place."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"When you come to the Bird’s Nest it’s like everything except you and the river disappear - it’s so calm and intimate and magical. We could have spent our whole week out on the porch if it had just been a bit warmer!
That being said, Natchitoches was so much fun. They were having “Blooming on the Bricks”, with concerts in the park and folks everywhere. Of course we had to watch Steel Magnolias and then take the map Jennifer left in her book of things to do, and drive around town and match all the places up with the movie. Such a fun way to see the community.
Then it was back to the Nest to watch the turtles, birds and sculling teams. And if you’ve never been “on the water” during a thunderstorm- Wow!
Yes, we’d go back in a heartbeat!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really cant say enough about this place. It is literally right on the Cane River in a very quiet neighborhood, but still 10 mins or so from the downtown area and anything else you could want. The house itself was very well kept and spacious for our group of 3. We spent a lot of time sightseeing and doing other activities, but we found ourselves sitting by the water each afternoon with a fishing pole in one hand and a beer in the other. Perfect weekend getaway. Thanks Jennifer!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We are local to Louisiana & only about an hour away from Natchitoches. We wanted to go on a quick getaway for a belated anniversary trip & this place was perfect. The cabin felt cozy and secluded. We enjoyed our time spent relaxing in the cabin and on the balcony/dock areas. Didn’t catch any fish due to the small gator hanging around but it was a a fun experience nonetheless. Saw lots of birds, including a pair of wood ducks and a kingfisher. Only about a mile from the historic district too. Will definitely come back in the future!"

We hope to be able to return soon.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,What a delightful place! We will be back.
2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Stayed here for our anniversary. It was quiet and close to everything which was nice. Loved being right on the river. My one comment would be the living room furniture was dated and needed updating. Upstairs bedroom was warm so the ceiling fans were a lifesaver. Otherwise this was a nice place for a getaway.

We hope to return soon!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect location for us. It was minutes from town and it was peaceful with the water movement below and relaxing when we were there. It was only two of us staying but this space could easily accommodate five. We chose to eat all of our meals out in town, but if we wanted to, we could have cooked in the cabin. The kitchen was a nice size."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jennifer's place is awesome. It was clean and comfy and not far from everything but still quiet enough to feel like it. We spent the majority of our time on the porch. It was so peaceful. We can't wait to get back again.

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Bird's Nest on the Cane! As others have mentioned, we were very surprised at how quiet and peaceful it is given its location - just a mile or so from a main highway through Natchitoches. The lake house was clean, stocked with plenty of kitchen necessities, plentiful linens and an amazingly comfortable bed. But our favorite part of the stay was the time we spent fishing and sitting on the deck and pier.
Jennifer was quick to respond with any questions we had. Overall, we highly recommend the Bird's Nest! We will definitely be back."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Bird's Nest. The place was extremely clean and had everything we needed for our stay.

Thank you Jennifer! We hope to return."

2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely place! It's a wonderful spot to relax, watch the water of the river, listen to birds, or just sit on the deck. It's in a neighborhood but you wouldn't know that, it's very private and peaceful. A great stop!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to have a nice relaxing trip. There is an outside porch that looks over the water. It’s nice to just sit and watch as boats go by and little ducks would play in the water. Not far from the boardwalk which was real nice. The place itself is really nice, living room is cozy, the bedroom is beautiful. The whole place just gives good vibes. Would definitely recommend"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The “Bird’s Nest” Cabin was all that was advertised And more ! Nice quiet location on the river, morning and evening views were absolutely stunning. Cabin was so comfortable and accommodating. Not too far from downtown, plenty to see and do. We will definitely be back !"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The perfect place to relax and recharge. Quiet and comfortable but close to all the great offerings of Natchitoches. And the host is such a pleasure to work with. Hope to visit again in the summer to really enjoy the deck.

2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very relaxing and quiet. If traveling with small children be aware there are multiple sets of steps to maneuver.
2021-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The views are wonderful, location is convenient. The star is the porch! Sitting there was so peaceful. Living and kitchen were comfortable. Sofa bed and air mattress were available but not a sleeping solution for 2 additional adults. I would not recommend for more than 2 adults. The shower is pretty awkward if you're tall. Host had snacks and an assortment of coffee there when we arrived and also a list of local restaurants which was helpful. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would stay again if it's just the 2 of us."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The description is extremely accurate. This spot is very cozy, comfortable, and rejuvenating. The space is well laid out, and the wrap around deck is a treasure. I hope to stay here again, and I'm sad that I'm not still there! The rocking chairs are also very unique and comfortable!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a wonderful relaxing place to stay. It is very comfortable and the sight of the river in the morning fog huddled on the rocker with a cup of coffee shouldn't be missed. I highly recommend this place. We'll be back first chance we get!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just a heads up, there isn't a private boat launch. So if you bring your boat, you can launch at Williamson Boat Landing, its only a 10 minute ride. And we caught catfish right off the deck."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking for a very affordable, cute, cozy, private place to stay, with an awesome sunset view, then this is it. Set back on the river, we had a beautiful view every day but sunsets were awesome. The place is very clean and inviting. Bed was comfy which is a plus in my book. Perfect also for a couple with an older child as they had a little book bed also. 5-10 minutes from downtown bars, restaurants, shopping and tours. Also a dock there if you have a boat. Our host was very responsive and helpful. I would definitely stay here again and recommend to our friends and family."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer had a beautiful spot on the river, very clean. She was very good with communicating with us. The shower was very spacious and clean. We enjoyed the deck."

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is great. Very nice, clean, and relaxing. Loved the dock area for fishing and for wildlife watching. Close to town, but feels like you are far away from from all the hustle and bustle. Hosts are great and will help you anything you might need. Great little get away. We plan on returning in the future for sure."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place! The Nest was a super cozy place to rest in Natchitoches, and it sits right on the Cane River in a nice neighborhood. It was convenient to the Front Street and downtown area. The lake was beautiful, and we enjoyed watching the wildlife."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A very peaceful place - my whole group loved it. I certainly will consider returning.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful cottage directly on the Cane River. Perfect for a weekend getaway. We will be staying again!!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was so quiet and relaxing sitting on the dock watching and feeding the fish and the turtles. If I go to Natchitoches again I will def be seeing if it is still available.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jennifer is awesome to work with... so very helpful and easy tonwork with
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The town was so clean and the people was so friendly! Meat pies at Mayeaux’s, was my favorite, but they were all great, then when we was done , we had a beautiful relaxing place to go and do nothing but chill! Jennifer is a super host and we will be back!"

It was clean, comfy, stocked & the perfect getaway spot!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was an amazing stay ! We loved how clean and relaxing the cabin was !
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The location and setting was perfect! We loved everything about our stay. We even got to see a curious alligator swim up while my husband fished off the top deck.
2021-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,So peaceful! Need a quiet get away this is it!!!! Jennifer was available at all times and did such a great job at helping us.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay...convenient, very nice cottage, quiet, simply peaceful! I will return. Just know that beds are upstairs...a tad hard for anyone who has difficulty climbing stairs. Otherwise, you won’t find a better spot!!!
Check in and communication were great."

Sitting on the deck in the evenings watching the boats go by was our favorite! It is an amazing home in a beautiful town, we will definitely be going back!!!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Bird’s Nest on the Cane River is such a gem!
We came to Natchitoches as part of our family road trip to Disney World. What we didn’t know was that we were continuing the Magic by coming to stay at this charming river side abode.
The Nest is cozy and has everything you need to unwind. Jennifer was such a darling host and communicated the day we came into town and made sure everything was ready for us.
There were snacks and breakfast items in the kitchen, a variety of DVDs including Steel Magnolias, the main reason we chose to stay in Natchitoches. The Nest is just a five minute drive from the heart of downtown historic Natchitoches and noteworthy places Steel Magnolias was filmed.
We would love to explore more and hope the Bird’s Nest at the Cane River is available again when we come back!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very peaceful!
Great location!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,I loved everything about it and the bed was so comfortable. The wrap around deck overlooking the water was so relaxing. I would recommend this location to others looking for a get away. The town is beautiful and such a great retreat for some relaxation.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We both throughly enjoyed our stay along the Cane River. One of the days it rained while we were there, and we still sat outside on the deck and ate dinner. There’s plenty of room, and the beds were comfortable. There’s a lot to do in the area, and they have good restaurants too. If you ever get the opportunity to stay here I know that you would enjoy it as much as we both have."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The birds nest on the Cane was the best stay. The neighborhood is gorgeous, along with the views."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Bird’s Nest is a wonderful and relaxing place that exceeded our expectations. The scenery was great, the atmosphere was quiet, and the house was relaxing. It was the perfect retreat to recharge from our busy schedules. We will definitely be back"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jennifer's place was perfect! It's located in a safe neighborhood, and is secluded away from the road which is so nice! The bed and pillows are soooo comfy. The porch was perfect to sit and watch the sunrise. Kitchen had everything we needed. Plenty of coffee and sugar! Natchitoches is a sweet small town. We loved exploring and walking around. Walmart and other grocery stores are conveniently right around the corner. I've stayed in my fair share of Airbnb's and this was definitely my favorite!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location! We had a blast. It was a wonderful three days. The accommodations were comfortable and relaxing. Just what we were looking for. Thanks for sharing your place with us.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place to get away. It’s a perfect size inside and out. It was everything we had hoped for and more. We can’t wait to come back.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,What an amazing stay. Checking in was seamless and the communication from the host was spot on. We could not have asked for a better stay.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very relaxing, close to everything. The home is clean and well kept. I will come back here and recommend it for anyone."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jennifer was a wonderful hostess! The property is so quiet and peaceful while still being an easy ride from Front Street. Everything was extremely clean and lovely!
2021-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very adorable “Birds Nest” on the Cane River! We enjoyed the covered porch & watching the birds & fishermen! It’s close to Historic District in Natchitoches, a few miles away. The home was clean & very comfortable! We would stay here again if we come back this way!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer's home is clean, quiet, beautiful and in a perfect location. We also loved using the paddle boat on the river. My husband and I travel a lot : this was probably our favorite Airbnb ever. Jennifer is very kind and responsive. Thank you for a great weekend!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect spot for a restful stay. Felt like home. Very comfortable furniture and bed. Roomy. Plenty of coffee! Fantastic porch. Very private. Snacks provided were very appreciated. One of the best Airbnb I’ve stayed in.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for a place to just relax and chill, this place is perfect. My husband enjoyed sitting on the deck and fishing. Although he didn’t catch anything big enough to keep, he thoroughly enjoyed the time fishing. There was a paddle boat available for use, but we didn’t try it. I feel this is a great place for adults who just need to unwind. I wouldn’t take my grandkids here unless they love to fish. I don’t feel there’s enough outdoor space for kids to run and play. You’ll find everything you need is stocked and ready for use. Everything is super clean and in great shape. There’s movies and books available. This really is a perfect getaway. Beautiful inside and a great location right on the water"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super awesome place with the best of everything!! We LOVED it!!!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is worth a trip back to Natchitoches! The views are stunning off the deck, coffee with white egrets, and the sunrise reflects off the lake and dances on the walls. This retreat is private, felt secluded, with comfortable beds, very clean house and the linens smelled great."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Enjoyable stay! Kids especially enjoyed the paddle boat!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Birds Nest was a wonderful place to stay. It was so relaxing and comfortable. The bed was comfortable and it had all the amenities you need. It was in a great location right on the Cane River where we enjoyed watching the boats, fish, turtles and beautiful sunset from the deck. Jennifer was a great host and responded quickly to any questions and concerns. She was kind enough to bring the Steel Magnolias DVD for us to watch since this is where it was filmed and based on this town. We will definitely stay here again during the Holiday Lights."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a great place to stay! My husband and I wanted to get away for the weekend for our anniversary and we really enjoyed our time here. Couldn’t have ask for a better place! The host was very nice and gave us great recommendations for food and for places to go visit.
We will definitely be coming back in the future."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Jennifer was an excellent host. The place had all the things we needed just as mentioned in the listing. Many other places just have a coffee maker but Jennifer provided some coffee supplies as well. Small things that make a huge difference. We went close to the full moon so we were treated to some spectacular sights over the lake. Everything at the place worked just as we needed.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The measure of a great host is what they do when things don't go right, and Jen is a GREAT host. The Bird's Nest is a serene, lovely place that is well worth the price. This was the mental health retreat I needed. If I ever find myself in the area again, I will definitely stay here!"
2021-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great place to relax!!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little house. In town, but the feeling of being away from everything."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great find! Jennifer was very accommodating when our original weekend date was compromised due to a winter storm. My wife and I loved fishing off the dock and relaxing on the porch. We will definitely be back!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a treasure! The location was amazing. Cabin on the river with beautiful views. We felt like we had escaped society except we were close to everything. Jennifer has a notebook with any information you could possibly need regarding where to eat, things to do, etc. We played the local golf course one day and enjoyed that. However, it is a perfect place to sit and do nothing but relax and breathe. Bird watching was super fun. This is truly a beautiful space. Recommend for a couple. The bed was super comfy. The shower was hot with plenty of water pressure. Fully equipped kitchen if you want to prepare your own meals. Jennifer even left snack foods for us. There are stairs to be navigated to get into the cabin and to go to upstairs bedroom. Not a problem for us but could be for some people. Handy extra bathroom downstairs. We highly recommend this place and will definitely stay here again. Maybe make it a destination instead of a 2 day stop over."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved it.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a fantastic place to stay. Off the main thoroughfares but not far from the main historic section. So quiet! We were well pleased with our stay and would think of returning.
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a perfect weekend getaway ! Everything was absolutely perfect .. the Nest .. the location and the hospitality! We will be returning if you will have us !
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are fortunate enough to rent this lovely gem you will not be disappointed. My wife and I wanted a getaway from our self quarantine at home to celebrate my birthday. The Bird’s Nest on the Cane River was the perfect place for us. The hosts gave us complete solitude and yet the with Cane River we felt a natural companion who shared with us the beauty of nature with ducklings feeding, egrets hunting, turtles floating and a painter’s backdrop of sunset and sunrise. It also gave us a wonderful home-base to explore the area. From visiting the historical district in Natchitoches, walking on the Cane River National Heritage Trail, and driving to learning about Creole life at the Cane River Creole National Historical Park. If you like hiking and nature (like We do) there was hiking in the amazing Kisatchie National Forest. So this place is one that will make you happy you decided to rent."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was AMAZING! It was in a great location! The home was nice and clean, Jennifer had everything in place for us, even down to the best eateries/venues! The area is rich in culture, nice people and the town is beautiful in itself. I strongly recommend! The best few days Ever!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The nest was absolutely amazing! We had the most relaxing and fun moms getaway weekend and we can’t wait to come back! We plan to make this our annual spot! It was so quiet and peaceful and in a great location! Thank you to Jennifer for all of the suggestions and tips!
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is perfect for a small get-away. The upstairs is like a master suite with a large bed, twin bed, and full bath with plenty of storage space. We even had a spot to have our 1 year old sleep by us in a pack n play. The peddle boat was a hit and the wrap around balcony and rocking chairs made for some great R&R. Walmart is right around the corner and downtown shops are a 5 minute drive. We will be back soon!"

2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a one of a kind place we stumbled upon! Beautiful, cozy place. Very serene and relaxing. Everything you need, very accommodating. Cannot get better then walking onto the front porch and fishing from the deck. We hope to make this a regular, family spot. Also, what a great little town to visit during the holidays. Cannot wait to experience it during the summer."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great getaway place right on the river. Close to the downtown area. Jennifer was easily accessible and super helpful. She was prompt in answering all of my questions and recommend some great local places to check out. We definitely want to come back.

2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a unique house! We really enjoyed the sunsets on the deck. My daughter (12) loved her bed at the top of the stairs. Everything was very clean and nice. We also appreciated having a kitchen and dining table. The little Christmas tree the hosts put up was a fun surprise for us all. Thank you!

2020-11-01,3,Stayed about a week,"Very pretty cabin on the lake! Nicely decorated and stocked with more than you could ever ask for from any Airbnb. Jennifer was always available. A very nice host. The cabin is situated off the road behind other houses. So, it’s not quite or private. A big RV was parked right outside of our cabin and someone was working on it every evening. But, overall we had a very nice stay."

2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed at Jennifer’s place 2 years ago and we enjoyed it so much we came back. The place is spotless and very cute. We enjoyed relaxing on the porch and overlooking the beautiful view. We were able to dock our boat right there. If you want quiet and peace this is the place. The town is beautiful and front Street is a few miles away. Jennifer had snacks for us and all the extras if you are prepared to eat in.
We have visited many Airbnb’s and by far, this is our favorite. I can’t wait until we visit again!"

2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We never left the rental during our entire 3 day stay. It was so beautiful and relaxing. Exactly what we needed to get away and recharge from very busy work schedules. I never wanted to leave and cannot wait to go back. The host/owner were so accommodating and helpful and made our visit feel like we were at home with friends.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful and unique experience! If you are looking to relax in a private cabin perched above water, come to Jennifer's place!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin is quaint and private. Loved the views of the Cane River the cabin and porch provided. The location is close to town and every point of interest is within 5-10 minutes away. Hated to leave and hope to return again one day. Highly recommend Bird’s Nest on the Cane and superhost Jennifer for those looking for a weekend getaway!
