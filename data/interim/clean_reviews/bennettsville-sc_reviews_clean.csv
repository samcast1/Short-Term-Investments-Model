2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was such a unique experience! You are literally in a carriage house with horse stables across from the living area. So fun! The property is beautiful and loved seeing our dogs runs and sniff everything! Definitely would recommend!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We've stayed in other AirB&Bs because our children are dogs...really...and motels don't welcome folks with four dogs. That being said, we were surprised and please that our kids had a lot of space, fenced in space, to exp!ore ( my guess maybe 2 acres). Provided for us was some beer, wine, and snack treats. For the morning was coffee to brew, English muffins, bagels, jelly, and cream cheese. There were juice drinks and some small cheese thingie and crackers to have with the wine. Okay, let me tell you about the bed...well, the mattress. I sleep and have lower back pain. When I get up it's there, but after a bit it disappears. As soon as I laid down I noticed a difference...no aches or pain. When I got up...nothing. So, a surprise benefit. So, for me and my wife, as well as Sigmund, Oliver, Cowboy Bob, and Milo Muffin...we rate is stay a 5 star."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved the carriage house! Extremely peaceful, quiet and serene. Superb getaway from the city. Melissa is an excellent host; responsive and personable. Would definitely stay with her again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very relaxing and quiet. A very Unique place to stay.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay, was a good way to break up a long drive. Perfect for dogs!!"
2024-05-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Melissa was very friendly and helpful. The place was perfect for our dog who loved it as she had a huge fenced property to explore and run in and access to the barn so she could come and go, unless closed into one of the rooms. This would be a great place for people with horses, too, as the horses would be in the same barn you are in, their large stalls right across the center aisle from your rooms (Melissa has no horses, so there were none there when we stayed). The layout was interesting as the three rooms (bedroom, bath and kitchen) looked to have once been stalls that were converted. They each had a separate door that opened onto the barns center aisle that you used to get from one to the other. The views were nice and the porch would have been nice to sit on, but the weather was drizzly and all the porch furniture was wet. The bathroom was serviceable, but rustic. Full sized fridge, toaster oven and microwave for the kitchen. Overall, the place had the feel of a nice summer camp!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great thank you
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was my third stay at Melissa‚Äôs and we enjoy it every time. She goes above and beyond for her guests and we love the uniqueness of the place. My dogs loved the space to run and enjoyed the extras, like toys, that she puts out for them. We will be back when we‚Äôre in the area again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful and charming carriage house on a beautiful property- can‚Äôt wait to visit again for a longer stay!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A Dog Lover's Paradise at Burch's Carriage House üêæ
‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
Our stay at Burch's Carriage House with Melissa in Society Hill, SC, was nothing short of magical. Traveling with dogs üêï‚Äçü¶∫ü¶Æcan be a challenge, but Melissa made it effortless.
THREE acres, provided our dogs a secure and fenced area to roam & explore to their hearts' content. Melissa's love for dogs was evident in every detail, from the welcoming atmosphere to her own sweet pups greeting us through the fence. üêï üê© üêæ
The deck was a highlight, offering a touch of civilized luxury as we grilled & dined al fresco. But it was the Breezeway that stole our hearts, providing a cool retreat for both humans & canines alike. üçîüê∂ üêæ
The cleanliness of the entire property, including the manicured three acres, was impressive. Even our dog with an old paw injury could run & play comfortably.
While there may be more to explore in the area, we were perfectly content to bask in the tranquility of Burch's Carriage House. üíïü¶¥üêæ"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If you want to get away from Society, come to Society Hill and stay at this peaceful unique place, bring your pups and they can run on a 3 acre fenced in yard which was amazing. I will definitely be a repeat visitor."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you are looking for a place for 2 people with pets and a desire for the unusual, and also enjoy pristine cleanliness, a comfortable bed, fresh air, and thoughtful amenities, this is the place for you! All the better if one of your animals is a horse, because 10 feet from your bedroom door is a roomy and immaculate stall( actually two.)
You can watch the sun set from your deck - or enjoy coffee in the am there! Melissa is a very responsive hostess and is willing to do anything to make your stay memorable! Don‚Äôt think twice-rent this adorable place-you will not be disappointed!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Happy repeat customer. Have been coming here for many years. Ideal place for me and my dogs to escape the cold New England winters.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great time, melissa was very helpful and kind and made the stay very nice."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved the location and so did my fur baby!!!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We travel with our 2 labs and this is the perfect place to stay. Not only does it have a small fenced in area but also a much larger one where our dogs can roam free. It is always quiet and peaceful there. Melissa always makes sure you know how to get in and where everything is. She is also always available if you need anything. Accommodations are great. It is always clean and in perfect condition. This was our second stay and next time we are in that area, we will be sure to stay there again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The place was as pictured. The best feature was the space for my dog to play! Melissa provided welcome treats and many thoughtful features.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I was in town by myself with my dog and this place was perfect. Exactly what I needed for a weekend visit. Not much around in terms of restaurants etc. but I went to the IGA in Cheraw and had everything I needed.
I‚Äôll definetly be back."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My daughter is in an annual horse show about 30 minutes from Melissa's adorbable place. We needed to bring our dogs with us this time. We just loved it there and were able to get out of our car after a long drive and let the dogs run. The carriage house itself is so well done and comfortable. The dogs had safe ways in and out which took the stress out of them getting away. Unfortunately, it was cold and rainy but we felt warm and comfortable inside. There were even treats for my daughter and a glass of wine for the mom! Thank you for being so accomodating Melissa!"
2024-01-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Quiet and private. Huge area for dogs to run and play.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Had another great stay here on my way from Florida to Maryland. My dog loved running around the huge fenced yard. It was a great reprieve from I-95 and long driving days.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Was driving through and needed a place to stay with my dog, and Melissa‚Äôs was perfect! I loved that I could let my dog run around in the fenced-in area, and the accommodations themselves were cozy and unique."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The carriage house was exactly what we were looking for. Quiet, private, simple, comfortable and extremely dog friendly. Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better place to stay while we were down for the holidays. Our puppies loved the field and I loved how secure I felt with them running freely. The property is well fenced in so I was more at ease letting them explore. We‚Äôll definitely stay here again next time we‚Äôre in SC!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We love unique and we love dog friendly, and this place is both! Host also called a local restaurant that her friend owns to let them know it was our wedding weekend! Super friendly and helpful, great experience!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place and perfect for me as I was running retriever (dog) trial at H Cooper Blavk about 15 mins away. Wonderful host‚Ä¶.!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was just what I was looking for as a place to rest for me and my dogs. The whole area was fenced in and they loved being able to explore and smell everything, while also being safe. The barn house was so clean and a beautiful and unique experience. Melissa was easy to reach and helpful with any questions. Thanks so much for everything Melissa! Ziggy, Titus and I hope to be back sometime!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My mother used to say to us. ""Close the door! Do you think you live in a barn?""
Well, I could have said yes this past weekend. What an eclectic place but perfect for our needs with our dogs.
It was quite cold at night but the heaters worked well and kept us comfortable. Speaking of comfortable, the beds were great.
We loved the deck off the bedroom where we could sit out and watch the dogs enjoy the yard.
We look forward to coming back."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"It was a great place to stay, very close to our dog competition, and nice place to come back to after a cold rainy day‚Ä¶fenced in yard was perfect for the dogs"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I don't think the airbnb listing does this place justice. If you have a dog 100% go here. Traveling with a pet can be difficult, especially a bigger dog that needs exercise. Melissa was so thoughtful in preparing this airbnb to think of anything we might need. Dog toys, dog treats, even dog shampoo! But the biggest thing was that the entire area was fenced in, so my dog could run anywhere and I could relax without worrying. She also had snacks and even some wine and beer which was really helpful as after the drive we wanted to stay in for dinner and had snacks for dinner. She has an apple TV in the room, a space heater for when it got cold, even a heater in the bathroom. I hope we get the chance to return!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed here as a respite from the road traveling from FL to NJ with our dog. She was very happy to be able to roam freely and explore the grounds. The snacks, breakfast items and drinks were enjoyable and thoughtful. All of our needs were met and exceeded. Beds were comfy. Plenty of towels in the bathroom. We felt welcome, safe and relaxed.
Will stay here on the way back to FL."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay again and Champ (our dog) loved it as well. See y‚Äôall soon. Thanks
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very quiet and beautiful property. Melissa was a great host. I called her personally due to traffic delays, and she was more than happy to talk and work with me for check in.I will definitely stay agin should I get the chance!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is my favorite Air BNB. I love the barn (I grew up in horse barns so it feels like home). Mellissa always provides thoughtful extras like snacks and toiletries. She is a wonderful host.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Melissa was wonderful and just a true joy. Our dogs LOVED the property and the location is perfect off I-95. And TRUST Melissa when she gives you a restaurant recommendation-phenomenal meal and full bellies were achieved.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Best place to stay if you are traveling with dogs. Our dogs look forward to getting out of the car after a long day and running around the massive fenced yard! It is the best!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was my second short stay at Melissa's place, and I highly recommend this beautiful getaway!! I'm looking forward to our stay in the fall."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Melissa is a fantastic host, can‚Äôt say enough about the property, absolutely gorgeous, we will be back!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved this place. Great value, all though nothing was walkable it was very close to a ton of stuff to do and restaurants."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Another great stay! Such a peaceful setting and Melissa is always friendly and responsive. Look forward to staying again soon.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It's absolutely stunning!! 10/5 star. super accommodating and way nicer in person. I would highly recommend it if you're looking for a unique getaway. So peaceful and beautiful! I will definitely be back for an extended period of time.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Melissa is such a great host and the property was so charming! We felt right at home. It‚Äôs quiet and peaceful üòä
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect place to stay the night w/pets while driving the 95 from FL to VA!
We have two energetic corgis and loved having a large space where they could run free without worrying about them getting hit by a car. Once we closed the gate, we were in a completely fenced in area and didn‚Äôt have to worry about keeping them leashed.
There was also a smaller pen that they could run around in when we wanted to keep them contained.
The beds were comfy and everything was clean. Melissa was also easy to reach for assistance.
If you‚Äôre someone who needs the room to be super cool at night, I wouldn‚Äôt stay here during the summer, but otherwise‚Äîwe can‚Äôt recommend this place enough and look forward to staying here again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent place. Melissa was very hospitable and accommodating.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Best place for us and our furry baby. We felt right at home and look forward to another visit in the future.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful stay at Melissa‚Äôs carriage house. We came through from CT with 3 horses, our dog and our cat on our way to FL. Melissa was so accommodating from booking to check in and through our stay. We, including the animals, had a very restful night. We will definitely stay at the carriage house again on our way through."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Melissa was an amazing host and very good with communication. I think out of all the Airbnbs I have stayed this was the best. I would be happy to stay again. I highly recommend a stay here!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place along our route. Wish we could have stayed longer. Our dogs especially loved the huge fenced in yard to run while we unpacked the car.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great spot... peaceful, private, and comfortable. Melissa is awesome!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay at the carriage house, the space is truly unique, and it was more than perfect for our two dogs. Not only is there a spacious fenced in space right off the deck but Melissa let us know the whole several acre lot was available and fenced in as well. Melissa as a host was very responsive and accommodating, as well as the space being stocked with goodies and all the essentials you may need. We were in town visiting family and were more than pleased with this relaxing space for us and our animals to come back to. We would happily return anytime we visit in the future, and only wished we had more time to spend there!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a great place so peaceful and beautiful surroundings, Melissa is a great host nothing like a beer in a frosted mug after 10 hours on the road.
We will definitely be back!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fantastic service, peaceful surroundings, and our dog‚Äôs new favorite place to be!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Such a fun Airbnb. The grounds were immaculate and the setting was very peaceful. Only the sounds of the birds. Tons of fenced in space for our dog to run around. Lots of special touches including snacks and drinks. Super comfortable beds. We hope to return in September.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,I enjoyed eating my dinner on the deck looking at the peaceful countryside. My dog enjoyed the fully fenced yard with lots of space to explore.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Could not have asked for a more peaceful place for my family to relax and for my child and dogs to safely run around. Perfect road trip stop for us but I would also gladly come back and spend a long weekend here. It‚Äôs a private and gorgeous property, Melissa was so kind and helpful. Would definitely recommend!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If you have animals, and you are traveling anywhere close to this place, you have seriously got to stay at least one night!
Its by far the most ANIMAL FRIENDLY place we have ever stayed. There are different size pens for your animals to run free. Not only that, this place is soo tranquil, you can definitely find a piece of mind here. We will definitely be returning."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful property, stayed overnight on my way north from Florida. Was farther from 95 than I expected, but that is my mistake, not that of the owner. My dog was able to run free after a long drive. Thank you for a nice stay!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"It‚Äôs a beautiful place in a lovely historic town. Peaceful, quiet with so much safe dog room to roam. The carriage house is beautifully equipped and very comfortable! One side is stable for horses, scrupulously clean. The twin beds are in a cozy room with a comfy reading chair, books and tv. The roomy bathroom has a huge shower with great water pressure! The kitchen has everything you need to cook. Super nice touch: a variety of breakfast treats and accompaniments make breakfast quick and easy! They had my husband at frozen frosted beer mugs! After a long day driving, to sit on the beautiful deck, watch the sun go down and quaff a super cold beer was so welcome! To repeat that in the morning with a hot mug of coffee while listening to the dawn chorus was bliss! We‚Äôd love to stay here again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was wonderful. Melissa had charcoal for us to use on a grill and we cooked steaks outside, then ate on the deck as we watched the sun go down. She communicated constantly via text to check on us and give us instructions. My son and I go to an annual event in the area and I hope this place is available next year."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"this is my most favorite Air bnb. Melissais a wonderful hostess, everything you need she provides I look forward to my twice a year stay at this wonderful place. very high recommended!!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,Happy repeat customer
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Unique pet-friendly location with a wonderful host ! So appreciated all the details and comforts -from a fridge filled with goodies and wine & cheese, to a lending library. We had a wonderful sleep on very comfy beds and even our cat felt right at home . I‚Äôm a history buff and our host Melissa was a font of utterly fascinating local history ! Would definitely stay again."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Lovely and peaceful overnight stay. Just what the dogs and I needed in the middle of an 18 hour car ride. Super-secure fenced-in area allowed me to relax while the pups sniffed around. Host Melissa is very kind and thoughtful.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved both Melissa and her property. She is a local historian and can provide historical details of the town including both revolutionary and civil war details. The town of society Hill, while small, has a lot of historically significance buildings. It is very interesting. Melissa did a great job of directing us to surrounding towns for restaurants, activities, etc. we loved the property and so did our dogs. We would love to go back."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had such a lovely stay, thanks to Melissa. Anything you could need, she had stocked. It‚Äôs such a neat place, and she‚Äôs thought of everything to make it warm and comfortable. The dogs loved running and exploring. The deck looks so nice for warm weather. Very comfortable, private and cozy! Thank you, Melissa!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great experience. Just what we were looking for. Host was pleasant and willing to accommodate needs.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved the historic area and the seclusion of the accommodations. Our very active Golden/Irish Setter loved the ability to run free and chase her ball. We stayed during a very cold snap but stayed cozy warm in the bedroom. Melissa was so kind to tell us some of the history of the area which was of interest to us. We loved staying in a place so steeped in history.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Well let me start with , dogs love the place !! Melissa was very helpful and even give me recommendations about places to go. Place looks great feels like home and pepper and Twix love the place . I wish I could stay longer but I will definitely give 5 stars. Beverages and snacks are good especially when you time is very limited to go buy something, sitting patio is also great even a place to make fire . I would definitely come back . Thanks Melissa ."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It is a great place to stay. Perfect for our needs with a great fenced in yard for our dog. Lots of room around the area and there was a lot of great touches from decorations to snacks and deonks left. We will be staying there again.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was great, we don‚Äôt travel much with our dogs so we were anxious about what to expect. The large property entirely fenced in was great. We didn‚Äôt do much more than sleep and get back on the road so just having a spot for our dogs to safely stretch their legs and explore was very worth it!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Though a very short stay, the Carriage House was everything we expect it to be and more! Lovely and peaceful surroundings. We had a restful respite from our long drive, and our dogs loved the space. They were able to run free and chase squirrels. Melissa is a great hostess, extremely responsive, helpful and flexible. The place itself is full of character, with nice touches, clean and we felt right at home. Definitely will be back, and maybe next time spend more time there, to enjoy the peace and quiet."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We were blessed to be able to stay here during Christmas 2022. What a beautiful piece of property. We were in town to drop off our dog (Barley) to her trainer (Lake Effect Gun Dogs). This location is perfect for those sending any time at H Cooper Black. This place had everything that we needed to stay a full week. If we are back in the area for any reason, Melissa's place would be my first choice. I do believe that our three dogs loved this place as much as we did."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I love this place. And now I‚Äôm spoiled because Melissa provides so many extras that other places don‚Äôt. Coffee, snacks, thoughtful extras to make your stay cozy."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second trip staying with Melissa. We love her space, she‚Äôs very responsive and helpful. It‚Äôs the perfect place if you‚Äôre traveling with your furry companion. I cannot recommend her place enough."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I always look forward to my stay at Melissa's while I'm in south Carolina. it's peaceful, and I love the space for my dogs. Melissa is a wonderful host. I will always stay here when I visit south Carolina, thank you for such a wonderful place to stay"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,peaceful and dog friendly- nice to be well off of rte 15
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Always a pleasure to stay here.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Well, this just might be my favorite Airbnb ever! It is definitely not fancy or glamorous but just exactly what I needed after being in the car with my dogs for eight hours! I was traveling alone and needed a place to stay that was halfway between northern Virginia and central Florida where I could rest, relax, feel safe, and keep my canine companions entertained and busy, and this little gem checked off all the boxes. As soon as we drove through the double gate, and opened the car doors, we (the dogs and me) were in fenced-in, beautifully manicured, straight out of cozy country living heaven! Everything was beautiful, loved, and so obviously cared for! It seemed as though every time I turned around there was a special touch or sweet surprise that was exactly what I needed at that very moment. I‚Äôm hungry, and there was a basket of snacks! Oh, I meant to grab a Diet Coke, and there was a stash of drinks in the fridge. Water for the dogs? A huge bowl and attached hose were right there! I need to answer emails, and voila I found myself sitting on the deck enjoying pure zen and comfort while my dogs were eagerly exploring acres of fenced in farm land! I need more light, turn and there was a light switch! Check in and out were seamless and I‚Äôm still wondering how in the world a barn could be so clean and comfy! I imagined what fun it would be to live there, but honestly there is absolutely NOTHING around which was just what I was looking for but probably not what everyone else might want in an overnight. But if you want a place to re-charge in the middle of a 95 road trip and find yourself in South Carolina, you should check this place out! I will definitely be staying again in this little slice of heaven. My dogs wouldn‚Äôt have if any other way!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Not sure who enjoyed the stay more, our dog or us; our dog loved running in the field, we enjoyed the peace and quiet. Thanks,"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a great place to stay, especially if you have pets. My two dogs had the best time roaming the property. Melissa provides toys, treats, towels, blankets, and water dishes for the dogs. For humans, there is wine, cheese, chocolate, drinks, and items for a continental breakfast. We look forward to staying again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful place to stay. Melissa is great with communication and accompanying any requests. Highly recommend when traveling with pets
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Melissa was an amazing host! Very friendly and we loved the carriage home. My dog also loved it because she had so much room to run! Thank you :)
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The carriage house was a very unique stay with great accommodations for our horses. The house was clean and beautifully decorated. We loved the back deck!!!
Host Melissa was very accommodating and communications with her were top notch! We will be back for sure!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Carriage House is a beautiful, well appointed place to stay. It‚Äôs very comfortable and clean. Melissa, the host, is warm and welcoming, and makes you feel at home. Very highly recommended."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is all about the dogs, and our puppy could run, do zoomies, and play. I never worried for her safety once on this property because of how its setup with secure fencing and plenty of room. Thank you again to Melissa for a wonderful stay. Wish we had the opportunity to stay longer."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a unique stay. You actually sleep in a remodeled horse stall. Being a horse owner I loved this place. So many lovely details. Wine, cheese and breakfast were pluses. Breakfast on the porch was wonderful. Melissa is obviously a master at giving you all the finishing touches. Such a wonderful once in a lifetime experience."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Burch cabin was everything and more. It was very clean, relaxing and peaceful. Melissa was very easy to work with. We will be staying here again.. Thank you!!!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Melissa's Airbnb is a true treat! The property is gorgeous. She provided so many nice details that made our stay great!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I are always on the hunt for a new and unique experience with Airbnb and let me tell you guys‚Ä¶ THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! We loved every single detail and Melissa was so so so lovely to chat to! Bonus points from our pup who absolutely LOVED the huge yard! This was probably the most unique place we‚Äôve ever stayed at and we‚Äôre definitely planning on coming back soon!
Melissa even provided snacks and drinks for her guests which was a nice surprise to come ‚Äúhome‚Äù to!
We‚Äôll be back!‚ù§Ô∏è"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is our second stay at Melissa‚Äôs place, and we love the space she provides for us and our dog to relax on our long road trip."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,My gf and I have been here twice and won‚Äôt be the last! Great escape with Cheraw golf course just north of here! Wish I had horse as they‚Äôd enjoy this place too! Cozy cozy and more cozy
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay was perfect. The place is clean and unique. We love all of the space for our dogs. The host is very responsive and she leaves drinks, snacks and everything needed for our stay. We will be back."
2022-07-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"What a cute place to stay! The host was very kind and left little treats and wine for guests, a sweet touch! my pup LOVED all the room and run and smell. As others described, it is pretty rustic and literally in stables so be prepared for that kind of experience."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean, great communication and beautiful property. I have already booked again."
2022-07-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Such a beautiful piece of property and so wonderful to have 3 acres fenced for dogs to explore! I've never had an airbnb experience with so many goodies for both human and canine guests. Visitors do be aware that each room is separate and connected by an open, unair-conditioned breezeway with glass sliding doors in this small barn. In fall and spring would be just lovely. In South Carolina's July heat the in-room plugin portable a/c units just couldn't keep up, and it stayed warm most of the night. Hard to sleep. But the beds were comfy and Melissa graciously pushed the beds together for us. Still we would go back, just at a different time of year."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,All I can say is Wow! We stayed here one night traveling from Florida to home. It is exactly as described. Very peaceful. Our pups had a fenced in yard and were thrilled. Picturesque scenery. I didn‚Äôt want to leave. Melissa was a great host. We will be back again for sure.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at Burchs Carriage House was a tranquil experience. The entire property is something worth experiencing. The highlight of my stay was having breakfast (which the host provides) on the patio outlooking the beautiful landscape while listening to the birds chirp.
Melissa was very kind, communicative and extended a warm welcome upon my arrival. I‚Äôd recommend this property to anyone wanting a pleasant experience!
Melissa, thanks again!!
All the best"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The property and setup is amazing if you're traveling with dogs. The entire property is fenced and the dogs have so much room to stretch their legs. This was a perfect overnight stop for us. Also really appreciated the coffee, drinks, and snacks provided."

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My Husband & I really enjoyed the mini-honeymoon we had at the Carriage House.

2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"So perfect for dogs and horses alike...if you‚Äôre like us and put pets first and don‚Äôt mind the layout then this Carriage House is precisely what you‚Äôll need! Melissa was easy to communicate with, fridge had snacks and wine/beer AND breakfast items! Only warning eat before you get to Society Hill because there‚Äôs only a Dollar General nearby so no choices for take out."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,What an awesome place to stay and our dog loved it more than we did. Hope to be back soon. Thanks
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Although it wasn‚Äôt my cup of tea‚Ä¶. It was exactly as advertised. Was very happy with the cleanliness and service.

2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a perfect overnight stay for us on our way from Florida to PA. We didn't have equine companions but our two canine ones were happy as can be. After the long ride in the truck, they welcomed being able to run loose and all the new scents! The property is beautiful, the accommodations very comfortable and the hospitality genuine. If you're traveling in cold weather, remember you may want an extra blanket on your bed at night or for your fur babies. Thank you Melissa for the snacks - perfect after our late night arrival. We will remember Society Hill for future adventures."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and private. Perfect if traveling with animals.

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Melissa was exceptional and so was the carriage house. It was exactly as described and perfect for people who enjoy (or need) to travel with their fur babies. Melissa pays attention to details with her Carriage House Airbnb, from the goodies she leaves for her guests, to the mini library that was a pleasant surprise, it‚Äôs all taken care of. Just show up and enjoy!!! I would definitely stay here again! Highly recommend this as a place to consider if you‚Äôre ever in their area!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Fabulous place to stay; my pup enjoyed it so much that when we started packing up the car to leave she kept biting at our feet and barking as if to announce she was not happy we weren‚Äôt staying. Peaceful and serene! Lots of room for the pup to run and play and Melissa left special little touches like a s‚Äômore kit for the fire pit and snacks/drinks for our stay! We loved our stay and hated to say goodbye.

The accomodations are lovely and so many thoughtful details , like a variety of snacks , drinks and even bagels for breakfast! Also lots of handy items for your pets, including safe and clean stalls for them to sleep in and beautiful outdoor enclousure for them to run and play. It is a rustic place but comfortable and full of charm. I would definetely stay here again. Thanks so much for the great experience and for providing such a nice place for travellers with their fur babies to stay and get much needed rest after so many hours on the road."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A most creative and comfortable place. We were so happy with all the thoughtful touches in these funky accommodations. This is one of the most interesting places we have had the pleasure to visit. Our dog was thrilled to have such a large fenced space to roam in.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Welcoming host, lovely refreshments, fantastic amenities for our dog, and unique, quiet accomodations. An excellent option for those traveling with pets!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Melissa‚Äôs carriage house is a great place to stay with pets. She had everything you could need for you and your pet. Loved the snacks and wine. Thanks you!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My second time staying here, and just as uniquely wonderful as my first stay. Melissa‚Äôs place has everything you need and she is readily available if you need her. The weather was very humid during this stay and when we arrived she had the dog bowl already filled with water for my fur babies. She is truly attentive. Since it was our second time my dogs were familiar, they felt right at home."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay for me and my two cats. Perfect if you need a pet/animal friendly getaway. Beautiful property and nice country scenery!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really a perfect place to go with your pets, it is 100% fenced and protected so you don't worry about your furry ones. Thanks to Melissa."

2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place! My husband, my puppies and I stayed for one night and we had the best time!
Plenty of space for my dogs to run, a lot of green around and Melissa left us some great snacks. Communication with the host was great also. Highly recommend!!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here. This place was unique and absolutely beautiful. The wine and snacks were a thoughtful touch after such a long drive down. Melissa was so kind, and responsive if I needed anything.Would definitely stay here again!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place! Love the land and how homey it feels. 2nd time there and will definitely be back again!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Carriage House is full of charm and good energy, a small oasis in a gorgeous rolling meadow, underneath an old pecan tree. Melissa has as much warmth and character as does the Carriage House, and I would not hesitate to recommend staying here for work, travel, or pleasure! I hope to be back soon."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Eclectic stay in a real barn ‚Äì as advertised separate rooms ‚Äì bed, bath and kitchen. Lovely and comfortable outdoor space ‚Äì I wish my dogs were with me! Thoughtful amenities ‚Äì wine, beer, snacks, Roku TV, reading chair, washer/dryer."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"One of our most favorite stays ever. Truly unique experience, spotlessly clean & comfortable. Best moments were watching our Jack Russell roam in the pasture as the sun set across a cloudy sky! It doesn‚Äôt get more perfect. Melissa is an outstanding host. Its was so nice to arrive after a long drive to see some snacks and beverages waiting, along with some other upscale amenities that only a really good host thinks to include. I loved falling asleep in my comfy bed where i could see the night lights of the horse stalls. Next time I come I need to bring a horse."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place, not close to major cities. I would advise including travel times in your plans. Homes in downtown Cheraw are beautiful."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great stay w my pup and son. Lots of little things helped to amplify the experience. The pup definitely loved the space a ton
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Truly a unique amazing stay. Unfortunately due to my time frame I was unable to meet Melissa. She was very understanding and readily available, but she already had everything I needed. When I tell you 100% pet satisfaction guaranteed!!!!!! Best stay ever!!!!!!!!!! We will be back!!!!!!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Carriage House was perfect for our one night stay with our two pups. The pups loved to roam and we loved watching them roam on the deck. Melissa thought of everything, from the complimentary wine, beer, bagels, juice, coffee, to the little library. If you have horses this is perfect for you. The two horse stalls are a great size and everything was so clean. Thanks again, Melissa!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is a pet paradise! Melissa puts a lot of efforts to make this barn house a great place for both you and your pet to relax and enjoy. The place is very clean and cozy. It got everything you need more than what they provide from the hotel in terms of amenities. We really enjoyed our time here. Do not hesitate to book it!!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Main reason I like to stay at Airbnb‚Äôs are finding places like these! Most unique and so peaceful with best touches! We got excited to see if the local deer would set off the motion lights on the deck‚Ä¶ no luck but just an example of the surroundings! I gave my girlfriend a golf lesson on the nicely mowed lawn before heading to Cheraw State Park Golf Course which is quick drive north‚Ä¶ peaceful area I‚Äôve never been! I like having the lights in the horse stalls as a night light‚Ä¶very unique experience and want this for a house one day
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,nice place to stay peaceful and quiet. great for if you have animals as well.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent place for couples, with Dogs, and/or Horses. There is an area, for additional people's
inside sleeping area, but you'll have to be ok, with the outside temperature. We had so much fun, it was so relaxing, and our dogs thought that they were in Heaven. We highly recommend, this AirBnB. Great hosts too.üëç‚ù§"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Melissa‚Äôs place is perfect for our overnight stay with our fur babies. She‚Äôs a sweetheart! Very responsive to our questions and needs. This is the second time we have stayed and will definitely be back again!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you have pets, this is the pet resort for them! Loved everything about Melissa‚Äôs place. Our pups especially loved the accommodations! Beds were very comfy for us humans. Perfect place for a night or a week. We will go back!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you are traveling with your pets just go ahead and book Melissa‚Äôs property. This is by farrrr the most pet friendly property I have ever stayed at, but it goes beyond ‚Äúpet friendly‚Äù and is more of a pet paradise. You cannot beat the price and Melissa went above and beyond to create a space that is perfect for you and your pets. She offered many small touches that made our stay super stress free and comfortable for us. Im just upset we couldnt stay longer. Wish I could give this property a million start. We will be back!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Melissa‚Äôs place is always comfortable, neat and clean. It‚Äôs a wonderful stop for our dogs‚Äî so easy!!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is my second stay at Melissa's-- I very much appreciate this unique space and it is perfect for people and their pets! Comfy beds and a fantastic deck and area to hang out.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Melissa a wonderful host. Her property is a great place and especially good for people who want to bring their pet with them. The location is rural South Carolina which I love. If you like that type of area, you will be impressed."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"TL;DR
Will definitely stay here again.
One of the most unique stays we‚Äôve had the pleasure of spending the night. The property and the converted stables are gorgeous. A super convenient place to spend a night or so if you have pets (especially larger pets that require a stable). So many little touches that normal Airbnb‚Äôs don‚Äôt do like wine and beer in the fridge, snacks on the counter, and breakfast for the morning(s). It was a little warm out but the bedroom had a portable AC unit that cooled the place sufficiently throughout the night. None of the rooms are connected so if you have to use the restroom or get water from the kitchen in the middle of night you‚Äôll need shoes and probably a flashlight, none of which bothered us. Thanks for a great stay, Melissa!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a gem of a location and star host. It was very relaxing and easy to work remotely from. We loved how dog friendly it was. The horse was very flexible with our arrival, incredibly responsive, and full of many details that made the experience a pleasure. We had amazing weather but if you were coming in the winter, pack your sweaters. It never got too hot and we didn‚Äôt even need the AC. It‚Äôs incredibly quiet and calm, a great place for a getaway from the city. The town is small and cute and there are many towns around it that are fun to explore. Our dog loves the water, and we found plenty of lakes and hikes within a 15 minute drive. It‚Äôs a great place if you‚Äôre looking for a getaway, a layover on a long drive, some peace and quiet, or simply a place where your pets are welcome.When they say welcome, they really mean it. They don‚Äôt just tolerate when they say welcome, they really mean it. They don‚Äôt just tolerate them, everything is designed to welcome the pups and give owners peace of mind."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host and the carriage house was a very cool place to stay. The stay was a great escape from the hustle and bustle of city living.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a fun, animal friendly place! Our little dog ran and hopped around the cottage and yard with total joy! The deck is a calm, beautiful place to sit and read, eat, watch the pup, and just relax! Best stop over ever on drive north from Florida! Kind of funky and unusual (really is part of an extremely clean stable with 2 stalls, which you enter to access the separate bedroom, bathroom kitchen). But clean and comfortable! We hope to return!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great spot, especially if one has dogs"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"if you have pets and want to have the most relaxing unique stay or even if you don't have a furry companion pick this place. melissa has everything set up perfectly from wine, snacks, to pet treats. She even has everything set up for horses to stay! there was a huge fenced in yard for our pups to run around and enjoy the outside while we enjoyed the deck with our coffee watching them."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place to stay for dog training at Cooper Black!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,Very happy repeat customer. Great for folks with dogs and horses.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very charming and unique place to stay! This would definitely be ideal if you are traveling with dogs or horses, as there is so much beautiful land to enjoy. We ended up arriving much later than expected and Melissa was so helpful and accommodating with our late arrival which we really appreciated. It was a very cold night and unfortunately we were slightly uncomfortable and cold all night even with the space heater in the bedroom, and having to go into the cold to get to the bathroom. Other than that, it was a lovely stay and Melissa added numerous thoughtful touches to make our stay very special!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time and it was just as great as the first. It‚Äôs a very unique place and one of our favorite air bnbs. Make sure to take advantage of the space; we really enjoyed making a fire and cooking on it, having s‚Äômores and picking pecans! We really appreciate Melissa and the details she added to make a great stay."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a great place to bring our dog! It was great to have so much space for her to run and play.
2021-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This was by far the most unique stay on our journey from MA to FL w our basset puppy. We stayed an extra day to give us all a chance to stretch our legs and explore; we‚Äôre glad we did. Our dog was in heaven with fenced in pastures to run/play in. The barn/paddock would have been great if it hadn‚Äôt been so (unusually) cold the days we were there. There were space heaters in the 3 rooms off the paddock area - bedroom, bathroom, kitchen - so we were warm when were in those rooms but couldn‚Äôt leave the doors of those rooms open to the common open area of the barn, which made it hard with a big puppy - she couldn‚Äôt move around inside, as the rooms themselves are on the small side. Which again would have been fine if we had been able to make use of the large open area of the barn as the wide open ‚Äúhallway‚Äù that connects the rooms into a little guesthouse. Melissa, who is a lovely, interesting and gracious host, had provided us w a propane heater for the open area but it couldn‚Äôt heat that area w nighttime temps in the 20s. No one‚Äôs fault but Mother Nature‚Äôs! Had the temps been 15-20 degrees warmer, it would have been absolutely perfect, so I encourage travelers who are traveling in late winter/spring (we were there during some of the coldest weather of January) to visit this unique AirBnB!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is my second time staying here, so I knew what to expect. I love this place and Melissa. I was having difficulty for some unknown reason booking the dates and Melissa took the time to contact Airbnb , which I so appreciated. She has a clean safe place to stay with your animals and so many special touches, dog treats, wine and beer plenty of room for animals to run and play. She really has created a haven for folks and animals traveling together. As long is she will be there and I have to travel back and forth I will be staying at Melissa's place, if allowed! :)"
2021-01-01,4,Stayed one night,"Our barn stay was very comfortable. The host had thought of lots of extra touches, like beer/wine, snacks, cheese and crackers, bagels with cream cheese! The barn was very clean, our pup was made welcome and the ONLY 2 little things that would have made our stay 100% was the DVD player working (we couldn't get it to connect) and we picked a VERY cold night to stay, so it was obviously chilly even with all the space heaters. But overall we thought it was a great airbnb, we would recommend it to friends and would stay there again üòÅ"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"So great we stayed twice on the same road trip. Sweet space, amazing place if you have a dog (or horse!) with you!!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had stayed once before and Melissa airbnb was just perfect for what we needed!
We love the carriage house and will not hesitate to stay again next time we are driving down the coast!
Thank you for your hospitality and attention to details. It is such a special place!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,So cute and cozy! Great place to stay especially if traveling with dogs and Melissa is a wonderful host!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Melissa was thoughtful since the minute we booked her Airbnb. We didn't need much during our stay since we were passing through but we fell in love with her carriage house! So much so that we booked it for way back!
She reached in a timely manner and made sure that we had everything we need for our overnight!
Can't recommended enough!
Also we had our dog with us and it was just perfect for her too!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a perfect place - safe fenced area for animals to run around, sweet indoor spaces and thoughtful host!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is adorable! I loved the amenities & the thoughtful touches & the host is always in touch should you need anything. Quick thing of note, I may have missed it in the listing (and/or not familiar with what an actual carriage house is) but you do have to walk through the stable breezeway to get to the bathroom & kitchen. Not a draw back for us, it was fun & authentic, but I wish I had brought slippers. Privacy is not an issue, we were warm enough, and the rain on the tin roof just lulled us to sleep. I would love to stay here again!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Melissa is awesome. Exactly what we expected based the description. It was perfect for our needs. Loved the little extra touches she provides. Will def stay there again if the need arises. Thanks for sharing a piece of your ranch with us and our fur babies!‚ô•Ô∏è
2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a lovely and unique experience. We loved everything about this stay. If you are traveling with furry friends, this is like taking them to Disney. We loved sitting on the deck while the dogs played in the yard. Cozy and very comfortable bed. Wonderful snacks and everything you need in the kitchen. It was complete with a full coffee pot and coffee to make for our journey. We wish we had more time to spend!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Melissa‚Äôs was the Airbnb Room of Requirement. It was exactly what I needed. Wish I wasn‚Äôt just passing through, I would ask to live there, but I appreciated that the listing accepted one night stays and that she welcomed my pet, as it is already hard enough traveling across country with them, her accommodation made it one less factor to stress over. There were very thoughtful and hospitable touches, from complimentary food and beverage, to shower goodies, and a book exchange library. She was communicative but respectful of privacy and space during the self check in amidst the Covid pandemic. Really can‚Äôt say enough about how much I enjoyed this spot. Am saving to my favorites!"
2020-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Thanks, great visit!"
2020-12-01,4,Stayed one night,We had a short one night stay on our way down to FL without a pup so didn‚Äôt get to experience the grounds but could see how our dog would love it. The room was clean and comfortable. If traveling in the winter be sure to bring layers as it gets cold in the barn!
2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"The cottage house was a fun stay. Great for the animals, they enjoyed the space and we enjoyed the friendliness!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Very accommodating if traveling with critters. Quiet and private. Had everything you could need. Very central location to explore interesting nearby communities.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely magical! I cannot express enough how perfect this place was for myself and my pup to unwind in after a rough few months leading up to moving back across the country. It was so perfect that we ended up staying an extra night to relax and enjoy the property! My dog had an absolute blast running around. Not only does the Carriage House have its own fenced in space with a dog door going to the porch, but the entire property is also safely fenced off and Melissa was so kind to give him free reign of the many acres of beautiful space! He LOVED it! Melissa was so kind when we arrived and so patient with him being stranger wary. He has never taken a treat from a stranger so quickly. She gave us a tour and let me know how everything worked. She even had plenty of things for guests in the kitchen which was such a lovely surprise after a long drive! They had even preset the firepit ready to go for us! It was a perfect stay and we loved every second of it, especially walking the acres and playing fetch, followed by relaxing on the porch. Would love to have stayed longer and hope to stay again! Extremely refreshing after months of chaos ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything about our stay was great. We arrived after 13 hours in the car with a dog and a cat. The space was clean and perfect for our needs. It was so great for our pup to be able to run around in the fence in deck and field that night. Melissa was super responsive and helpful and her place is a gem if you are looking for a place to stay with pets.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"It is the most interesting Airbnb for me so far. It‚Äôs a half horse barn, half living space with a fenced in yard within an even larger fenced in yard. Melissa is such a kind host and has provided so many thoughtful amenities (juice, bagels, dog treats, coffee, beer/wine... etc). It‚Äôs absolutely wonderful and we hope to find our way back soon!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stop on our trip from north to south. Our dogs loved the gigantic fenced area they could run and play. The interior space is perfect for those traveling with pets. Melissa is a friendly and attentive host. We will definitely stay here again on future trips!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you‚Äôre looking for a special stay, Melissa‚Äôs place is perfect! Everything was more than expected from the listing. The converted Barn, on her beautiful, spacious property, provides a unique and cozy atmosphere with all the amenities. Your four-legged friend(s) will be just as excited to stay here, with their own large fenced in yard (with doggie door!) to romp in as you enjoy a serene coffee in the morning or beverage at night. There are even treats and some toys for them!
Melissa is the most thoughtful, gracious host. She was very accommodating and very quick to respond. The place was very clean and had all of the necessities and more, as she provided snacks, drinks, and items for a continental breakfast!
Melissa was understanding of our changing timeline, as we encountered bumps in our timeline on our road trip. She was able to provide us with a guided tour and all the information we needed via phone (perfect for social distancing). My only regret was arriving after dark so I could not take in the beautiful scenery and sunset, and wish we had had more time to enjoy the space. Her place is just perfect and I highly recommend for any future stays!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was so much better then expected. Melissa is by far hands down the best host I‚Äôve ever had. She greeted us right away when we arrived and showed us around. This place is perfect if you want to get away with your dog for a weekend. My favorite part was enjoying the complimentary wine and eating s‚Äômores by the fire at night. I will definitely be returning. Thank you Melissa.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"My dog was smiling as we pulled into the large fenced area for her to explore. I was happy to be in a quiet, rural setting with comfortable beds and a normal sized frig-freezer to unload all my food into. The microwave and toaster oven were fine for heating my dinner."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place if you have dogs. Country setting, very unique setup. Have stayed 3 times now"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Melissa‚Äôs place is a quiet spot with a fantastic set up for pets!

2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a very relaxing time with our dogs with such a gorgeous view of your grounds. So unique and tucked away from it all. We would definitely stay there again!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Me and my fiance are traveling down 95 and needed a place to stay that would not only take in dogs but embrace them. This place absolutely exceeds this expectation. Melissa's home provides vast amounts of space for your pup to explore. The entire property is fenced in with your own private yard inside the property. This home caters to everything you and your fur family will need. I can't wait to make a visit back.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you have dogs or horses, this is the place for you! The space is wonderful with plenty of room to run. Melissa was so nice, helpful, and quick to communicate. She had many thoughtful touches around the place from food and drinks in the kitchen to all supplied bathroom items to tennis balls, dog treats, and even dog shampoo! I was passing through on a trip but already booked it for my way back! I definitely recommend staying here if you have any four legged companion."

2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"My experience at Melissa's place far exceeded any expections I arrived with. Spotless, adorable, well appointed, and filled with good energy from a woman who obviously loves sharing her space with people she is willing to immediatly treat as friends. I loved everything from the moment she met us at the gate to let us in to the last sip of coffee on the deck before I had to leave. I am anxious to find an excuse to return to Society Hill!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I booked this for my mother, sister, and their dog. They enjoyed their stay and thought the place was great. It‚Äôs extremely dog friendly. Melissa is so nice and easy to communicate with."

Being that the situation I am in is ongoing I foresee being back in the area and I will be staying again. I hope to stay longer than one night and enjoy the kitchen for a meal.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This has been my best experience using Air BNB so far. I travel for work and need a decent place to come too after a long day. This little place was perfect for that.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I were in town for a local event in Cheraw that we attend every year. We usually stay at a hotel or Inn but with the extra 2 guest we had, price wise it made sense to rent Heather and Collin‚Äôs home. I can‚Äôt even express how happy we were to have such a beautiful home to stay in. All the amenities, the cleanliness and the coziness was all we needed to feel right at home while also 460 miles away from ours. Not to mention how friendly they both are! We needed to stay an extra night and they were able to accommodate with no problems. Such awesome people and an awesome home. You will love staying here!"

Unfortunately we tried several restaurants in town to have a late lunch but they were all closed. We finally found Oslo‚Äôs Spirits and Grill!! Our bartender (Kayla??) was friendly and got us drinks and much needed food;)"

The hosts are quick to respond and the place is clean, beautifully decorated, thoughtful items left for guests, like extra towels, dish soap, extra toilet paper, washer and dryer available, snacks, books and games. if you are staying more than a couple days you might need extra toilet paper, otherwise it is completely stocked. Very unassuming property, looks very small from the front is actually very large and our family of five plus our dog had plenty of space. the area is charming with lots of historical sites and buildings to see. You can walk to the Catholic Church Three doors down or several other churches. We have family in the area and we will definitely be back again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,A very quaint house with plenty of room for our family of three. Although there is a barber shop attached to the property we not bothered at all by it. We definitely would stay at Heather and Collins place if we find ourselves in Cheraw in the future!

I probably misunderstood office area but kitchen table allowed me to set my office up just fine. Internet worked great and host was very gracious responding to my necessities related to internet.

They have it tastefully decorated and it‚Äôs very comfortable. Lots of parking in the front. Turn around is a little tight in the back if you have more than 1 vehicle. They make the extra effort for you to enjoy your stay. They have a list of local restaurants and their hours of operation. They had fresh flowers and homemade cinnamon rolls from local business too.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was participating in an AKC hunt test at H Cooper Black Jr Memorial Field And I decided to give the Brown House a try. It was a really good decision. The home is everything you could wish for! The neighborhood is also beautiful. I went several blocks to reach downtown and had excellent pizza at Leo‚Äôs. The Mexican restaurant is also very good. (The Brown House has a full kitchen but I did not have any interest in cooking).
Before I went I spoke to Heather on the phone and we exchanged a couple texts. I appreciated that. Thank you Heather and Collin for the effort you have put into making this home so nice for travelers!"

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an absolutely beautiful home and very spacious. We rented this home because we were attending the Nascar Race in Darlington. It is about a 30 min. drive to the race but taking backroads keeps you out of traffic both to and from the race. The pictures on the internet do it no justice as it is even more beautiful than the photos show. Also a very beautiful state park with beach, swimming, hiking, kyaking, fishing , hiking trails. We totally enjoyed our stay."
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,I am so very thankful that Heather decided to share her beautiful home with the world. The pictures do not even begin to properly show the beauty of the property.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Amy's place was amazing. It was super clean, comfortable and easy to find. Amy and her husband Phillip went above and beyond to accommodate and were very easy to communicate with. We felt very much at home here and the decor was charming. We will definitely stay here again if we are in the area.
We were booked for a week but actually extended our stay.

Cozy inside and this area expieriences some awesome nighly thunderstorms, the night rain hitting the roof made for the perfect sleep, the bed is fantastic, great size tv, The owner lives right next door both were really friendly and welcoming. We will definitely book this place again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is a true gem! Beautiful space, excellent location, very quiet and close to the main highway. The place itself is immaculate. The host was very friendly and accommodating. The pictures don‚Äôt do it justice. Definitely staying there again."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a beautiful serene place to stay and awesome host
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was our 2nd stay with Melissa. We had everything we needed and could relax on the porch and enjoy the country sounds. She‚Äôs a fantastic host and we will for sure return.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This historic house is a lot nicer than we had imagined. It has great decor and furniture. The setting is calm and serene with nice woods in the back and even an old historic building on the side.
Getting to the place was a little too long driving in through miles of fields of crops for about 45 min. at night with no street lights, but it was mainly due to my GPS telling me to get off in a particular exit coming from I-95 southbound. There's a closer way to I-95 of about 20 minutes drive in the southernmost exit. But it's okay if you don't mind driving in the middle of nowhere enjoying the fields and farm houses until you make it to your destination.
We only stayed one night as we were traveling back home. Wish we could have stayed longer. The house is old but not squeaky. It's bigger than we imagined and has all the necessary things for a great stay. It has nearby gas stations & local stores to visit. Restaurants are not too far, they're within 15 mins. on each direction."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I loved the fact is was right near a gas station! It was a small town but not a far drive from anything! we stayed for a dog event but loved that there was a good sized yard! There were even good snacks in the fridge!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We greatly appreciated the flexibility of being able to do a one nighter, and there's not much else available in the area so the house was a great find. We had a wonderful evening cooking burgers on the grill and a good nights sleep."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Melissa was extremely friendly and answered all our questions in a timely manner. House was beautiful and loved the history. Loved Melissa's added touch of providing snacks and drinks. After a long drive, we enjoyed the wine and the snacks. Highly recommend this house."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This nearly 200 year old cottage had character to spare. From the clawfotted tub to the hard wood floors it was great!
We enjoyed our time and Melissa made everything very easy.
This is our new 'home' returning to the area."
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Love the house! Beautiful surroundings.

Every cornerwas it's own and the history of the house was amazing.

The house is build 2 centuries ago but well maintained.

Check in and checkout instructions were very smooth and flexible.
We will def comeback in future."

Perfect."
2023-09-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"While staying at a historic property is novel, we didn't care for the dark interior, old squishy beds, or room AC units that were noisy, ineffective & a huge waste of energy. The house needs some basic TLC and the bathroom needs a deep cleaning."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Great host and great place
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was our second time staying here and would highly recommend.
2023-07-01,4,Group trip,"Cottage was very homey. WiFi was not working so we couldn't use the TV. Be sure to stop for groceries before you get to Society Hill, there is only a convenient store, a Family Dollar and no restaurants in town. Melissa is a very responsive host which was appreciated."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"All recommended, great place and host !!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Burn Cottage was an unexpected treat, we enjoyed the history in the space, it felt like going back in time a little bit. Melissa was the most accommodating host, both with late check in due to traveling and any questions or needs we had during our stay. We would love to stay again."
2023-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Melissa was avaliable via phone call upon arrival and walked me through the place giving details. Directly after hanging up my mother let out a loud scream I rushed to see only to find out she stepped on a dead mouse laid out on the carpet in the kitchen. My mother was totally freaked out. I immediately texted Melissa who was extremely apologetic and assured there were no more mice in the house. I probably should have packed up then but being it's a small town and due to the event I was attending there were no vacancies, so I was stuck and decided to make the best of it. I didn't hear back from Melissa again until we were on the road headed back home and she didn't even mention the dead rodent. While I have had a mouse in my home before living in a rural area, we felt as if she thought we were used to this kind of thing all the time and we weren't. When asked for a refund of 50 percent she declined citing we stayed there (had no choice) and even said my mother was an unapproved guest."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Melissa is a great host and easy to communicate with. She has a private, cozy cottage to get away with family or friends."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was an experience back in time to stay at a home built in 1840. Melissa has decorated the interior that made you feel like you were in a time capsule. To stay in a Historical Marker home was a great experience and would love to stay there again. Great place to stay!!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,we enjoyed our stay at Melissa's cottage. It's a beautiful place and very cozy. She put snacks and drinks out for us and our dogs. We couldn't have asked for a better place or host. Would definitely stay again.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Easy check in, the fridge and pantry were well stocked with some basics and more! Beautiful historic house, would stay again!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay at Melissa's. It was a great location to explore some nearby state parks as a family. It was a very cold weekend while we were there, and the heaters in all the rooms worked great for keeping us warm! The floors do get very chilly so I recommend shoes or slippers to be worn. Also just to note, there is an outside grill that works great, but per a sign on the fridge, the oven is not recommended to be used."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Lovely restored historic home. The overnight stay was comfortable.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Melissa was very responsive, friendly, and helpful. the residence was clean, and full of history. as far as historical homes go, it's very close to the original structure and is comfortable. Will definitely come back whenever we have work or vacation in the area!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Thank you Melissa everything was absolutely amazing. It is definitely an awesome place to stay. It was just what was needed for me and my fiance. I recommend anyone who is looking for a homely feeling when you stay to stay here.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks for the stay! We had a wedding to attend down the road (23 minutes) in Hartsville, SC and this historic home was perfect for our two little families to stay at for the weekend. We loved having more space than hotels can provide to enjoy each other's company. The home had basic necessities in the kitchen and bathroom. If you intend to prepare food during your stay grab your groceries on the way in before arrival, there is not a grocery store nearby. Two people in our group had an allergic reaction to something while in the house, likely pet related but it is listed as pet friendly so that's on us, just bring your Claritin if needed. I honestly wish we had more time to stay and enjoy the house with our friends but we were in town a good bit during our stay for wedding festivities."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"It's a great place, and Melissa was extremely accommodating!"
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"The home is a historic home so there are things about it that we loved; the porches, pet friendly, old furniture, etc. Glad the weather was nice because not sure how we would have liked it if it was cool. The heaters are all portable & there is one big heater in the middle of the house. The home only has one bathroom so for a house of 6 guests, it can be challenging! We did enjoy our stay! The host, Melissa, was very nice! Didn‚Äôt get to meet her personally but was available whenever needed!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Lovely historic cottage! Definitely recommend.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Melissa was a very attentive hostess. I knew if we needed anything she was just a message away. The fridge was stocked with eats and beverages and plenty of snacks were available. I loved the haint blue ceiling in the front bedroom where we slept. The cottage is definitely an historic treasure and if ever in that area it is a must for you to use an Airbnb hosted by Melissa.
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,This house is amazing! Very spacious and Melissa is an amazing host!! She is very welcoming and they really do go the extra mile. Not many places to eat but honestly not an issue with the stay you have. Just have to plan a bit for meals. Quiet for being on the Main Street. Really was very comfortable and Melissa goes above and beyond! The area is beautiful and the multiple porches are so inviting and relaxing! If you have animals even has a fenced in area. Totally recommend this place!!!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Good location for an event we were attending.
2022-09-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Very rural and cozy but there are things to do within a 20m drive. Bed in the large bedroom are a lot more comfortable than the other 2 bedrooms.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Like stepping back in time! What a unique stay! Melissa's care in getting the house prepared, her communication, and her hospitality are impeccable! Would definitely stay again and would absolutely recommend this location to others heading to South Carolina!!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Outstanding place . A textbook example of why I only stay in airbnbs when I travel. It‚Äôs a very unique place that is rich with history while also providing all the comforts of home. Melissa is a great host. I will definitely be returning the next time I need to stay in the area.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Consummate Southern host. A true step back in time. Conveniently located. Easy check-in and check-out. Peaceful, quaint, historical, small town atmosphere."
2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Melissa‚Äôs lovely home was very tidy and comfortable. Nice location and though situated on a road with lots of traffic throughout the day, inside the house was quite peaceful and serene. The fridge was stocked with beverages and breakfast items. We had plenty of pots/pans/plates etc and spices available for preparing our own meals. Beds were very nice and comfy as well! There are two screened-in porches, (though I was only able to access one, as the key did not fit the door for the back porch) that was cozy and thankfully mosquito free to leisurely read one of the many books available around the house. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Melissa‚Äôs and the only disappointment was that the wifi wasn‚Äôt available at any point during our time there. However, we will definitely stay here again, the next time we‚Äôre in the area. Thank you Melissa for making us feel so welcome in your enchanting, historical home."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Love Love Love.
House is awesome! It's like steppingback in time. Comfortable beds...had everything we needed. AC a bit loud but we were tired so sleeping was not a problem."
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,There was a lot of history in this little cottage. Melissa was a great host! The snacks and breakfast items were much appreciated after a long drive
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great overnight stay for our family on the way home from Florida to PA! I wish we had more time to enjoy your historical cottage!
We loved everything! Thank you for all of your personal touches and the snacks and goodies you left for us!! We will definitely stay there the next time we are in the area!
Thank you Melissa!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay! The house is charming and comfortable and exactly as described. All the extras were very much appreciated!
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,Melissa has a great place. will stay here again in the future.
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"Historical fun! This authentic 200 year old home took me back to visits to my great-grandma's. No central AC, but the bedrooms had comfy beds and portable A/C units that kept us cool in July. We were surrounded by antiques and cute country farm decor. The uneven wood plank floors and settlement cracks added to the home's character. Peaceful and far away from the city sounds. Bring quick-fix food stuffs you can microwave or bake in a toaster oven as restaurants are about a 20 minute drive away. Melissa had the porch light on and the A/Cs ready for our arrival. She even had little treats around the house and breakfast breads in the fridge. We enjoyed our day at Moree Sportsmen Preserve which is only 6 minutes away from this historical treasure."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband, dog and I just loved our stay at Melissa‚Äôs place. It was so quaint and comfortable. Melissa truly thought of everything to make our stay so perfect. We definitely look forward to coming back. I highly recommend staying here if you‚Äôre in the area."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice stay.
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"The Burn Cottage is a great place to stay and Melissa is a fantastic host. Highly recommend staying here, especially if you enjoy historic homes."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful, rustic place, away from the big city! A GREAT place to get away, watch the seasons change, listen to the crickets, gaze at the stars! Melissa is a great host! Any guest would benefit from her organization! Totally recommended!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,So cute!! Very clean!!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,Melissa is an excellent host and my stay was perfect.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Melissa was incredibly communicative and wonderfully accommodating. The house was very interesting and full of rich history‚Äîevery room had a story! We really enjoyed our stay, and if I ever find myself in Society Hill again, I'll be sure to check out Melissa's cottage once again."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"great place for history buffs and the cottage brings that history to life. As President of the Society Hill Historical Society, Melissa was a perfect resource for this information"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,A very comfortable house I love
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect for our stop over between Virginia and Florida!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,I‚Äôd rather not have a public posting. Thanks.
2021-11-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The house is an older home (built in late 1800's) and knew that going in. With that, is was very cold inside and the bathroom was without heat. Melissa did accommodate us very well and communicated excellant. This was a great place to do nothing but relax."
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful, quaint, and well kept."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, cool house, no problems, good communication! We will definitely stay again if back in the area!"
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful house out in society hill. We loved staying there and learning about the history of the house and the town around it!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,What a unique stay! we only stopped in for the night but we loved the history and and the decor.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed our stay. We loved staying in a comfortable restored home from the 1800s. Next time we'll plan more time to visit the local antique stores.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Melissa was easy to work with and had everything prepared for our arrival!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Do not miss this experience. I have stayed in over 60 Airbnb's and I must say that this was one of the most amazing experiences I have had. You can feel the history the second you walk in the door. Every amenity one could ask for. Melissa was a fantastic host.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a gem! The house is so spacious and decorated so beautifully to maintain the rich history it carries. Each room is so cozy and comfortable. Melissa is wonderful and does a great job communicating all of the details and working with me when I had some delays to meet me at the house! I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone visiting the area.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a short stop in between destinations , she was so generous left us breakfast bagels , beers and wine for when we arrived juices for the kids and snacks
everything was perfect !!!
I loved the coziness and feel of the porch setting and old school stove was fun to cook dinner on .... Melissa was super helpful in our journey ... she was a wonderful host"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"best place ever nice and clean well located the host is the best, great place"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The pictures do not do the house justice. My wife and I are serious history buffs, this house was an opportunity to stay in a home that one would think would be a museum. It‚Äôs full of vintage/antique pieces that create an incredible atmosphere.
The kids loved it. One of them even commented that it smelled ‚Äúold-fashioned‚Äù. The claw footed bathtub was a new experience for them, as were the tall beds.
The hostess overextended herself with multiple breakfast items, adult beverages, snacks, drinks and even chilled glasses!
Wish we could have stayed longer to sit on the enclosed porch for a meal, rocked in the chairs on the front porch and explored the beautiful town. Maybe next time."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nothing
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very historic house. Extremely well kept. Loved the feel and the kitchen was great. Melissa was of great help when needed. Children loved the open space as they played. Loved the extra porch space to becwith family or by yourself. My family will book again.
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"You really must stay here. The most unique AirBnB we‚Äôve ever been in. First off, it has every modern comfort: Great ice-cold AC; full kitchen; nice lighting; very comfy beds, a comfortable main room; reliable high speed wifi; three! porches to enjoy; crystal glassware; big Roku TV, etc. The high ceilings and claw foot tub will impress as will the delicate and very pretty light fixtures. The entire place is a work of art deserving of a photo shoot. Don‚Äôt arrive expecting to find a modern home. This is an exquisite historic home but with every modern comfort. The host gave us a nice tour to familiarize us with the home‚Äôs features. Very clean. Well thought out. Spend a couple days or a whole month! The host provided above and beyond snacks and drinks. We‚Äôll be back."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Melissa is kind and really helpful. We really liked the place. My son was so impressed. We enjoyed our night stay extremely well. I wish we could have more time to spend around. Highly recommend if somebody traveling around to stay here.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family and I enjoyed our stay. Everything about this house was pretty cool!
2021-07-01,3,Stayed with kids,Melissa is a wonderful host and very considerate. She leaves snacks drinks-including beer and wine after a long trip that's great. Our only complaint was that due to the age of the home there were portable AC units and they did not keep the house cool. We ended up a bit hotter than we would have liked. Other than that beds were clean and the house was comfortable.
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"This Airbnb is absolutely adorable, and we couldn‚Äôt have been happier with the space. The host is incredibly nice and couldn‚Äôt have been more welcoming. Overall we couldn‚Äôt have had a better time, and we intend to stay here again."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Love the house!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love the house!
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"Gorgeous house! We would absolutely love to visit again.
The wine was a fantastic touch!!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a quaint stay for a wedding in town. Thanks, Melissa!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This historic home was a really neat place to stay while my husband worked in a nearby small town. My daughter and I spent our day at a water park that was about 20 minutes away, and enjoyed nice evenings in. We had everything we needed, and Melissa left so many extras that were so appreciated."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautifully preserved home with decor that makes you feel at home. Great communication from the host. Super easy check in. Personal touches like bagels, snacks, drinks. Very clean and spacious."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,A wonderful place. So cool to be in such an old house. Melissa always is awesome to talk to and has great advice about the area. I especially appreciate the snacks and wine left for us!
2021-05-01,4,Group trip,the house was nice and was enough linens for our group. a/c could not reallykeep up with the 90-100 degree Temps we had
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful historical home with true southern charm!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Truly wonderful place, steeped in history and as cozy as could possibly be Imagined, the detail was Incredible, Snacks, Bagels, water , couple of brews, right down to an Umbrella which we didn‚Äôt need, but as a Host myself I learned from the best this trip. Melissa is an Excellent Host. Don‚Äôt miss a stay here."
2021-04-01,4,Stayed over a week,Melissa responds quickly to any questions or concerns. Comfortable historic home in good location. Pet friendly makes it even more of a valuable find.
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing host! Amazing property. Will visit again when we can stay longer.
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Melissa‚Äôs home was absolutely beautiful! If you are an old home fanatic (like I am) this is the place you want to be! Beautifully restored while fully keeping the vintage aesthetic! I was sold after seeing the picture of the claw foot bathtub, but the home was even more beautiful and spacious in person!
My husband and I were traveling from Florida back home to New Jersey and stopped here for the night. The location wasn‚Äôt too far off of 95, which was perfect for us!
From the second we walked in, the space felt so warm and inviting, then we continued to find thoughtful little amenities left around the house. A bottle of wine was the most amazing touch after 12 hours in the car!
We were also traveling with our small dog, and there were even little treats left for her!
We wish we could have spent more time here, we felt right at home!
Thanks for everything, Melissa!"
2021-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,Melissa was very welcoming. Nice amenities included. This is an interesting historic home- for us that was highlight. If you do not like historic homes this isn't for you.
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,So very charming. Worth going out of your way for!
2020-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Cute space in an easy location. Comfy beds. big enough to accommodate 5 of us traveling. We didn't have pets, but the place was very pet-friendly. Rooms each have their own climate control, and the units are a little loud, but you can customize the temperature for your comfort.
If you are fragrance-sensitive, reach out to the host before you book. There was a lot of fragrance in the house."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We always enjoy staying at Melissa's
2020-12-01,3,Stayed with kids,Very old house about 30 minutes from I95. Make sure you pick up dinner before your arrival. It‚Äôs a good place to stay when the weather is mild because the house is not adequately heated due to its age. Melissa was on call if you needed her and tried to be accommodating. However future guests should be informed about the lack of heat during the winter months.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very nice older house, as advertised. We stayed among authentic older furnishings. The place is very clean, which is important since we are in a pandemic.
Melissa is very responsive when I sent a message. I recommend her house."
2020-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The Burn House can accommodate a nice sized family or group. There are thee porches and a huge living room with a lot of seating/gathering options. We were able to spread out and the weather was good so we were able to take advantage of the outdoor spaces too. The yard is spacious and the little dog pen outside was a plus. If you like history, you should check out the Burn House."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host and amenities. Excellent communication.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is my second time staying at Melissa‚Äôs. Melissa is a great host. The cottage is well equipped. Melissa went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. Will be back again.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Melissa has a fantastic set up for pet owners or anyone that wants to get away to a historic town for a few days.

2020-10-01,5,Group trip,Very clean and very nice host!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Historic house and really enjoyed the history. Melissa really has great knowledge of the area and we learned a lot plus has. Great stay. Highly recommend her and the property.

2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Talk about going back in history. Melissa's place is just that. A diamond in Society Hill. You will not be disappointed.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Unmatched! This 1800‚Äôs cottage is so quaint and peaceful. From sitting on the porch swing and listening to the church bells to relaxing in the claw-footed tub, it was just the get-away I was searching for from the business here at home. The Cheraw National Park is a short drive away. We hiked and enjoyed nature. I will cherish this trip for a lifetime!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Burn Cottage is a step back in history. Great gem in Society Hill. Melissa is a great hostess with a lot of historical knowledge. Will be back soon!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,The cottage is an historical gem and Melissa was fantastic throughout the process. This was my first Airbnb experience and I was not disappointed. Would definitely stay again!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful host with an amazing, historical place. Loved every bit of it."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is a gem! The pics do not do it justice. It was a beautiful mix of modern and vintage. Melissa was incredibly helpful and thoughtful. Wish we could‚Äôve stayed longer
2020-08-01,5,Group trip,Excellent Stay...
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Literally everything we needed we found stocked in the kitchen. She knew we were there for our wedding and made sure to add special touches. Way better than what I was expecting. Would definitely stay again
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage is beautiful - spacious, comfortable, and clearly original. It would be an excellent place for a longer stay (a week or more) for a vacation - it has a very unique character is just overall very cozy and lovely. I was only there for one night, and I truly wish I could have spent more time there. Melissa was fantastic - she was beyond accommodating about an unexpected delay in my arrival time, and was always thoughtful and kind in all of our communications. I cannot recommend this cottage strongly enough!"
2020-08-01,5,Group trip,Great stop on the way to the beach with historic ambiance. My first Airbnb rental ever!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, super comfortable historic home! Melissa thought of everything with complimentary drinks, snacks and breakfast items. Highly recommended - would definitely visit again!"

2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an old house but very well maintained. It cannot be really ""updated"" since it is a historic property and has to remain true to its time period. Hello, one outlet in each room! However, even without being able to have central air conditioning the room air conditioners keep it cool. The high ceilings are great, and the house is fabulous. There is a binder of local information and lots of historic pictures. Melissa does not skimp on mattresses so we all slept well. Being pet friendly is a real plus. Old home plus allowing pets makes it seem as if cleanliness would be an issue, but the house is scrupulously clean. We will stay again next time we are in the area."
2020-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Burn Cottage was a step back in time. A wonderful, historical home in an area of SC that is rich in history. Melissa was a great host who is also an amazing interpreter of Society Hill‚Äôs past to present. She has done an incredible job in restoring this home in accurate detail. Thank you for a wonderful week. Thank you again for your hospitality, we had a great time."
2020-05-01,5,Group trip,Melissa is by far the best hostess ever. The house was absolutely spotless and full of history. Melissa stopes by to meet us and have us a history lesson. I only wish I had more time to hear more about Society Hill. I highly recommend Melissa‚Äôs home. You will not be unsatisfied.
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I sooo enjoyed my time at the Burn cottage! It felt like home away from home~Personal touches & history galore- Melissa is a great host with lots of great knowledge about the area- I will Definitely be booking again!
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay beautiful house very nice
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I really enjoyed the house. It was a great place to stay while working. Alot of work has went into this house to get it restored. Lots of history in the area.
2020-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay. Melissa is a wonderful hostess. It is evident that she loves to share her cottage and the history of Society Hill.
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great, comfy old home with a great host. Would highly recommend."
2020-02-01,5,Group trip,"My daughter and 5 of her sorority sisters stayed here for a weekend. They had nothing but wonderful things to say about the host, Melissa. They said the house was charming and beautiful. Thanks!"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great historic home. Melissa offers great hospitality and extra touches for a wonderful stay.
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a great, comfortable place to stay, then this is it. Melissa takes care of every detail. It is a very pet friendly place that is very clean and very well put together. This is not my first time staying here and I feel I am at home when I‚Äôm here!"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,The home is clean and the host is sweet. Right off the highway which made exploring surrounding areas very easy.
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a great place with some history! Melissa is a great host and the special touches were just perfect! Being there with the pups was a big plus. We will be back when coming back to the area!
2020-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This cottage is charming! Relaxing space and very interesting house, especially if you like historical places. Melissa was friendly and very helpful. Snacks, drinks and bagels were there for us. We were traveling with our pup and the screened porch and screened yard space was perfect. Tip: there are no restaurants within the town but plenty just a short 15 min drive away. If you don‚Äôt want to go out, stop and get food on your way in."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Melissa was one of the friendliest hosts I've had the pleasure to stay with throughout my travels. Its tough to believe a home from the 1800s is in as good as shape as it was. If you are passing through and need a place to stay you will not find a more unique stay than this one!!
2019-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,What an amazing host. Melissa has a great place. To sit on the front porch and just enjoy the country sounds in the evening to eat breakfast on the back porch. The bedrooms were great and relaxing in the family room was just as nice.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything was exactly as described. Really neat having the cows and horses right outside and we did feed the horses some apples.

She always looks for ways to make our stay more pleasant, relaxing and enjoyable."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Rachel was an amazing host, she was very helpful with getting to know the area and responsive to any need or questions we had.
The cottage is in a nice, secluded area with a nice privacy fence of mature bamboo, and the yard was nice and spacious for our 3 dogs. Lots of beautiful trees and flowers!
Everything you could need for small home living is there. We were able to cook in the kitchen and do laundry easily since we had an extended stay. TV and board games are there for you too in case of inclement weather.
Rachel also gave us a binder with suggestions for food spots and things to do in the area. It even had the history of the property!
Highly recommend staying here if you need a quiet place to get away or as a nice base of operations for exploring the area!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The cottage was idyllic. I had everything I needed. I felt relaxed, & secure. Initially I booked to stay one week, until repairs on my house were finished, but this turned into 4 weeks."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Rachael was a very communicative hostess, even coming over to welcome us upon arrival and happy to assist with any needed items or recommendations.
The space is tidy and exactly as described with all items you need to prepare meals and relax. Plenty of blankets, towels, sheets. Loved the heated bathroom!
The only issue is bed is rather noisy if you move, a smaller sized queen and mattress isn‚Äôt particularly new or comfy. The sofa is also a pop out bed though so hubby opted to sleep there on 2nd night and we both got a little bit better sleep.
We do definitely recommend Rachael‚Äôs place, great value."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay here. The house was clean and ready for our stay. The host was very kind ahead of time and left little goodies for our old pup. She was also kind enough to leave us some creamer, which tends to be the thing I forget to bring along.
The house felt private and the yard was great.
For my SCA friends looking for a place close to the Girl Scout camp on Ebenezer Rd, you can't get much more convenient at 11 miles away!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The flexible check-in was great as it allowed us to arrive later than we anticipated due to storms on our drive. Rachel was very responsive to our messages and questions. She offered us farm fresh eggs which were amazing and the coffee she provided was excellent (need to find out how to order some üòÅ). Rachel was very sweet and I could‚Äôve talked all day with her if we hadn‚Äôt had to leave ! This was an excellent choice for our stay and we will be back.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The home was a very cozy and comfortable place to stay with our puppies. The dog treats and toy made their stay special. The coffee, tea and creamers left for us was very much appreciated. We will definitely stay again."

Walking into the kitchen, the lights were on, the music was going .. there were welcoming snacks.. and then begin the exploration!
This house is definitely a Top 10 for me, it‚Äôs actually at the very top! The history, the warmth, the entire vibe of the house is utterly welcoming!
Please take the thought into staying here, you will feel like you are living in a beautiful estate!"

We had a party of 10 guests and everyone had more than ample space and having 3 1/2 baths were perfect! No one felt cramped at all. The lines were pristine and more than enough towels. Washer/dryer with detergent are there for your use and that was a plus for sure. The grounds on the 1 acre are a must see. Very beautiful and relaxing to say the least. Highly recommend and the price was so on point for us.
I would like to add the host Mary and John are exceptional! They made sure everything was up to our expectations and the communication was very quick with their responses. If you pass this house up you are truly missing out. Thank you Mary and John, WE WILL BE BACK!!!

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"This Hartsville property is a hidden gem within a rural countryside landscape! Upon arrival we were pleased to find Dawn and Thomas had a Keurig with coffee and tea waiting on us. This immaculate home has an open kitchen, living room, and dining room which allowed our small group to socialize. Located in a quiet neighborhood surrounded by country roads, the home is private enough to get away but close enough to get a bite to eat or shop for groceries and supplies. The information book Dawn and Thomas left was a big help, as was the list of interesting places to visit. We were able to fit five motorcycles in thee garage (two of which were trikes) which was a gift, because we didn't have to fully unpack. There is plenty of sleeping space with six beds in four bedrooms. Both full baths were spotless. This is one of the best Air B&Bs I have stayed in. This trip is an annual thing for my group, and now we get to visit the nearby Buc-ee's! We will absolutely be back!"
