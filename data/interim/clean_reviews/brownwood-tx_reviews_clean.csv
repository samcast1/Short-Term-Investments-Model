This place wasn’t too far from Downtown Brownwood, and after a long day of exploring the town, I loved spending the night at this AirBnB. The host truly thought of everything to make this stay perfect-there is coffee for the morning, there are plenty of dishes for food, there’s a pullout couch if you want to lay down while watching tv in the living room, there are plenty of blankets to get cozy. The place has great air conditioning. The shower was wonderful. I use a cane because I have chronic pain, and there’s a ramp if you use any mobility aid plus the living room, kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom are all close enough to each other which helped since I have some trouble walking. I can’t wait to come back here for another writing retreat!"

I drove back towards town in order to get cell service and Oscar was very quick to respond. He assured me which key should work. My gps took me down a washed out road but I drive a Jeep, so that wasn’t a big deal and it’s not Oscar’s fault. Got back to the house, my husband got the it unlocked. The neighbor came over to make sure we got in ok. Since I didn’t have cell service, I thought that was nice! My husband went to the local store and found out their WiFi was down, so that explained why there wasn’t internet at the house either. But the home was cozy, clean, decorated cute, and the AC worked GREAT! WiFi came back up, we had cell service and the rest of our stay was wonderful!

2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Cynthia is always available for every concern we may have had and takes care of her guests!
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Cynthia was absolutely amazing to talk to. She was helpful, responsive, kind and thoughtful. The place was perfectly prepared with extra thought put into the little comforts of home that make staying here an absolute treat. Wonderful lady and host. Will be booking here every time we’re in town."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great house. Lake is low now but we knew that before our trip. Host was very accommodating and communicated well from booking through check out.
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"The drive through the neighborhood goes past some home that are not well kept and makes you start wondering what you signed up for. As soon as you open the door to the house you are set at ease by the immaculate, welcoming and comfortable surroundings. The kitchen was well supplied, plenty of towels, toiletries if you needed them and lots of board games if you're interested."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,Cynthia is an amazing host and the property is definitely worth the stay!
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Nice place and easy to get to.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,Wonderful place very quiet and peaceful
2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,Cynthia was very easy to communicate with and was very understanding when we had to check out early due to work circumstances. I couldn't be more happy with the experience.
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"We loved the house, and it met our needs just perfectly. Our 9-day stay was wonderful. The house was decorated for Christmas. The beds were very comfortable, the bathrooms were spotless, and the showers were nice and hot with strong water pressure. We learned the first morning cooking breakfast how sensitive the smoke detector in the kitchen is! Turn on the fan over the stove and open the sliding door in the kitchen! LOL Having that full size washer and dryer was wonderful. Our phones mapping app (""G"") gave us directions to this address, and they were terrible directions and left us hanging but we found the house regardless. We had no idea how to work keyless entry and lockup, but we figured it out! We corresponded with the owner several times, and she always made time for us, and we never felt like we were an imposition. When we come back to the area to visit family, we would definitely stay here."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,Our company had work in the area and we wanted a nice relaxing place for our guys to stay while they were working in Brownwood that was not going to be a budget buster and better than a hotel for multiple electricians.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,Thank you for all of your help and understanding. We booked this house as we are in the Panhandle of Texas and doing work in Brownwood. We have a crew staying at the house while we are on the job. So glad that we were able to find a peaceful place for our electricians to stay so they could relax after working so many hours in the day. Thank you so very much for letting us extend our stay! You have been very gracious.
2023-10-01,3,Stayed with kids,"The house is nice, but lake levels were to low so your not able to fish from the dock so it wasn’t great for us I took my parents who are older, a toddler and me being 5 1/2 months pregnant we had to make other arrangements to be able to fish, I just wish they would of let us know this before hand so we would of been better prepared."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Cynthia was an excellent hostess. She was very accommodating and quick to respond to messages.The lakeside cabin was quite nice and had a beautiful view. I would definitely stay there again if I'm ever in the Brownwood area.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,Beautiful lake view. Cynthia was a very responsive host. Will definitely book again. Next time I’m in the area.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Second stay here and just as we remembered it. This is a super quiet location, clean and comfortable. It was super hot this weekend and showing up to the house chilled down was a pleasant welcome. Lake Brownwood is hurting with the drought and low water levels right now, but our stay had no problems. Very appreciative of the hospitality."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place.

2023-01-01,5,Group trip,The house was clean & efficient. All instructions were precise and clear. Communication with owner was great. My family enjoyed our stay and would stay in the house again. The neighborhood is very rundown but nobody bothered us and everybody seemed friendly.

2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"Cynthia's home is amazing! Its clean, cozy, warming and refreshing. Our go to home while visiting Brownwood!"
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,My family came to see my daughter perform as Mother Abess in the Sound of Music at Howard Payne University. I waited too long to get hotel rooms as it was homecoming weekend — all full. But I found the Hideaway. My family of 5 were very comfortable all weekend. Adorable and clean. The kitchen was well stocked. I caught a beautiful sunrise by the lake and had a wonderful time.
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful view, lake level low. Wildlife awesome. Quiet and comfortable. Had a wonderful time."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here for 4 days to celebrate my mothers 60th birthday, everything was so clean and the house was cozy and very comfortable. The views (even though lake is low) are breathtaking! Sitting on the porch listening to the birds and enjoying coffee was so relaxing! There’s an entire collection of games that came in handy on the hot afternoons! The house is stocked with extras, TP, paper towels, shampoo, conditioner, washer/dryer and detergent, fully stocked kitchen and so many other things. The beds were great and comfortable, we had plenty of space. Highly recommend staying here for a day or a week, it was amazing!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous comfortable home
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,Great time was had here. Baby deers were adorable! Comfortable and cozy!
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"We loved, loved this home so much. The amenities were many and very much appreciated by our group. The various board games gave us nights of great laughter and precoius memories. Although the lake was low it did not hinder the great time we had."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great views her and very convenient for our purposes. Lake access is good and the location is very quiet at night. Clean home with good bedding
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was perfect and the walk down the stairs to the lake was not bad at all! The lake was low (as mentioned in her info), but we still had great luck fishing off the dock!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very cute home, that functioned very well for us. Enjoyed the doc in the evenings. Nice extras like coffee/wine bar, snacks, and sunscreen, aloe Vera were appreciated. Decided to add an extra day to our stay!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great time.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The home was beautiful and I loved the little extra she had for her guests. Little snacks, coffee and even a bottle of wine. I even appreciated the Aloe Vera gel, we always forget that. Tons of board games for your family to enjoy. Easy check in/out process. She answers her messages very promptly. Had no complaints outside of the lake being way down, but nothing they can do about that, with no rain for anyone thats to be expected and our stay wasn't for the lake anyway so that didn't matter to us. We very much enjoyed our little vacation in their home."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Hideaway on the Lake was lovely! This was our first Airbnb experience. My family chose to stay here for a family reunion at the State Park instead of renting multiple hotel rooms or cabins. This way I could have my children and grandchildren all together. It was perfect! Everything you could need if provided! Cynthia goes above and beyond all expectations in providing a wonderful experience! We thoroughly enjoyed our visit! And the sunsets… WOW!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Clean and comfortable! My family had a wonderful time with all the comforts of home!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our family of 4 had a great time here! Fishing off the doc was relaxing and enjoyable for all!
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,Amazing place! The whole house is stocked with everything and anything you could need. The view from the house is gorgeous! The host is very accommodating and responds incredibly quick when you message her!
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"The house was perfect! We really enjoyed staying there. We picked the house because we were celebrating my moms 80th birthday. She uses a walker and the walk way up to the house and the drive way are not wheelchair/walker friendly. Other than getting in and out of the house, it could not be more perfect! It was clean and beautifully decorated with very comfortable beds and a great kitchen! Also, lovely views! Highly recommend!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wild Duck Marina is a great place to go for lunch. Flat Rock Park is a nice swimming area nearby. Underwood's in Brownwood is delicious...we recommend the country fried steak and their cobbler is yummy!
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,Great location and great host! Great place to get a way and reset from the craziness of daily life.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"House was very clean and made us feel like we were home. Went fishing out on the dock and caught a 20lb catfish. My family and I had a great time relaxing, fishing, and making memories. Great Lake House if you want to get away from a busy life."
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"Well located on a point on Lake Brownwood with a good dock, kayaks and a paddle boat. The house is very nice, comfortable and a well supplied kitchen. Very clean-- the hosts were responsive to anything we needed. Looks like a good place for a family lake vacation !"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home was above our expectations! Cynthia was easy to communicate with and prompt on answering any questions we had. The view was spectacular!
Next time we are in Brownwood we will hopefully go here again!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful property. So big it took me forever just to explore it all. Rods are a little rough but there's other ""amenities"" she didn't even mention."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A truly wonderful lake house. The views from the living room window, backyard, and the dock are beautiful and serene. Wish we could’ve stayed longer but loved every second that we were there. Wonderful communication, comfortable beds, and everything we needed & more."
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,"This was the perfect getaway!!!! Cynthia thought of EVERYTHING: shampoo, conditioner, Tide, paper towels, plenty of toilet paper, hand soap, plenty of board games, etc. the washing machine and dryer came in handy. The tall ceilings make it feel SO spacious. Our family of 7 slept comfortably, plenty of seats, inside and out. We enjoyed the rocking chairs on the front porch, in the shade. The view of the lake is gorgeous.
The fridge was stocked with condiments, plenty of seasonings, pots and pans, so, so many little extras that no other airbnb provides.
There are a few abandoned homes nearby so we actually were grateful for the video surveillance! felt safe the whole week!
I would highly recommend this airbnb! Cynthia was quick to respond and very accommodating! Oh, the shower in the bathroom was roomy and spacious for my 85 yr old mother n law who needed a shower chair. This airbnb is A+"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really cute home on the lake. The beds are SUPER comfortable, which was a blessing after a long drive. Would definitely stay here again!"
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,We enjoyed our stay! Cynthia was very quick to respond. Wish we could have taken advantage of the kayaks and fishing. The view of the lake is beautiful!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,beautiful lake beautiful fishing beautiful sunrise/ sunsets it maid for a great day walking out on to the back patio and drinking a cup of coffee with the birds chirping
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,"Great lake getaway. Direct access to the lake. We enjoyed the Kayaks and pedal boat. Only 2 lifejackets available so bring your own if you have more than 2 people.
House is stocked with everything you would need, didn't lack anything. Beds are comfy. House was clean.
We would definitely come back."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay at Cynthia’s lake house. It was beautifully decorated and very comfortable! The view was gorgeous. We will definitely be booking again!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cynthia's home was very inviting and her thoughtful touches made it so homey and comfortable. Its right on the lake and is so peaceful. We especially liked the fact there are several outdoor spaces to sit and relax. The home is very clean which we also appreciated. She is great at communicating! We will definitely be back when we just need to get away.
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,"Cynthia is a great host!
We enjoyed everything about the place, we loved the sunsets on the dock especially. Everything we needed and more was provided. We had a blast fishing and enjoying the weather. We will definitely be back soon."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Everything thing is as it is listed. Comfortable for small or large family. Great access to the lake plenty of shade for outdoor relaxing. Beautiful views!
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay with the whole family loved staying there.
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,"The house is beautiful, very spacious and very homey. Cynthias very responsive when I called at night with a small incident that I had burning a tortilla she picked up right away. And I get to see you too baby Deers!!! Overall the experience was very nice I came for work but honestly I’ll like to return to enjoy the lake"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a cute a clean home. The beds were so comfortable. We really enjoyed our stay. We would definitely stay here again!
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,"Great place for kayaking, swimming, reading and whatever else you plan to do!!! Best host we’ve ever had for communicating! Loved everything about it!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Always a pleasure staying here at Cynthia’s beautiful Lake House during the Holidays. It’s the perfect getaway for a family of 6. Plenty of room for everyone and the kitchen table is large enough to have a nice sit down cooked meal.
The relaxing back yard is a plus for a breezy day sitting out and enjoying your morning cup of coffee.
The kids love sitting out on the dock to fish. Everything was well stocked and the place was very clean. This hideaway lake house won’t disappoint!"
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,We had a GREAT time at this lake house. The place was clean and well furnished. There was a bottle of wine waiting for us and my kids had a great time with all the board games that were provided. The property is well well furnished. We weren't lacking for anything. There's a small fire pit so we nice fire one of the nights and enjoyed relaxing on the patio with the small fire and no distractions. This Lake House is a GEM. We would defiantly book again!!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay!
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,Great place. This was our second time to stay in a two week period. We were on Lake Brownwood for back to back tournaments. Parking is key when you fish and your friends fish and need a place that can accommodate trucks and boats. Two trucks with boats fit nicely and we could have squeezed in a third.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A great, private, quiet getaway to unplug and recharge. Clean and can't beat the beautiful lake views in the backyard. The dock was great and the guys loved fishing and kayaking."
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"Clean and cozy. This house is very nice. We were in town for a couples fishing tournament and are looking forward to our next stay here in a couple of weeks. We had two trucks with boats and had plenty of room for a third if needed. Just a sidenote, it is easier to back your boat into the driveway than to back it out. There is no room to turn around once you have pulled into the drive."
2021-09-01,4,Group trip,The house was great the dock was really nice right out the back door. We had a lovely time.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Clean, functional space, great for kids, and isolated for privacy. Right on the water and perfect covered dock to secure your boat to, or fish from. We caught many fish from the dock."
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,Everything about this home was perfect! Great description and so cozy! We were in town for a funeral and I’m so happy we had a home away from home. Great stay and great value.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great rental. Cynthia was a very responsive and accommodating host and the house was nicely styled, very clean, and well appointed. Location is about 20 minutes from Brownwood."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place to stay a little out of the way very lots of privacy very clean and comfortable plenty of things to do
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,a beautiful home everything you need for a relaxing get away highly recommend this place host is great she makes sure your stay is memorable
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,What a great place to stay. Our kids really enjoyed the place. The water was perfect. We will be back!

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean place. Cynthia thought of everything. Will definitely be staying again!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Rough roads but a beautiful place when you get there caught one fish
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay & had such a great time!
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"Cute, clean home with Great Lake access. House accommodated 5 adults and 2 teens perfectly."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a lovely place to bring our family for the Fourth of July weekend. We enjoyed this quaint cabin by cooking out, fishing and a nice firework show from across the lake.
This is a very secluded clean cabin that I would recommend to anyone that wants to get away from the hustle and bustle .
The Shivers"
2021-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,Great place lots of amenities. plenty of room. Surrounding neighborhood not near as nice as this place but was never bothered
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Tucked away from others. Peaceful and quiet.
Cynthia was very responsive.
This home has wonderful updates, and everything needed to enjoy a stress free getaway.
A hidden gem!!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I rented this home to spend time with my grandkidwho live in the area. Drove down from Michigan & was thrilled to arrive and find this beautiful place. Everything was spotless, decorated beautiful & had absolutely everything we needed to just relax. Our favs- front porch sitting, sunset from the dock, privacy, comfortable beds!! Loved everything & made wonderful memories!"
2021-05-01,4,Group trip,Clean
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,Lovely place!!! Great view. Very very clean.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, all of the pictures could not compare to the actual view and the magnificent sunsets. We had lots of rain so the fishing was pretty poor, but the home was great. Nice covered dock makes for comfortable fishing. Big screen TV very comfortable living area provided great pace to visit and that was mainly why we were there. Great Mexican food restaurant nearby. The week went by so fast sorry we had to leave. We will definitely be back."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Once we arrived at the house, we loved it. It is clean and well stocked with nice amenities. There are books, and games, a smoker and a charcoal grill. We were pleased to find a ‘real’ coffee maker not just the Kuerig. The Coffee and Wine area was a nice touch.
If you are there for the fishing, you may want to take advantage of the boats provided because the lake was relatively shallow off the dock when we visited.
We did catch a few nice fish though.
If you need peace and quiet, this is a nice place to find it."
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,"A great little gem! Don't be fooled by the area leading to the house. Cozy, quiet and clean. It was the perfect spot for our getaway! All the extras were available."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cynthia’s place is great and we felt right at home when we walked in. Loved the relaxing lake view from patio and all the windows. Available WiFi so happy faces. Cynthia is a wonderful host and I was appreciative of quick respond to questions. While staying at Cynthia’s we found a wasp nest on front porch and she immediately sent out someone to remove it so we could enjoy our time outside. Made us feel at home and safe.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice and easy!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our time at Cynthia’s was a much-needed time of rest and relaxation. Her place is the perfect getaway—you won’t be disappointed. I agree with other reviewers—the drive in may seem a little concerning, but we had absolutely no issues and felt very safe at Cynthia’s place. It will be worth it all!! I’m a detail person, and Cynthia has ALL the details covered: spotlessly clean, well-appointed kitchen, abundant towels (bath and beach), washer & dryer, comfortable beds, soft throws to snuggle under in the living room, multiple sitting areas outside...I could go on. I hope you love it as much as we did! I only hope we get the chance to return!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice and quiet place to stay very clean and comfortable place to stay all needs were met and place was totally furnished
2021-04-01,5,Group trip,"This cabin is far better than advertised. Nestled in a near private corner of the lake, this wonderful home has everything that a person could possibly need and then some. We had planned a fishing trip but Mother Nature changed that for us quickly. Thankfully, we had multiple board games to choose from that filled our time. Cynthia is a great host and her home was perfect!"
2021-04-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful house so comfy and cozy 😊 had everything we needed hope the weather will be better next time..
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"SUCH a beautiful view and great place for a family to stay and have fun! Was lovely to have a variety of coffees and little creamers, red and white bottles of wine, and a big basket of snacks to greet us and have on our stay! We were there a little bit after the first week of April and there is a small, ADORABLE patch of bluebonnets outside the back window that you can take photos in front of!
They had a variety of fishing poles available with 4 lb and 6 lb fishing line spools, but we used the ones we brought. The gar were spawning and we saw at least one large gar swimming around the dock so we didn't catch much other than 1 small catfish, 1 small drum, and 2 small sunfish / perch that we threw back. (Had a ball fishing, though!)
Was really nice to have beautiful outdoor / yard space for little ones to run around in and to grill for dinner.
Nice variety of books / games on the shelf. (There were even 3 books for small children, 2 of which are Peppa Pig, which saved us as at bedtime when realized we had not remembered to bring any bedtime storybooks.)
As an FYI the room with the Texas-themed bedspreads / decor / bunk beds has a sliding barn door, just so you're aware. The ladder on the bunk bed can be removed in the even you have a child below age and need to make sure that child isn't tempted to get out of the bottom bunk and ""explore"" the top bunk.
Host was super responsive and very thoughtful! Lots of towels, nice toiletries, many spices / extras available in the kitchen (I think it's the best stocked kitchen I have ever encountered in an AirBnB). You can tell they have put a lot of thought and effort into this space.
Would highly recommend this host and place, you sure can't beat a lakeside sunset or sunrise!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Enjoyed kayaks and paddle boat. Kept kids entertained. Never left the lake once we arrived. Comfortable home with calm lake decor.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very Comfortable , Clean home , we will be back , she makes sure she takes care of the lil extras that matter ."
2021-03-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful house. Be sure you are aware that there is a no guest unless their names are given to the owner and approved. That includes someone stopping over for an hour or two. The owner has cameras in the front of the house and does monitor them during your stay.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Had a wonderful family getaway at this house. we loved the location! Cynthia the owner was great at quick replies when we had questions.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were very impressed from the moment we opened the door. The space is very welcoming and we felt right at home. The dock was were my family spent a lot of time, sunsets are beautiful! We experienced absolutely no problems during our stay and look forward to staying again!
Marcie Harris"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our family had a great time staying at this lake house. We liked how the house came equipped with essential amenities as well as some kayaks and a paddle boat. The view was nice too!
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very beautiful inside nice location away from everyone just amazing to stay very nice view in the back
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Incredible views and everything you need for a nice getaway
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful experience! Will definitely be coming back.
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice clean accommodations
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We truly enjoyed our stay here. The lake is very pretty and the house is tastefully remodeled with many smart amenities. It was especially well stocked with so many things that you may need such as spices, a Keurig, coffee, tea, creamers, a bottle of wine and waters in the fridge. That made our first night so nice as we ran out of time to stop at the grocery store on our long first travel day. The neighborhood left a bit to be desired as the roads in are a little rough and the homes around this one are in need of repair, but this home is tucked closer to the lake so you don’t readily see the neighbors and this home is well maintained and remodeled. Being on the lake was nice for beautiful sunsets and some any time fishing (she even has poles available to use). Cynthia has thought of everything you might need which is especially helpful if you are flying in!! The beds are comfy too! We enjoyed ourselves and would recommend this house to others."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay here at the lake. Although we couldn’t do much outside the cabin due to eateries being restricted, we had a great time playing games and just talking. I loved the isolation of it, the cabin is super cute, and I’d stay here again. The weather wouldn’t allow us to partake in any outdoor activities though, but what can you do? Great time."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was comfortable, clean and well stocked. Cynthia was a gracious hostess and we enjoyed our stay."
2020-11-01,5,Group trip,Awesome place
2020-11-01,5,Group trip,Cynthias place was great! I will definitely be booking again in the future:)
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I most definitely will be renting this place again, this place was much cleaner and organized than we thought. This place provided so much stuff for us, like blankets, towels, champaign, coffee, hot chocolate, kitchen utensils, toilet paper, first aid kit, wifi, directv etc... I can go on and on and on. It had a beautiful view and we were able to use the kayaks, paddle boat, and life jackets... This place was just amazing and Cynthia was fast at responding and really nice."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is very comfortable and well appointed. The kitchen is well and thoughtfully stocked with all the things you need a little of and would rather not have to bring from home (spices, condiments, oil, shampoo etc). You have a great view of the lake and a convenient wooden path to a floating dock right on the lake. In October we didn’t try to fish or swim but we did kayak a little. There are many games to choose from for indoor entertainment."
2020-10-01,5,Group trip,We had a small weekend getaway for a sisters wedding. We enjoy ourself and the house was really beautiful! Cynthia is always available for any questions/concerns. She is an amazing host.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is awesome! We had a great time during our stay. There is a lot of fun lake things to do and this place is most accommodating with all of the fun lake stuff provided. We brought 2 boats and 2 pickup trucks-plenty of parking and plenty of space for lots of fun!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cynthia has thought of EVERYTHING you could possibly need and want in this cozy home. We made great memories!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cynthia’s Place was perfect for a weekend family trip! There was enough space for everyone and the kitchen was well stocked with cooking supplies. This area of the lake was very peaceful. Even though the house seems like it’s in a weird area, we felt safe. I definitely recommend staying here!"
2020-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The place is adorable with great amenities! We had no troubles with the location or the neighborhood. If traveling with little ones, I don’t believe we saw any child locks on the doors. Something to be aware of since you’re close to the lake. We appreciate Cynthia’s flexibility with being delayed trying to checkout. Max people allowed isn’t just for guests staying overnight, that includes visitors.
Overall the place was good."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing place to get away and relax! The house is beautifully decorated and stylish. The covered dock is great. We were out there all day fishing. I used the nice outdoor space and grill to bbq ribs. I stayed up very late both nights just to take in all the relaxation time in. There were little extras like the Keurig, a choice in wine, a snack basket, beach towels, extra fishing poles, that made the stay a bit more comfortable and special. Best Birthday weekend I’ve had in years!"
2020-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Looks can be deceiving! Like others have said, the surrounding neighborhood and structures will leave you concerned, but once you arrive at the Hideaway, it is absolutely quiet and peaceful! Owner has thought of all the little touches that make you feel at home, and the house is clean and tasteful! This place is a hidden gem and an incredible value!"
2020-08-01,5,Group trip,"This is a super well-appointed rental! Just pack some food and you're set; Cynthia has provided every other thing you may possibly need. Including a pedal boat, kayaks, and a Weber for grilling."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay at
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great Lake house, shoreline is great for fishing and quiet little neighborhood."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great family place! Plenty of room and games to play. We used the kayaks on the lake every morning!Don't let the neighborhood deter you. The house / lake area is great! Cynthia goes above and beyond! We hope to have the opportunity to stay there again in the future!
2020-08-01,2,Group trip,The host will stalk you on the cameras. Please be aware you are not allowed to drink in this home although there is a wine bottle pictures posted giving the misleading idea that it is allowed. The house and lake are beautiful but host is very uptight and does not allow any drinking or they will call the cops and make you drive home drunk.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice house and beautiful views. Private area and great water amenities. Cynthia is a great host and quickly responds to any needs or questions. Great family getaway!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cynthia’s place was perfect for my family! The place was very clean, had plenty of room, lake access, and a private dock. Cynthia left a some sweet snacks and cold water which was the cherry on top of an already perfect weekend! We will definitely be back."
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful little house, great for a family get away to the lake. House is well stocked with every amenity that you need. We didn’t get to use the paddle boat or the kayaks, but they looked really fun. Dock is great for fishing. Don’t be worried about the surrounding houses. We felt totally safe there. Not far from town in case you need anything. Would definitely rent again 👍🏻👍🏻"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This vacation was amazing. Cynthia is very responsive and provided so many amenities. We will definitely be staying here again. Love it!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place, very clean and was well represented by the description."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had an amazing stay at Cynthia’s hideaway at the lake. The home was very clean, fully furnished with everything we needed & was on a quiet part of the lake. The walkway to the dock seemed a bit steep at first glance, but our 2 kids (5 & under) and my two parents (67+) were able to walk down just fine. The bedroom setup worked great for our family & the rooms were very spacious! We loved that the home wasn’t cluttered and was very easy to walk through. We would definitely love to stay again in the future!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The place is very clean and well kept. The lake view is amazing. It is very cozy and plenty of space. The response from the host are very quick. Enjoyed my stay and plan to be back next year.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is a great get-away. The kayaks were awesome. I liked the extra things we found like bean bag toss. It was fun for 7 of us (although a bit tight at times) to spend some time away. While this place is a bit remote we would even return outside of a pandemic and social distancing requirements. One thing to be careful of- there are lots of loose dogs in the “neighborhood” and I did get “bit” by one of them. Thankfully it didn’t break the skin. Still an awesome stay.
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,"Very Nice place!! Very clean, updated and a place that felt very comfortable and homey!! Great views and a great dock to fish from. I would highly recommend this place to everyone.."
2020-06-01,5,Group trip,Amazing place for a getaway!
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Awesome place awesome host
2020-06-01,5,Group trip,Great place to get away! Beautiful house....loved the sunsets.
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a beautiful lakehouse that is exceptionally clean. The views from the lakehouse are beautiful for sunset watching. The home is well-appointed with a nice dock, kayaks, paddleboat, grill and outside seating. The inside is very nice farmhouse style and up-to-date. We especially liked the red/white/blue bunk room for our boys, the ""LED-lit"" bathroom faucet and wide open entry hallway. Owner is extremely responsive to any questions. A nice getaway right on the lake! Our first time at Lake Brownwood and we loved it!"
2020-05-01,5,Group trip,Amazing house with amazing views!! The dock is breathtaking around sun set time. We brought our boat and had no problem finding the boat ramp or the dock. This place is amazing
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our first time visting this area, and our expectations were exceeded. The location and amenities provided by our host were exactly what we needed for a little lake time!! Would definitely revisit if our schedules allow :)"
2020-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,Loved my stay at the lake. It was a great get away when social distancing took affect. Cynthia went above and beyond and was quick to answer when I wanted to extend my stay.
2020-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,House was perfect for a family get away. Beautifully decorated with supplies for just about everything you need. Dollar General and Bait shop within a mile of the home which made it great for quick pickups of things needed throughout the week. Townsfolk are all very pleasant. We had a blast fishing with our boys and the weather was fantastic. Not all the homes in the neighborhood are quite as nice as the hideaway but no issues with neighbors or anything. It was a quiet peaceful spring break vacation for my family and we’ll definitely be going back.
2020-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Hideaway at the lake is a gem tucked away. Do not let the entrance of this little neighborhood deter you. Once you make your way through to the home you will find pure bliss. Everything is just as pictured online. As soon as you walk in you will feel very welcomed. The home is cozy, the beds are all very comfortable, and the kitchen is equipped with all the utensils you would need. The distance to the water is just a short little walk and the patio area is very relaxing. We BBQ'd and enjoyed kayaking and fishing. You will not be let down staying at Hideaway at the Lake. I definitly recommend this property"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pleasant place to stay and relax. Lake house has all of the amenities you will need while staying, and they put a lot of thought in making it personal and cozy. Great host, and we recommend staying at their home!"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a lovely house in a sketch area. But no worries with anyone around. Roads to the home are rough.
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful sunsets on the water and a beautiful home with everything we needed

2019-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Everything looks identical to the pictures! We had such a nice time here with our kids over Christmas break!
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay at Lake Brownwood.
2019-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay here. The host was very responsive. The home was perfect for our family. Plenty of space for the kids to play and the kitchen amenities is top notch. All the dish wares, silverware’s, pots and pan, and cutlery to cook meals during our stay. We even used the grill to cook hamburgers one night and grilled chicken legs another night.
There’s a stationary wine opener and a Keurig, which was a huge plus.
The home is beautifully decorated to fit the theme of a Lakehouse.
The grandkids went fishing with grandpa and that alone made it all worth it.
The only negative is that the neighborhood is not as well kept as this house. Some of the surrounding homes looked abandoned. A true gem once you reach the house and open the doors. Not what you would expect from the looks of the neighborhood.
With that said, we felt very safe and really enjoyed our stay. We highly recommend. Loved!Loved!Loved!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Stayed here for a wedding in the area. Wonderful place, updated and very clean. William was friendly and responsive. Super easy check-in, comfortable beds. Not sure what else you can ask for!"

2024-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"It was a great place. I had a hard time spending $300 for one night and as little as we were there, but it was Very clean, nice and they were very friendly and accommodating. Very nice house and it served great purpose while visiting some family in time."

Full kitchen, large comfy living room with big (smart) TV, nice dining area, 3 rooms, laundry room and plenty of space. The master bedroom was perfect with a comfortable bed, great bathroom and a nice sized closet.
The back yard was large with plenty of privacy and space for our dog to roam. They also had games for the kids with corn hole, washers and more. The grill was nice although we didn’t use it this trip.
The amenities were really nice as the place came fully stocked with what you need. Soap, shampoo, shaving cream, coffee, coffee filters, dish detergent, laundry detergent, dishes/plates, silverware, etc. They had everything we needed!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jordan’ place is so cute and comfortable, contemporary decorations, great appliances, huge back porch and great hot tub! We went to this beautiful part of Texas to be close to the eclipse zone and this was just perfect! It was an easy drive to where we wanted to view the eclipse. Horses and goats on nearby properties, rolling hills and wild flowers everywhere we drove this time of year.
Jordan was proactively communicative, VERY nice and immediately responded to any questions we had.
The lake is very low on water, so you are not right on bigger lake water, but there is enough water right there that our daughter was able to catch some cute frogs (she immediately released them). It’s so pretty there- lots of trees, great view, and the perfect combination of easy to find but also set back from the main roads.
We highly recommend this home and Jordan!"

I'm a professional designer and was stunned by the level of thought and quality of furnishings and linens she put into the design. GORGEOUS, comfortable, luxurious. It's everything -- just book it and find out! Liz is SUCH an amazing host - one of the most kind and gracious hosts I've rented from. 10-star stay."

The house has been restored to perfection and very well furnished and outfitted with all the modern conveniences. It’s a relaxing space, too, except for the occasional hot rod zooming down Main Street. We all wished we could have stayed longer than a weekend. Central Texas has so many cool places to see, including the Harper House."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Harper House is absolutely stunning, it’s just like the photos. You can instantly tell how much time and effort Liz spent restoring the home, keeping as much from the original structure as possible, with new modern upgrades and decor. The home is perfect for medium to large gatherings with a very welcoming fenced in yard with ample seating. The home is located quite close to Brownwood’s downtown area, you technically could walk it, but it’s also about a three minute drive. I’d definitely recommend renting the home for your stay in town."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a beautiful old historical home in pristine condition. The host Paid very close attention to detail.. My wife and family. And I had a wonderful time.

2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The house was really neat as far as being built in the 1900’s. NO TV! We were ok with that because we were there for a funeral! If we would have been there for any other reason we would have been disappointed! There was road noise!

2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"The place was clean, air conditioning was great, vicki was great to communicate with. The only thing I can say was not great . The pictures shows it’s on the lake, it is but no water. The lake is filling up but nothing in this location, like the picture shown on the pictures. That was one of the reasons we booked it wax to fish out back. We did go Fourth of July weekend and lots of fireworks until 1:30 at night. We would come back though. The place was very clean. Thank you vicki for everything."

Overall the home is nicely decorated and had most things on hand that we needed. The master bed was not comfortable but we notified Vickie and hope that the problem will be resolved for the next guests.
The access to the lake is a bit difficult for my older mom. But Vickie had warned us of that so I'm not complaining. Just recognize what she meant now. There were chairs by the water to relax and enjoy. We were thankful for the relaxing weekend."

2021-07-01,4,Group trip,Place is pretty accurate according to the listing and a good amount of room to relax and spend some time there. Only thing is that the microwave may need a wipe down first and the paddle boat out back will need manual paddling.

2021-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The house was cute, location on the water, everything worked. Our only issue was that due to safety hazards, we did not use the dock or go near the retaining wall due to lack of maintenance and upkeep. This was very disappointing because we had rented a lakeside place in order to use watercraft at the rental and go swimming."
2021-06-01,4,Group trip,"There were a couple of interior doors that wouldnt quite close, but other than that we loved out stay at the cottage! We came right after a storm os the water was murky and the ground was muddy. Check the weather before you schedule if that's something that will bother you, but we didnt mind."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, relaxing and very well taken care off. We enjoyed our entire time in this beautiful location and will be making reservations again in the future. Everything you need is on site, the fishing was amazing and there's a lil store not far in the event you needed anything. We had such a great, relaxing, 3 day weekend and would of loved to stay longer. The sunsets over the water are absolutely beautiful from the backyard as well... And there's much more.... Thank you Vickie for providing a very memorable and unforgettable weekend."

2021-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Traveling to vickies place was alittle worrisome. The neighborhood getting there is what I mean by that. Once u get there it’s much better. Vickies place is a cozy little cottage right on the lake. The place is stocked with everything you might need. Fishing was good right from the back yard. The only downside is no WiFi or no tv, which vickies place tells you that so it’s not a surprise that’s just a suggestion to make it a 5 star. Overall it was clean and cozy and we would rent again. Thank you vickies place"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful location for a quiet getaway! Calm and quiet part of the lake. House had everything we needed from coffee to a fire pit! If you want to relax, fish, or maybe even swim away from the crowds, this place is great!"

2021-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Vickie’s place was outstanding and incredible value. Unfortunately, I had to leave early because of the Texas frozen storm that froze the water and shut off electricity. Vickie was gracious and worked with me as I had to change accommodations due to the disaster. I would stay again."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a perfect lake cottage for a peaceful getaway. We enjoyed the sweet touches throughout the house and the lovely view of the lake from the couch where we sipped our coffee and played Yahtzee. The Brownwood Lake State Park had excellent hiking!
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed for 4 nights and each day was beautiful. To the lake view and the sunrises, well worth the value."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,I highly recommend Vickie’s Place!! It’s really close to the water and our son caught a big catfish!! Having 2 bathrooms was also a plus. Vickie was always responsive when we had questions or needs. We stayed the week of thanksgiving and Vickie even let us add an extra day and checkout late. It was extremely clean!! I was surprised how comfortable the master bed was. We will definitely be back!!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Lakeside Cottage. Amenities were just as described, the home was super-comfortable and had everything we needed. We loved that it was in a quiet area of Lake Brownwood - setting was very tranquil. Vickie is very responsive and made check-in simple."

2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Vickie's place is exceptionally clean! The location is perfect and the view is fabulous. The value of this place can not be beat.

2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place for a family 8. We were all comfortable and Vickie provided everything we needed for the week and was happy to deliver more towels if we wanted.

2020-05-01,5,Group trip,This is a great little place! Me and the girls stayed the weekend and it was perfect. Vickie was super sweet and responds so fast!
2020-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a very nice time at this great little cottage! It was very relaxing and exactly as described. Such a great view and the sound of the water, makes for a lovely time away. Everything you need is right there. Note that the description says 'paddle boat' which in my head was thinking was a paddle board (SUP) but in fact is a pedal boat. All good either way, the water was too rough to go out and was nice to look at. Thank you for sharing your space with us Vicki!"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Excellent host! Beautiful house and lake view!!
2020-05-01,5,Group trip,The cabin was very nice! The decor was adorable and the small things around the house made the house very comfortable. All my guest loved it!
2020-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We live in Lubbock and due to Covid 19 we have been locked down and couldn’t wait to travel ! This was a great spot to unwind . Only thing I would recommend is putting plug covers on we have an 8 month old crawling in the great crawl space and her first thought was to touch the outlets ! Other then that it’s great there is a store down the street a red box at the dollar store to watch movies if you wanted beds were comfy . Overall it was nice and peaceful Thankyou !

2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute house with lots of room. Beautiful views and lots of amenities. Would love to come back!
2020-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Vicki is a host with integrity and I appreciate that in the uncertain days of the corona virus. It's shocking when you discover the inflexibility of some hosts and oh so reassuring when you discover the integrity of a host like Vicki. We very much enjoyed a peaceful stay at Vicki's simple lakeside cottage. The sunsets are beautiful from the back yard. We actually survived no Wifi! We enjoyed watching Vicki's stash of old movies. It was a peaceful, sweet getaway. We walked in the state park in the mornings and took our ski boat out on the lake in the afternoons using public boat ramps. We pretty much had the lake to ourselves during out stay and that was pretty sweet. Many Thanks, Vicki."
2020-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice place and location.
2020-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such amazing hospitality our family had an amazing time fishing till our heart content ♥ the house was extremely clean and had a breathtaking view only thing I disliked was no washer and dryer .... other than that it was amazing and we will most definitely be back ty so much Vickie 💗
2020-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Vickie has a beautiful home. She was very helpful and quick to respond if we had a question. The nice quiet atmosphere is exactly what we needed.
2020-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was a very peaceful place to relax. Hope to get to stay again!
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,👍
2020-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lakeside Cottage is a great place to forget why you’re so busy and worried all the time. Relax, and remember what it was like before the Internet, smartphones, and 24 hour news!
A great view, cozy cottage with everything you need, and great hosts too! Five star!"
2020-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location on the lake. Nice amenities. Very clean. Peaceful quiet surroundings.
Will definitely stay here again. Fireplace is a nice extra touch."
2020-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Super cute! We very much enjoyed the peace and quiet!
2020-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great lakeside stay.
2020-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great host, will stay here again!"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed one night,A nice spot on the lake. Budget friendly stay.
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place to stay for a weekend getaway. Only downside is that there is no Wi-Fi. Clean, and stylish."
2020-02-01,5,Group trip,"The house was super clean, the amenities were awesome, and the neighborhood was safe and quiet. Our experience was better than I expected and yours will be too!"
2020-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"This place was amazing with the best lakefront view. The place was decorated beautifully and had plenty of space with a full kitchen. Everything was clean. Head up if you have Verizon the signal is nonexistent; however, my sister had service with ATT and her phone had great signal. Other than that bring some DVDs to pass the time when not out and about or at the lake. Great place!"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Vickie's place was everything we needed for a quick stop to rest -- clean, quiet neighborhood, gorgeous lake views, and a big back yard for my pug to roam around! Stylish space, very clean, effortless check in. Thank you Vickie for a very comfortable place to rest!"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Communication was great. The place was perfect. Clean with all the extras to make the stay great. Many of the little things were provided to make the stay so much better. The place was much nicer than even I expected. three bedrooms with plenty of beds if someone had a bigger group. There were only 2 of us but we were able to have family over and visit as well as eat out by the lake. When we make our next trip down to visit family we will definitely try to rent this place again. They have only had this as an AirBnB for a short time but I am convinced that as soon as enough people find out about this diamond they will be charging more than the $75 per night that we paid. There was so much more value here than you would ever get at a hotel and you would pay much more for a hotel room. I just can't speak highly enough about this place!
2020-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Vickie’s place was wonderful! Right on the lake and such a great way to get away. The house was very clean, the beds were comfy, and we really enjoyed our stay."

2019-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lakeside Cottage is clean and cozy with everything you need for a comfortable stay. I especially loved the outdoor seating around the fire pit right by the water, and the view of the lake from inside."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Adorable place!! The pictures do not do it justice. We will be coming back again.
2019-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Clean cabin in a quiet place right on the lake!

2019-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,The lake house was a very cozy place to stay. Views of the lake were great. It was a very nice place to stay the night and hang with family!
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Vicki was a wonderful host. I am a licensed Realtor and I manage 20 or so properties all in Galveston. It was nice to see how other hosts treat their guests.
Vicki has all the little extras one would need.
You will need a hot spot to use WiFi and she does not have cable. The hot spot will be used to run the options she provides via the Roku TV. Vicki said she would update her description stating such.
The home itself is not down justice y the photos online. You truly are right on the lack. I think adding a photo of the lake, taken directly from the back door would help guests realize how nice this property is. It truly is right on the lake. My mother-in-law enjoyed fishing which was such a nice surprise.
The home is pet friendly as well. Our Chessie enjoyed the yard and felt very at home.
The home is about 10 minutes from Brownwood. Several restaurants are right outside of the community and within a minutes drive. A Dollar Store is also close by.
You would be doing yourself a favor by renting from Vicki. This lake property is perfect for your next vacation. You will not be disappointed."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very peaceful, private location. The only thing we ever heard were the birds...no street or highway noise. Only complaint is (early season) cocklburs in the yard. Had to pick a bunch off my dog, but she loved the place too."

2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"We enjoyed a family gathering here. This was a lovely stay, we even cooked a few dinners in the fire pit. We got to all be together and laugh about childhood memories & celebrate the good things in life for a few days. Hope we can all break away from the hustle and bustle meet up here again sometime, under happier circumstances (here to lay my dad to rest) Our stay was everything we hoped it would be & more. Good energy here."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best places we have ever stayed. It was absolutely wonderful. Great home, great location, great host, great stay. Highly recommend this to anyone that wants a place to get away or just needs a place to stay for a night or more. It is really nice. Jordan was very helpful and kind. He allowed us an early checkin even though we ended up getting there late. I think when you arrive your first thoughts will be WOW. Wonderful kitchen; well equipped, beautiful bedrooms and bathrooms. Very, very clean. It was such a comfortable place that it is really hard to describe, you just need to see for your self. Thank you Jordan."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a hidden gem, I almost don,t want to say how great it was. Not too far from town, but completely out in the country. Sitting on the back porch drinking coffee was so peaceful. We both hooked an alligator gar but neither of us were able to land him. Kayaking was so serene and just watching the turtles was fun. I will 100% come back here."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to get away at. Host had everything you need to fish the river and great places to try.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful time! The house was nice, the main bed was great, and the air beds were large and self-inflating. We loved the river and especially the kayaks. The only thing that was unexpected was that there were 5 RV spots on the property too. There were only 2 RVs when we were there, so it wasn’t too crowded, but it was a little less private than the pictures represented. I still list it as 5 stars and would highly recommend it to anyone! It was a nice, relaxing spot to spend a couple days."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Really beautiful house right off the river. Private, peaceful. A great place to unwind. I would highly recommend it and would definitely stay here again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay. The house is nice and accommodating inside. He left snacks on the counter, water in the fridge, coffee next to the coffee maker. In the bathroom he had mens and women’s soap and shampoo, makeup wipes, cotton balls along with the normal items. The bedroom is spacious with a king size bed. The river is just a short walk from the back door, so you can go fishing easily. He has a grill, fire pit and corn hole boards for your use. Definitely a great place to get away."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay if you want outdoors and quiet.. good place to build a fire and relax
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,It was nicer than it looked in the photos. Its a great place.

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just right
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is just cool. They’ve done a great job creating an affordable stay in an area that’s otherwise strangely expensive for small town Texas. Beats a hotel any day as having a kitchen and laundry facilities are included. I felt quite safe in the area. I am happy go lucky. There’s a little homeless activity but again it’s small town Texas and I felt for them far more than I’d be worried about them. A few cats came around which I fed and they kept to themselves otherwise. It all made it more enjoyable honestly. I got to feel like a local, which is what I like. It has a private feel to it though it’s a bit open aired. I can assure you this is a safe, well built, clean, & comfortable place to stay. They thought of just about everything from grilling, to corn hole, a gas fire pit, board games, & more. My only critique is actually a positive. The pictures don’t do it justice. I recommend having a professional photo the place to truly capture it’s esthetic and awesome outdoor space."

Thank you so much!!"

A covered patio to sit outside and enjoy the breeze. Tastefully decorated."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a repeat booking following our stay earlier this year. Lisa and Courtney again, were extremely welcoming and very responsive to any queries we had. They left us with an extremely clean and comfortable home, which made us feel like we were literally; at home.
Within 1/2 mile walking distance to Downtown, local restaurants/tap houses, shops and museums. There is a great coffee shop within 1/2 mile, Common Grounds Coffee. If you're into fitness; like I am, the local gyms (Anytime Fitness or Brownwood Fitness Centre) offer daily/weekly passes.
If you're feeling like chilling ""at home"" one night, Lisa and Courtney offer a very private communal area (between the two stations) with beautiful evening lighting and outside activities, a grill, romantic firepit table that we used to make smores with our little girl... and plenty of seating! It's very comfortable, and you can really appreciate the time and attention put into these vacation homes.
Will be booking again"

loud with playing music & people using the drive thru. I would never stay here
again."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything was great! Really appreciated snacks being available!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Homie and host were extremely nice
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice Host! If we are ever in Brownwood again, we will definitely stay here!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lisa & Courtney were perfect hosts when we arrived on this ""Rare Find"" that we came across on AirBnb, on a last minute search for accommodation in Brownwood. This accommodation did NOT disappoint! The space is very thoughtfully decorated with a subtle railroad theme, which is appropriate given its distance from the railroad museum. It is very warm and inviting from the moment you step in the door. It's a very easy walk to Downtown Brownwood and local coffee shop (Commonwealth Coffee). We were so impressed with this experience that we have already re-booked for another week. Thanks for being such amazing hosts!
p.s. I would like to thank y'all again for reaching out to return my husbands favourite shirt. That was extremely sweet of you to be in contact with us pretty quickly to make sure you caught us!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa is a great host, and this rental property is perfect. We felt right at home, and everything was as described on her post. Thank you Lisa for everything"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"This is a very nice, well cared for place. We were very comfortable and enjoyed the dock and nice back yard. We did not get a chance to use the kayaks or go on the lake as we were attending a conference at the 4H center. The location was not ideal, but the lake view and the trees were great."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is very nice and clean. Beds were super comfortable, plenty of towels and wash cloths. We had two trucks and bassboats so parking was a little tricky but we made it work with the help of Tiena! I would definitely recommend!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Tiena was an awesome host. The house was great, with plenty of room for folks. Cheers!"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,pictures are one of the most accurate I've seen in Airbnb. Nicely renovated home that is better decorated then any Airbnb I've used.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful and tons of space
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,Cute lake house with a great kitchen and all of the appliances and kitchen wares needed for at home dining. Patio is nice and two grills were available for use.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Everything was great. Plenty of space and nicely cleaned. There was a Christmas tree waiting for us decorated. Mattresses and pillows were ver comfortable. The only improvement I recommend is kitchen more kitchen hand towels and cloths available.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tiena was easy to work with and very accommodating. The house looked newly remodeled and had everything we needed. Tiena checked on us during the stay to make sure everything was going well. We'd rent this place again when we come back.
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"We came here with a big group for my wedding. Everything was perfect! The home wasn’t just your typical Airbnb. There were so many personal touches, Knick knacks, custom furniture, you name it! You could tell that Tiena loved the place and that her and her family enjoyed the house too! There is just something different when someone opens up their vacation home to you vs it being a business from the start! We had such a great time, and have 0 complaints! * keep your fellows over 6’2 downstairs tho*"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was just as described and a great place to spend time with family/friends. The beds were all pretty comfortable which is always a bonus. The kitchen was well stocked and cooking was pretty seamless. The dining table was plenty big enough for the 8 adults and 2 kids we had but wouldn’t fit much more than that. Internet was good enough to stream movies but the WiFi wasn’t great so we kept phones on cell mostly.
A few things to note that are not a negative to the host at all. The neighborhood is a little strange and neighbors the driveway is shared with don’t look thrilled to be next to a rental property but weren’t rude about it. There is also some sort of construction going on where I think they were in reverse for two days straight (beep beep beep).
And very sad that the lake is so low so we didn’t really get to enjoy that much. A cart to take stuff down to the water would be a great idea since it is so far down right now.
Overall would recommend!"
2023-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,House was great but not having a dock in water wasn’t too good but I knew this ahead of time
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Absoulutely beautiful and cozy home. Host was very responsive. The current heatwave and low lake level limited a lot of what we could do outside but home was filled with a lot of games and activites that we still were able to have a great time. House is located near the Marina. Thoroughly enjoyed out time and would love to stay again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lovely older home nicely updated and decorated. Nice amenities to enjoy outdoors and well equipped game room to occupy the kiddos.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Tiena helped us out greatly after an abrupt cancellation of our original plan in the area. Wonderful place to stay, beautiful kitchen. Beds are super comfy. Can’t say enough great things about it!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,A little tight to get in and out of. Parking was a little close. Next door neighbors were nice but very junky and trashy property
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"This place is bigger than the pictures attest too. We easily had 6 adults working in the kitchen with room to move. And the kitchen was well-stocked with serving bowls, storage bowls, spoons, etc. Plenty of chairs so 12 or more people could sit at one time. There was also room for multiple cars on the property if everyone drives in. If you want a vacation in a quiet environment, with lots of space for people to visit or get away by themselves, near a lake, this place is it."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was great! It was in a great location, the trees and lake are beautiful but our favorite thing is how unique it is decorated on the inside! Loved it! Tiena was fabulous to work with!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Worded perfectly for our families. Kids enjoyed the easy access to the lake.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Host very accommodating and personable.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The house was great. Everything we needed. Super clean. Comfy beds. Neighbors a little trashy. Parking challenging.
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,We had a great time at this house. Great setup!
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,Very spacious and clean house! We enjoyed our getaway.
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,Clean and a lot of room for our large group.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Good view of the lake. Very clean, updated older house with Wi-Fi and smart TV. We stayed between Christmas and New Year’s for a basketball tournament so didn’t get to enjoy the lake. Tienna was a great host."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay, very well stocked kitchen with pots, pans and just about everything you need for cooking and eating. Bedrooms were cosy and clean. Good yard for visiting with friends. Host was very helpful!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay over Thanksgiving. Thank you Tiena!
The kitchen was fully stocked, including every pot and pan one might need.
The place is super cute and comfy with plenty of space, and fun things to do indoors and out.
Check-in and check-out couldn't be easier."
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,Great place for family & friends
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This home was perfect for my family’s stay. The downstairs bedrooms worked exactly right for my grandmother and parents. The house was stocked with everything we needed. We enjoyed the large backyard and spent time out there as the weather was lovely. We would definitely stay here again.
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"We really liked how well stocked the house was from the kitchen to the laundry room. We also really liked the amenities like the kayaks and game room. The host is also very good at communication. The only negatives we experienced were the upstairs was a bit too warm for us on hot days and the the neighbor’s house is right next door which isn’t shown in the pictures. Overall, we loved our stay and would recommend it."
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"My college girlfriends and I stayed the weekend here we had a wonderful time! This is our second stay at this home and it’s such a nice, peaceful stay each time. There are plenty of beds and bathrooms to give everyone their space, and lots of hangout areas to chill throughout the day. The kitchen is stocked with anything you would need and the dining area is perfectly sized for meals and board games. There is plenty of parking for six vehicles, and we especially enjoyed early mornings by the lake sipping our coffee and chatting. All around a great stay. We’ll be back :)"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is absolutely adorable, is very spacious, has everything you need to set you and your family up for a successful getaway.
You want to cook, she has you covered. You want to chill and relax, she has you covered, you want to play games (indoor or outdoor), she has you covered. You want to have fun on the lake, she has you covered. She literally thought of everything!
We had a mixture of adults, teenagers, dogs,
married couples, single folks, and even an infant. This place has something for everyone.
Tiena’s reviews speak for themselves. Book with confidence. Her property is top notch, extremely cozy, clean, and the experience she provided was one we will never forget."
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"Everything was wonderful! Loved the view, enjoyed going on the dock and using the awesome kayaks. The house was clean and really pretty!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We rented Tiena's house during our time at the WTJGA (West Texas Junior Golf Association) for the championship invitation only tournament. We had a great time. The water was low but sometimes that is to be expected. Our stay was more about hanging out with our Grandson. We'll be back for sure..
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Home was great, we loved our stay. Plenty of space between the 5 bedrooms to ensure nobody had uncomfortable sleeping arrangements. The cost wasn’t bad at all for up to 10 people. The host was amazing, kept in good communication and ensured we didn’t need anything. Only downside is that we couldn’t use dock to fish or tie up boat because of water level for our trip. Not hosts fault at all, she even let us know we couldn’t ahead of time. I would recommend anyone stay there in the future."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place, very clean and organized. Tons of room for our whole family. Kids could get away to there own space when not in the water. Great view from dining room and back porch was a focal point to visit"
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"Great, comfortable, eclectically decorated guest home. Kitchen well-equipped."
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,This place is incredible!!! I have stayed in Air BnBs all over the US… by far my favorite!!!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a nice place to hand out with friends and family. Fishing off the dock was great we caught a good number of fish and some really big catfish. Kids had plenty of room to hang out. And we had fun in the boat on the lake. Definitely recommend staying here.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was great! Close to the lake and a perfect place for outlet kids to swim!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great space for a relaxing weekend.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed this house so much. The location was great for the guys fishing. The upstairs was perfect for the kiddos. The kitchen was stocked great. Cozy and comfy beds. I hope we get to back and visit again soon.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,Photos don’t do it justice- even better in person! So spacious and fits enough friends. Poker room was a bonus as well. The master bed/bath was great!
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,Has lots of the basic necessities as we needed! Great spot for gathering!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved staying here with our family! Tiena was very helpful and responded quickly to any questions we had. The house really nice and spacious. Had great wifi. I have zero complaints. Very thankful we found this place.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,You are going to love this 2 story lake house! There is room for 4 families to stay and play here! We went for Thanksgiving and it was great!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place and Tiena is an awesome host.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Tiena was a great host. She checked to make sure we were comfortable and had what we needed. She communicated ahead of time with check-in information and clear instructions. The house was perfect for a multi-generational family getaway. We had a great time relaxing on the back porch, fishing at the dock, and cooking in the well-stocked kitchen. The game room was a nice touch and housed several entertainment options (foosball, darts, poker, and cornhole boards). The house is well-maintained with thoughtful touches throughout. All in all, we had a very comfortable weekend and would stay here again."
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"This beautiful home was very accommodating, comfortable and relaxing. The host communication was excellent. We would most definitely stay there again."
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,Perfect! Just as advertised! We enjoyed our stay.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home was incredible and made for a perfect weekend on the lake! It had everything we needed and was great for a larger group. The beds were very comfortable and the upstairs was a perfect “kid zone”. The dock, kayaks and Lilly pad were the best part and the kids spent all day in the water and fishing. Could not recommend this house more!!!"
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,Very nice house! Lots of room and very clean!
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,"Perfect place for our girl’s weekend! It was easy to get in with the keypad, which was great since we all arrived at different times. We were shocked by the size of this house, it is much bigger than we anticipated. We had plenty of beds and space for everyone to stay. We didn’t end up using the canoes, but they had four available, which is great for fun on the lake. The house is in a quiet part of the lake with plenty of privacy. Would definitely stay again!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is great. Very clean and well stocked. Tiena was very quick to respond when booking and even sent a message shortly after we arrived to make sure everything was good with the house. Plenty of room for our group of ten. Beautifully decorated. We will definitely stay here again.
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"My family of 12 loved our time here! The photos don’t do it justice. There’s so much space and no one ever felt crowded. The movement through out the house gave everyone a place to go if they needed to unwind for a bit. But there was also room for us all to eat our meals together & play in the game areas. The home also comes well equipped! There were plenty of extra blankets, sheets, towels, board games, kitchen items, etc. and the laundry room was a bonus for all the lake activities we did. The best part is they’re pet friendly & our dogs had a blast, just like the rest of us. 100% recommend :)"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house is great. Lots of room. We liked the upstairs, a great place for the kids. Would definitely go back."
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,This place was a great spot. Very comfortable and large enough to sprawl out in.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This house is great with loads of space to spread out. Very clean and everything you’d need to have a comfy stay. There were 12 adults and two kids and it worked out perfect for sleeping with ample bathrooms. Awesome game room and dock for fishing. Kayaks for your use as well!
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,The pictures really don’t do this home justice! The home was so clean and it was so homey. This really is such a great place to stay whether you are with friends or family! There is so much room for everyone and the kitchen is perfect for all meals!
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"We booked this trip for a fun and relaxing weekend on the lake with friends. The house and location were perfect for what we needed. The house had everything we needed plus more and was very clean. We spent most of our time between the lake, game room and back porch, and were able to have a very relaxing time along with getting to visit and hangout as a group. It was a lot of fun and a great time. There was also great communication between us and Tiena and no questions went unanswered."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Awesome lake house, plenty of space and fun to have! We will use this one in the future again when going to visit this area!"
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,This house was amazing. Plenty of space for a large family or a few couples that want to get away for a few days. The house was clean and inviting. Will definitely want to stay there again in the future.
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,"We absolutely loved this bnb as a family of 6! Plenty of room and beds for each of us to be comfortable. Beds were huge and very nice, you don't feel like you're sinking in, like at most other places. dining room was a good size for us. The proximity to the water is unbeatable of course, we also really liked wild duck marina just down the street, both for sunset views (which you can just get on your back porch as well), dining (breakfast is really good here!), and fishing supplies.
The amenities are 10/10 and second to none. You have everything from hammocks (clean!), to kayaks, lily pads, dock lights for night fishing, and plenty of lounge chairs, and of course the indoor game room. Our dog loved the fenced in yard as well. Last but not lease, the check in and check out times are second to none - the most generous of any bnb we've stayed at by far.
The only con is the amount of bugs and mosquitos hanging around, just make sure you bring plenty of off spray. Also, the wifi is a bit spotty and slow. Good enough to just browse but I definitely wouldn't be working from here.
Also, if you come during wildflower season (may-ish), the drive to get here is phenomenal."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful place for a group/family getaway to the lake! Hostess is amazing and accommodations are great! The sunsets over the lake will sooth your soul. The furnishings and decor are much more than you’d expect at your typical lake house - and the game room, what fun! If you want a great weekend at the lake, this place can’t be beat. Add this one to your list of family adventures and you won’t be disappointed."
2021-04-01,5,Group trip,"Came into town for a guys golf trip, and this place couldn’t have been better. Not only was there more than enough room for 8 guys to hang out and sleep comfortably but the game room, dock, and fire pit provided a great space for all of us to hangout and enjoy each other’s company.
Would highly recommend this place for anyone looking to get a large group together and have a fun and relaxing time."
2021-04-01,5,Group trip,"A nice getaway for a group. Ample outdoor space, fenced in yard, and large fire pit. Road leading up to house has many potholes so drive carefully! Nice kitchen and propane grill -though we had to replace the tank after one use. Store in is about 15 minutes away so it was no problem. Check out Spirit of Texas Winery about 30 minutes away - bring a cooler of snacks and enjoy the wine tastings!"
2021-04-01,5,Group trip,"This place was so ouch more than expected and had everything you might need plus more, they have plenty of space to have a big get together and enjoy the space and not be cramped. I would recommend this if you have a big family. Plus having access to Lake Brownwood is so awesome and also there is Lake Proctor 1 hour away both places with great fish and beautiful scenery. Great place for kids to hang out and play in the backyard and they even have a fish cleaning station in the back by the dock. Definitely we will be repeat customers!!!"
2021-02-01,5,Group trip,You will fall in love with house! The amenities were amazing! Our group had a wonderful time and we look forward to our next trip. The host was exceptional and made sure we were comfortable.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,The cabin has everything you need to cook and have a good time. We happened to be snowed in but it was still wonderful.
2021-02-01,5,Group trip,"Very enjoyable venue for our family to spend time with each other. The fire pit was very popular.
The rooms and decor was perfect for a lake house."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best AirBNB’s I’ve ventured too! Definitely staying here again.
Place was very nicely located on the lake. The house had a unique touch to it and plenty roomy!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This lake house is so roomy, well appointed and has great amenities. The beds were fantastic (much better than a hotel), rooms were spacious, and our group had plenty of areas to spend time altogether or break up into family units."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place! The hospitality was amazing. They knew we were coming to have our Christmas with our new grandson. We arrived to Christmas lights hung in the trees. We had coordinated to bring our own Christmas tree but they had put a few decorations up throughout the house. The layout of the house is great. We had lots of family there so we could all be in one area opening gifts or we could “get away” from each other when needed because there were multiple rooms to hangout in. There are plenty of bedrooms/beds. And we never had a problem with bathroom availability. There are multiple TVs in the house. There are a multitude of cooking utensils/supplies. The kitchen was nice and open so several people could be in there at one time. We enjoyed spending time on the back porch also. I would definitely recommend this getaway.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Really cute lake house with lots of room and extras.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great lakefront property with amazing sunsets! Quick walk to the dock. The area is quiet and definitely a great place to get away and relax! We had a wonderful stay!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,So much space! We had everything we needed for a wonderful weekend!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Because the hostess did such a great job describing the place, everything was exactly as described and therefore met our needs and expectations. We loved that check-in was earlier than most places and hotels, and that check-out time was later at 3:00. The beds were all super comfy, and we loved the eclectic decorations and charming touches in every room. The upstairs is super cute and seems to go on forever. You would never guess from the outside that this house has so many rooms (including game room) and is two-story. Amenities galore, beautiful waterfront view and separate fenced yard were perfect for our 3 families. So fun!! You won’t regret staying here!!"
2020-10-01,5,Group trip,The place is just as described. People are friendly and the lake was outstanding.
2020-09-01,5,Group trip,"Don’t miss this great getaway - clean, cozy and comfortable! Great for a group of friends!!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a fantastic place! Cozy, yet spacious. Very functional. Very friendly and attentive host. We had a great time! Would love to stay again sometime!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"it was nice space, sparkiling clean and cool when we got there. Most definitely worth the trip."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Spacious home with plenty of room for two or three families with children to visit. Enjoy sitting outside with a nice breeze off the water watching the kids swim in the private cove or fish off the private dock. If you are looking for a private, low stress vacation rental, look no further!"
2020-08-01,5,Group trip,Tiena’s place was so cute and much bigger than we expected! We loved using the kayaks and place was very private! Tiena communicated very well with us and the place was stocked with everything we needed and more! We can’t wait to come back!
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,"Cute lake house! Enough space for a group of people to really enjoy it! We loved the kayaks, lily pad, and everything else that was provided to help us enjoy our lake stay.
The upstairs room cool of nicely, so no worries.
Would recommend!"
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,Pulled up to a very spacious and clean house. The property is right on the lake and had everything we needed for our weekend trip. 10/10 would book again.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Home is much larger than the pictures represent. Comfy spaces, great location, and all the right amenities. We felt right at home."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house is amazing and has every amenity we could have wanted. The lake view was beautiful and the owners were extremely helpful and available to answer any questions. The house was beautiful and my kids had a blast with their first kayak experience, we all had a blast and would stay every time if this home is available!!!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very comfy cozy!! The house, the yard, the dock and everything with it was amazing. Tiena is also very kind and helpful. Best one yet!!!!"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,The pictures don't do this place justice. It is an awesome property. Easy lake access that is very close to the public boat ramp. We swam in the cove and fished from the dock where we caught many fish. Everything about this place is great. The host Tiena was very friendly and helpful.
2020-05-01,5,Group trip,A clean house and great hospitality made for an even better stay on the lake. We really enjoyed our time here and can definitely see myself coming back.
2020-05-01,5,Group trip,My family has a wonderful stay! The property was clean and the beds were super comfortable. My boys enjoyed fishing off of the dock and using the fire pit in the evening. We had everything we needed for our stay on Lake Brownwood and Tiena was a fabulous host!
2020-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was amazing, great fishing and lake view! Very helpful! We had a great time and will definitely look to book again!"
2020-03-01,5,Group trip,"Wonderful place, right on the lake! Me and some friends stayed at this place for the weekend, and had a great time fishing and relaxing. The place is decorated super cute, and has all amenities needed for a great trip. We were able to pull our boat right up to the dock at the house which makes it super convenient for fishing or other outings. I will definitely be coming back again when it's warmer. If you are looking for a relaxing getaway, I highly recommend!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect setting for a family reunion. Quiet, private & beautiful. We spent a lot time on the dock fishing, swimming & just enjoying the scenery. Last day there we rescued a fallen baby bird that was about to drown in the lake, was able to save him & get him to the Bird rehab center in Abilene. What an adventure... just what we needed to get reacquainted 🙂 thank you"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great location on the lake with short drive into town. Beautiful house with comfortable beds on the lake. Plenty of outdoor seating and lounge chairs on back patio and boat dock. Conveniently located close to the public boat ramp. We grabbed dinner at Wild
Duck Marina across the lake. The food and atmosphere were good and fun. Thank you for accommodating us for a last minute lake trip!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Melissa was very attentive since the day I booked. She was more than welcoming. The house was beautiful better than what the pictures described. My family had such a great graduation weekend their. The stay was definitely worth it. House was very spacious and felt at home.
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Beautiful house on the water with a great view. The dock was great. Location was perfect right next to the boat launch ramp. Hope we are able to stay again sometime!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place!
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful property on the lake. Being just a few docks down from the boat ramp was super convenient.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Like other reviews have stated, the pictures don’t do this house justice. Especially the huge back patio with a grill, propane fire pit and perfect lake views. We really enjoyed our stay!"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"Absolutely beautiful, peaceful, and yet so much fun! A group of 10 friends stayed over for the weekend and it was the absolute best spot for friends to come together and gather by the fire while celebrating a wedding."
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Very accommodating host. Great stay!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Awesome place
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was very clean and would easily accommodate a large group. We were unable to get the internet to work. We contacted Melissa and she responded quickly. We were still unable to get it to work but we did not contact Melissa again. We didn’t have a lot of need for internet while visiting the lake anyway. Really enjoyed playing pool with our family.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The photos pale in comparison to actually seeing this place!
Fully equipped kitchen - the entire house is more than adequately equipped for everything. Melissa decorated for the Christmas holidays and even left a family sized danish to enjoy with our morning coffee. This is a charming lake house. We had a wonderful family holiday and will come visit again."

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Melissa’s house was at a great location on Lake Brownwood. The house was everything we wanted and more. Melissa was extremely nice and had great communication. Would book again!
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"This is the second time this summer,,, The place is more than she describes, clean and now they have tv , didn’t watch it much but football time is coming. People give this place a try , u won’t be disappointed,,,, we spent a lot of time on the big porch talking and sitting . We celebrated my Moms 91 birthday here , she loved it and from her that’s saying a lot . It was still a little hot but we caught fish , swam and made some great memories,,,, we will be back !!!! Y’all don’t take my place!!!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"This place is awesome, if you hate living out of a suit case while your away from home , you will love this place , a walk in closet for hanging clothes and shoes , dressers for everything else and more towels than you could ever dream of. The dock is awesome good for fishing (which my grandson caught a 5lb bass off of).
There isn’t anything that I could say negative about this place or Melissa ,,, she started off by leaving us a welcome gift of triple chocolate cupcakes ,,,, She is gonna spoil ya!!! We will be back again!!!"

Peaceful and relaxing are on the top of list, but hospitable and comfortable are right up there. Wildlife all round, beautiful scenery and an abundance outdoor activities for the whole family.
The house was perfect, warm and inviting. Kitchen was stocked with pots and pans and the grill worked great.
I will definitely stay here again if I venture to brownwood in the future."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jordan's little hideaway was a very private, cozy space. It was very clean, and Jordan was very responsive; I had trouble finding the place, but I messaged Jordan and he quickly responded and helped me find it - I was a couple of blocks away. I was not expecting to stay by myself when I arrived, but due to unforeseen circumstances, I did so, and was a little scared, not being from the area and not knowing what kind of area I was staying in. Everyone I interacted with in Brownwood during my stay, including Jordan, were super nice. Nowm being familiar with the place & the area, I would stay there again. Thank you, Jordan, for making your place feel very inviting. I enjoyed my stay."
