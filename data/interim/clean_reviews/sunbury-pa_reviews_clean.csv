The place was just the right size for us and very clean and nicely decorated with a river/fishing theme. The beds were comfortable and there was plenty of towels. Our time there was relaxing and peaceful. One small suggestion would be to have a dish rack for doing dishes. Thank you!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here after a day with the kids at Knoebels. We were tired and the 25 minute drive from the park was great. Check in was a breeze and the house was easy to find. We picked up pizza at Giugi’s (delicious!), watched a movie, and really enjoyed our quiet evening after a busy day at the amusement park. The house was super clean, cozy, and the perfect size for a family of 5. It’s very private and we walked down to the river in the morning. There is a small playground there and the kids played. Thank you!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great home in a very ideal location!
We came to central PA to visit family and were pleasantly surprised to find this rental home. Its location on the “island” was very ideal for us as it is close to many of the small towns. In addition, the home itself was very well-appointed with everything one would need to make a stay enjoyable. The decor was the best part though. Local pictures and works of art and antique replicas were displayed throughout the home which really added to the ambiance.
We look forward to staying here again!!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a really nice little house, in a very picturesque setting. It is literally less than 3 minutes to the Susquehanna River! It was exceptionally clean and the linens were great! There were lots of nice towels and the bed sheets were wonderful. The beds were super comfortable and that, along with the quiet neighborhood, helped us get a great night’s sleep!
Angelo might be the very best AirBnB host I have ever dealt with in terms of communication. He was so good about quickly answering questions. He obviously cares about the folks he hosts. Thank you!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The view is Beautiful! Kirk has done an amazing job with the outside space, giving guests so many different spots to enjoy the beautiful river view!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay here. Very relaxing to sit on the dock under the enclosure. The swing is nice too!
It may be a ""Tiny Home"" but these hosts really created an outdoor paradise in beautiful surroundings!
Our only regret is that we didnt have more time to spend here!
Great place, hopefully we'll be able to make it back for a longer stay!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kirk & Danielle’s Tiny Home exceeded our expectations. Not only was the home clean, the property itself is gorgeous. Having direct access to the Susquehanna River was ideal, plus the multiple outdoor areas (decks, docks, swing, etc) I really enjoyed drinking my coffee every morning on the dock with the screened in porch.
Would absolutely recommend!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for an autumn getaway and although it rained for half our trip, we still had a great time. The tiny house is cozy and has thoughtful amenities inside and out. Plenty of shops, wineries and breweries within a 20-minute drive and state parks nearby for fishing and hiking.
Kirk was responsive and unobtrusive during our trip and the place was spotless. You can’t top the river views - we were able to watch the sunrise from the bed. We hope to visit again soon!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay at the tiny house on the river and I just love it! Perfect hosts, perfect communication, perfectly clean & comfy little place with its own boat ramp. The only thing they could make this little place better would be if it was all mine!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"lovely little place, would stay again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This sweet and immaculate ""tiny house"" is all about its location on a stunning and pristine stretch of the Susquehanna River. There are six different ways of engaging with the river: a panoramic view from the bedroom, a comfortable patio just outside the kitchen, a small deck and cafe table directly overlooking the river from above, a porch swing on the perfect lawn a few feet back from the water, a stable dock with two lounge chairs, and a gravel boat launch hidden from direct view. With sunrise and moonrise happening across the water behind a small mountain ridge, and herons and ducks flying around, you couldn't ask for a more beautiful location. The house is simple and comfortably furnished, and feels very connected to the site. Very easy on/off the main road."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay at this beautiful spot!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute little place on the river - we loved our stay!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I wanted to have some time away with peaceful scenery and that is exactly what this lovely tiny house is! I wish I had stayed longer, but I will know next time. The host was wonderful with instructions and it was just what I needed. ☺️❤️"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first time at an Airbnb and Kirk definitely raised my initial expectations. Everything was organized, neat, and clean. The description matched the place and he provided the home with basically everything!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Flawless experience! Kirk’s friendly & helpful communication was much appreciated, and the space was exactly as described, if not better. Spotless, comfortable & cute, in an ideal location.
The tiny home on the river is so perfect for me that I booked another stay before I even left!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful view. Peaceful and quiet. Great location. Awesome host, very detailed instructions and good recommendations. Just an absolute gorgeous property on the water. Well worth every penny. Thank you for a much needed relaxing weekend."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kirk's place was even more charming than we expected. Everything was spotlessly clean. Kirk gave us a heads up about how tiny the place was, but it was everything my husband and I needed. There is plenty of outdoor space - a table with umbrella, outdoor couch and chairs on the patio, and a beautiful deck with table and two chairs by the river. My husband took one of the provided kayaks out for a paddle on the river. Kirk recommended a restaurant in Lewisburg (Gram's), where we had an amazing breakfast. Every time I contacted him, he as quick to respond."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This tiny home was the perfect getaway!
The owners did a fantastic job on designing this house and they had stocked it with everything you would need. The surrounding towns were beautiful to walk and explore and the local food was so good. Waking up on the river every morning was perfect and we really enjoyed staying in this cool tiny home!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I had a great time at Kirk’s place. This was our 3rd time here and we always love how peaceful and beautiful it is there. We loved the addition of the fishing pier!! We can’t wait until next time we can get away for a few days here!!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for kayaking.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kirk and Danielle’s place was by far one of the best Airbnb experiences my partner and I had. From the cleanliness of the place, to the well stocked kitchen, to the beautiful river views and the peaceful atmosphere, we really enjoyed our time here! Our favorite thing to do was sit by the dock and fish (we caught so many catfish!) whilst taking in the sun and view. The house also had a cute swing seat outside for when we didn’t want to be on the deck.
The only con is to make sure you put a lotttt of bug spray on!! My partner and I got a lot of mosquito bites but it was still worth it haha. Nevertheless, we are definitely thinking about coming back again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I only went for one night as we were on our way to New York. If I could give it more stars I would. Excellent place very clean, tidy and very quiet. It was exactly what we were looking for and more than expected. Thanks Kirt for the space and I hope to come back one day. Highly recommended."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The host was very responsive and helpful recommending places to go. The tiny house was cozy, spotless and modern with thoughtful decor. Perfect if you enjoy the river and relaxing outdoors. Absolutely loved it. Look forward to another visit!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a second excellent stay and even went into town to the Brasserie Louis for our honeymoon (we just got married 😊) and wanted to come back to this serene spot. Lovely stay again all around! We will be back!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay at Kirk’s tiny house. Loved the view and sitting outside in the morning watching all the boats on the river. Kayaks were fun. Would recommend and would stay here again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pictures don’t do this property justice. Can’t wait to come back. The hiking, hosts recommendations and the fishing off the kayaks was top notch. Would give 6 stars if I could."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Clean place with a very beautiful view
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was such a great place to unwind and relax! Very clean, beautiful views, great outdoor space from the dock, hanging by the fire pit and bbqing!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed in this little gem for a 3-day getaway. It was our first experience in a Tiny House and certainly won't be our last! The photos don't do the place justice- a lovely stay both inside (modern amenities, tidy, and functional) and outside (beautiful view, seating areas, fire pits, etc). We brought our two-person canoe and were able to be out in the water in minutes from the boat launch.
Kirk went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. Highly recommend!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our visit! The tiny home was exactly as pictured and the property was even more beautiful in person. We loved spending time on the lake and using the kayaks provided. It was the perfect peaceful summer getaway. Thank you Kirk!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for a couples get away !
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second visit, will go back again. The new deck overlooking the water is beautiful."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This tiny home was just as described. I loved it - compact, clean, neat, right at the river with a dock, kayaks and 2 fire pits. The beautiful weather was a bonus! Host was always responsive and accommodating."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The tiny house was exactly what my partner and I needed for a mini vacation. It was very clean and had great places to sit and relax outside. We loved having a dock to drink our coffee on and took the kayaks out everyday. It is small, but worked really well for us. It is off of a busy road, but you can’t beat being right on the river and it was very peaceful at night!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I had a lovely overnight stay at Kirk's tiny home. I was travelling from New York to Ohio on business and picked Kirk's place to break my journey mainly because of the availability of the kayaks. There could have been no better way to start my day than to take a dawn paddle up river and round the island, before embarking on my long drive to Cleveland. The kayak was in great shape and the setting is beautiful. The home itself is exactly as described – and perfect for one person or a couple. Some reviews have mentioned the bed being a bit small but I'm 6' and had a very comfortable night. The only downside for me was that there was a bit of noise from the highway but the riverside location more than made up for that."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful stay, absolutely beautiful and so relaxing. Wish we would have stayed longer. Lots of restaurants and cute downtown area, anything you really need within about 15 mins. Very cozy and clean."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We will be returning!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our experience at Kirk & Danielle’s Airbnb was absolutely wonderful. They were so nice, responsive and helpful. As for the Tiny House, It exceeded all our expectations. When we arrived we were at awe over the beauty and maintenance of this property.
Pictures don’t do it Justice. We had everything plus more; a comfortable bed, great amenities and super clean and beautiful surroundings outside as well. The private dock and the kayaks was my favorite! Morning coffee on the mini balcony while listening to the birds is a must."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location! Perfect for couples on a weekend getaway. We loved being right on the water and having access to the kayaks, grill, and fire pits"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect spot for relaxing trip. Place is tiny, but you want to spend most your time outside. Kayak in great shape, easy get in and out of river. Firepit was great and wood kept dry. Only thing is you can hear the traffic from rt 11, which I didn't mind. Definitely saving for future trips."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very small, but very much worth the price!
The was by itself in the corner of the property."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very beautiful view to wake up to and the kayaking was a plus! Despite it being so far away from things to do it’s very nice and cozy for 2 people
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The little house was perfect for our getaway weekend.
So peaceful and beautiful scenery. Loved the fact that is super close to Lewisburg and have have some favorite breweries to visit there and other restaurants.
Awesome waking up with the best view of the water :)
Kirk & Danielle were super friendly and gave us good suggestions for local places etc etc. Love the patio area and fire pit. Next time we book with them I have to bring my telescope because you can see every star in the sky. Too much light pollution where we live unfortunately. Lol Can’t wait to go back :)"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed my stay! I enjoyed sitting out looking at the water. It was a great tiny house experience!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the riverfront was exactly what we needed. From kayaking at sunrise, to walking the nearby town of Lewisburg, and all the attractions that Kirk and Danielle recommended. This truly was a trip that we will remember. The tiny house was an awsome experience, highly recommend!!!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The “tiny” house is quite a gem. My wife and I absolutely loved everything it had to offer. Kirk took care of everything so all we had to do was enjoy it.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was great and matched our expectations.
Kirk was responsive and we had a great time.
On a totally unrelated note, the river was extremely dirty and there was visible raw sewage in the river (and a lot of it)."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little house, perfect for two. Convenient location, 5 minutes from the Bucknell campus."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was just amazing! My husband and I took advantage of all that this home had to offer by kayaking along the river and building fires while looking at the stars. Check-in was easy and our hosts were quick to respond when needed! A perfect get away for some much needed rest and solitude.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I wanted a small house to spend time with my husband and I for two people. I found a house that was so perfect in front of the river. Tiny House is very clean and the location is very good. You can see that owner take care of inside and outside the house. It is a place where you can relax just by looking at the river. When I contacted the owner, he was immediately contacted, so it was convenient. While using Airbnb, there are some houses that have only good pictures, but this one is really recommended."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay here was perfect for the UnPaved cycling race weekend in Lewisburg in October. Kirk was highly responsive and accommodating. The place was very clean and well prepared.
The bed was comfortable and potentially a little short depending on your needs. I’m 6ft2 and had to sleep diagonally in the bed to ensure my feet didn’t hit the end of the bed. So if you’re planning to share the bed, consider the height as a factor here. Would recommend this place and will consider staying here again next year for the UnPaved race. Thanks Kirk!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cozy and convenient to Lewisburg, we had fun fishing from the dock, fire pit and grill were great too."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kirk and Danielle's tiny house is a perfect weekend getaway on the water. Fire pit, outdoor seating with a patio make this tiny house a cozy stay. We will be back!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The tiny home was serenely located on the river in a quiet strip of houses and tucked away easily accessible off of the highway. Thoughtful instructions/local guide provided by Kirk, mirrored the same thoughtfulness found throughout the tiny home itself. Well stocked efficient kitchen for cooking etc. everything you’d need for a delightful nighttime fire experience, or to cozy up on the dock with some coffee in the morning.
To add the cherry on top, it was easy to check in and our host communicated seamlessly. Would absolutely recommend, and will stay again if we happen to find ourselves in the area in the future."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed the fire pit and relaxing chairs by the river!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We truly enjoyed ourselves and will most definitely be booking again
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved the place and its locale on the river. We wished we could have stayed another day to spend on the river. Our host was extremely friendly and accommodating. The tiny home was VERY well designed, placed, and furnished. We loved the light and view from the abundant windows, which were well-covered by shades at night."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful spot right on the river! Perfect for two for a getaway. Kayaking on the river is lovely.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Easy to get to clean and very easy communication nice place don’t forget your fishing pole lol
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved the space. It was perfect for what we needed. If you’re into kayaking the views and just stunning. We definitely want to come back again :)
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place is better than the pictures. Very clean and cozy and the view is amazing.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Listing is truly accurate. Location is right off main highway and minutes to nearby Towns. We enjoyed our stay and will return.
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quaint, well planned trailer home with direct lake access. Needed getaway just for ourselves, and this was economical option. Host Kirk & family in house directly across lawn. Very friendly when briefly met while we took out canoes and he was preparing pontoon. Emailed instructions worked perfectly and recommended Gram's eatery for brunch was terrific. Lots of wood under water side of house for outside fire pit. Propane barbecue lights up right away and tools for BBQ hanging from side (right under cover). Pretty quiet/private area."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and peaceful place. We did not have to leave the house, it had everything we needed. The kayaking was so much fun, water is very clean. Also in a great area, the entire stay we didn’t even see anyone, very quiet."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A truly special place for a quick get away !.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The tiny home was 5 stars all the way! The inside of the home was very clean and well equipped. The outside area features a beautiful view of the river with several seating areas. Communication with the owner before and after our stay was prompt and efficient. There were no questions or concerns during our visit. We were happy with this Airbnb and would recommend it to anyone visiting the area!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent stay for a long weekend on the water, perfect! Hubby and I wanted waterfront, kayaking, swimming, relaxing and the lil house was perfect! Everything Kirk describes about the property is 100% accurate, but the views are even more beautiful in person! Everything you need is in this house. Extremely clean, and very simple setting if you want to cook you have everything you need inside or outside. Plenty to do within the area great options in Lewisburg (15 min) like Grams’s Eatery for breakfast, or shops on main st. home of Bucknell University or head to Bloomsburg (30 min) for Dinner at the Farmhouse or Brewery at Turkey Hill, and more shopping options on main st home of Bloomsburg University.
If you are looking for a getaway this place is perfect, and Kirk is an outstanding host, attentive to making your stay the most enjoyable!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kirk's listing is definitely a unique and memorable stay! I've stayed in plenty of AirBnBs that are renovated and nice, but there's nothing I love more than plenty of space outdoors to hang out and relax. I loved the patio and the dock! The included kayaks (plus paddles & life jackets) were an above-and-beyond host touch! Everything was tidy, clean, and just right for a short trip. Gorgeous views were also included!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Just what we needed for a quick trip to see our kid off to college!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was exactly as described the only down part would be the shower it was very inconsistent with the temperature but they were very helpful and the place was perfect for some away time. The water only goes to about 3 feet deep so not what I was expecting but still fun.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We visited with our 1 month old and had the perfect weekend getaway. The home and location exceeded our expectations. We enjoyed relaxing by the fire and grilling. We visited the Street of Shops which was neat. If you’re looking for restaurants, Grams Eatery, Skeeters BBQ and the Rusty Rail were all amazing. Grams Eatery had great gluten free food! We will likely stay at Kirk’s again :)"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful location and perfect accommodations. Clean, organized, and great host!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little house is great for a couple’s getaway. It’s modestly decorated, very clean, and right next to the river. The dock is perfect for watching the sun set!
The yard has some beautiful big trees, plenty of options for seating, and a nice size fire pit. We really appreciated the kindling, and DRY firewood!
Kirk, and his wife, make sure that you have everything you need for a pleasant stay. Check-in was super easy, and communication was great!
The only thing we struggled with was the length of the bed. I’m 5’7, and my boyfriend is 6’1, so if you’re tall you should keep that in mind. - That said, we hope to visit, again, in the fall! :)"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing! This place is perfect for a weekend getaway for 2. They have literally everything you need for cooking (electric griddle, single burner, small toaster oven, toaster and much more.) Outside you are well supplied with comfortable chairs, fire starting supplies, kayaks, canoe, life jackets, paddles, etc. Exactly what your looking for. Comfortable inside, air conditioner works great also! TV can rotate so that you can watch it from the bedroom if you want. Would reccomend this for any couple, amazing place!"
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,An amazingly beautiful site. Just what we needed for a couple days away from it all.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great lil spot for a getaway for a mature loving couple
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay in this tiny house!
This location on the river was absolutely beautiful. It was a great stay for just the two of us to check out a few breweries and come back to a comfortable waterfront stay. We thoroughly enjoyed the quiet evening around the fire as the sun set.
Providing the kayaks was a great bonus as well.
Also, breakfast at Gram’s was delicious. Thanks for the recommendation.
Hope to return again for a longer stay!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for everything
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great weekend getaway at Kirk’s place! It was true to the descriptions. The tiny house had everything we needed for the stay. Definitely bring bug sprays to use! Highly recommend.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful & relaxing. Cute house and close enough to parks.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the tiny house was incredible! The access to the river and kayaks were more than we could’ve asked for! The boat launch was a surprise and something we’ll keep in mind for next time. The different seating areas on the property were very inviting. We really enjoyed the fire pit and grill. The location is mostly private, however there are neighboring houses on either side the back is blocked by trees but the front of the house is wide open to the neighboring property, I’m assuming the owner. It was very quiet and we didn’t mind the highway noise at all. The house was mostly well stocked and the cleaning products were very useful to help keep the space tidy. The mattress is very comfortable, but the bed is rather small (a double). The shower temperature is very hard to control which was a little disappointing after spending so much time outside and needing a nice shower. The air conditioning kept the place very cool and when we had the chance to open all the bedroom windows it was amazing listening to the river and enjoying the breeze. We brought some yard games too and really enjoyed all the time outside and on the river. Highly recommend the tiny house by the river!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time enjoying this property. It is situated in a great spot where you can disconnect and plug into nature and the river but also enjoy the perks of being close to Lewisburg. We brought our canoe and used the kayaks at the house as well and even though the water level was lower due to dam repairs, we had a great time. The house was so clean and well stocked. Kirk was easy to communicate with and made it simple to check in. Great spot for couples or for couples and a small child or two!"
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The tiny house is so cute. Kirk was responsive and was very accommodating to us when we met in person. The river water level was low due to the dam being damaged, but we still managed to catch a few fish right from the property. As other reviewers mentioned, there is traffic & train noise which is very audible but that didn't take away from our ""glamping"" experience. Most things we needed was provided and the location is close to everything."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kirk’s tiny home was the perfect weekend getaway for our anniversary! The views of the river are beautiful, and the home is clean and cozy. We enjoyed relaxing by the fire pit at night, grilling dinner, and paddle boarding (brought our own, although they do provide two kayaks) the river. We even had an eagle fly right in front of us while relaxing in the yard! Fourth of July fireworks along the river properties were a nice bonus. All around, it was a great stay, and I’m sure we will be back some day!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing home! Close to everything. Between all the extras this house includes and the amazing river view, I was in awe the entire stay! I loved the fire pit and the view from the bedroom. Even sitting outside and looking up the stars at night gave me a great sense of peace. The hosts were great communicators. Can’t wait to stay again."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Prefect stay for husband and I with 9month old. Beautiful nature and has everything you need for your stay. Would come again.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect little getaway. Description very accurate. Very clean and cozy space for 2.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Tiny House is in a magical setting! It is clean, inviting and cozy inside, while spacious and pictoresque outside."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our second time here and we love it. The little extras that the hosts include and help with are great. Can’t wait till we come back again!!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This property was beautiful and a great getaway. The home has wonderful amenities and is close to shops and restaurants in nearby Lewisburg. I highly recommend this to others looking for a peaceful week or weekend.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was like a dream! Has all the little things you may need for your stay and the sleeping area was lovely!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cute house! Loved the location. Rained while we were here but the house had everything we needed. Would
Come again and loved fishing off the edge.
Kirk was super responsive and helpful. Perfect little get away!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"kirk's place was a nice weekend getaway, the view was beautiful along with good amenities. it was a great experience!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great tiny house in an incredibly beautiful location on the Susquehanna River! Very clean, well cared for. Three very nice outdoor seating areas. Despite being a tiny house, it did not feel like there was a lack of space. Outside, lots of bird activity on the river, including bald eagles who were regular features during our stay. As other reviewers have noted, you can hear the traffic at night — but that is solved easily with a pair of earplugs. Well worth it to enjoy this beautiful place!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful tiny home!! Gorgeous view of the river. Host was very responsive and helpful. We are hoping to come back in the summer.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were looking for a relaxing getaway. We found everything we were looking for and more! Quiet and peaceful retreat, beautiful scenery, close to so many things to do, yet secluded and private. The house was stocked with everything necessary! The owners but so much thought into what might be needed or would be wanted. It was perfect! We would love to come stay again!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Adorable house. Spotless and has everything you need. Loved it.
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Kirk and Danielle's tiny home by the river is indeed a beautiful retreat and get away for one or two people. It is just as it appears in the photos. The views from the windows in the bed area are incredible as many other reviewers have stated. We enjoyed sitting outside when the weather allowed as the river is beautiful and peaceful. The tiny home is situated next to the river. On the other side there is a major roadway and train track which you cross over . The road noise was audible at times but not a problem. Our visit took place in April and the river was too high & rough to use the kayaks. We may have to return for a Summer or Fall visit! This is a wonderful tiny home that feels spacious due to the way that Kirk and Danielle have designed the interior and exterior outdoor space.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very peaceful and beautiful place! My husband and I have a wonderful, unforgettable time! Will definitely be back soon. Highly recommended it! Thanks so much!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is so cozy & perfect for a little getaway! It does get cold so bring extra blankets & warm pajamas. All the necessary items were there plus some extras (firewood, games). Would go back in a heart beat!!!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cozy place with a great view! Had all necessities and great location.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything is as described. My boyfriend got to fish right off the property while I grilled dinner and it was a serene experience. I loved waking up and rolling up the blinds right from the bed to enjoy the view. Looking forward to going again in warmer months.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was amazing and beautiful. Everything for grilling and the camp fire was supplies. Definitely would visit again.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is the perfect house for a quiet weekend away for a single traveler or couple. It’s location along the river is great and we appreciated the proximity to Lewisburg. The house is exactly as described and fit a lot of helpful amenities in such a tiny house. We would not hesitate to stay here again.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The tiny home was perfect. I loved everything the house offered inside and out. The area is beautiful. It was so peaceful and relaxing. It was just what my girlfriend and I were looking for. The views are amazing. I can’t wait to come back and stay again. I highly recommend this place for a solo or a romantic getaway. There home offers all the basic items you need for cooking. There are several grocery stores and restaurants in the area.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super cute tiny home!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Host was always available for questions. The house is well insulated. While one night the outdoor temp was 55 degrees, inside was very comfortable with the baseboard on Low. Can’t wait to return."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a great beautiful location. The tiny house has all your needs and perfectly situated on the River property. Kirk was spot on with a response on a couple of needs for us. Beautiful sunrise and sunset! We would definitely stay again!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Would definitely stay again, it was perfect for a weekend getaway with my girlfriend!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location on the river! Perfect for a relaxing stay! The host communicates exceptionally well.
As other reviews have noted, you are close to the highway and train tracks, so expect to hear traffic and/or trains most of the time. Also, if you're taller, you might find the bed a little small. But if you want a beautiful location on the river, you cannot beat this place!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I booked a long weekend trip here as a gift for my fiancé to celebrate our anniversary. I definitely paid more than I had hoped for a 2 night stay however with it being october & probably a very popular time of year to visit, I feel lucky to have found this gem available! This was absolutely perfect for the two of us - the view is outstanding. We enjoyed our wine from Union Cellars (only about 15 min away!) as we sat by the fire pit overlooking the water. This was the most low key weekend and I wouldn’t have had it any other way! Kirk was extremely kind and welcoming as well. We truly enjoyed our stay & look forward to coming back again in the future. I highly recommend this spot if you want a simple, relaxing getaway."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,nice service
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A perfect spot for a relaxing getaway. Kirk was exceptionally communicative leading up to my stay. I was left with no questions. I'd gladly stay here again.

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great tiny home with a lot of outdoor space and great riverviews. The sunrise is a mustsee!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The tiny house is even better than imagined! It looks exactly like the pictures, although feels so much larger. There is plenty of space outside to relax, have your morning coffee, watch the birds. All the necessities are provided. As someone had mentioned in a previous review, there is a Weiss market about 10 minutes on route 15 where you can pick up a few groceries/beer/wine. If you want to grill, everything is provided in the house. There is a coffee maker, toaster, toaster oven if you want to stay in for breakfast. Having the dock and the kayaks was a real treat! My husband spent time fishing before we headed out to explore in the kayaks. We spent much time watching the birds. There are plenty of scenic places to explore in the area. The campus of Bucknell University is beautiful to drive through as is the Bucknell Golf Course. We found a great Italian restaurant ""Primavera"" on Route 45 which is right off of Route 15, only 10 minutes or so from the house. The fire pit was great! We enjoyed a glass of wine by the fire every night. The view from the bedroom was gorgeous! We very much enjoyed the beautiful colors of the sunrise. We also enjoyed the sunset later in the day. The Tiny House is a perfect spot, we will definitely be back. Thank you Kirk!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an amazing place, great location and just the perfect size. Great for a few day get away!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful view of the river in the morning! Property was in perfect condition when we arrived. Owner was super responsive to anything we needed or questions we had.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I would have given this 10 stars but it only allowed 5. A perfect getaway to unplug and recharge. Will definitely be back!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This tiny house is absolutely adorable. It’s cozy, clean and quaint. It has an amazing lake view, a great patio area and all the accommodations you need. It’s perfect for one or 2 people and I highly recommend!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay here. Very nice to have private dock and boat ramp. Good fishing on the river. Place was very clean and up to date. Almost everything you need provided right down to the small stuff. Some road noise from the highway but would still recommend a stay here!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place for a getaway! My husband and I had so much fun and it was so peaceful. Worth every penny!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, great host, great fun"

The house, the river, fireplace and all other small things. It’s a total package you wish for your getaway trip. Love to visit again!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The tiny house feels anything but. The yard and water access is picturesque and breathtaking from the bed. Danielle and Kirk are great hosts who made sure our trip was smooth and comfortable. So close to everything, yet feels like a getaway… we would absolutely come back for another stay."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little place. Stayed there as a long weekend getaway for our anniversary and it was just what we needed.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, great outdoor space, and close to the water! We enjoyed our little getaway."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The best place ever! Will be staying again
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"A Quaint Tiny Home.... Right on the River....
Provides what is needed for a time of simplicity. Does get noisy with everyone playing in the day. Very Clean, air conditioned, with the ability to open windows if a breeze is desired. Provides a coffee maker, toaster oven, griddle, mini fridge, microwave, outside grill, dishes. You may enjoy the outside patio, use the grill to prep a meal, have a fire in the fire ring, use the kyaks or raft to paddle around in the river, or just sit on the floating dock and enjoy watching everyone enjoy the water, the wildlife, and of course the sunsets. Pack simply, but bring some groceries with you. Coffee, creamer, breakfast foods, snacks, etc, if you dont plan on eating out the whole time. Lewisburg is about 10 minutes away and provides Weis Markets, with some neat places to visit. Some are on the the main strip called Market St. Others are slightly off Market St. Use your maps app to find attractions, shopping, and restaurants. Near Bucknell University."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The proximity to water is unbeatable! Great place to relax and have a great time. The Tiny House is cute and true to name when it comes to sleeping situation. We were 2 adults with an almost 2 year old, which may have been a stretch. It would have been perfect for a couple.
Their description is accurate in the listing and we had a great time. The place was super clean and easy to find. I miss the access to water already!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This tiny home was exactly what we needed for our 4th of July getaway.
The view is gorgeous and there are 2 kayaks and an inflatable boat with ores if you wanna spend some time on the river. There’s a private dock with chairs on the river as well which was great for taking in the view and watching fireworks from neighboring areas.
The house is flanked (not very closely) by other properties so not max privacy if all blinds are open. Only the river facing windows offer full privacy.
Kirk was very easy to reach and I think lives nearby should you need anything. He provided check in details well in advance and check in was very easy.
All in all we had a great stay and would go back/ recommend this tiny home."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,So lovely! This spot was everything we needed for a quick getaway. I definitely recommend staying longer if you can! The bed was comfortable and the view was incredible. Very quiet neighbors and over all tranquil experience. Definitely looking forward to visiting again. The river water was very calm and surprisingly warm! The dock area and patio area was great for your morning coffee. Sunsets and sunrises are stunning and you can see so many stars at night. Definitely bring things to grill because this place is perfect for it and the firepit was a great treat. Can't wait to come back.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"all excellent, we love this place!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My partner and I spent one night in this adorable home dreaming we could stay longer. The view from the bed was truly stunning, nearby downtown was ridiculously charming, and we got to see a river otter; so I’d say we had a wonderful time."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Niceeeee! Got way more than we expected. Great hospitality, beautiful place. Loved just being able to kick back , grill, use the fire pit, and enjoy the views. Definitely worth the drive."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute little spot. Very clean and great accommodations. Host gave great recommendations for nearby activities. Worth a visit!!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is great! A bed surrounded by windows overlooking a river was incredible. Sat on the dock for hours and watched an eagle fly around. Plenty of space around house to throw football and Frisbee. Highly recommend

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This tiny house has just enough to keep one comfortable with peaceful views. there is some nearby highway traffic and the occasional train, but nothing disruptive. Very easy drive to anything you may need from downtown Lewisburg shops to all the national chains you're used to.
Would stay again."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was perfect!! My love and I loved waking up to the beautiful view of the lake. Everything was clean and the little extras were perfect like having firewood available to the small bag of coffee. We can’t wait to come back!!

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful tiny home and definitely worth the cost, waking up with a view of the river is second to none. Only thing is to be ready to see some bugs/spiders as it gets buggy at night with the river being right there."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kirk’s place was very clean and special. If you’re looking for a place to unwind from your hectic fast city life or just if you want to spend a special time with your special person, this is a place to really take advantage of.

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Kirk’s tiny home, but never felted tiny. The house is very clean, cozy and well organized. The house was spacious for us (two people) than what I thought. I love it. They did provide us two kayaks and directions to nearest hiking place and brewery. This place is wonderful to the people who like to relax, chill and sip a wine while sitting next to the River bank. I would definitely visit this place again!"

2021-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Was pretty chilly and windy which definitely impacts how warm the house was able to get. Overall it is a beautiful view and lovely getaway for one or two people.

Thank you Andy and Melanie for hosting such a wonderful home!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect get away! Very clean and accommodating. They have the little things for their guests, first aid kit, river towels, coffee, etc... I rented this Airbnb for my cousin and I as we had a guided fishing trip scheduled. I was wanting the trip to be special and memorable as my cousin and I love to fish and don't get to spend much time together. This cabin helped complete the perfect week.
The area is great, close to town but also isolated just enough to chill out on the back porch and enjoy nature. We could not have chosen a better place to stay. You get more than what you pay for which is a rarity in today's world.
We got very lucky, and I was honored to be a guest of this host.

Having the wood stove inside and the fire pit outside was a treasured feeling of calm. This cabin has everything you need for a family or couples get away. Fully equipped kitchen, living room full of games and cozy blankets. Rooms are a nice size but have the calm cozy feeling. True treasured gem in PA."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home is quaint and situated on a beautiful piece of property. Photos are an accurate representation of the home and it was very clean and comfortable. Kitchen was well-organized and items were easy to fine. They had a nice coffee area with all needed amenities. Bathroom is spacious- only downside is the strong smell of sulphur, which owners note in their description and is due to water source. Wifi is speedy. They have a lovely covered deck with comfortable furniture. I really enjoyed sitting out in the morning and watching the creek and wildlife."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great time! The place was super clean and in a great location. We are already talking about going back soon.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was ideally located as we were visiting the local university, but in a very peaceful setting right on Penn’s creek.

Great host and a great stay!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was a steal for the price they charge. Porch and back yard was fantastic wood supplied for fire and fishing poles and kayaks. Crazy. Inside was nicely finished and perfect. Too much good to say about this place. Thank you for shari g it with us
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to stay for our visit to Knoebels (about 1/2 hr) and Dutch Wonderland (longer but doable!). The cabin is super cute and very clean! Sitting outside in the backyard along the creek was so peaceful and relaxing. When it was raining, the covered porch was just as nice. Hosts are very friendly, even checked on us when severe weather and tornado watches came through. I wish I would have planned a longer trip! We will definitely stay here again if we head back out that way!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"From start to finish it was truly a great experience. This was a quiet getaway for my son and I, only a few hour drive from our home. We felt like we were right at home nestled in this adorable and clean cabin. The hosts made everything so accessible and easy, they had everything you will need to function and enjoy. We mostly stayed on the property, taking full advantage of the beautiful and serene surroundings. My son was in the creek in the easily accessible kayaks every day. It was very close to everything you’d need(shops, restaurants etc) yet felt like you were tucked away in the middle of nowhere which gave the best of both worlds. Would highly recommend and would love to return and stay longer next time!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"No detail was overlooked! We were comfortable, safe, and enjoyed our stay very much."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a fantastic place to stay! We had a great time with our 3 teenage sons; swimming and kayaking in the river, Knoebels for 3 days and a huge Community Thrift Store. This home was extremely clean, beautifully decorated, and fully stocked with everything you could possibly need (which were so well organized and labeled)…all bedding, bath and bathing towels, 4 fishing rods and kayaks!! We want to go back. Loved every minute!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our time at Andy and Melanie’s place. We relaxed on the back porch and loved listening to the creek and watching the various wildlife. We saw cranes, ducks geese, deer. We were entertained by watching a mother duck coax her ducklings back down steam after their swim upstream. We were able to use the fire pit when it wasn’t storming or too hot. When it was too hot or humid we enjoyed the cozy air conditioned cabin. It seems like you are in a rural area at the cabin but it is just a few miles from Selingsgrove."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was great supper clean has everything u would need and even more the owners are supper sweet an helpful as well

2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great amenities. Little extras like microwave popcorn, oatmeal packets, spices and coffee. Cabinets each well marked as to contents.
Very welcoming hosts, stayed in readily available communication, although we.didn't need to make contact.
Cabin was tricky to find, we didn't see numbers on tree or house. Took a couple of passes to find it. I would recommend placing a rural mailbox or roadside post with 1806 on it in large reflective numbers at the entry driveway."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family had the best time at the cozy cabin! We fished all day and caught countless small mouth bass.

Wonderful hosts!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great little place with access to creek only feet away. Had a great time watching my teenage son and his friends reel in one smallmouth bass after another. Owners very responsive to any needs or questions.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A wonderful home away from home. Being right on the water was a dream for us. The cottage is a perfect place for quality family time. My family spent an entire day swimming, kayaking and fishing in the river and having a bonfire. The cottage is equipped with every need possible. Perfect place to rest and reset. Enjoying the daily wildlife of deer, geese, birds, chipmunks and jumping fish made for a great morning coffee entertainment.
The kitchen was fully equipped to cook meals. The owners provide fantastic games for the family to play. Lots of space to relax and unwind.
The local store Heimbach's is a great, I suggest ordering cupcakes. Delicious! A large chain grocery store is about 3 miles away.
For a cute afternoon activity we played putt putt near by at Susquehanna Sports Complex.
The cottage is located nicely near Knobels and Hershey Park. Off the beaten tourist path.
We truly enjoyed our time and plan to back."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying here was above and beyond my expectations! It was very affordable, comfortable & clean. Plus these guys really thought of everything... Everything was clearly labeled and easy to find. The kitchen was stocked with everything you could literally need. Having the kayaks and grill was nice. We even used the little stereo at one point and the board games. It was a nice place to stay and I definitely reccomend it for anyone. We were able to go to knobles two of the days and the rest of our time was fishing, cooking and relaxing!"

I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We just loved our stay at this cute cabin. A lot of thought went into the decor and amenities provided. Everything was labeled so you could find what you were looking for and put it back in the right place. The basket of goodies in the kitchen and the Keurig with the coffee was wonderful. We enjoyed sitting on the back porch watching the creek and the wildlife. We even saw an eagle one morning!

(The only flaw was the bed as it creaks for any little movement.) We went hiking in Raymond B Winter State Park and Shikellamy State Park, and we highly recommend both. We used the grill, fire pit, kayak, and the internet was great."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my most favorite Airbnb we have stayed thus far!! We already booked our next stay! Truly a home away from home. The creek is amazing, the location is so convenient, the home is so cozy, and the hosts are great too! Can’t wait to be back!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very clean place that matches the description and photos. Instructions were clear and Rodney responded to my notes promptly.
I was familiar with the area and wanted a place that was convenient to Rt. 15, clean, and at a reasonable price. This place fits the bill. One thing that surprised me was how quiet it was in the evening despite being just a few blocks off the strip."
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Nice size place. Slept wonderfully in the comfy bed. Gosh a newer couch would be really great. The one there was really pilly, super low and just run down. But overall, for the price, it really met my needs. Thanks very much."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean nice & felt rich at home. I am currently on a work traveling assignment the location was perfect very close to my job
Would highly recommend."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We've been to Rodney's Petite Suite 3 times (?) and it's fantastic. Clean, comfortable, and affordable - exactly what a couple needs. Also, this time I couldn't find an email and reached out to Rodney, he responded in 20 seconds! Located about 25 minutes from hiking and biking all the state lands, it's a perfect home base."
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,The rooms were a good size and close to shopping and restaurants. The kitchen had what was needed to fix meals.

2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"Everything was good except the air conditioner didn’t work. There were fans, but some nights were hot. Air conditioning should be taken off the amenities."
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very roomy and nice unit over all. It has all the extras you would like to see in every unit.
It would be greatly improved with a nicer couch and chair in the living room, but the ones available are serviceable. If you use a gps to help you find the way, you need to plug in Monroe Twp instead of Hummel Wharf which the gps does not recognize. My only hesitancy concerning the room is that the door leading to the unit next door has a keyed deadbolt but no bolt on the guest side to use to secure it or a way to secure the front door when inside the unit. The surrounding area is pleasant but I like to be able to secure the doors before retiring for the night."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to relax , it was very clean , and a wonderful Host!! 10/10 recommend !!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is larger than a “petite suite”! Very spacious and comfortable site. The location is central for the Sunbury-Selinsgrove area - close to anything you might need - restaurants, shopping, groceries, golfing etc. Very quiet and peaceful. I enjoyed coffee in the mornings on the outdoor patio by the pond. Host was very responsive - missing an ice cube tray & he had my need met in minutes! Great stay!"
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"I just stayed one night on my way to Virginia from Northern NY. Overall it was a good location, quiet, easy communication and no issues with check in or check out. Directions are super clear, and parking was good. There were clean towels with some miniature toiletries which I appreciated. Also netflix which was nice, I got to catch up on Stranger Things :)"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is easy to access from a main road with all the chain restaurants and stores. The State Park is only 12 minutes away with beautiful walking trails. The living room is huge with a small bedroom, kitchen, and bathroom. It was really good for my working week away. The wifi connection was good and Netflix was nice too! The owner is very responsive and easy to work with. I enjoyed my stay!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cozy and clean! Kitchen has all your basics covered - we even made cookies during our stay. Perfect for a close couple

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Petite Suite is kept in immaculate condition. It has all a couple needs in a place to stay. The bed is comfortable. Kitchen has microwave, oven, toaster, coffee maker. My only suggestion would be bring a chromecast or other portable streaming service of your own if you want live TV. This really is an excellent value."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location , large and clean and great amenities"
2021-05-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Definitely petite. It's a small apartment in the lower area of a house. You can easily hear the people in the rest of the house. It also didn't appear that high-touch areas were cleaned well. Nonetheless, close to many restaurants."
2021-04-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,Great value and location for a month long stay! I work as a travel nurse and it was exactly what I needed.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a cozy and comfortable place to stay in the Susquehanna Valley. The bed was the perfect firmness for me and I loved the size. This would be great for a single traveler, a couple or a family; it’s quite sizable and kids could camp out in the living room in sleeping bags. It’s got a comfortable living room with a great couch! I felt so relaxed. Beautiful neighborhood, and the koi pound was a nice touch as well. The full kitchen is there for cooking but the place is close to all the good restaurants and stores on Route 11-15 if you don’t want to cook. I really enjoyed my stay and look forward to returning."
2020-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Had an amazing stay with you. Your definitely a super host thanks so much for all your melp
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely an amazing place to stay! Very clean and cozy. Also a very convenient location with tons of restaurants and shopping nearby.

Definitely look forward to staying here in the future"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First of all, shout out to Rodney and amazing, fast communication in reserving his place. We were moving my daughter into Bucknell University, and in the midst of the pandemic, Bucknell changed orientation plans two times. I kept rescheduling, eventually canceled, then rebooked ...it's a long story, but Rodney was awesome and understanding through it all. We finally made it down to move in this week. The space was perfect for our needs... I actually think the bedroom and living room are bigger than they look in the pictures. The eat-in kitchen was great for the take out meals we picked up at the ends of two busy and stressful days. He is going to extra steps cleaning the place during the pandemic, and provided hand sanitizer. Easy check-in and quiet area. Cute pond and chairs in the yard... it was too hot to be outside but it's a charming touch. AC worked great on two August days in the high 80s. Overall, a great value and we'll be back again for sure!"

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We enjoyed staying at The Petite Suite. It’s conveniently located & had everything we needed.

2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We’ve stayed in many Airbnbs, but this has to be our favorite. The place was spotless and smelled lovely. The suite was spacious and modern; had a very “homey” touch! We enjoyed the smart TV and large couch for lounging and relaxing. The location was perfect; extremely close to everything, yet private. Rodney was a great host, he responded quickly to our messages. We enjoyed the area and the suite, would love to visit again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Karen is a thoughtful, gracious and very responsive host. There were pastries and cookies waiting for us and treats for our cat. A small cat bed was also there. Pets are very welcome and much is provided for them. The house was clean and stocked with necessities. The view of the Susquehanna river was beautiful. Very accessible by stairs. Our week there was as we hoped it would be, relaxing and decompressing. As an added bonus the property also comes with its own resident ground hog, “Chewy,” who would make his appearance in the afternoon to feast upon the clover."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was our second stay at Riverbreeze Cottage and we absolutely loved it! Absolutely gorgeous riverside location with a beautiful view of the river from the picture window in the living room. The cottage is so cozy and feels homey from the moment you step in the door! Highly recommend!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It is with a heavy heart I share my final review after spending the last several months staying at this fabulous house. Karen has been an amazing host and adds special touches to make sure you feel welcome. She is such a pet enthusiast, and your furry friends will have toys to keep them happy and a wonderful fenced in yard. I love the access to the River and was sad we never had the change to enjoy the firepit outside. The kitchen has pretty much everything you need and we appreciate the window units in the bedrooms so we can all sleep comfortably. It's been fabulous but after our son's graduation, I am not sure we'll be back to Lewisburg. But if we find our way there again, this will be our first choice for accommodations."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Another wonderful stay at Riverbreeze Cottage! Karen is so helpful and responsive, and the place is immaculate and cozy. My pup and I enjoyed playing in the large yard and catching some sun on the deck. And, the best part of all, watching the river run while sitting in one of the Adirondack chairs in the peace of the back yard. We will be back!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Second visit was as great as the first and will certainly be more.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This cottage was wonderful, it was clean, quiet and the view and surrounding area was beautiful! It is 5 minutes from Bucknell which was great for us.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed here several times in the last year while visiting our son at Bucknell. Our favorite spot place in the area and one is the best hosts we have experienced on Airbnb.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Karen was kind and responsive, the house was clean and charming, it matched the description perfectly and we felt right at home to have a nice, relaxing time! Our pup was welcomed and there were tons of treats and toys for her to play with. There’s not a lot to do in the area but that was ok since we were looking for a relaxing, low key weekend getaway and this place hit the spot!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Karen is a multitalented host, and she thought of EVERYTHING to make this a perfect stay! Our group included a variety of ages and a pet. We were all comfortable and had what we needed there to truly live and function for a week. It was easy to prepare meals in the well equipped kitchen, and the grill worked perfectly and was clean. We enjoyed meals together on the deck overlooking the river in a lush springtime setting. The decor was so fun and interesting, but never felt cluttered or overwhelming. The home was perfectly clean and in a great location for day trips in the area. We would happily stay there again. Thank you Karen!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great Host! Great Place!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Every room was nicely decorated and cozy so you feel like you are on vacation even if you don’t leave the house. Beautiful views of the river from inside and out with several cute towns near by.
The host was super responsive and there were meticulous “extras” like coffee pods , lots of towels, cozy throw blankets, and candles in the fire place."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Awesome rivers edge location. All the necessary amenities, and then some. Very generous host."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I took my wife here for her birthday. Karen went beyond expectations, having flowers, cupcakes, and a “Happy Birthday” balloon waiting on the kitchen table. Great setting along the River with song birds singing, even got to see a Bald Eagle fly by."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Karen is an amazing host. Friendly and very responsive (usually within minutes). I had high expectations going in given the reviews but in many instances I'd say they were exceeded. My 7 yr old loved it and didn't want to leave. My wife loved how she decorated. It was very peaceful and serene out by the water. Highly recommend if you're staying in the area. Next time we visit we'll stay here again.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Karen’s home was the perfect place for us while in Lewisburg. The setting along the river is beautiful and peaceful, and the home is comfortable, clean, with thoughtful touches that made us feel at home. The beds are comfortable, bathrooms nice and clean and the kitchen had everything we needed. The welcome snacks and breakfast supplies were much appreciated. Our dog was very happy here! Karen provides fun toys, a crate, dog bed, treats and supplies for the visiting pups.
We highly recommend staying here, and will not hesitate to book another stay if we are in the area again. Thank you Karen!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Karen is a super nice host, very friendly and fast responding. The house was beautiful, clean and had everything you need and more. The fenced yard part was amazing for our puppy so she could run around. We will be coming back for sure!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,i rent places on airbnb all the time...Karen's house was the nicest house I've ever seen in America
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Karen was extremely hospitable & friendly. The welcome touches of cookies, muffins, eggs and snacks were very thoughtful. I also appreciated that Karen made up the sofa bed for me in advance as our senior dog wasn't able to make the stairs upstairs.
The house was extremely charming and had a wonderful view of the river and looked even more lovely when it snowed. It was very clean and eclectically decorated which we loved!
You can tell that Karen is a dog lover as she had very thoughtfully left poop bags, a crate, bowls and a towel for our use for the pups. Also having an area for the pups to potty was extremely helpful.
We have stayed at other dog friendly properties, but none as dog friendly as Karen's home.
Thank you so much!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We are local and needed a place to stay in a pinch. Karen was understanding and wonderful! The home was beautiful, had fantastic views, and was stocked up with some coffee and snacks. What more could you ask for? Would recommend!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"So happy we found this place! We had a wonderful quick weekend away with our pups. The home is cozy, comfortable, with lots of space. Even though it was winter and there was snow on the ground, we still enjoyed having the river right outside the door. Especially in the morning watching the sun come up was beautiful with the snow on the ground. The host is more than accommodating and makes your stay there a special experience, even for our dogs. We especially loved the fenced in yard since it was cold out!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"NOT JUST A RIVER VIEW—but right on the Susquehanna. There is even
a windowed spot with a comfortable chair and binoculars. There was a beautiful snow when we visited and was stunning.
In very cold weather, first floor was chilly so flannel and sweaters help.
Historic yet has a lovely modern kitchen and bathrooms, and dog/cat-friendly comforts!
We love antiques. This area is extraordinary that way!
Karen was very responsive and upbeat. Much appreciated!"
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Karen’s home is a beautiful place to unwind and relax. With the breeze of the river and the heat from the fire it was a perfect place to reset. The house has everything you may need to cook and eat comfortably. Makes you feel right at home with all the special touches for us and our puppy.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"After a 6+ hour drive with three dogs in the wind and rain, arriving at the house was sweet solace! It was even cozier than in the pictures, and so heartening to see how accommodating the space was for people traveling with pets. Karen was super helpful in making sure I got in okay, and the space was clearly curated with TLC. I wish I needed to be in the area longer, but I certainly hope to return in the future!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Riverbreeze Cottage felt like home from the moment I stepped inside! The river views were absolutely breathtaking, especially at sunrise. All the little touches have been thought of to make you feel warm and welcomed - from home baked cookies waiting in the kitchen to a pair of binoculars in front of the picture window in the living room for bird watching. Truly one of the best rental experiences I've had...so much so that I turned around and booked it again for a summer trip! Highly recommended for a peaceful getaway or even a small family reunion. It's an unforgettable place."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at River Breeze Cottage and it definitely won’t be our last. The home is the perfect location for visiting our daughter at college. We enjoyed the beautiful view of the water and this visit we made dinner here instead of going out. The kitchen was clean, organized and had everything we needed.
The home is pet friendly and we brought our dog this visit. Because pets aren’t allowed on the furniture or beds, there were no doggie odors in the house. Our dog enjoyed the fenced in area and it was nice sitting on the porch with him.
We honestly couldn’t have had a more enjoyable and relaxing weekend getaway. We’d rather stay here than any of the local hotels. It feels like you’re home!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a beautiful, memorable stay at Karen’s oasis on the Susquehanna. The space exceeded our expectations; the photos on the listing don’t even do it justice! Karen was lovely and easy to deal with; she left us everything we needed for our stay (along with some extra touches like treats and snacks everywhere we looked), she was friendly and communicative throughout, and the house (and deck, yard, fire pit, view, river access, birds, stars!) kind of blew us away. Our dogs loved it and didn’t want to leave! The fenced portion of the expansive yard area was great for letting the dogs out at bedtime. The location was ideal for our outings to Lewisburg, Selinsgrove, Sunbury, Mifflinburg - right off 15 but you’d never know it when you pull up to the house. We can’t wait to return!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We love this place. It totally exceeded expectations - both for location and for Karen who is just wonderful. I love the proximity to the river and the ability to launch our kayak from the backyard. The kitchen had every single thing that I needed as did the rest of the house. Having three dogs can make it difficult to travel and she was so wonderful and welcoming. Our dogs just loved all the toys and treats - perfect vacation for them.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Anything and everything you could possibly want for a comfortable stay was available. Karen was proactive, and responsive, leaving clear and simple instructions for enjoying her cute cottage on the river. Her home is exactly as pictured on the site, and the grounds are lovely, quiet and peaceful. The pictures really don't do justice to the experience. Our dog was made comfortable, also, and enjoyed the crate, bed, and treats provided.
It was a short drive to historic Lewisburg, where there were plenty of restaurants, shops, and things to do nearby. Karen's attention to detail is apparent everywhere, and we couldn't imagine having had a finer first Airbnb vacation!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,She is sweet person and her house is cozy
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Karen’s home was a gem. We stayed for several days and she went above and beyond to accommodate my family. The home was stocked with everything we could ever need, which was so lovely. Best AirBnB experience we have ever had!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Thank you Karen for a wonderful stay at Riverbreeze!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay at River Breeze! The goal of our trip was to relax and Karen’s place was the perfect choice. Beautiful yard with a gorgeous view of the river.

We will definitely be returning!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The River breeze Cottage was beautifully kept. This was a perfect family get away with an at home feel. We plan on booking again next summer.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,What a wonderful homey place to stay w our dogs! Place is a lot bigger than the pictures make it seem. The fenced in front yard is a god-send.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"from the minute we arrived everything was great. From checkin to checkout was what we needed.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Can't tell you enough, how wonderful our stay was. If you are looking to escape the world and simply relax, this is thr place. Not only were we happy, my dog was elated as well with the special perks for the pups.
Being by the water brings you peace, and this wonderful home ensures this. Karen is prompt and wonderful, with communicating."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved staying at Karen’s comfy river cottage while visiting family. Her decorations, dog toys/supplies, kid friendly spaces, welcome goodies, and local recommendations were thoughtfully put together. We particularly enjoyed the fire pit which was perfect for cool summer nights and the gorgeous scenery perfect for enjoying a morning coffee. Our dogs enjoyed cooling off in the river, roaming the outside space, and relaxing on the dog beds provided. We would stay in Karen’s place again and would highly recommend if you’re visiting Lewisburg/Milton/Sunbury area!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Karen was a fantastic host for our weekend stay for a local wedding. We loved the solitude of this vacation rental. Everything one would need and much more were found at this rental. We loved sitting in the river early Friday night in our water chairs enjoying an adult beverage and watching the jet skis go by and the beautiful reflection of the trees and clouds in the clear water. We also loved the fire pit area. Wish we could have spent more time at the rental, but it definitely was a wonderful stay with a beyond wonderful host."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very quiet and peaceful area for relaxing. Perfect for my dog to enjoy the yard with the fenced in area and convenient quiet, low traffic street to walk down. We enjoyed the gestures that made it feel more like home- eggs in the fridge, coffee bar & snacks (including treats for our dog!) and extra little supplies (doggy bags, dog beds, gate to block the stairs). We loved the enclosed porch area for meals with a view. We enjoyed the chairs outside to watch the fishing boats and loved the binoculars for checking out the wildlife on the other side! We saw deer, groundhogs (…we think?), tons of birds, and river snakes. Karen was very accommodating and responds quickly! We will definitely be staying here again in the future - it’s very hard to find places like Karen’s that are so accommodating and peaceful for dogs!! Highly recommend for a quiet get away."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was lovely and would be happy to stay in the future!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We only stayed 1 night but the house was perfect. very clean and comfortable. We loved all the extra things there for our dog like the cage, treats, toys, beds, etc. Being right on the lake was so peaceful. Definitely recommend booking here! Thanks Karen for a lovely stay 😊"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was by far the best AirBnB experience we’ve had! We love that a proceed of what we paid gets donated to best friends. We will be back next year!

The view is lovely and the amenities are generous. Sorry this is not on a more common travel route for us, or we'd certainly stay again! Recommended!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Fabulous waterfront location with expansive views of the Susquehanna River. Charming home with a cottage feel with “fun” decor. Dog friendly with a side fenced yard that my two Standard Poodles enjoyed immensely. In addition, upon arrival, Karen not only left yummy people treats but doggie treats and toys!!! You will feel comfortable and relaxed as you sit by the large picture window in the sitting room and gaze at the river which you are almost able to plunk up in your hand. Karen and her rental are a true delight!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay at this lovely home! The house itself is comfortable, well appointed, and is full of everything you could need. Beautiful location on the river. We sat is the Adirondack chairs in the backyard looking at the boats drive by. It was so peaceful. Karen is also an amazing host, ensuring we arrived safely and had what we needed. We even decided to stay an extra night!
Thank you for everything- we loved it!! Lisa Hoey"

The kitchen was well-equipped and there were plenty of opportunities to sit and relax and take in the view from inside and out. We appreciated the fresh flowers and the basket of snacks. The fridge even held eggs, English muffins, jam, and butter for breakfast! We felt so at home, and very pampered, and will definitely return to this sweet spot again."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Me, my husband and pup stayed here for a week and it was perfect for us. I worked remotely for part of the time and the internet worked great. We used it as a base camp for some biking in the area. Thanks for a great stay!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Clean and quaint cottage with gorgeous river views. We enjoyed being able to bring our dogs and were impressed with the whole experience. The host was kind, responsive and so easy to communicate without before and during our stay. We will be back!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"If you’re even remotely considering a stay here, JUST BOOK IT! First of all, Karen is such an amazing and responsive host! She thought of absolutely everything and even provided treats upon our arrival plus necessities in the fridge, and even little toys for our kitties, which they loved! She also went out of her way to help us with our particular situation while we were getting our RV serviced in the area. The home was spotless and absolutely adorable, and the views just absolutely breathtaking. It felt so peaceful from the moment of arrival until we left. We even got to see an incredible view of the bald eagle preening and enjoying the breeze the day after we arrived! What a treat! This has definitely been one of our favorite Airbnb stays so far. If we ever need another stay in this area, Karen’s place will undoubtedly be our first choice!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Looks just like the pictures and has everything you would need. Karen was very helpful and responsive. My dog had lots of fun playing in the river and fenced in area. Hoping to come back in the summer.

Everything was perfect and well stocked. Karen was so nice and easy to communicate with. We plan on returning for future travels.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely cottage, and easily the most dog-friendly place we have rented. Our 15 year old dog was right at home, and the fenced in yard really made everything stress free. The river was of course beautiful, we could have spent the entire time enjoying the view. But, Karen made us a helpful list of places to visit in the area, so we did some exploring as well.
The place was clean and well-stocked. We arrived late and were worried about breakfast the next morning but there was muffins, coffee, and eggs so we were set!
This is the perfect place for a quiet, stress free weekend on the river, especially if you have a dog. Lewisburg had a surprising number of shops and restaurants to help spend your time."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Charming house right on the river. very clean & cozy. Can't wait to go back.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Karen was extremely responsive in making arrangements. The home was cozily lit, and decorated with imagination around coastal themes. Lots of character. Plenty of sitting rooms for gathering. Thoughtful additions from soothing sound machines available by each bed to binoculars for bird spotting. Lovely seating area with large glass window to look out large back window on river. Very well equipped kitchen with all utensils and pots. Home cozy warm in winter. Good value especially if multiple guests in multiple rooms—a whole house!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonderful time at Karen's home. It was very clean and the layout was great. Karen was very responsive to all our questions. She's a pleasure to deal with. I hope we get the opportunity to stay here again. We really loved it!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful place on the river. Great host. Everything was as described and a great deal. Will only stay here when we come back. Home away from home. Thank you Karen
Fran , Danielle and the voices"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It felt like home from the moment we walked in. Karen set out cookies for me, and treats and water for my dog! The river view was peaceful and beautiful - a perfect getaway. The house was very clean, comfortable and had everything we needed, including a dog bed (which Stella loved!), dog dishes, full kitchen, coffee and snacks. Karen was very communicative and quick to respond. I will be going back very soon - already booked a second stay!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My family of 4 including a small dog loved in the house for 5 days in February 2023. The house makes us feel at home. Karen is very considerate and responsive.
All of us including our dog are very happy with the stay.
Thanks Karen .
Peter"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This riverfront cottage property is AMAZING! It was our first time traveling with our dogs, and we couldn't have felt more at home! I even have some of the same decor! The host, Karen, was so polite and accommodating, which we greatly appreciated. We certainly recommend this adorable little spot on the water and plan to stay again in the future! Thank you for a wonderful stay!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Karen's place was everything and more than most other listings. Beautiful place and she is one of the best host! All the added smalls for us and our service dogs were so greatly appreciated.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We LOVED our brief stopover on our drive back home to Chicago after visiting family in NY. Traveling with a toddler, baby, and dog is always a challenge, but it was so much easier with so many thoughtful extras.
When we arrived, the lights outside and inside were lit for us - what a lovely welcome! We were greeted to a cute set up for our pup and an inviting decor style that immediately made the stress of the day disappear. The kitchen had a coffee bar, snacks, oatmeal, and even a plate of cookies - YUM! A pack and play was set up also - thank you! So many thoughtful amenities and touches - our only regret was not staying longer.
For folks traveling with young children and small/older dogs:
- There is a fair walk from parking to door; you may wish to bring a wagon to help with load in/out.
- The wooden stairs are slippery and gap in railing which could pose a fall risk. Our toddler tumbled while being supervised and being super careful - take extra care and use the gate!"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Karen's home was perfect for us and what we were looking for. The minute you walk in you feel like your at home. She had even made homemade cookies and left dog treats for our pups. The kitchen is set up so perfectly. She has put alot of effort into making sure that her house guests have the best experience possible. Our 12 year old golden retriever also enjoyed this weekend very much. The location of her home on the river is magnificent and very private. She was one of the best hosts that we have ever interacted with. I loved her place and working with her. She is a great communicator and very flexible. Thank you Karen!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This has been my favorite weekend trip yet! Karen was responsive and friendly, a superior host that cares about her guests and wants them to feel comfortable! The river views were beautiful. Hubby and I went for a weekend fishing trip and caught some small mouth bass nearby. Definitely recommend for couples, families or friend gatherings. There’s tons of restaurant options nearby and things to do. Karen’s cottage is absolutely gorgeous and was spotless. We felt right at home. We will definitely return!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It was honestly insane how little we paid for our stay for such a large/luxurious place on the riverside. My partner and I were blown away. The amenities even for the dogs were amazing. I only stayed one night but I really wish I had stayed longer. This is the coziest airbnb I’ve been in at this price point. If you’re traveling with dogs, I recommend this cottage. The whole experience start to finish went stress free. A+"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Wonderfully decorated for Christmas. Very confortable with all needs inticipated and provided for. Communications with Karen wrer great. Could not have been more pleased.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This airbnb was more than I hoped for! The night I arrived was a full moon & its reflection on the river was awesome and the sunrise the next morning was beautiful as well. Loved the coastal theme throughout the house … lots to see & discover! I appreciated the Christmas tree & decorations so much. Karen’s house was very clean with nice kitchen, dishes, pans, even the oven was spotless. But I was most impressed by what she provided for your pet. A crate, bowls, treats, doggie bags, fluffy dog bed & toys! She has a very caring heart & that made all so easy. I enjoyed the plate of cookies she left. Great communication! Thank you for hosting!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We loved our stay at Karen’s place. The home was beautiful and very homey. The location was private but not to far from conveniences.

Hopefully longer next time so I can enjoy the outdoor fire pit !"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was an awesome experience! From the location to the communication with Karen to all of the nice touches that she provided. The house is in a great spot just on the river. Close to Lewisburg so you can drive there for enjoying the town and having a meal. Plenty of yard space for our dog to run around! Check-in was easy. Karen was always responsive when it came to questions and the fact that she baked us a plate of cookies as well as had treats for our pup when we arrived. I don't think I've ever had the pleasure of dealing with a more thorough, professional and accommodating host! Definitely book this place!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful and relaxing time at Karen's' adorable cottage. Being on the river was a definitely a bonus and contributed to the relaxing time. You can hear the street noise while outside but it really wasn't a problem for us. The house was clean, comfortable, and quirky in the best way, with many extra's which felt welcoming and helped while arriving late. Karen was very helpful and easy to reach. She made the house very doggie friendly which made traveling with out 15 yr old pup so much easier than usual with a fenced in dog area, dog bowls and towel, treats, and a large plush doggie bed we couldn't get our girl out of. Also, being only a few miles from downtown Lewisburg was a positive for us. We'll be back!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Karen’s place is perfectly situated on the river with a great view. The house is cozy and the grounds are well maintained.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"From initial communications, to final farewell, Karen is truly one of the BEST AirBnb hosts I have ever had the pleasure of staying with. We were in town for my sister’s wedding and she gave navigating tips, amazing detailed directions, and quick responses. The house is absolutely charming!! Spectacular views. Cozy, welcoming and relaxing vibe all over. The attention to detail is impeccable. We continued to be impressed at every turn. So many wonderful amenities to make our stay homey and enjoyable. Fresh flowers, cookies, snacks, water, breakfast goodies and coffee, toiletries, extra blankets, and she even turned down the sofa bed for us and accommodated our early check-in request. She truly thought of every detail. And even though we didn’t have fur babies, I could see those traveling with pets would be extremely pleased with the pet amenities (crates, toys, food bowls, paw towels, baggies, fenced in yard, etc.) Our kids also enjoyed the house and we all wished we could have stayed longer. Karen truly is a super host!!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We thoroughly enjoyed this home, the view and access to the river were stunning. Karen thinks of everything! Including plush accommodations for your fur baby.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Karen's Riverbreeze Cottage is absolutely adorable. The view from the sun room is absolutely breath taking. The perfect place to enjoy a cup of coffee. Karen was kind enough to accommodate our family during our move from Colorado to Massachusetts. The journey was a lot longer and harder than we anticipated and Karen was able to make room for us and our fur babies for a last minute stop. I love that she provides dog toys, beds, kennels and a fenced yard. It made us feel at home. Wished we could have stayed longer! Thank you so much!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Karen’s place is cozy, warm and welcoming. Her little touches make all the difference in the stay.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Karen is an amazing host. Traveling with a baby and a dog is not easy. Karen helped us to have a smoothly trip by preparing everything we need there; a baby crib, a baby gate, a large dog crate, drinks and snacks for us. She is a very sweet person, caring and thoughtful. She’s very responsive and very nice to communicate with. This is what Airbnb should be.
We had a great birthday weekend getaway. My husband really likes this place. Our 14 months old slept in a cozy crib through all the nights. Also our Aussie dog loves to run and play in the fenced yard. It’s very quiet place for a vacation. We grilled outside with an amazing river view and used a fire pit at night. It’s so calm and relaxing.
Every corners and rooms are very clean and tidy. We felt like home.
We will come back again for sure. Highly recommended! 😊"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay at Karen’s was great. Everything was clean and comfy. We enjoyed sitting outside next to the river. It was a short drive to downtown where we walked and checked out some shops and restaurants. We loved this spot so much, we decided to stay an extra night! Can’t wait to come back!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! Karen was a great communicator and the place was cute and clean. Would highly recommend.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What can I say!? Riverbreeze is an always will be my most favorite place to stay on Airbnb. This is not just a place to stay, this is somewhere that you feel instantly at home. There is such a peaceful, harmonious vibe at Riverbreeze. We have spent two weekends here and plan on spending many more!!! In the mornings you are greeted by a symphony of beautiful sounds. From the birds chirping to the river peacefully passing you by. Every single square inch of this home is built for comfort. There is a multitude of places to nap and sit and get cozy, something you don’t always find in an Airbnb. The home is spotless clean and each room tells a story of a person who is so deeply thoughtful and warm. Karen is the ultimate host, and quite honestly a wonderful person. So many times during my stays at River Breeze Avenue I find myself texting her as a friend. She is SO RESPONSIVE and welcomes you as if you are her family. She welcomed us, for example, knowing we had a hard day journey to get to Riverbreeze, with a thoughtful welcome basket and even a toy for our sod Rory. It was sorely needed as by the time we arrived, we were starved and nothing was open (11:30pm +/-). This was so clutch given the circumstances and so very kind of Karen, to go the extra mile for us.
This home is fully stocked, clean, comfortable, cozy, fun, filled with thought and love and has the absolute best ACTUAL fully stocked kitchen I have ever seen. I legit would live at Riverbreeze, what a little slice of heaven with Karen a true angel ❤️❤️❤️"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My wife Vanessa, dog Munch , and I had a very nice stay at Karen’s place. The house is very comfortable and nicely appointed with a nautical theme. The location on the river is perfect. We enjoyed a fire in the fire pit every night we were there. It is convenient to Lewisburg as well as great restaurants, wineries, and breweries. Highly recommend staying at Karen’s and we hope to return again soon."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Karen’s house was perfect. So clean, so comfortable, so beautifully decorated. The location in the river was lovely. Karen left us bagels and cream cheese, orange juice and waters - such a nice touch. Beds were comfortable, window air units worked great, we had everything we needed or wanted. Highly recommend!!!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location! Amazing view and very close to cute main street with many food and shopping options. Perfect stop off 80 on our multi day road trip. Karen has so many great amenities there, including my favorite hot chocolate!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was a fantastic place to stay. The home is whimsical in decor with an amazing layout. The views alone-wow. The morning view of the river and the eagle was breathtaking. Karen went above and beyond in every aspect of comfort and hospitality. We felt so COZY. We arrived to homemade cookies, fresh flowers, and a filled water bowl for our dogs. Any communication with Karen echoed such kindness. We definitely will be back for our annual trip to Knoebels."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The location of this house, right on the river is just gorgeous. The house itself is cozy and welcoming and includes everything you might need. Karen is super quick to respond to any questions. We will definitely return when we’re back in the area to visit family!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a phenomenal time! It was such a privilege to be able to stay in the happiest, coziest and most masterly curated river refuge on the whole Susquehanna! Karen took such good care of us. Just the best!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A beautiful location right along the river! My stay was super chill and I loved the view of the river and the bald eagles with my morning coffee.
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Such a quaint nice home on the River w sooo many great surprises every where you look. Clean and comfortable and private.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely enjoyed EVERYTHING about our stay! Karen proved to be an attentive and gracious hostess . We were happily surprised with and appreciated all her attention to detail. The coffee and tea station was perfect. The home is listed as ""Pet Friendly"" and it really was.....from the fenced yard to the dog crates , dog toys and even treats. We stayed during a very hot few days and the window unit air conditioners did their job of keeping us comfortable. Best of all was drinking our early morning coffee on the deck and watching the beautiful sunrise over the river!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Our stay was fabulous. Karen knows what she’s doing and has a beautiful home to accommodate. Plenty of space and the views are magnificent. Very comfortable beds and nice hot shower. The house was immaculately clean. Nice touches throughout. I definitely recommend. Thanks Karen!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Stayed here for about 2 months while on a travel assignment for work. Everything was great, Karen was always very communicative and accommodating for myself and my two dogs. Location was very close to the hospital I was working at and the view of the river is amazing!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This house is minutes from Lewisburg, an array of breweries and wineries, and other great scenes. We travelled with a baby and two dogs, so not an easy arrangement, but this house had everything we needed, with a great view, and perfect yard. Karen, the host was wonderful. We were greeted with a nice note and fresh flowers around the house, she even left dog treats as a gift for our puppies. We would certainly recommend this stay to all wanting a cozy, relaxing stay, next to the river! We would certainly love to come back! I mean we were supposed to leave on Monday and ended up extending until Wednesday, that’s house great of a place this is. Do yourself a favor and book extra nights!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Karen was very welcoming and even left us orange & blue Bucknell m&m's as part of our planned stay for graduation weekend.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I wish that there could be a rating with 10 stars because that is how many stars I would give this beautiful home and it’s hostess. The minute I entered Karen’s place I instantly had the most amazing and good feeling about it. There is an energy and a warmth to this home that is only surpassed by it’s beautiful views and location and artwork.
The home was equipped with not just one, not just two, but FIVE of the most comfortable sofa/chairs, complete with an OG lazy boy! Karen‘s home is situated on the Susquehanna River and the views from every aspect of the home are breathtaking. The kitchen is stocked and each room is beautifully decorated with themes and artwork that lend itself to a hostess that must be so incredibly well traveled and down to earth.
We only booked this place for one day and night because it was just supposed to be a quick stop over, but by the time we were checking out we didn’t want to leave. Our stay turned into an entire weekend and we still didn’t want to leave even then.
Throughout the entire stay I remained in touch with Karen about the smallest of details to the very big details such as extending our stay. The entire time I felt like I was speaking to a friend I had known for years. Karen is lovely and so communicative and gains so much joy from her guests enjoying themselves and the house.
We have decided without hesitation to come back for an August trip. We love this house so very much, anyone who stays here and has the chance to meet and interact with Karen, even just over messaging, is so very lucky. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! BEST HOUSE WE HAVE EVER STAYED AT."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Karen was very receptive and extremely helpful during my stay. What is depicted in the pictures of the property is exactly what you get! I enjoyed my stay and felt at home.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I'm not sure where to start. The winery and restaurant that they own and operate is just incredible. The staff was so friendly and welcoming and the prices were very good. The food and drinks were off the charts good. We could not get enough of it.
The location is very quite and private, the property was well maintained and the guest house was perfect for our stay.
Lastly the hosts Thomas and Tammy were just so gracious and welcoming. Anything we needed they accommodated without hesitation. They are very caring people and it shows in their genuine interactions with those around them. I cannot thank them enough for their generosity with us. Truly wonderful people.
Just an amazing experience overall and cannot recommend it enough."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place is beautiful and the furniture is impeccable
Lots of nicknacks to make it feel homey.
But the price is too high for anyplace that I only sleeps 4 and doesn’t have a ton of amenities and 4 star services"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We couldn’t have been happier finding this little treasure spot on Airbnb. All of us were so pleased with the beauty and comfort of the house.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Unfortunately we had to cancel our stay with Thomas, however I am giving him a 5-star review for his communication and kindness. Our son came down with the stomach bug the day we were supposed to check in and Thomas was quick to communicate, accommodating, and offered to book us for another weekend. We hope to be able to visit in the future."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Spyglass Ridge Winery guesthouse was a nice spot for two couples. We chose the spot around a concert at Spyglass and it was perfect. Convenient yet private. Recommend the house. Tom and everyone else we interacted with were friendly and welcoming. The shared pool, the hot tub, the fire pit, the cats! The cats! We will return. Did I mention the loving and welcoming cats? Thank you for everything."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Everything about our stay was just perfect!! We stayed on way home from dropping our daughter off at college and wish we planned to have stayed longer. The home, views, and surrounding areas were all just so beautiful and peaceful. We brought our younger two children with us who just loved hanging outside. Tom was awesome and so friendly! Food at Three Beards was perfect and a nice short scenic walk after a long day."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We can not express how wonderful our stay was. Myself, husband, daughter and in-laws stayed for two nights. The second we arrived, I was already looking forward to our next trip! The house was so beautiful and the scenery just blew us away. Tom was so kind and welcoming. Loved chatting with him. We will be recommending this place to all of our family and friends! Winery shares parking lot with the house and brewery is just a short walk up the hill. This could not have been more perfect! I could go on and on about only positive things! Great couples getaway or girls weekend :) Thank you Tom!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Where to start with this place…. This place is literally a hidden gem!!! We unfortunately only got to stay one night because it was on our way to picking up our daughter from camp.
Tom and Tammy are amazing hosts! They had great communication! The house was so beautiful with every single detail. Beautifully decorated. Very homey. Pristine clean. Kitchen had every needed amenity! EVEN FRENCH VANILLA CREAMER-say what??? There is a winery on site!!! It closed before we got to go BUT there is also a brewery on site!!! Tried 4 different beers and didn’t even make it past the appetizers because they were so yummy! Jess was our server and she rocked. Another amazing thing about this property was there is an amphitheater on site and hosts amazing performers. Pat Benatar was scheduled for the following day! No joke!!!! I cannot wait to see the next summer line up which comes out in January. Absolutely cannot wait to stay here again! More time needed! Thank you Tom and Tammy!!!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Many more amenities than they have listed. The grounds are beautiful and a welcome respite from city noises. The space was as described and it’s hard to beat a dip in a clean pool on a muggy afternoon. We didn’t know about the outdoor cats but we’re pleasantly surprised and enjoyed their friendly purrs as we drank morning coffee outside.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is spectacular. Great getaway for my work road trip. I have recommended to others for a couples retreat. Beautiful space with winery and brewery in walking distance on same property as the home. Great scenery. A little while away from any stores or convenience so bring your overnight things for your fridge and snacks, but restaurant is open until 9pm and has great food. Tom and his family were very welcoming and even offered food off of their grill for me because we were outside coincidentally. Great place, better people"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is beautiful so clean. Quite even though your next to the winery and brewery. We only slept there didn’t hangout due to working in the area. We will 100% be back. To top it off the brewery and beautiful and wonderful. And the winery was tasty also.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I visited here for two nights with my husband and young daughter, we couldn't have asked for a more beautiful and peaceful spot to spend the weekend! The home is very spacious and comfortable with a huge lawn, outdoor seating, a pond, and a pool and hot tub (shared with the adjacent home). The brewery next door has fantastic beer and food, and although we didn't have time to do a wine tasting, we loved the view of the vineyard!"

It was spotlessly clean, the bed was super comfortable with ample AC, and the bathroom and kitchen had all the necessary amenities.

A full length mirror would be helpful."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is such a cute little apartment and Billi was very proactive in contacting me before check in to see if I would like her to be there.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Billi's place was very clean! The kitchen was very well stocked as was the bathroom. The setup of the spaces was well done. There was plenty of parking and we got to meet a delightful orange cat who greeted me outside the kitchen window. It was so nice to have a large laundry room as we stored our bags there to avoid using them when the baby was sleeping and were able to do laundry easily.
Just a heads up that there are no doors on the sleeping areas (this was a problem for us as we had a baby with us. Thankfully, we travel with trash bags and tape for light) and the space is cooled by window AC units in the sleeping areas. We happened to be there on a couple of very hot days and with a baby, it was a little more difficult.
Definitely would stay with Billi again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Billi is amazing! I’ve loved the space and she’s been an incredible host. Im very grateful!

Clean, quiet and fabulous!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was attending an event at Susquehanna University and looked for a place that was comfortable and private without being too close to campus. Truly, Billi's place is absolutely amazing and I can't recommend it enough.
Every possible amenity I could have forgotten, she'd already thought of it and made it readily available in the extremely clean space. Billi was also very kind and wonderfully communicative, making my entire experience seamless. Next time I'm in the Susquehanna Valley, I will 100% be staying here."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’m so excited to have found this Air BnB! The apartment was so clean, well decorated, cozy and comfortable. There were so many small touches - Billi thought of everything you could need when traveling and was so kind. I will definitely be back!"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot say enough great things about newly renovated apartment! Everything was exactly as described and SO CLEAN! Bed was especially comfy and for those who are bed snobs like me, It's a memory foam bed! It felt like a Tempurpedic.
Tasteful decor, thoughtful amenities (She even supplies a 5 gallon water cooler with quality Deer Park water) and every need cared for and anticipated. It's like she put herself in the shoes of her guests and supplied what needed for a relaxing stay! My husband and I literally didn't want to leave.
We did have to endure some construction in the downstairs apartment that's being renovated a little early in our day (around 7:30am), but it wasn't excessive. This is probably just a temporary thing, so don't let it sway you from booking!
Billi was also extremely responsive to any questions we had! She's an excellent hostess and hopefully, we will have the privilege to stay here again."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"By far THE BEST host I’ve met and the most gorgeous space I’ve ever stayed in!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable place in a great location.

For my husband, the kitchen with state of the art appliances and all the cookware and staples one could want. For me the outdoor space was so peaceful and lovely for birdwatching, even a few fawns passed through the woods.

2021-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Thank you so much for having your home available for our stay! It was super close to Bucknell where our daughter graduated.

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay exceeded expectations and was exactly what we needed right now. The event we were attending was cancelled due to Covid but we decided to take the trip anyway to have a much needed break. We are so happy we did. This home is so unique and beautiful from the moment you walk through the door. The elevated and open layout of windows fill the rooms with natural light throughout the day. My favorite times were spent in the sunroom and on the patio watching birds and chipmunks in the landscaped zen garden. It was so relaxing that we chose to stay in an entire day followed by grilling and enjoying the privacy of total peace and quiet. I can't say enough about this perfect getaway. It really was something special.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An amazing home! This retreat was a much needed get away for our family of 4. The home is absolutely beautiful, bright , homey and relaxing!

2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This fabulous home is even more beautiful than the pictures. Sunny and spacious (those windows!) yet cozy and inviting. Wonderful art and antiques throughout the house. Dramatic lighting, with light switches thoughtfully labeled. Spotlessly clean. Great location near Lewisburg. Very quiet neighborhood. The upstairs bedroom has a comfy bed, with plenty of room in the closet and drawers. There is a nice coffee-making nook off the dining room, and the eat-in kitchen has luxury appliances and every pot, pan and utensil you could possibly need. Check in and check out was easy. The house is up a steep driveway, which became icy overnight when the temperature dropped. Even though the owners were out of town, Anna Beth promptly responded to my early Sunday morning text and sent over her handyman to help with extra salt. Highly recommend this home!"
2019-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Plenty of room throughout the house. Description is accurate. We were there in winter during snow and you would need four wheel drive. Great location, enjoyed our stay, great responsive hosts."

It’s very private and at the same time lots of natural sunlight streaming through the large windows. It feels like you’re sitting outside up in the sunroom. Beautiful original artwork throughout. The kitchen is fabulous with a subzero refrigerator, several coffee options with French press, aero press, and other coffee machines. Plenty of pots and pans, dishes etc. for entertaining.
It’s a lovely place to stay! I highly recommend it. Thank you John and Anna Beth!"
2018-06-01,4.0,Group trip,"John's home is beautiful, the outdoor space is wonderful. They are great people and they get back to you almost immediately. It is a comfortable fit for 6 or even 8 people, though they prefer 6. Nice place to stay.
Keep in mind that this is their home, that they are renting out, hence it is like house sitting for a good friend, the house is completely supplied with everything and their personal belonging are there in the house closets and drawers. It's their home away from your home that you are renting. I recommend this house and it's owner."
2018-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Anna Beth and John were very welcoming. They communicated from beginning to end. They went out of their way to make us feel welcomed upon arrival. The house is wonderful with plenty of open space to visit and relax. I highly recommend this home if you have an event in the surrounding area.

There’s a tv in the living room and both bedrooms plus great Wi-Fi. The backyard is cozy and private, with outdoor seating and dining, and two dedicated parking spaces. Close to parks and both Susquehanna University and Bucknell, it’s both convenient and comfortable. We would stay here again!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I loved staying at Billi’s place! I felt right at home and loved using the grill! Night time was really quiet expect for an occasional semi that rolled by.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,This was a more than pleasant place to be and I can’t give the owners.

I would recommend this ab&b to everyone.

She is a gracious host. Duke street is somewhat busy therefore road noise was excessive, at times, but did not detract from the overall experience. Beautiful home, gracious host, centrally located, very well worth the expense. Highly recommended!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We were so happy with our stay in Norry. The house exceeded expectations based on the photos. It was really well cleaned and really well stocked with everything you need should you have forgotten something. The beds were really comfortable. I made a pie and found the kitchen to be perfectly well stocked for cooking purposes. The street outside is a little noisy with cars and a train can be heard in the distance but it was a perfect place to crash while visiting family. We will probably be staying here again in the future. Would recommend.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Billi's place in Northumberland. Billi was flexible in meeting us at the house after encountering two traffic delays in transit. Her place was roomy and very comfortable for the four of us attending a family gathering. Since the weekend weather was beautiful, we spent a good deal of time on the back porch which provided a wonderful spot to visit. Should our future travels find us needing a place to stay in the Northumberland area, we would definitely stay at Billi's again!"

Everything was thought of, from liquid for your lenses to a real popcorn machine.
We would have liked to have stayed longer, but unfortunately had to move forward.
We would recommend everyone to stay here once.
Billi thank you so much and who knows, see you soon!!!
Bas, Thera Pien and Teun."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great Value is an understatement!
We felt at home right away. Billi greeted us with a beautiful smile and kind heart. Her home was cute, cozy and colorful! At night I was tickled by her choice of sheets in the bedroom, I shrieked with joy!
We had a house, not a condo or hotel where there is usually some interference with a bang, knock or dropped shoe. There is traffic but we adjusted quickly. Easy to find, near many places to shop and eat and a Park to enjoy by the Susquehanna River, within a short drive."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I had a great stay at Billi's house! It was very clean and cozy, with beautiful wooden decor. The bed was very comfortable (I was in the king), the linens looked clean and fresh, and the bathroom was big and very clean. There were also little things, like the stairway lights being motion-activated, that were really nice/convenient. Billi gave me very clear instructions, so it was easy to figure out where to park, where to find the key, etc. She was also very responsive and helpful."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My Husband very much enjoyed his stay. Good location for a few trips to Knoebels, nice places to eat in the area. The place was spotless with plenty of amenities. The place is great and Billi is an excellent host. Would definitely stay again."

From prompt communication throughout the weekend to nice little extras that make this a great place, I will stay here again when my travels require me to be in this part of the state. In-home WiFi is available so you don't have to use your cell phone's service. The kitchen was well suited for preparing meals during my stay. All eating related parts were clean, ready to go, and a fully matched set (for those who care about such things). The water cooler was a nice addition for easy access to cold, cool, or hot water on demand. The towels in the bathroom were plush and soft. The TP was a quality brand. The memory foam mattresses were quite comfy. The pillows were feather filled and quite soft. Somebody get me Rogers & Ebert, this place gets two thumbs up easily!"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Billi was a delight to meet and talk to. She was just a phone call away throughout my one week stay. I loved that the house was even nicer in person. What I found helpful during my stay is Billi had extra toiletries if I forgot something. The amenities were as listed. I would must definitely recommend this property to other guests. It was truly a home away from home.

The location was close to the many activities we had planned while in the area. Would definitely recommend this as a home away from home.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful and cozy home in a convenient location. The photos simply do not do this home justice. My husband and I instantly felt right at home and didn't want to leave! Our only issue was that we are not used to sleeping so close to a main road and had to adjust to the conditions a bit. I particularly liked decor and usability of the space. We hope to stay again.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay, house was in a great location with easy access and had everything we needed"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Margie and Dave's house was very comfortable and felt like home. We stayed there for my nieces wedding which was nearby. The beds were comfortable. They had many amenities and many extra thoughtful touches. Margie and Dave communicated in a timely manner with any questions and were proactive in making sure we had what we needed. Would definitely recommend Margie and Dave's place.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were visiting family in Shamokin Dam. The Air B&B was 2 blocks from our family with a fenced in backyard for our grandchildren to play in. Our hosts had no problem with our grandchildren visiting. The house was beautiful, very clean, and relaxing. It was also beautifully decorated. The kitchen was well supplied with breakfast items along with some very yummy pastries! There were brochures about area attractions. We took a driving tour of old covered bridges! Margie and Dave’s place is well worth the stay; we would recommend it! It is close to nearby universities, hospitals, beautiful parks, hiking trails, and Clyde Peelings Reptile Land . We would definitely stay there again. Great hosts and very nice Air B&B!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed the weekend for SU Graduation and this property was immaculate. The owners were very helpful and our stay was fantastic.

The accommodations are lovely and comfortable. Margie and Dave are wonderful to work with. They are responsive and add many wonderful touches that make you feel right at home. This place is a gem!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, peaceful home. Spotless, warm and inviting. Ours was only a 1 night stay for graduation at Bucknell. We really appreciated the extensive coffee bar, snacks and breakfast options. The backyard was inviting as was the outdoor furniture. Would definitely return!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Traveler is a great place to stay and Dave and Margie are exceptional hosts. The home is well styled and appointed, with generous offerings of snacks. The hosts made us feel welcomed, more like staying at a friends house than a strange place. Absolutely the best experience I’ve had in an Airbnb."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,One of the cleanest AirBnBs I’ve stayed in. Margie & Dave had so many welcoming and thoughful touches! Cats next door provided great viewing entertainment. Grocery and restaurants very close by. Would definitely stay again!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Can’t say enough good things about this place. It was the most well-stocked AirBnB I’ve ever stayed in, with various snacks, drinks, and even fresh apple fritters and eggs from their backyard hens! But even if none of that had been there, this place would have been great. It was as clean as could be and I loved that all the drawers, cabinets, etc in the kitchen were labeled. No complaints at all. Highly recommended."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,‘The Traveler’ was amazing. The description was very accurate and the hosts are extremely responsive. The accommodations were unlike any other Airbnb I have stayed in. It was so close to the main strip and minutes away from shopping and restaurants. Would love to stay again if we are in the area.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The hosts went above and beyond making it as flawless and easy as possible. With plenty of snacks, fruit, drinks and the most delicious blueberry and apple pastries. I can’t express how welcoming and enjoyable the stay was. I will be looking to rebook for my next stay. Thank you again for everything"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed for one night at The Traveler and it was probably our best Airbnb we’ve had so far. Margie and Dave thought of everything. They were very accommodating and responsive to questions and very kind hosts. The house was lovely and spotless. Our bed was comfy and we slept really well. Loved the extra touches of providing shampoo, conditioner and body wash as well as the other little toiletries, so helpful especially for someone as forgetful as myself. They even left us some breakfast treats from a local café and the kitchen was well equipped for anything else you might like or need. It was a rainy day so it was so nice to be able to use the garage to park my partner’s scooter out of the rain. We had a great stay and wouldn’t hesitate to stay at The Traveler again next time we are in the area. Thank you Margie and Dave for a lovely stay."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at The Traveler. Very comfortable home with everything we needed. Margie and Dave clearly put a lot of thought into all the amenities at the house, and we appreciated all those thoughtful touches and hospitality. It was a perfect place for us to stay to visit for Homecoming and Parents Weekend at Bucknell. Would recommend!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"When a person travels there always looking for a place that feels comfortable and welcoming, and gives some sense of calling it home.
This Airbnb hits a home run ! I
It is the perfect place to stay, and they are the nicest couple I’ve ever come across to work with .
So while I am given the lucky opportunity to stay there, I am calling it home!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"AMAZING PLACE!! Margie and Dave have gone above and beyond making your stay PERFECT!! Absolutely beautiful decor, completely clean and well stocked with goodies and every day must-haves, thorough and thoughtful binder with a plethora of info on the house and local restaurants and things to do. They also responded immediately with any questions we had! Overall wonderful place and people!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Although it has been a while since we stayed in an AirBnB, this was by far the best overall experience we've had!
I cannot say enough about the ""little things"" that made this overnight stay stand out ... from the subtle yet effective labels on everything so that there was no confusion or guesswork, to the extremely well thought out snack basket and delicious baked goods. Every thing that could have been needed was provided, and it was obvious the attention to detail and pride in ownership that Margie and Dave have.
My only regret is that we were only staying for a quick overnight. My wife and I are already thinking about other things to do in this area so that we can stay here again for a longer trip.
Thank you Margie and Dave,
Todd"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Margie and Dave are such a top notch host. Best air bnb I’ve ever stayed. They went above and beyond to ensure our needs are met and made us feel right at home. Their house is clean, neat, beautiful, and most of all they are so generous when it comes to amenities and snacks! Their Apple fritters, free range chicken eggs are just delicious. My husband also got allergy reaction and Dave went out his way to get us the meds even though it was already 10pm. I just can’t thank enough. We will definitely stay here again when we visit the area! Thank you Margie and Dave!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"So glad we decided to book The Traveler for our visit to Central PA! This was most certainly the nicest, most cozy AirBnB we have every stayed in. The home was clean and the hosts were so welcoming! Thank you for a great stay!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing place to stay!
Everything was perfect. The house was extremely clean and welcoming.
I have never experienced a more well stocked kitchen, with everything you needed, from coffee and snacks and the muffins and donuts.
I cant say enough how impressed we were with our stay."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was truly a privilege to stay at Margie and Dave’s home. The home made apple fritters were heavenly and the little touches throughout the home made it feel so warm and welcoming. The fresh eggs in the fridge from their chickens - made an amazing omelet! Everything you need was provided - not just because - they did it with care. Wonderful Home - Marvelous Hosts - truly the definition of what an Airbnb should be like - they set the perfect example and they did it with elegance. We will definitely be staying again soon!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely excellent accommodation! Margie and Dave were extremely friendly and responsive. Lovely home. Everything was clean and comfortable. Left us refreshments from a local store which was so nice as we arrived hungry late in the evening. Will definitely stay here again!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Margie and Dave’s place! It’s super clean and comfortable. Decor is visually very pleasing and a lot of it seems to be brand new. Bed, pillows, bedding really comfortable, great shower. There is a place for everything. They are incredibly thoughtful people… The kitchen was fully stocked with coffees, creamers, fresh fruit and pastries, eggs! Etc., etc. They even wrote a personal note… their hospitality was off the charts. Dave is very responsive, helpful, and friendly. We would have stayed on longer if we were able. Easy drive to Susquehanna and Bucknell Universities. Highly recommend!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Margie and Dave were awesome hosts! Quick to respond to my questions. Their place was immaculate. You can tell they put a lot of love and work into the home. I say home because that is what it felt like. The yard was huge and peaceful. The hammock was a nice treat. The bedrooms where spacious and very well decorated. The bed was comfortable. The living room was cozy. The kitchen's vibe was so beautiful. They left us a nice snack basket which my husband enjoyed for the drive. I loved the small details they put into every area of the home. We were so well taken care of. I can't say enough as to how much this place made me feel special. You won't be disappointed to reserve this beautiful home.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was super cozy! Snacks provided, a coffee maker and a keurig! Walking distance to downtown and very private. Awesome little nook with lots of games made for a great spot for kids!Would highly recommend and stay again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,For four years we have stayed with Helen and Bob as my daughter attended Susquehanna University. Their home is warm and welcoming as are they. We will miss it and them very much. Guests should consider themselves lucky to stay here!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely time staying here for my sister’s graduation in Lewisburg. It was so comfortable and Helen’s instructions so clear, we didn’t have want for anything!
The area was so beautiful, we hope to come back for a fishing trip and stay at Helen’s again (and maybe get to finally play some of the many board games!)."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We've stayed at Helen's place before. It's always a pleasant experience.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very comfortable, charming home in a peaceful neighborhood. It's definitely worth walking along the river which is just down the street!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice place.
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoy staying at Helen's because of its proximity to Susquehanna University. There's plenty of space for our family when we visit our daughter at SU, and enough room they and friends can come hang out for a meal. We'll be back !"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I only needed a place to stay overnight, but I would have been very comfortable staying here for longer. There were many nice touches that are not universally available. For example, there were numerous complimentary snacks including some breakfast items, lots of information about local attractions, and multiple notes throughout providing the wi-fi information so no need to look for the one place it's stored. The kitchen was very well stocked and there were games and some other items to help keep kids or families occupied. The main bed was a bit too firm for my tastes, and the shower stall is a bit cramped for bigger people. However, this is a fantastic property overall."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Always a pleasure staying with Helen and Bob. For the past 4 years, as we've visited my daughter at SU, they have made us feel like we have a ""home away from home"". Anyone coming to the area should stay with them, but for SU parents in particular, this relaxing location is in walking distance to the school and town, and provides everything you need. We will miss them and their home after graduation next month!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Second time staying to attend event at Susquehanna University. Would highly recommend.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a really lovely overnight stay. The place felt comfortable and cozy. Wifi was strong, bed was comfortable, plenty of space, clean bathroom. I appreciated the little touches, like having more than enough towels, and providing breakfast and snack item, very thoughtful."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great weekend catching up with friends in our old college town. Perfect location for getting to downtown and fit the group perfectly. Super easy check in and check out. Snacks and coffee available made it easy to settle down for the weekend before we had groceries and made mornings a breeze. Super clean and worked so well for us even with the rainy weather. Great place to stay!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Very nice place and Helen was very responsive before and during our stay. Thanks so much.
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This is our third time at Helen's place while visiting our daughter at the university, which is barely a mile up the road (my husband walked there). It has a very clever layout which maximizes the space but is cozy and comfortable. The kitchen is fully appointed which allowed me to cook and serve breakfast for our daughter and three friends on her birthday. We'll definitely be back!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay in Selinsgrove. Very close to Susquehanna U. which was the reason for my visit.
The snacks, coffee and quick breakfast options that Helen provided were awesome. Another great added perk. I will gladly stay there again if I visit Selinsgrove."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Helen was a lovely host and the home was just what we needed. As students visiting Susquehanna University for our own graduate program residency, we appreciated the proximity to campus (just a short drive). The neighborhood was peaceful and the home was as described. It was cozy and warm for a winter visit. Helen provided snacks and breakfast items, which we found to be extra-thoughtful and sweet. Though we had to leave early due to plumbing issues (likely caused by work on the main sewer, and outside the host's control), Helen was super quick to respond and offered us her other AirBnB. We really appreciated Helen's quick response and clear communication. The home itself is warm, inviting, and we felt right at home. Thank you!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I couldn't give enough stars. Helen reached out early and provided excellent driving and check in directions. The home was in perfect condition, clean, comfortable and decorated for Christmas. There were quality breakfast and snack options including Clif bars, cereal, oatmeal and multiple coffee options. The main bed was firm and very comfortable. Home instructions were clear with Wi-Fi info listed in multiple locations. There were travel brochures located at the top of the stairs for easy reference. Helen also took care of the little things that are often missed. There was a channel guide for the TV service, safety equipment including a fire extinguisher and escape ladder for the bedroom, board games and books among others. The home was very quiet but right off of the strip that includes the areas main dining and shopping options. The next time I'm in the area, the Cottage on Que will be my desired booking option."

2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home in a lovely neighbourhood that afforded some much needed peace. The house features comfortable furniture, is set in a friendly community, and has a beautiful location. Plenty of places to walk and explore! Be advised if you are in any way sensitive to fragrance that the place is HEAVILY scented with air fresheners and I highly recommend reaching out to Helen ahead of time about having them unplugged before you get there. We had a very difficult time breathing until we aired the place out. Once we did however it was a lovely stay!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, private, conveniently located for us, and Helen was easy to work with. We were very comfortable and hope to stay there again in the spring!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A lovely stay in Selinsgrove on the Isle! The apartment is quiet and wonderfully stocked. The coffee pods were a welcome touch as well. The bed was extremely comfortable for a great night's sleep. Thanks so much and I would happily stay again!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a very short stay, in at all 7pm and out the next morning by 9am. Hope we can book it on our longer weekends coming up later this year and next spring."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Helen’s apartment is the best. Super clean. Snacks, breakfast, water, toiletries great extras. Clear instructions throughout the apartment."
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Helen's place got the job done for a space to stay on a road trip. Cute area around it and nice retro decor. The bed was comfortable.
Things to denote that could use some work:
1) There are physical keys in a lockbox that are required to be returned and taken out every single use. Fine fo a night but multiple days, would drive me crazy. Just updating the lock to an easier digital and updated one would make sense.
2) Water pressure is again-alright for a day- but I need a hefty shower after that period.
The place was well maintained and I loved the extra day beds and washer/dryer."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Helen is the most gracious host and her apartment is warm and homey!!! I can’t wait to come back!!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Helen was proactive and responsive with our communications. She gave alternate directions when the GPS wasn't accurate. Made sure the temperature was comfortable for our arrival. Provided clear instructions for the lock box ,appliances, heating and lights, etc. The ""extras"" , snacks,water,coffee,tea, breakfast cereal & sandwiches, kitchen & bathroom necessities exceeded anything we have seen at other BNB's
The cottage was exceptionally clean & beautifully furnished with antiques in a country style. We slept well & fully enjoyed our stay. Our only regret was that we couldn't stay longer. Hope to back again. Thanks so much, Gene & Dana"

Helen does not disappoint in the slightest! Clean, comfortable, cozy, private; plenty of room and lots to keep you occupied just staying in, let alone in town. You don’t even need to think twice about where to go, Helen has it all laid out at your fingertips. Snacks, coffee, tea, and breakfast options are stocked in the beautiful kitchen. TV, board games, and books in the living room. Town and state pamphlets organized neatly at the door. I can’t wait to share with all my family and friends!!"

It’s tiny, charming and was perfect for us. While 4 could stay, 2-3 would be a wiser choice. I’m not sure I’d bring real young children as they’d be confined , only a small shower, but so perfect for us. The bedding and towels were fresh and new, everything extremely clean and well maintained. Great location in a quiet neighborhood, located on a large lot. We found commuting to Bucknell for activities a perfect distance. One parks on the street right next to the entrance. We can’t wait to return,"

From the breakfast sandwiches in the fridge, to the sweets on the counter, you are covered.
A very comfortable large space to be enjoyed by all. Don't forget to take a cruise by the river while you're there."

Helen has thought of everything you may need but is always nearby if you have questions about anything.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay with easy walking to the river and downtown Selinsgrove. Very clean and cozy with everything you could want for a stress-free vacation .
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is spacious unit very well presented and welcoming for families. Plenty of board games and spaces to retreat . The place was very clean, the beds were very comfortable and well equipped with linen, towels, shampoo and breakfast bars. It was very easy and pleasant stay at a great value."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great furnishing and decor!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful place to stay, quiet, convenient, very roomy, lovely furnishings and decor, great kitchen. We intend to return when traveling to the area."
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,My family and I enjoyed our stay at Helen’s “yellow house” as my children would say. Helen was great at communicating with me and making sure that everything was going good. I really appreciate how she thought about my children and made the house kid friendly!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot in a perfect location! Minutes to downtown but in a nice, quiet area."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean. Nice quiet neighborhood. Would definitely recommend to friends. Helen was easy to communicate with.
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Helen's place was a nice space for us to enjoy during our recent trip to Knoebels. She really added so much extra to the cottage to make the stay enjoyable including the quick breakfast items and other necessities that were needed. I liked that the place was really clean and she quickly addressed a concern we had. Too bad we didnt have more time to explore the town! Another bonus was that the place had more space than a traditional hotel room. One downside was that street cleaning was overnight on Wed night, and we had to park on a different street. Of course we had massive thundersorms the night we stayed, but that's the only night that you can't park right in front. For our first ever AirBNB stay, I was pleasantly surprised and the price was cheaper than some of the hotels we looked at."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay here. The accommodations were comfortable and great amenities!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Roomier than expected!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I’m pleased to confirm the earlier favorable reviews of Helen’s place. We found it to be spotlessly clean, spacious, with everything we needed for a comfortable stay. Helen is a responsive and helpful host. Should our travels take us back to Selinsgrove, we wouldn’t hesitate to stay in her place again."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home is definitely going on our list of favorites! It was immaculately clean and very charming. The host had definitely put a lot of time and effort to ensure that all needs and wants were anticipated. We typically pack everything when going to a new home ""just in case."" That is definitely not needed here--fully stocked bathroom, kitchen, games, and light breakfast and snack items. Communication was also fantastic. Definitely recommend and we will definitely be back."
2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Very cozy and cute space that was a perfect stay for a wedding at The Stone Barn! The river is a short morning walk away and is beautiful as well. Great location.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Helen is a great host.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our recent stay was absolutely wonderful!! We were very happy with the apartment, lots of room, very clean and quiet. Has everything you need.
The neighborhood was having yard sales on Saturday morning. We strolled through the neighborhood, shopped and met some of the neighbors. The neighborhood is very nice and so are the residents.
One of our favorite things to do was walk the couple blocks down to the Susquehanna River and stroll along the road that parallels the river, beautiful!
I highly recommend staying at Helen’s place. Next time I’m in the area, I will definitely book this apartment again!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Helen's place was a perfect home base as my son and I visited nearby colleges. There was more than enough room for a mom and a teenager to spread out and relax between our appointments. Lots of welcoming little touches -- breakfast treats in the kitchen, spare toothbrushes in the bathroom -- made us feel well cared for, and Helen was quick to respond when we had questions. The local schools just went up several notches in my book, just so that we can come back to stay here again!"
2021-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,This place served our needs perfectly while visiting Selinsgrove!!! It is in a perfect location and close to everything.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,She pays attention to detail and makes her place very comfortable.
2021-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Helen’s place was perfect!! The pictures describe it perfectly. The set up worked so well for us for returning for SU’s Grad ceremonies. Walking distance to river and to town, so no need to drive or uber after the bar! She left us a cute note congratulating us on graduation. Will definitely check here first for availability in the future when returning to SU!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was a pretty magical space, shared with three couples, a two year old, and two older dogs. Very well appointed home, no detail overlooked!! All the extras really put a cherry on top. This is clearly a well loved space... with lots of area, inside and out, to come together with family and friends for games and meals....and plenty of spots to retreat for private moments too. Loved bring snow to launch our kayaks right from the property. We saw deer, turtles, geese (and babies!), frogs, snakes.... it was a truly relaxing retreat. We're already looking at booking next Memorial Day weekend!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay for privacy. Once you drive past the campgrounds, you are all alone. Kitchen was well stocked. Loads of firewood for firepit. Lower level good for kids. Great stay overall."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved this place. Can’t wait to book with David again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely stunning location! Lots to do. Great hosts. Loved every second of stay!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely amazing location! Extremely great hosts. I couldn’t ask for a better location to stay in the area.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"2nd time staying at this gem. Will definitely be back again. Such a beautiful home and peaceful location, and hosts who have curated this place perfectly."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is one of the greatest Airbnb’s my family and I have EVER stayed at! Gorgeous, tranquil setting and an incredibly comfortable and well equipped home. There wasn’t a single thing missing from this home. Every detail was thought through and no corners were cut to deliver a great guest experience. Everything we could have needed, and anything we could have wanted to do was right there for us. We will be back many times over."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We very much enjoyed our stay! Our granddaughter loved the swings and helping to build bonfires in the evening. We were close enough to the nearby towns for small excursions and one day even drove up to the Poconos to enjoy Fall color. Everything at the house was so well thought out and in the best of taste. It truly was a relaxing, rejuvenating week for us. Many thanks!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,One of the best Airbnb’s I’ve ever stayed in! The home was very private and in a peaceful location. My two dogs loved the ability to run around and enjoy the amazing warm weather. I may have to return next year!
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful place, the new bathroom was an added benefit. Looking forward to next year!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Fantastic place Great outdoor amenities. Lots of wildlife to see. Hope to come back soon!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay! The host met us and walked us through the property briefly. The house had everything. Fully stocked kitchen. The house is really well done - just gorgeous! 3 kayaks and 2 kiddie ones, a fun raft and private dock. Animals on the property was awesome and you truly are VERY private on a large piece of land with no neighbors. Matt made suggestions for restaurants and told us of the fireworks going off nearby in case we wanted to check them out. We stayed on the property though the whole time and really enjoyed it. The house is just fabulous. Amazing seating areas, screened in porch was heaven, fire pit, outdoor games, comfy beds, brand new bathrooms and a fun rec room basement. The Wi-Fi is patchy if it rains - and we used our hotspot quite a bit - so worth bringing your own streaming stick (we did). Overall just a fantastic stay and loved the privacy, the amazing house and the property. Very special place. And the hosts are great people! We will return"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely wonderful hosts. The house was so well stocked (down to seasoning spices in the kitchen), you don’t need to bring anything extra. The hosts had a bottle of wine, cheese, crackers, and cookies waiting for us when we arrived. It was a lovely gesture that was much appreciated! The house is clearly loved and you can feel that when you’re there. Bathrooms are clean and updated. Beds were very comfortable. Good energy. The views were beautiful. The deck is fantastic. Our kids had a great time running around and playing games. We didn’t use the water much, but the privacy was lovely. For families, this house is a quick 25 minute drive to Knoebels. We shopped at the Lewisburg Farmers Market on Wednesday (amazing). We had a great time. Thank you!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"This cottage was beautifully furnished and extremely well stocked. We rented for some very dear out of state friends. Ideally located for our needs. Only a half mile from our home, yet we never knew it was there in our small town! Our host was easily accessible, very friendly, and helpful. The cottage was bright, cheery, and really comfortable. Plenty of fellowship space to socialize, both inside and out. Would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a peaceful get away in this area."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We rented David and Matthew's home while attending our daughter's graduation from Bucknell University this weekend. This house is fabulous and one of the nicest AirBnB properties we have stayed in. The setting overlooking the lake is spectacular. The house has been beautifully decorated and had every feature we could need. While we did not get to use the outdoor spaces, they were well done and added to the ambiance. Our sons used the kayaks and loved a peaceful afternoon on the lake. Overall, this is a fantastic house. We highly recommend it."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,My family & I thoroughly enjoyed staying at this beautiful house. Every detail was thought of. Very clean and nice. We felt very comfortable. Highly recommend this to anyone!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Fantastic place and wonderful host! We’ve stayed here previously and love the location. It’s so peaceful, the recent upgrades make the house even more welcoming and cozy. True gem in the area!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Such a gem for the area. Being right on the river was beyond beautiful and peaceful. The house was picture perfect, and on top of it all, decorated for Christmas. It felt straight out of a movie set. Great place, great hosts… definitely will be coming back."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a fabulous stay at Earl's Landing. The home was super clean and the kitchen was the best stocked of all the AirBnbs I've ever stayed at. It had everything we wanted. The beds were comfortable and everything in the house was high quality and in good shape. We felt comfortable from the minute we walked in. We loved the water view and walking around the property. David and Matthew were easy to work with and very responsive. I wish we could have stayed longer!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Really fantastic. Couldn't recommend more highly. Far exceeded our expectations both in the place itself and the amenities as well as in the degree of home hospitality.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"House was clean and nicely decorated
It was a perfect rental for my family and I
Saw ducks, deer, turtles, weather wasn't Great, but we had a good time
Nice and quiet while only minutes to town"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This beautifully designed home feels spacious and cozy at the same time. The view of the Susquehanna River is stunning. The owners thought of everything their guests might need. I’d highly recommend this place for a stay.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our family vacation was fabulous at this home. We enjoyed the beautiful views, amazing property and plentiful amenities. The wildlife was so cool to see. We witnessed many deer including fawns. We appreciated the tour at check in to gain the nuances of the property. We enjoyed the many wineries and breweries surrounding the area. This was a beautiful home and would love to come back during the cooler months."
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"We loved our stay! The hosts were very friendly and accommodating. The house was very clean, decorated beautifully with great amenities!
It was a very relaxing stay! Beautiful views. Indoor and outdoor games, kayaks, fishing and more. Shopping nearby if you forgot to pack anything, and lots to do in the area.
We definitely recommend this AirBnb and we hope to stay here again in the future!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a fantastic couple days at this house. Very well appointed and clean. Very relaxing and beautiful views. David and Matthew were great host !!
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"We have only good things to say about our stay at Earl's Landing. Our check in experience with Matthew was welcoming and informative. The listing description and photos do not do this place justice! This is a beautiful cabin with thoughtful and stylish upgrades throughout. It was the perfect place to travel as a grown family - my parents were able to lounge on the deck, in the screen porch or by the campfire, while my sibling and I and our spouses played lawn games, kayaked, or (attempted to) fish from the dock. It's clearly also welcoming to families with younger kids with bunk beds and Pac-Man in the game room, board games & lawn games provided, and so much room to run around. The house is secluded and serene with lots of local wildlife enjoying the acreage, that you forget that you're only about 5 minutes from town and about 10 minutes from several restaurants and grocery stores. This place is a gem and we could not recommend it more highly!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Fantastic home. Beautiful property. Plenty of room for our big family. Looking forward to renting house again!!
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is really beautiful. It is so well decorated and clean. Unfortunately, it stormed for our entire stay so we were unable to take advantage of the outdoor amenities, but we did play a few of the board games. It was a nice stay."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lovely getaway on the river! Gorgeously updated cabin with everything you could need to cook up a feast, enjoy slow mornings looking out at the wildlife, and evenings relaxing on the back deck. Our kids loved the tree swing and had plenty of space to run around outside. The screened porch is a gem— I could literally sit out there all day and read and listen to the sounds of the woods evolve over the day. Matt is super welcoming, communicated about everything ahead of them, and Matt & David have thought of everything you could need for a relaxing weekend exploring the region (or just enjoying this sweet spot!)."
2021-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"This Airbnb was truly one of the best places we have ever stayed. It was truly a home away from home and no detail was forgotten. The beds were comfortable, the showers were hot with great water pressure, wood for fireplaces fully stocked, kitchen utensils enough to prepare a Thanksgiving dinner. The home was incredibly clean and welcoming, right down to the towels for our dog’s feet. It was a bit too cool to take advantage of all of the outdoor amenities, but all of the family games were enjoyed. I highly recommend this home to anyone and hope to return here again sometime."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"David has a beautiful home that was perfect for me, my husband, and 3-year-old son to meet up with my parents from Ohio for an early Thanksgiving meal. The home is absolutely beautiful with an abundance of sunshine coming in the windows. The weather was great for us and we were able to sit out on the deck in the sunshine during the day. There are working fireplaces and a fire pit, which we used continually while we were there. The kitchen is spacious and has all the cooking materials that you need to make a full Thanksgiving meal. We especially appreciated the nice touches of wine, cheese, crackers, and the S'mores kit upon arrival. The house has everything you need and it is spacious enough to ""get away"" for some quiet time from others if you need to. We only stayed on the property as we were enjoying our company, but we also went on walks around the property as it is so quiet and spacious. We will definitely be back for another visit with family. The views are beautiful and the entire stay was relaxing. Thank you to the hosts!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had an amazing weekend! The house was great and provided the perfect venue for our stay. The views of the river were great and the fire pit outside was the ideal way to spend the fall evenings. Matt and David made the whole process easy and there wasn’t one thing that we needed that they hadn’t already thought of. Great place and great hosts!
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"If you are looking for a beautiful and comfortable stay on the Susquehanna, look no further than David’s stay! From the blend of mid-century and classic waterfront furnishing, to the comfortable bedrooms and stunning screened-in porch, you will want for nothing during your visit. David was quick to communicate and incredibly accommodating, even when we were much later than anticipated in our arrival. There were even fresh baked cookies when we got there! We will definitely be returning in the future."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great and as described. The house was charmingly decorated. David was a great host, and we enjoyed the cookies, cheese, and wine after a long drive. The rooms were comfortable and cool. The deck and grill was functional and we grilled and ate dinner every night at the deck table. We spent all three nights around the firepit roasting marshmallows and making S'mores. We took the kayaks out for a spin and got some good rest, relaxation and quiet time.
We would stay here again."
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was the best Airbnb I ever stayed. Kitchen was very well stocked with utensils, pans, spices, full pantry and a variety of hot chocolate. Every single detail was placed with thoughtfulness, even for the dogs.
Communication was on point. Always got an answer within 10 minutes.
Very clean and well maintained!
It’s quiet and very private.
Would totally recommend. Can’t wait to be back next year."
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"The setting, the river, the beautiful grounds, and well appointed home is a wonderful place to enjoy nature and unwind. All of the beautiful touches, home made cookies, throws in every room in case there is chill, the screened-in porch, the deck overlooking the river are amazing!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"David and Matthew were fantastic hosts, the place is ready for you to just show up (not much needed, they supplied it all) and have a great time. They really anticipated our needs and the place is as good as it looks in the photos. It is immaculate and the screened in porch was my favorite spot in the evenings to relax! Great place for outdoor families with lots of activities at the house and nearby. We will certainly be back!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing time - great location and house has all amenities. David and Matthew were extremely helpful. The house has stunning views of the river and so much outdoor space for the perfect relaxation. We truly enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home is by far the best rental we have had. The decor, location, amenities and communication with the owners is amazing! Highly recommend!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful home! Tastefully decorated and very homey. The view is amazing. I would stay here again for sure!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great spot to get away and relax. Tons of spaces to be social or simply escape with a book or an iPad. And there’s arcade Pac-Man.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time. Very nice comfortable house. A perfect place for young children (2 and 5 years old) - just step out the door and there's a full day of adventures. And if you want, many nearby outdoor places to visit.
Lots of nice touches, like Smore kit and cookies. Great kitchen - we bought groceries at a local store and cooked all meals in the house. Very quiet and private. We would definitely come back."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A wonderful experience - great location and house has all amenities. David and Matthew were very helpful and reachable at all times. The house has stunning views of the river and lot of outdoor space. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back.

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great house, very confortable and well decorated.
Beautiful and relaxing views.
We had a great and relaxing time even with the cold thanks to the light, the views, the fireplace and board games."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place, bigger than it looks and incredible views/ location. Hopefully we’ll be back soon!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was great and amazing views . Me and my family had a great time . David was very helpful and responded to all my questions and was very helpful on check in and out . And helpful Throughout our stay. I highly recommend this place .
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend, my cousin, her husband, and I had an amazing adult getaway weekend in November 2020. The house is beautifully decorated and the views of the water are breathtaking. Kayaking is a must !! They have kayaks and life vests for you to use. It was the highlight of our weekend. Other highlights- s’mores by the fire pit, dinner in the screened in porch where you’ll see deer and birds, and morning coffee/breakfast on the deck. There are so many places to sit and take the views in. They also provide a lot of games and blankets! We couldn’t have asked for a better weekend and we highly recommend to anyone. Local Mexican spot - el Torito was fantastic as well. Only thing to keep in mind, was the wifi wasn’t able to have more than one person, so using our personal hotspots was a must."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My family had a wonderful time staying at the cottage! The location is beautiful and secluded- perfect for social distancing! We loved the indoor fireplace, sunroom and view of the river. We greatly enjoyed the daily deer feedings from the window. There is SO much property to explore during your stay. The cottage was incredibly clean and had so many special design touches. We truly felt like we had our own little oasis! We highly recommend and looking forward to coming back in the summer! 5 stars!!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"This riverside cottage is a hidden gem! The interior is beautifully decorated and thoughtfully appointed with coziness and comfort in mind--there's a tea/coffee/cocoa corner complete with small deluxe touches that we enjoyed all weekend! The master suite is gorgeous, and the screened-in porch is an especially lovely part of the house--good for watching deer and wildlife. The deck offers a breathtaking view of the river. We enjoyed kayaking and the fire pit--the outdoor areas are just as wonderful as the indoor space, with lots of room to explore and walk. My one tip would be to bring ear plugs for sleeping at night, as it is truly an old-fashioned bungalow with somewhat thin walls, so if you're a light sleeper and people are walking around in the night, it might wake you. There is a train that runs infrequently behind the house (we heard two train whistles in our four-day stay), so earplugs would also help with that. All in all, it is a spectacular property, truly magical, and the owners were very responsive and helpful. We hope to be back again regularly!!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a hidden jewel. The surroundings were serene , the home felt like a 5 star resort. For those who like to cook, the kitchen is a dream. The ""white glove"" test passed with flying colors, the housekeeping was immaculate. We cant wait to return ."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time. The lake house is beautiful and very clean. Had everything we wanted in a relaxing vacation. Wish we could have stayed there longer.
2020-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a wonderful stay at David’s place. With two other couples we had plenty of room to hang out, cook and dine together. The outdoor space is amazing with a variety of areas on the deck, by the river and around the fire pit. We also enjoyed being able to use the kayaks. The only small issue we had was with the water pressure, which isn’t great, but we staggered showers and worked it out."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"David and Matthew are such wonderful people. They are on top of everything and made sure we had everything we needed and more. The grounds are amazing and their house has such a wonderful cozy feeling. Perfect for any time of the year. We had access to everything on the property including kayaks, fire pit, the dock, the water, and so much more. They have awesome games you can play and truly thought of everything. I came with my wife, brother and his girlfriend and we had the most amazing time. It was extremely relaxing and definitely what we needed. The property is super clean and we all felt extremely safe during this strenuous period of time we are all in. We even had a chance to see the deer feeding. Truly a wonderful experience and even more wonderful people. We will be back."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"David’s lake cottage is the perfect stay for a family or a an adult getaway. The place was super stylish and immaculate. Lots of space inside and out to spread out and relax. Great deck and lounge area facing the lake for you to read or eat with a view of the water. Great amenities on site and super close to a boat rental where you can rent jet skis, pontoon boats for water skiing and tubing. We couldn’t be happier with this trip. We will definitely be staying here again!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"David's home is a perfect getaway location! It is clean, beautifully decorated, and fully equipped. The host is quick to respond to questions or needs as they arise and was very accommodating to our requests.

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is everything that you can ever dream of. This is a house that has been in the family for generations and it was nice seeing the pictures of that in the kitchen. I thoroughly enjoyed sitting out on the screened in porch in the morning watching all of the wildlife eat from the feeder. There is a lot of wildlife from the surrounding acres and the wetlands directly adjacent to the house. Kayaks are provided which we absolutely loved and helped us explore the river during the beautiful weather. There are little spots all over the property all facing the beautiful view of the water for varying activities - sitting on the Adirondack chairs, around the firepit, loungers for sun, dining/lounging outdoors or playing games. The house is beautifully decorated and very clean and stocked with necessities. They were so accommodating to pets and provided blankets to put over the furniture and towels to wipe muddy paws. There is a huge supermarket that is a 7 minute drive from the house. Thank you again to David and Matthew for hosting us and our four legged family at this beautiful house. We will definitely be returning to make more memories"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a really lovely house right on the water and a large bit of land - the perfect socially distanced getaway from Pittsburgh this summer. We brought paddle boards and enjoyed using the kayaks provided. The property has lots of lovely places to sit and look out on the water, including a screened-in porch and a fabulous big deck. Lots of space for frisbee, croquet, etc, and you can watch the deer come and eat from the feeder in the evening. On rainy days the kids were plenty entertained with games, movies, and there is even a Pac-Man machine. We really enjoyed our stay!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful rental in Northumberland. Lovely space right on the river with room for yard and water activities of all types. Nature abounds with deer, water fowl, groundhogs, and turtles around throughout our stay. The indoor space was thoughtful and well stocked. Outstanding hosts. Would certainly stay here again."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of those places that you want to keep a secret but it absolutely deserves 5 stars all around! Quite possibly the best airbnb experience I've had! David and Matt are fantastic hosts. They are quick to communicate, thoughtful and extremely helpful.
The house and property are STUNNING. There's plenty of land and privacy. Deer visit the feeder frequently! The spacious deck and firepit area are perfect places to unwind with friends and family. Having access to a few kayaks was absolutely a bonus as well! The interior is very clean and decorated stylishly with care.
The kitchen is well stocked. It was great to prep meals inside as well as outside on the very cool double grill! There are thoughtful touches around the house including plenty of blankets and games (which is great to stay cozy if there's rain outside)!
We loved everything about this very special place. We hope to return very very soon! <3"
2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"The riverfront home is decorated impeccably with wonderful homey touches and comfortable furniture, pillows and blankets. Kitchen was stocked to satisfy our every need.

2020-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"The whole experience was great, starting from our fist contact with David, he was very quick with all responses and very helpful. The whole area around the house is beautiful, clean and quiet. House also very clean updated, all furniture is new and pretty, everything is thought through and feels like home. They have everything in the kitchen. Lots of garden games, koyaks, fore place outside. We would put 10 starts if we could! 100% recommend! And we definitely go there again very soon."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was a peaceful oasis, a much-needed respite from the current chaotic world. It was even more picturesque than we were expecting, and there were an endless number of thoughtful touches -- gourmet goodies including hot chocolate and pancake mix, kayaks and PFDs we could borrow (including for children!), board games, citronella candles, flashlights in every room, a s'mores kit and tons of firewood, bug spray... My favorite space was the covered porch, where we watched deer and ducks making Earl's Landing their own. Thank you so much for your hospitality, and we look forward to visiting again!"

David’s home is thoughtfully appointed, stylish, comfortable and fun. Every detail is on point and you won’t want for anything. Also, the communication was outstanding throughout the entire time. David is a lovely guy.
Can’t wait to come back!!!"

From the decor to the kitchen to the cookies, everything was great. It was a perfect fit for our family. We came in the fall so the fireplaces were super cozy. Can’t wait to come back in summertime to enjoy more of the outdoor fun."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We LOVED the decor at David's home. Very stylish and clean! the space was unique and just the right size for our family. We had a great time running the dirtbikes and four wheelers at a nearby outdoor trail riding park, and the wines at Whispering Oaks were fabulous! Easy check-in, and some unexpected treats -- the cookies were awesome! We would definitely consider staying here again."
2019-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was beautiful and spotless, and the setting and views were splendid. Our family had a wonderful time enjoying all the outdoor games, swimming, or simply resting surrounded by beautiful nature scenes. The house is set in a large and private water front property surrounded by protected land. The hosts were very attentive and left nice touches for us to feel welcomed, such as wine in the wine cooler and homemade muffins on the counter. Matt and David met us at the house upon arrival to give us a tour of the house and property. The following day they offered to give us a boat ride, which my family truly enjoyed. Although the property does not offer Wifi, we were able to use our cellphones as hotspots for our laptops without a problem. We like the fact that we had privacy and yet we were only minutes away from main stores and restaurants. We will definitely come back and recommend the house to our family and friends.

The outdoor area was great which included a fire pit, fabulous outdoor seating area, tons of outdoor games and a relaxing area to sit by the river! I would highly recommend this house for a family gathering. The host went out of their way with their hospitality and had very quick responses."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were greeted by the host when we arrived and he showed us around the property and house which were beautiful. The house was sparkling clean and the decor was amazing. The view of the river was awesome and my kids had a blast jumping off of the dock into the water. Everything was there for us, plenty of firewood and even the s’mores! The host was very accommodating and could not be more helpful. There is a lot to do in the area and you can rent a boat to waterski at Shikellamy State Park which is about a mile away. I highly recommend staying here and I have already told friends about the great time we had!"
,,,"Sad Property
Horrible host(s)
Extremely excessive Noise
Tractor Trailers 24hrs a day
Right on top of busy road
Possible cameras on site inside home
Would go anywhere near these people
Left house really clean
Billi complained it wasn’t industrial level clean
House is Harrassful and dismissive
