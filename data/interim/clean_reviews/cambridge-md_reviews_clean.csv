2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The location and the place was absolutely amazing. You are close to Ocean City MD, Baltimore and DC. The calmness and serenity, the water front and Light House was very impressive. The history of Herriot Tubman Underground Railroad museum is a must see. I was so at ahhh with the town and night life. I don’t think people really know about this town and history it’s amazing and my grandson learned so much even about Fredric Douglass born and raised in Eaton,MD. I will definitely come back again. The only thing Gary is missing is a full kitchen. Other than that, the place is a gem and goldmine."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Location in Cambridge is older and nice--not central, but still walkable to the marina and nightlife establishments. Landscaping is well done. The back entrance was a little confusing, but once we saw the hand written sign designating the wrong door, we found the correct door. Using a rear entrance is a challenge, but they made it work. The price was a little high for the location, but at the time I didn't find any other options suitable for three or four people."

2023-01-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"When I was walking towards the rental unit, the host came flailing out the front door to tell me that I needed to move my car. He didn't say ""Welcome"", ""hello"", not even a ""hi"". He came out to tell me to move my car and said nothing else at all. I was parked in the street. I knew right away how the stay was going to go. I was unable to relax in the space because it felt like I was being watched by a Scooby-Doo villain. It's a shame because it's a really nice place."

Probably not the best for location for small children but was an amazing getaway for athletes and adults!"

There's a mini-fridge stocked with water, and a small microwave, as well as some plates and utensils, which we appreciated.
There is also a beautiful garden and patio with tables. There's no place to eat inside but if the weather's good you can eat on the patio, though there are so many great restaurants located within easy walking distance of charming ""downtown"" Cambridge that you might not want to eat in! The home, located on a lovely, quiet street, is close to the Choptank River, and a short drive to the Blackwater Wildlife Refuge and Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Museum. So much to do in this area! We came for the many biking trails in this area, and Gary graciously let us stow our bikes in his garage. We had an amazing time and hope to come back again."

Place was impeccably clean and freshly vacuumed. The visual style of the property is beautiful: garden outside with vibrant flowers, fresh, soft linens and pillows, extras like a Keurig with coffee pods, cream, and sugar as well as multiple bottles of water in the mini fridge. Really nice and thoughtful touches like plastic cutlery and paper plates, napkins, shampoo/conditioner, and soap. Loved the decor of each room and the living room quarters.

2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gary and Hugo have a remarkable place! It is such a cozy stay and in a beautiful area. Gary was extremely personable and gave great local suggestions. Gary and Hugo were having some work done on the house and purchased us a gift card for the inconvenience—yet we certainly did not see it that way. Highly recommended!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The suite is great! Classic design and decor. Bedrooms are huge. Place was very clean with new/wrapped soaps and the like. Gary was incredibly responsive and tried to help me get everything I asked about.
Point of consideration that I should have figured out from the photos and from the name of the place, but as a suite, it’s part of (mostly second floor) of a home where Gary lives. This makes it convenient to ask for help, but note there is a door that connects his unit with the rental unit. This door wasn’t locked during the time of our stay. we could hear the dog from that side, and I imagine they might be able to hear us when we were talking in living room."

All around, a great choice for a peaceful two couple or small family get-away."

Everything was exactly as advertised, and Gary's pre-arrival instructions were detailed so I knew exactly what to do and expect. The neighborhood is great and is a quick walk to a nice downtown area with lots of restaurants. The neighbors are friendly and the old houses are very charming. The wifi in the suite works well and is quite fast, and the bedrooms are huge! I look forward to returning to Cambridge, MD and staying at Oakley Suite in the future."

2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"100% would recommend. Group of 3 couples went. We had plenty of space plus pictures exactly matched house. We walked/biked to restaurants, waterfront and general town area.

We would absolutely stay here again when we are in town to visit family."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Thank you very much for a wonderful weekend. Your home is so comfortable. We felt right at home. Everything we needed was available. You were very thoughtful about the little things one always needs when away. Lots of space with a great mix of traditional and contemporary decor. It was a great home for a dog also. Our little one was very comfortable in the home and loved the fenced backyard. It is an easy walk to the river and downtown. We really enjoyed our stay and will come back again. Thanks
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is a large house. Great for a group trip. Several seating areas. Comfortable bed. Large TV with comfy seating. Fenced in backyard for your dogs and kids.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A charming home with tons of character. We loved the mix of modern construction with the original construction. Everything we needed was pretty much provided within the house. The location makes all of downtown Cambridge and the waterfront very walkable. For other attractions, like the nature preserve or winery, nothing was much more than an easy 20 minute drive. The hosts were responsive and helpful. We loved our stay and will certainly book again if we ever return to the area!"

The kitchen is very modern and has everything you need, and family room is comfortable and inviting. We spent the weekend doing nature photography in the area and this house is central to everything there is to do around Cambridge. We would definitely come back to this house when we want to stay in the area again."
2023-12-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"We'd been to the area a bit before but had never stayed in Cambridge. It's a convenient location, and very walkable to the downtown strip. The house is super clean and tidy, so that was great! Perhaps we were just there during the off season, but it didn't end up being an enjoyable stay. The walls are VERY thin. You will hear everything - inside and out. The neighborhood is pretty quiet thankfully, but if you're in the back bedroom, a car door opening will wake you up. A few more amenities/essentials would have been nice - more than just 3 Keurigs, toilet paper and soap in the downstairs bathroom, etc. I also sent a few messages to our host (once asking if early check in was on option, and the other when leaving about the amazon packages that were delivered the night before.) Never received a response.
It's a much better deal if you have a few more people and the lower cost outweighs the cons."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The Historic district of Cambridge is full of lovely architecture. We walked everywhere with our dog. The people were very friendly. The house was just what I expected. We were a family of six adults and had plenty of space. The dedicated work space was very convenient just off the kitchen and came in handy for those of us that needed to get some work done. The kitchen was well stocked and we found everything we needed. Everything in the house felt brand new. I thoroughly enjoyed staying in such an old house but with all the comforts of newer construction. and modern technology. We visited Cambridge with no agenda and really enjoyed the family time together.
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"I truly loved the house, being an older home it has so much charm and character. I loved the way it was decorated. The house was perfect for my girls trip. I would definitely stay again. The host was great and responsive.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Erin's house is spacious, quiet and very comfortable. The beds are great! Kitchen and baths completely renovated while lots of architectural details such as the original woodwork were preserved. There is a huge living room and dining area off the kitchen. There is a temperature setting on each floor. There are two bath but one of them is on the main level and the other on the second floor that has the three bedrooms, ideally both baths would be on the same level. Overall a very pleasant experience!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place! Would definitely return!
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Erin was a wonderful host. My friends and I loved our stay in her beautiful, historic home. The house is very spacious, comfortable and immaculate.

Thank you Nikky for your excellent service."
2024-06-01,4,Group trip,"Love the aesthetics and the decor in the to combine kitchen dining room area was our favorite. Could have used a blender for smoothies instead of the Margaret machine .

Great location, WELL STOCKED with practically everything we needed.

The kids LOVED the loft (said it was their ""playhouse""). The kitchen was well laid out and stocked - there were even fresh roses to welcome us 🩷.
We definitely recommend and will plan to stay again when in the area.
Note: The only TV is the large one in the family room. So if bedroom viewing is a wish list item, plan to bring your own portable or laptop/device be sure to bring your own."

Amazing large kitchen with plenty of room to cook in. I do with there was a filtered water system but I was able to borrow one of my local friends brita. We enjoyed our stay and would gladly stay again if we have a reason to rent a large house again! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone coming from out of town!

2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved Nikki's home in Cambridge! The home was even more beautiful than the pictures - and the home was well-stocked with everything we needed. We enjoyed exploring Cambridge itself (so many things to explore within walking distance of the home's convenient location - lighthouse, parks, restaurants, tennis courts) and also found it to be the perfect base to explore the surrounding area - St. Michael's, Easton, and the Blackwater Wildlife Refuge which we particularly enjoyed! We would definitely stay here again - a wonderful AirBnB experience all around!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house is adorable and was a great space for seven of us (4 adults, 3 kids). It was very homey and comfortable, and had everything we needed for our stay.

The kitchen is well stocked with pots, pans, dishes, utensils, and basic spices and sometimes more. We would definitely stay again!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a wonderful house to stay in. The Community is great. It reminded us of a small fishing town. There isn't any public beaches close by to swim in, the one that is down a few blocks was used for crab fishing, so we didn't want to take our chances 😉. We had a party of 10 staying, ages 2-50. Everything we could possibly need Nikki had it there for us. Restaurants weren'treally equipped to host us all at one time in Cambridge, but we spent most of our time in Ocean City. All in all we would give Nikki's house a 10/10."

2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"Great house , alot of room, great location with the water and down town in walking distance. Nikki was very quick w responding and the house was so clean, comfy, very cute."
2021-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This house is adorable, the decor is fun, it is roomy for a group, and it is well stocked. The only negatives were that the screening on the porch storm door was completely broken and hanging off, making the screened porch completely open to insects, and a section of the fencing in the backyard was completely knocked down. The screened door should be an easy fix (I bought duct tape to do a temporary fix) but the fencing is a larger repair. Hopefully these can be taken care of before another family with young children rent the home. The location is nice - we walked to a local park, and into town for coffee/breakfast."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Adorable historic house with fantastic ocean-y decor.

2021-05-01,5,Group trip,"Nikki was a wonderful host! She communicated with me several times as my plans evolved, and she was helpful and accommodating! The house was fantastic! It was ideal for my large group! Book this house for a great Cambridge vacation!!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely home in the historic district of Cambridge that we truly enjoyed visiting. Nikki’s house is full of cozy charm, easily walkable to the river and lighthouse, and offered all the small extras we needed (coffee filters, etc.) during our stay. The house was thoughtfully updated with an extremely spacious kitchen & dining area where we spent a lot of our time. Nikki was responsive from booking through checkout and also let us know of a few things happening locally like the farmer’s market, which we appreciated too. Thank you for a wonderful stay!"
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,"Nikki was a wonderful host! We had a group of 6 guys in Cambridge for a fishing trip and the spacious and comfortable house was the icing on the cake. There was plenty of parking which was great since we came from 3 different states and had to drive separately. The neighborhood is very quiet and the house is located within walking distance of several restaurants, I personally recommend RAR BREWING. The amenities were above and beyond the average AirBnB that any of us had stayed at prior. The house was absolutely spotless when we arrived. I would definitely stay here again if i get the chance and highly recommend it for a home away from home."

2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nikki's house in Cambridge's historic district is cozy and charming, with lots of original style showing through her tasteful renovations. We really enjoyed the large and open kitchen and adjoining dining room, perfect for meals together or family game nights.

We found the beds comfortable and the street very quiet at night, perfect for a restful sleep."

Having laundry facilities on the second floor is very handy. Nice front porch rocking chairs for morning coffee, and a large enough fenced in backyard for kids to run around in. Great dining (fresh seafood!) and shopping within easy walking distance."

2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really loved the house. It had everything that we could want for a family of 6. We had plenty of space, and were really comfortable. The kitchen is so fabulous: spacious and stocked. We loved the common spaces and the boys enjoyed being able to sleep upstairs all together on the third floor on the trundle beds. It was great that there were so many bathrooms so people did not have to wait to shower and the hallway bathtub was wonderful. The front porch was a great place to hang out on the rocking chairs, and the enclosed porch in the back had a table for drinks and talking. The house is so charming in a great location and we would definitely consider returning.
We had some issues upon arrival and one of the air conditioners wasn’t working, but Nikki responded right away and tried to solve all of our problems immediately. When she was not able to fix one of the issues, she still found a way to make it right and made us comfortable. She really cares about her guests. I would have appreciated a bit more communication, however, leading up to the trip.
Overall, we had an amazing time!!"

2020-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful house, well located to Chesapeake sights. Very well stocked with many thoughtful touches. Enjoyed the screened porch. The only thing that keeps it from five stars is that the A/C did not work on the third floor. Very hot, even with a fan. Otherwise, a great place, would stay again!"

2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nikki’s house is beautiful and appears to be recently renovated. I was hoping to visit Cambridge to learn about the city and enjoy the historic West End. We only had two people staying but it could easily host more people. The living room is especially comfortable with large couches and a bit TV.
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nikki’s place is absolutely beautiful. From the moment you walk in, it feels like home. It is equal parts old world meets modern. The amenities are spot on. The bedrooms comfortable and the house close to points of interest. Nikki is prompt and Efficient in her communication, which helps to resolve any concerns. Definitely one of the best, if not, the best property we’ve stayed in. Highly recommend."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was absolutely perfect! We stayed with our family for Christmas and celebrated there together and the home provided us with everything we needed to make it a beautiful time for all. We went to visit the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad visitor center and also spent a day at Assateague Island - both only a short distance away.
The town is also really cute and minutes away from the waterfront.
The house was clean and so very cosy. We had a lot of fun seeing all the different rooms and spaces, that were taken care of so well! The kitchen we perfectly stocked for all our needs.
I would definitely recommend this place for a cosy stay with family or friends! And hope we can come back again! Thanks you so much to the host for answering any needs/concerns we had!
Lovely memories made!"

2019-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at Nikki's place!! I was joined by my wife and three young sons, as well as three other IRONMAN athletes. This was a perfect location for my wife and the kids as it's only a few blocks from both the start and finish of IRONMAN MD. It would be a great location to spectate Eagleman as well. Her place was very clean, really nice/ new kitchen and dining space, and plenty of room in the bedrooms. Everything was very clean and well kept, we were more than satisfied and will look to rent again for future races. Would be a nice place to rent outside of IM races as well, close to downtown, close to the water and parks etc. Neighbors were also friendly, the stay exceeded expectations and Nikki was great with communication and instructions, we didn't have to reach out to her for anything!"
2019-09-01,5,Group trip,"My family and I stayed at Nikki's home in September 2019 for the second time. Just like before, everything was perfect!

The front and back porches give the home a special touch, as well as the beach decor inside the home."

It was easy to find and check in. The bedrooms were all nice and comfy. The kitchen was beautiful and fully stocked. The living room was very comfy. We walked into town for most meals, we love Cambridge. If we come back before our house is done we will definitely stay here again and we will recommend it to all our friends."
2019-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nikki's home was comfortable, convenient, clean, spacious and beautiful! We stayed 8 days and the price was basically the same the Holiday Inn Express. The house is spacious. He's 10 and loved having the 3rd floor all to himself!My son and I tagged along with hubby on a work trip since it was Spring Break. It was nice having our own space, washer and dryer and being able to cook in her fabulous kitchen. Nikki was thoughtful enough to give us tips about getting into Washington DC on the metro, which we did as a day trip. It's 2 hours from her door step to the Smithsonian. We did a little day trips all over! Ocean City, MD and Assateague Island National Seashore is about an hour away. The local restaurants close to the house were great. We ate at Portside, Snappers, Jimmie & Sooks, Suicide Bridge Restaurant in Hurlock, Katie Mae's and bought crab to make crab cakes. Cambridge is a beautiful little town. I am very particular and I highly recommend Nikki's home. We look forward to coming back one day."

Check-in was simple, and Nikki was quick to respond to any questions we had. Besides bringing a rolling pin, Nikki’s kitchen had everything we needed to prepare a full Thanksgiving meal; this to us, was huge because so many other places only have the bare essentials and we didn’t want to lug utensils with us or cook everything beforehand. Thank you, Nikki, for a lovely stay. We hope to have an excuse to return!"
2018-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great house that is close to everything in Cambridge.

The communication was excellent. I highly recommend staying there"

2018-04-01,5,Group trip,This house is worth every penny. The neighbor is nice and the location is great.
2018-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our group of far-flung siblings and other family members had a wonderful stay at Nikki's house. The house itself is beautifully renovated and decorated- we kept finding fun and interesting little touches everywhere we looked- and very roomy and comfortable. The kitchen was probably the best-stocked we've ever encountered in terms of plates, pots, utensils, etc. We cooked most meals together and, despite being a large group, never felt crowded. We enjoyed st Cambridge a lot too- Lots of interesting architecture and great to walk around. Had a good meal at the High Spot.
Nikki was a real pleasure to deal with- very responsive, helpful and flexible. We encountered no challenges at all but I'm confident if we had she would have been right on top of them.
All in all, truly a 5-star experience. We will be back!"
2017-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed for the weekend while doing a 30-mile charity walk and had a group of 9. We all stayed comfortably and loved the openness of the 1st floor, the great backyard with screened-in porch and the comfort and charm of the home."
2017-10-01,5,Group trip,"We were blessed with a beautiful weekend even though late October. The home is well equipped, the kitchen stocked much better than most places we've stayed. The rockers on the front porch were a plus. The beds were all very comfy. We had 9 adults, and while evryone was comfortable, the third floor is better suited for children/teens. It's a short drive into town (maybe a mile or so) and to the Lighthouse/marina which is lovely and peaceful. Nikki's place is worth every penny."
2017-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nikki's house is fantastic! Wonderfully decorated & well-equipped, it was perfect for our group. Nikki is super responsive and made sure all our questions were answered. Couldn't have asked for a better stay."
2017-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our group stayed at the house for the 2017 Ironman Maryland race. The decor was tasteful and beautiful, and fit with the area's theme. The location was convenient, with easy 10- minute walks to the river and the High Street eating establishments. We loved the kitchen! Plenty of space to sit and socialize, and well-appointed with good quality appliances and tools that made cooking a breeze. All beds were comfortable and the central air-conditioning and ceiling fans helped keep us cool in the unseasonably warm weather. Nikki was very responsive with questions and the check-in instructions and process were clear."
2017-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home has been beautifully redone! A mix of rustic and coastal while maintaining its historical features. The kitchen is literally my dream kitchen, with perfect amount of space to prepare our large family dinner (we were in town with extended family for my sister's wedding at the local yacht club, which was in walking distance). The open space between kitchen and dining room allowed for easy serving and cleaning up while still hanging together. The third floor bedroom was perfect for my young ones, away from the late night family talk in the living room. Each of the 2nd floor bedrooms comfortable slept my parents and aunts/uncles. The house was fully equipped with sheets and lots and lots of pillows and blankets. All the bathrooms were modern and updated, equipped with fresh towels. Iron and board also available, which came in handy as we prepped for the wedding. Easy access into the house, and Nikki was highly communicative ahead of the trip and made clear she was available, but we didn't even have any questions once we arrived. It was an easy walk to Main Street for a handful of wonderful restaurants. Definitely recommend this home!"
2017-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This home is so beautiful! Decor is so gorgeous! Nikki is a great host and gives you an amazing experience from the first time you walk in. My friends and I wished we would have stayed longer! We were very close to local restaurants and to the water as well.
2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was even nicer than I had expected, very well and recently renovated, nicely decorated in ""beach house"" style, and extremely comfortable. We were a group of four friends and each of us had our own room. The kitchen is well-appointed and user-friendly, and the living space is comfy and spacious. We ate one night on the screened-in porch in the back, and hung out on the front porch rocking chairs one afternoon--super relaxing. The location is on a quiet street that is just few minutes' walk from the restaurants and shops of downtown Cambridge. Nikki was very easy to book with and the self-check-in process worked very smoothly. I would recommend this house to anyone."
2017-09-01,5,Group trip,"This is a beautiful home, walkable to downtown attractions and restaurants in Cambridge! We had a group of 9 people and had plenty of room for all. Nikki is a great host - very responsive and very helpful with anything you may need. We are looking forward to our next trip to this area!"
2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nikki's house is awesome. It was above and beyond what I expected, especially given some of the other places in that area that I've stayed at in years past. Nikki was very helpful, and I would strongly recommend the place."
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is well laid out and very roomy. I love that it is not cluttered with lots of stuff and has just the right amount of decor to add beauty and a nice touch of class. The bedroom in the attic/third floor was the highlight. Once the kids saw the room, they claimed it. Nice little hideaway for the kids with their own private bath. They are still talking about the room just wishing they could be there now to snuggle up in the beautiful warm blanket.
And there's ample food stores nearby, You just can't go wrong with this selection."
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just returned from a weekend stay with 10 people (including three kids under 10), and the house was perfect--huge and well-appointed. It fit us all very comfortably. Everything has been updated but the charm of a historic home remains (think restored hardwood floors, but all updated fixtures, bathrooms and kitchen). The chef's kitchen was great to cook in for our big party, and we also used the brand new grill to cook out one night. The location was also close enough to Easton and St. Michael's for when we wanted to get out for a meal. Great marsh park is so fun and easily walkable from the house. It is right on the water (cool breezes and no bugs!) and they have multiple playground areas which the kids loved. We would have grilled out there if we brought charcoal, but it is a great place to picnic or chill out. They also have huge oversized swings, sort of like porch swings, with nice views of the water. Nikki was a great host and dealt with my multiple questions promptly from first inquiry to check out. She seriously responded within 10 minutes to every email. Would definitely recommend this place!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a charming little place, perfect for me and my husband."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nellie's Choptank Oasis is a small, but comfortable little home that served nicely as a resting place for me as I partook in the sites in the area, i.e., the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge (all day Eagles and Raotors Festival) and some stops along the Harriet Tubman UGRR Byway highway."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Choptank Oasis is everything described and more. It is 1/2 a block from the river and an easy walk over to Sailwinds Park. The neighborhood is beautiful, quiet and very nice to walk around. Lots of bird watching available. Near rt 50 and a quick ride to all the stuff you need. Nellie was a great host and her home is relaxing."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Had a great stay at Nellie’s place. Location was ideal. It’s an easy walk to the river front and park. Ceilings are a little low in the entrance and shower so if you’re taller than 6’4” beware. My husband bumped his head a few times, but not a huge deal! Would recommend staying here."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful stay. The queen bed was sooo comfortable. Often this is overlooked, but there is an abundance of pillows in the closet and this with the already comfortable bed made my trip that much better! The stairs to the basement are very steep and I wouldn’t suggest making that venture with an unsteady gait. This was a cute Air BNB with a lovely view!"

2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place. Close to the water. Take your own wash cloths as these are not provided. Washer on main floor dryer in basement with small narrow steps that are slippery. My fiancée slipped and fell leading to bruising and skinned back. I sent a message to the hostess. Have not gotten a response as of writing this over 14 hours later so I would have to say slow response time for problems.
House was overall good but please use extreme caution if going down those stairs. The handrails are out of reach at the top, you will need to hold to the wall. and if you are carrying wet heavy laundry just be very careful."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great experience staying here. The house was exactly as advertised. The house was very clean, and reasonably priced. We had 4 adults, and a child, but all fit comfortably. A short drive to downtown restaurants, and shops made it easy to see Cambridge. Would 100% stay here again, and recommend it!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Clean, close to everything, great host. Highly recommend!"
2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place! My husband was in town for business and it was a nice quiet place for me to work remotely while he was out
2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,What a great view of the Choptank. We enjoyed our visit to Cambridge. Please note that this home has stairs without a railing at the entrance. The home is very clean and tidy. The space is limited and comfortable for two or three guests. This home is a diamond in the rough.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location right by the water and cozy space. Very clean and easy - and a wonderful welcome book with details on the area. A wonderful homebase to explore Cambridge and the broader shore
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an awesome place. Small and cozy. We had everything we needed. The location is very close to Rt. 50, yet tucked away on a quiet street."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place for two people and the host made access very easy and straightforward. It would be small for more than 3 people. Very tidy as others have mentioned.

2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you want a nice, clean, cozy place to stay in this is a the place for you. Nellie was easy to communicate with and her instructions were simple and easy.

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place, as advertised, no surprises."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Very clean, great location. Nellie was nice. Highly recommend for a party of two."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable. I enjoyed my stay
2021-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,Nellie’s little house was very comfortable for our family of five. Her cleanliness level was high. The location is very good for long walks and easy access to route 50 to explore surrounding areas. We were here at Christmas and enjoyed the local model train exhibition. We also loved the Maiden Maryland store a few blocks away. No time to see the Harriet Tubman museum due to holiday times but we will go again in summer. The walk along the boardwalk and into town to the lighthouse was lovely. Washer and dryer access is greatly appreciated. We would love to stay here again when we happen through the area.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and facility.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great place. great value. good location. perfect for a visit to the Shore.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A very clean and well kept home. Everything was just as promised. We had a wonderful time!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had such a great time at Nellie’s little cottage and private little beach! She greeted us upon arrival and was perfect at communicating. The space was great and clean, very cozy. The proximity to the water and the bridge were perfect. Thank you for a great trip!!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place in Cambridge
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Small, super clean house. Perfect for the 2 of us although another 2 people would be comfortable. Across the street from the Choptank River, short walk to Cambridge Visitor Center, park, fishing. Short drive to restaurants and shopping.
Hosts were friendly, communicative. We would stay there again."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a great cozy place with a wonderful view of the Choptank just down the sidewalk. If you need a place to call home base on an adventure to the area, this is a great option."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cozy home in a wonderful location!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at the Choptank Oasis! The house was adorable, spotlessly clean, and had every amenity we could have needed. The wi-fi was strong enough for us to both work with ease when we needed to, and the smart TV was a great way to relax and unwind at night. We'll certainly stay here again the next time we're in Cambridge! It was a wonderful experience and I recommend this house very highly!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Place was everything we needed and Nellie was very accommodating and always made sure we were okay. I’d definitely do it again.
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,Lovely place to stay. We were in the area for work and it was nice to come back after long days and relax and sleep well. Thank you Nellie!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean. Everything worked. Host quickly responsive to questions. Kitchen utilities a bit understocked is the only negative. Everything else was great.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is well-located for quick access to downtown Cambridge, Route 50, and the waterfront. Kitchen is well-equipped and the smart TV in the living room is a nice entertainment option. Two couches make the LR very comfy. Having two bedrooms provides a lot of flexibility in accommodations. BRs have ceiling fans. Mattresses are on the firm side, which is a personal preference; if that’s not your thing, consider bringing a foam topper. We enjoyed four nights and would stay again."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house is very clean and Nellie is a great host. More confortables beds will make this place a perfect getaway. Enjoyed our stay and the little private beach that comes with Airbnb.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute house in a great location.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nellie’s Choptank Oasis house was perfect for what we were looking for
It was clean and had good amenities for a great stay
Had good offstreet parking, nice air-conditioning, and the private beach access was nice to relax down by the water in the evenings
The town of Cambridge is very nice and you’re only a short distance away from other historic sites and towns
I would rent again if ever visiting down there again"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"an adorable, cozy and very clean home; centrally located for many of the activities in Dorchester County."
2021-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"We had a nice stay but the listing mentioned having access to a private beach which was misleading as the private beach had eroded away. Otherwise, it is at a decent location as were right by the bridge leading out of Cambridge and close to the downtown area."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at the cozy house in Cambridge, Maryland right near the Choptank River. The house was clean, the bed was comfortable, and Cambridge is a lovely little town. We also love how close it is to the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge, which we love to visit to see the amazing wildlife."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely, impeccably clean home, steps to the water on a quiet street, serving as an ideal home base for exploring nearby towns."
2021-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This house was adorable. So convenient too. We loved how close it was to restaurants, the public pier, playground and public beach. It was comfortable and in the cutest neighborhood with awesome views of the river. The only reason I can’t give this 5 stars is because the beach isn’t as pictured. It was pretty beat up. And the ladder leading down was impossible for my mother in law to access. Luckily it wasn’t a big deal because the public beach was very easy for us to walk to."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Awesome location. Easy walk to small private beach, the fishing pier, or visitor center beaches, playground, and more."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We have a really lovely time! Very accessible to the playground and beach.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is lovely, with all wood flooring and original carpentry, and everything fits snugly in each room. We found this place very comfortable, and the shops and seafood restaurants were within easy walking distance. Important to know that beaches are very small indeed, so the area is more about boating and fishing. Nellie was friendly and accommodating, providing us with assistance on restaurants and wireless questions. We really enjoyed it and if visiting Cambridge again, this is where we would want to stay!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location -we enjoyed being able to walk to the fishing pier and sail winds park. Nice views of the river from the home - relaxing location!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Just a minute walk from the water and not far from many stores and restaurants. We enjoyed our stay!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This cozy little house was very comfortable for our family of four, and extremely clean. It is in a nice location, an easy walk to the river, local restaurants, and a nearby playground and pier. It's about 20 minutes away from Blackwater Wildlife Refuge which we love to visit for it's biking, fishing, and kayaking. Nellie was very responsive during our stay. This house was a good value, and we would definitely stay again when we visit the area!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cute and cozy home in walking distance to the beach, pier and playground and a quick drive to everywhere we wanted to go. A really lovely place to stay for us and our 1.5 year old."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nellie’s place is a sweet little house just steps from the water. We stayed with our 2 little ones for a weekend, and appreciated the quick 10 minute walk (at a 5 yr old’s pace) to the big playground at Sailwinds Park. Be sure to take the footpath under the overpass! There’s a ton of food nearby as well, most in walking distance and all within a 5 minute drive.
The house was immaculately clean and there are clear instructions for everything. We will definitely be back!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice comfortable, basic spot, nearer the water than it seemed from the pictures with a private beach on the river - the size of the beach is reduced at high tides."
2021-02-01,2,Stayed with kids,"Disappointed. The host didn't communicate pre-arrival, including not sending check-in instructions, so we had to text her as we drove up (I don't need that kind of anxiety in these pandemic times). We didn't expect much, and only booked this place based on the ""beach"" access, so my daughter could have a place to dig in the sand, but that was a bust -- it was hard to find, across a field of goose droppings with a scary number of ""No Trespassing"" signs, and down steep stairs, only to find a debris-littered tiny patch of sand MUCH smaller than the pictures. We ended up walking down to the Sailwinds Park beach (5-10 minutes) so she could play. The setup inside the house is cute, if simple, stocked with all essentials, and very clean. And the location was good, nice to be able to walk along the river, to the playground (5-10 minutes), and into town (15-minutes). TIP: follow the path from the fishing pier (instructions in the coffee table binder) and you don't have to cross the busy road."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely little home with convenient access to Cambridge, the Harriet Tubman museum, and wildlife reserve. House was comfy with all that we needed to make some home cooked meals. Hope to see Cambridge in warmer months."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So cozy and peaceful in a beautiful location. Near the water, a walk literally a couple seconds away. Definitely worthy of a visit."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house is cozy, and charming. Nellie does a great job at ensuring that everything is sparkling clean, and the location is great. We walked the path under the bridge to Sailwinds park every day of our trip, and enjoyed takeout from Blackwater Bakery, Ava's, and Theo's. While we didn't use it much, having a good size tv was a nice feature, as was the strong wi-fi for when we needed to get some work done."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nellie's place is exactly as advertised and one of the cleanest Airbnbs we have stayed in. We loved that you could see the water from the living room and hope to visit again when the weather is warmer to use the little private beach.
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at Nellie's place. Like the first time, we had great fun with beautiful views of Choptank right from the living room. Highly recommended!"

2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nellie's house is right by a lot of great restaurants and easy access to the highway to get to Easton, St. Michaels, or other spots on the Chesapeake Bay. The private beach gets you a great view of the Bay"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend Nellie's cozy home near the water. It had everything we needed and was super clean and comfortable. Nellie was very responsive and accommodating throughout. We'll be back!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Convenient location, just over an hour's drive to Assateague or other beaches. The house itself is very clean and comfortable."
2020-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,Perfect little spot with just a few steps to a private beach. Perfect when social distancing and shallow warm water for young kids. Nellie was very responsive and gracious when we managed to lock ourselves out within 30 minutes of arriving.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place for a long weekend. We enjoyed playing at Sailwinds Park with our kids, scooting along the water, playing in the sand, and splashing in the water. The cottage was the perfect space for our family of four and very comfortable."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay at Nellie’s place. Extremely clean and great location. Nellie was a great host and checked in to make sure everything was ok. Highly recommend staying here. It was the perfect little getaway for my family.

2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location! If you are looking for peace and quiet to relax - this is the place. Beautiful sunrises over the river, a nice walk into the downtown area of Cambridge. Nellie is very helpful and lives near by - we had a wonderful weekend here."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely summer weekend getaway here! Great location, super clean, and Nellie is a kind, responsive host. Access to the private beach on the Choptank is wonderful and the public beach at the park is walking distance as well."
2020-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nellie is a great host, who was super helpful. We stayed at her place and end up extending our stay several times due to the ongoing pandemic. She was very gracious and helpful, and even volunteered to reduce rates for the extended stay, which was very nice of her. We really appreciated it.
The location is amazingly beautiful, right next to the Choptank river, with great view of water and birds, and plenty of opportunities go for runs and walks. The place is nice and comfy for a small group or family. We had a great time all around. Highly recommended!"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice house in a good location.
2020-01-01,5,Group trip,Great location in Cambridge! Pretty views of the water. Nellie was helpful when we needed her!

We would definitely stay here again. Thanks so much Nellie!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nellie was great to work with! House was perfect for attending Dank Day, great location. Thank you!"

2019-07-01,4,Group trip,Really good place for those needing value and close to Hyatt!
2019-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The house is a lovely little house walking distance from the Choptank River. It’s on the other side of Route 50 so a bit of a bike ride or longer walk into Cambridge. It’s a short distance by car. Cambridge is a perfect place to be located if you want to experience a lot of different places on the Eastern Shore.
2019-06-01,5,Group trip,This was a great place to stay. House was clean and tidy. It was my wife and I and 3 boys and there was plenty of space. I only wish we could have stayed longer. Good communication and super easy check in. Appreciated the coffee and the water and the air conditioning on a very hot day. It has a great view of the river with close access. Close to restaurants and bars. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place to stay.
2019-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice simple house, set with care, perfectly clean and functional. Great option for family weekend. There is a close by beautiful small public beach, right next to a great playground. A happiness combo for kids and parents! Is a relatively small town but with good options for basics such as supermarket, pharmacy, restaurants and coffees. Nellie is super responsive and welcoming. We would love to come back!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful host and lovely place. James was very responsive, accommodated a late checkout, and everything about the place was well thought out (with snacks, a well-stocked kitchen, plenty of clean linens and towels)."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"James’s home was so nice & comfy. Many tasteful upgrades have been made to the inside of this home, so even though it is an old house, it is very nice inside. Nothing forgotten and many extras. In addition, his kindness was very much appreciated. We really loved our stay."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We will definitely be back, we loved it."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at James' was great! From the beginning, he was easy to communicate with, very friendly and helpful, and very accomodating. And, the place was perfect - bedrooms, kitchen, sitting and reading rooms - a total pleasure. It's in a nice quiet little neighborhood, but only a quick couple minutes drive from markets, fuel and food, and close, too, to 'downtown' Cambridge. I recommend James and his home without reservation, and would go back in a heartbeat."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice little house, nice town with pretty good restaurants. the host James was very responsive and checked in to see if we needed anything."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mickey’s place is great. Conveniently located in Cambridge, easy in and out to Route 50 and was a good hub for me for my visit to Blackwater. Quiet neighborhood. Home is charming and welcoming. Perhaps the most well-stocked AirBnB I’ve experienced! I’m sure we’ll be back."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was a very nice place, close to a lot of places we wanted to go, but without the cost of staying in Saint Michaels or other locations closer to the water. A 30 minute drive to everywhere. The house itself was very nicely set up. We felt right at home."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a fabulous place and James “Mickey” was Awesome! Will definitely be back! ❤️

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"James is an outstanding host.
he communicated early and often but was not intrusive.

his place is well maintained and worth the price."

2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet neighborhood, with easy 5-7 minute drive to historic district. Alot of care and pride has been put into the home to make it comfortable and clean, with many kitchen and bath amenities. Once you enter the house from the side door, you are in a den/sitting area, and there is a step up into the rest of the house. You can see that James has thought of what guests could need, from lots of towels and blankets to coolers that you can borrow and local sight-seeing information. James was very responsive throughout. We had a problem with the lock when we arrived, and James answered the phone immediately and helped us with it. The next day, when we called to let him know of some wind damage from a storm, he also answered immediately and took care of the problem. You can tell that James cares about his home, and that his guests are his priority."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,James/Mickey was a great host! Super friendly and helpful. He had great local suggestions for food and excursions. His house is thoughtfully furnished with extra beddings and beds. He also has lots of local brochures and the bathrooms were well equipped as well!

It's very spacious, homey, and had everything I needed, including a dryer to dry my swim gear each day. The host was very friendly and made sure everything went smoothly. I would definitely stay here again in the future!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My visit lasted two nights, and being new to the area, I was very interested in seeing the sites. Roslyn Cottage is located in the center of a number of things to see and do. If you're not familiar with the history of Harriet Tubman's lifelong work, you'll find a number of excellent venues. You're also not far from any inlet with great seascapes, places to eat along the water, and lots of crab, lobster and fresh fish. Roslyn Cottage is on a very quiet, private street with driveway parking, and remodeled rooms that provide you all the comforts of home. James is super attentive, from booking to close, and is ready to help you with any issues. The cottage has two large bedrooms, with their own private baths, on each end of the house, with living area in between...perfect for two couples to enjoy a stay. All as described. Highly recommended!!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Happy to find a dog friendly stay near the marina when I had to work on my boat. James communicated very clearly. And I was very comfortable. Enjoyed hanging out on the back deck with visiting family in the peaceful backyard. Would definitely re-book in the future.

Our dog was welcome, and we enjoyed exploring the neighborhood, especially the walks down to the water. James also provided plenty of information about local attractions, which we used to plan our explorations of the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge and the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Byway and the Visitor Center. We would go back again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I have stayed in places being I constantly travel for work. Hardly ever is a place better and nicer than what the pictures look like. James's retreat was exactly that.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"James is good people. His freezer went out and he went above and beyond to make us comfortable. Very knowledgeable and proud of his community. If you’re a fisherman he’s a great local for good information.
House was clean, clean, clean! Plenty of room. Super cool marble kitchen island he said he got out of an old candy shop. Plenty of cooking utensils to make meals. Super close to several restaurants and stores."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Roslyn Retreat was a great value. The house was clean and cozy with very nice furnishings and a very comfortable sleep number bed. Mickey was very responsive, though the house was well stocked, and we didn't need a thing. If you need to be near Cambridge, this is the place to stay!
Pam"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"James (goes by Mickey) is a fantastic host. Responsive, kind, and the listing was super clean. We hope to return. Thank you, Mickey!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is an older home that has been lovingly updated to be an excellent place to stay in Cambridge. The home is immaculate, and well-appointed. The location is great, as I was working at the Hyatt right around the corner. I had a lovely walk along the water in the mornings with the dogs. The home is cozy, private, comfortable, and clean. Mickey the host was attentive, and I felt very safe and well-cared for. It was great for the dogs-Mickey even provided crates and dog bedding! I would definitely stay here a second time."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay, accommodations were exactly as advertised. It’s a perfect bay cottage for a weekend away in Cambridge."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,James (Mickey's) place was exactly as expected and accommodating for us with our dog. The backyard is mostly fenced in so we were able to take our dog out back and play with all the sticks from the big shade tree. Great stay! Thank you!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Mickey was a gracious host. We couldn’t be happier with the venue and taking us in under such short notice. He was very accommodating and supplied my kids and I with a few toiletries for our stay, as we’d forgotten a few things. The home is cozy with a modern kitchen that has a charm all its own. The bed is super comfy as well. I would definitely recommend this location, and Mickey. Thank you again Mickey!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"James - Who goes by(Mickey) was WONDERFUL. Ran me through the home when I arrived and had everything I needed to have a successful stay. My girlfriend and I stayed for Ironman Maryland and the location was absolutely perfect for the event. Anyone thinking of staying with Mickey and visiting the area should for sure stay. Anyone doing Ironman Maryland should ABSOLUTELY stay here, you won't regret the convenience!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I loved Kristin’s place. Charming Victorian home. The bed was to die for, super comfortable. We were able to bring our older dog along and the ease of getting in and out straight to the back yard was very much appreciated. I loved the hand drawn art pieces on the wall! This town/location has a lot to offer without being too busy. I hope to stay there again."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kristin's home is lovely, just as the listing suggested. She has put a lot of effort into the furnishings and decor. The place is very ""cool"", rather eclectic. I felt like I was staying in someone's private home, not a rental at all. More than enough room to move about, charming bathroom, huge and comfy bed and a great kitchen. A few hundred feet from the water and a short walk to all the restaurants. Charming neighborhood. If you want to go to the Eastern Shore or Cambridge, this is the home to rent! Thank you Kristin"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Pamela’s place was perfect for a short get-away to Cambridge and Dorchester County. I especially liked the proximity to the park and water nearby. The neighborhood was quiet and also had a neighborhood feel. The location was also close to downtown and some nice spots to eat.

The bed was extremely comfortable and the bedding was too."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My friend and I were in Cambridge for the Wild Goose Chase Women’s cycling weekend. Pamela’s place was perfect. The apartment was within walking distance to shops and restaurants. The beds and living room furniture was comfortable. Everything was very clean. I especially appreciated the nightlights. This was not a problem for us but the small shower stall may be an issue for some.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This worked well for what we needed. It was walkable to area shops and restaurants and had a park close to the water and the Choptank lighthouse.

2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I/we had a great time in Cambridge celebrating a friend’s birthday. Pamela provided a binder full of helpful suggestions for things to do, restaurants to dine at and things to do. Our group did The Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Byway as suggested by Pamela. We ate at Salty’s Restaurant. The seafood was delicious! A Little Slice of Cambridge was perfect for our needs. The only thing I wished there was a fenced in yard. Look forward to visiting again. Thanks!
Evelyn n Phyllis"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We were in Cambridge for my daughter's wedding and needed a place in between all the festivities. "" Little Slice of Cambridge"" was just the place for the downtime. It was very welcoming and clean. The beds were comfy and rooms spacious and the whole place unique and inviting. The only negative would be the small shower but it would not deter me to stay here again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Excellent property. Clean, well maintained, comfortable. Older property, but thoughtfully updated with modern plumbing, electrical outlets, etc. Extremely walkable. Drive to shopping (groceries, etc) within easy range (1-2 miles/5 or so minutes). If we return to Cambridge it will be our first choice for a place to stay."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful stay here - the location was perfect and the apartment was well stocked with everything needed for young children. Pamela and Ric were what really made the visit special, though; they worked overtime to make sure our stay was a good one. Highly recommend!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Three of us really enjoyed our stay. The location was perfect (we walked to breakfast both days) and there was enough street parking for our two cars. One of the bedrooms had a squeaky door and Pamela and Ric took care of it immediately after I contacted them. The house was clean and quiet. The beds were very comfortable.
Four notes:
- There are window AC units, which are mentioned in the amenities section but I missed that. I slept comfortably even though I am temperature sensitive.
- The twin beds are short and one of them has a bed frame at the bottom. My 5' 10"" friend slept on the twin bed without the frame at the bottom and his feet dangled.
- The shower is tight.
- There is an additional apartment on the second floor. I only heard someone walking up there once.
The Airbnb felt like home. I would definitely stay here again. Thank you!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for Ironman 70.3 Eagleman. Pamela's place is a great location to set up shop for the race. Easy to walk to both Gerry Boyle Park for the race expo / transition as well as walking into the main town center with all the shopping and dining.
The place was as advertised. Very clean, quiet evenings, comfortable bed. Check in and out were super easy.
If and when I decide to do the race again, I will certainly look into staying here again.
Would recommend. Even if it isn't for the race. A good central location for the area in general."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Little Slice of Cambridge is a lovely, unique apartment in a location that is walkable, close to cultural sites, near waterfront access, and restaurants. We were able to really immerse ourselves in Cambridge by being in town but also enjoyed relaxing in the living space which has a lot of nice touches. It is one of the few airbnb offerings that I have encountered that has a king bed which is a plus."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The location was fantastic and the house is nice and comfortable- a perfect place for anyone coming over for IMs or other races at Gerry Boyle. Beds super comfortable and nice amenities in the kitchen. Loved sitting on the front porch having coffee.

I’d choose it again. 😊"

Took a day trip to St. Michaels. Thank you Pamela!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Fantastic!! Pamela's place is wonderful! The home is in a beautiful historic district. So many amazing homes in the neighborhood. The king size bed was the best!! It is stocked with everything you need for a short or long stay. The river front is just two blocks away. Pamela is very accommodating and responsive. Book this one! You won't be sorry!

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location, an easy walk to downtown and to the waterfront. The apartment is roomy and very comfortable. We didn't eat there since there are so many great restaurants in Cambridge and nearby, but the kitchen was well equipped and we appreciated the coffee, creamer and snacks. Pamela is a great host. She always responded quickly to messages and was able to accomodate us for an early check-in. A great place to enjoy a visit to the Eastern Shore."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was clean. Quirky touches like the shark toilet paper holder and popcorn machine. Great location if staying for Eagleman or IMMD. Walkable to town. Window air conditioning units in both bedrooms and living room - they weren’t loud but did add some background noise; they worked very well and we had no issues even when it was blistering hot outside. Shower is a standup and small but has an aftermarket shower head with good pressure. There is an apt above and you could hear footsteps sometimes but not loud and we didn’t hear them at night.
2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Pamela's place, a convenient location within easy walking distance of Long Wharf Park (river front park with Yacht Club view), downtown Cambridge shops and restaurants. Short drive to national parks, attractions, and other waterside communities. One disappointment (over which our hostess had no control) was that many shops and restaurants in Cambridge and surrounding towns are closed Monday - Wednesday, so if you're looking for the full compliment of activities, Thursday - Sunday would be your best bet."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Everything was great. Plays looked better in person. Enjoyed my short stay! Thank you!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed our stay at Little Slice of Cambridge! Beautiful accommodations with many nice touches!

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Nicely appointed spot walkable to the lighthouse and lots of restaurants in downtown Cambridge. Pamela was very responsive and check in/ out was effortless. This is the first floor of a two story house, though we never heard anyone moving around upstairs. It felt very private. Great location! Loved the living room and had a very comfortable king size bed. Would stay here again."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Funny apartment. Good for visiting New York. Near a great park that gives access to the staten Island beaches.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We booked Little Slice of Cambridge for our annual girl's weekend. However, it would be a great place for a family vacation as well. It is in a great location. We were able to walk to the restaurants and bars as well as the lighthouse. The town of Cambridge is adorable and is good for anyone looking for a low key, relaxing getaway. The house itself was very comfortable. The host included so many small, thoughtful touches that went above and beyond most Airbnb's that we have stayed at. We would definitely recommend a stay here."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This place is a true gem! Location is ideal for walking to town or the marina. The apartment is immaculately clean, very comfortable and cutely decorated. We look forward to staying there again."

We walked in to a spotless home with every amenity we needed or even thought we would need. The area is gorgeous, easy to walk around or drive a short way to town. We would 10000% stay here again."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay! Affordable, easy to get to, easy to park, and very close to downtown.
The house is decorated, furnished, and supplied well to make the property feel comfortable and be easy on travelers. It feels like the owner thought of everything a family could need.
Furniture was clean and comfortable.
The WiFi came in very handy because cell service out here isn't great.
I could go on for a long time, but the point is this was a great stay"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location is PERFECT! Once we got there on Friday, we didn’t use our car again til we left on Sunday.
Neighbors were friendly.
And you could walk to so many good restaurants and historic places.
Now, we didn’t need a “luxurious bathroom” by any means, but the shower was very small. Now, my husband and I are big people (6ft+ tall), so it probably seemed extra small to us lol. However, that wouldn’t deter us from staying there again. Just FYI. The place was great!!
And if we had brought our kids it would’ve been great for them too.
The host was very nice and very easy to get ahold of. Such an amazing trip!!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cute little place close to everything in Cambridge. I stayed here with just me an my dog and had a great time. Close to downtown and waterfront for easy walking. Cozy, comfortable and easy parking. Little touches that made my dog feel welcome. Everything I could ask for."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay for mother's day! We were with my 7 month old daughter, and having the pack 'n play and highchair was really great, less things to worry about! The house was very neat & clean, and had everything we needed in the kitchen. It was a great stay and an easy walk to downtown. Would highly recommend!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A very comfortable apartment in a great location for exploring Cambridge and the surrounding area. Everything was just as we expected.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Brought the kids to Cambridge to do some stargazing at the Blackwater Refuge. Pamela’s home is in the historic district and just a few walkable minutes to restaurants, and the water. It was also a quick drive to the refuge which was helpful coming back late at night.
Pamela’s home is nautically decorated and in very nice shape (I LOVED the two arm chairs in her living room). Her home has everything you need with a fully stalked kitchen, bathroom towels were bright white and fluffy (another favorite!) Bedding was perfectly clean, and mattresses in both bedrooms were very comfortable! I’m sure we’ll be back!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay at Pamela's house. It was clean and comfortable. We enjoyed our time in Cambridge.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Pamela's home was more spacious than expected, and in such a great location. Only two short blocks from the water and a few blocks from downtown. Very walkable. Her home was also very welcoming to both our toddler and our dog. Pamela suggested that we check out Emily's Produce, and I'm so glad we did! We ended up going twice during our weekend. We also walked down to the lighthouse and checked out some restaurants. Thank you Pamela, we will be back!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location of the apartment is perfect! We felt like we could experience an authentic Eastern Shore neighborhood while being walking distance from great restaurants and the Harriett Tubman museum.

The beds were comfy, there were toys & furniture to accommodate kids, and the popcorn machine was a fun surprise! It was easy to get to downtown, and their restaurant recommendations did not disappoint. Would highly recommend staying here for a family.

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a gem! It’s beautiful, cozy and much bigger than we expected. It’s in a safe and friendly neighborhood. What really stood out were all the thoughtful touches: the many different types of glassware, bottled water, snacks, coffee, spices, kitchenware, toys & equipment for children (we don’t have any but I just kept thinking how kid friendly the apartment felt), a nightlight in every room and, of course, the popcorn machine! You can tell they put a lot of thought into making sure your every comfort is met. Loved it!"

2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Wes & Deb were very quick to respond to questions. The house was well appointed and maintained. And I had a pleasant flashback with the retro 60's look. The record player was another real treat!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was absolute gem. From the retro theme bought me back when I was a younger person. The property was very clean and spacious for the couple days we stayed. We stayed as a girls time away to enjoy time together and this house was perfect fit for our little outing. We enjoyed the kitchen where we prepared our dinner the first night, nice to have new appliances to use that were very nice & clean. Everything was very comfortable even the neat game room it was fun to see the extra items we could use while there if we have had more time. But if we come back to the area we would like to extend a little more time to spend in this great property. Thanks Wes and Deb we enjoyed our little vacation in your wonderful home."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful house with great amenities. I especially appreciated the coffee machine with starbucks drip coffee each morning. The kitchen had all brand new appliances. The couches and beds were especially comfortable. Relaxing in the game room with music from vinyl was an experience unlike one I have ever had in an AirBnb to date. Truly lovely.
This house is only a mile away from downtown Cambridge with delicious local restaurants as well as grocery/department stores, while feeling cozy and out of the way on a small dead end street."

2023-07-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"The oven did not work, and I notified the owner upon arrival. Two days later it was determined by the owner the oven would need to be replaced. Therefore, I spent the entire stay without the ability to cook. There were bugs and dirt throughout the house, holes in the wall, and peeling paint. There was an odor in the house and rust on the mirrors in the main bathroom as well as a large stain on the top of the tub. I have rented numerous Airbnbs and this one was the most disappointing. Many repairs and a deep cleaning need to happen for this to be a true rental and to reflect what I have learned are top standards of hosts who care about renters."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very responsive host that worked hard to make it a great stay. Close to the Ironman course for those training or racing!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay and get around St Michaels, Cambridge, and extremely close to Blackwater Refuge. Peaceful garden with birds galore."

We would definitely recommend the place!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a really comfortable and relaxing stay at Kathy And Rick’s place. The place was beautiful, full of thoughtful touches, and you could simply sit all day and watch the birds in the garden. Their forest and farm is a treat to explore. It is conveniently located close to Blackwater NWR, a haven for birdwatching. Kathy and Rick are two of the loveliest hosts we've met. This place comes highly recommended!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The property is a piece of Heaven, quiet, walkable, peaceful (except for duck hunters on nearby property).
but they gave me a bright orange vest to wear so I was safe. Kathy and Rick have very friendly personalities, were available when I wanted to talk and allowed me time and space for my own retreat. I was able to read and write in a way I just can't focus in the city. The apt was comfortable and warm as I requested. There was no stove yet with with their microwave and my hotplate, I got along just fine. Being near Blackwater was great and there are also other spots on the water to explore."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My son and grandson enjoyed their stay over Christmas very much. They felt welcomed and were comfortable. It was close enough to our house to be a useful choice. And the scones were outstanding! Thanks.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my third stay at Kathy and Rick's place. It is the perfect location to visit my family in MD and the space is just what I need when I am in town.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is awesome. Great hosts that treated us like family!
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Traveled to the area for a wedding on Hoopers Island. This location was closer to the venue than hotels in Cambridge. Private entrance, which I appreciated, as well as a full kitchen and living space. My only complaint is that it is not contactless entry, but otherwise, was great for the purpose that I used it."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kathy and Rick were wonderful hosts who welcomed me and helped me with my bike and bags. Kathy is a wonderful baker and shared a piece of chocolate cake she had just baked. She also left me delicious bread slices that I nibbled on for 5 days. The accommodations were lovely. Having 3 rooms to hunker down in during a tropical storm was delightful. My hosts suggested sites to see and places to eat once the weather improved. I look forward to coming back sometime in the future.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect stay. Beautiful space. Excellent people, very friendly and helpful."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We found this place at the last minute and it was such a find. Their farm is lovely, close to water, and there is great cycling in the area. The place is spotless and comfy (although you can hear voices from the main part of the house). I would gladly stay again if I was heading to that part of the world. We even came home with fresh eggs from their hen house! It was a nice place to relax."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rick and Kathy are exactly as the reviews say - warm, welcoming, and friendly. Their place is much more than a great place to stay, it's a restful and relaxing farm with places to sit and swing, places outside to eat dinner, and places to walk. It's a great place to slow down. We so enjoyed their place. They were wonderful hosts."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a perfect quiet rural getaway. As mentioned in previous reviews, Rick and Kathy are warm and wonderful hosts.
We have never stayed on a tree farm before, and it was so interesting to read about the work they ave done to preserve this beautiful environment.
The Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge refuge is just a few miles away. We went there three times and saw our first bald eagle.
Kathy is a professional baker and we may have happily gained five pounds during our four nights day.
If we are fortunate enough to return, we’d love to explore their walking trails."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our time at Kathy and Rick's cozy hideaway amongst the pine trees. We enjoyed quiet time on the glider under the pergola, and a long walk on the beautiful wide path through the pine forest. Their location was a good base for our exploration of Dorchester County's history, including the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Historical Park in Church Creek and the Harriet Tubman Museum in Cambridge. Kathy and Rick gave us good recommendations on local Cambridge restaurants. Overall, a perfect weekend."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay with Kathy & Rick. They were there to greet us and show us the lovely space attached to their home. In addition to this space, they let us explore the whole property and so we were able to use the grill to cook outside and eat in the screened room, bike the trails, visit with the chickens, and drive to the pond. Kathy & Rick were very hospitable and provided extra touches that I appreciated like a breakfast treat, coffee & teas, brochures and maps of the surrounding area, and great advice on places to dine an explore. When we needed something they were very responsive and let us use some of their kitchen items to cook. I'd stay here again-- though would come better equipped for swarms of mosquitos! :)"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,I can't say enough nice things about staying at Kathy and Rick's place. They really do want you to have a great experience and will help you with whatever you need. The apartment has plenty of privacy and was easy to work from if needed. Amazing access to all of the surrounding nature and also Cambridge is just a stone's throw away. Thanks again for the great hospitality and wishing you all lots of joy.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathy & Rick are wonderful hosts--genuinely warm and hospitable. They were proactively helpful, and also provided much privacy. The unit has many thoughtful touches--including delicious cake from a local bakery! The bed is GREAT!
The property is a certified tree farm, so lots of woods with trails, lots of wonderful birds--I saw a red-headed woodpecker for the first time in my life! (and I'm a birder!). And they have four gorgeous, amusing, talkative hens, ""The Girls,"" who enjoy having the guests visit with them.
I will happily return to this property the next time I need a fairly local get-away retreat."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An excellent home base for exploring Cambridge, Blackwater Natural Wildlife Refuge and the surrounding area. Rick and Kathy were so kind and beyond helpful and the space was comfortable and well appointed."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our 6th wedding anniversary trip to an amazing place full of history and beautiful nature. We loved walking through the mixed forest. We were humbled by the beautiful Blackwater nwr. As hosts, Kathy and Rick were warm, welcoming, and generous. The place had everything we needed and then some. The bed was soft and comfortable, the living area very clean and cozy. After acquiring some provisions from the country store, we got seafood from Lindy's and made a great dinner in the little counter-top oven. We really wish we had more time to spend at this perfect location!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband was racing in the Eagleman triathlon in Cambridge, and we were looking for a quiet place to call home for the weekend. Kathy and Rick’s place was perfect. We enjoyed their outdoor seating area one afternoon, where we saw a red headed woodpecker, goldfinch, and hummingbird. Very peaceful and relaxing.
Kathy and Rick were very friendly and kind, giving us local dinner recommendations, and even surprising us with a goodie bag the day of the race.
If we had more time, we’d enjoy exploring the wetlands their home backs up to.
Highly recommend!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathy and Rick provide an amazing AirBNB! I had travelled here with my best friend to go kayak snakehead fishing. There was plenty of space to park both our boat trailer and the truck. Kathy and Rick greeted us when we arrived and where everything welcoming. We were invited to use any of the decks/pavilions as well as to walk the trails and visit/fish the pond. I caught half a dozen bass at the pond and greatly enjoyed watching the various wildlife. Rick took us on a tour of the farm and was a great and informative guide.
I will definitely use their AirBNB again if I travel back to this area. Thank you Kathy and Rick for being such awesome hosts!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time here because we loved it so much the first time. Kathy and Rick have created an oasis. The home is spotless, comfortable, and well equipped. It is exactly as described in the listing. The grounds are extensive and have a pond and walking trails. The bird feeders are full and they attract all sorts of birds. My favorite was the red-headed woodpecker. There are several beautiful places to sit outside and watch the birds. We came to the area to visit Blackwater NWR so this location couldn't be better. Kathy and Rick are wonderful hosts. They greeted us when we arrived and were always available with suggestions on where to go and had wonderful stories to tell. You can engage with them as much or as little as you want. After an evening toasting hot dogs and marshmallows with them over the fire pit, they seem more like friends than hosts. We will have to go back a third time."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fabulous hosts, lovely surroundings, very comfortable bed, definitely exceeded our expectations!!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay- our hosts were very friendly and helpful - they went above and beyond. Accommodation was perfect and location very peaceful and relaxing. Lovely walks around property and wonderful wildlife- we saw an Osprey nest with a chick during one of our walks on the property. Would definitely recommend and plan to return in the future!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay with Kathy and Rick at Madison Nature Getaway. The farm is beautifully maintained with numerous trails and lots to explore. Easy day trips of 15-40 mins to a number of local Eastern Shore attractions: Blackwater Refuge, Harriet Tubman Center, Cambridge, Oxford, St. Michaels, etc. Kathy and Rick were extremely friendly and made for gracious hosts. The accommodations were just as advertised and were very clean and comfortable. We will definitely be back."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rick and Kathy did everything possible to make our stay a pleasure. They were the most considerate and welcoming hosts we've ever had for Airbnb. We enjoyed their company and their recommendations. We enjoyed talking with them and walking on their tree farm and learned so much about the area. Their place is a treasure.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a comfortable, peaceful stay at Kathy and Rick's! We enjoyed their walking trails and many outdoor sitting areas. They made us feel right at home with a well-stocked kitchen and cozy living and sleeping areas. Kathy and Rick are wonderful, responsive hosts.
This is a fantastic get-away for a single person, couple, or family with small kids.
We look forward to staying here again!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super quiet and comfortable indoors. Great outdoor setting with lots of wooded paths and a nearby pond with a photo blind for enjoying birds and other wildlife. Hosts were super communicative and helpful - a truly delightful couple. Can't wait to visit again. Close to Cambridge and Blackwater NWR.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay. Have been here twice before and love the peacefulness that their place and grounds bring us. We hiked their property and enjoyed the coziness of their place. Great place to disconnect. Kathy and Rick are very hospitable and friendly.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Kathy and Rick were great hosts. From the moment we arrived they were friendly and quick to offer lots of info about the local area and even show us around the farm. We brought our 9-month old baby with us and the space was great for the three of us. We brought a pack and play and the baby slept in the kitchen area. We had a lovely weekend exploring the area and checking out some of the local wildlife. We really liked the Harriet Tubman visitor center and the Blackwater wildlife preserve.
2023-01-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Very nice people but don’t expect privacy.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathy and Rick are easy going and genuine. They made us feel at home. We enjoyed walking around their woodlands. Nearby Blackwater Wildlife Refuge was quiet and beautiful both for hiking and kayaking…we want to return in warmer weather.
Two things to note are the slow internet and no cooktop. I learned to use the countertop oven and microwave for cooking so we ate well!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at Kathy and Rick's place. So peaceful and yet close to adorable towns like Cambridge, Oxford and St. Michael's. Highly recommended. Would definitely return!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My time at Kathy's and Rick's apartment was lovely. They are warm, caring, and most hospitable. The unit is clean, homey, and well appointed. I look forward to my return visit."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You cannot find a better place to stay when visiting the Eastern Shore and the Blackwater Wildlife Refuge. I heard that there are lots of Wood Ducks on their pond in March so this would be a great time to visit. Kathy and Rick are wonderful hosts. The natural setting of the home is beautiful.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rick and Kathy are the kind of people that make Air bnb great. this a fantastic place stay in a great area.. We recommend highly.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Unit was as described and Kathy and Rick were very welcoming and informative hosts.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house and property was wonderful and a great retreat from a busy world. Great location near Blackwater and we enjoyed the biking and kayaking. Kathy and Rick were wonderful host. I would highly recommend this place for a quiet getaway.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great quiet place to stay. Nice rooms and really nice people. I would encourage everyone to vacation there
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed staying at Cathy & Rick's. All the reviews I pre-read before staying and the reviews are spot on. This stay was perfect. The property picture perfect. The hospitality was great. We were greeted with the most delicious muffins on kitchen table. Their suggestions of things to do and places to eat were taken. Blackwater wildlife Refuge Drive Through. Loved it. RAR Brewery. Loved it. Maryland Blue. Great. Visited Hoopers Island, Taylor Island. Saw several eagles, herons, turtles, egrets and deer. Great Trip. Great hosts."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super clean and comfortable! What a lovely location! Rick and Kathy are so kind and attentive to detail...they make you feel like part of the family right from the start. For triathletes coming for a race, this is only 21 minutes from Gerry Boyle but gives you such a peaceful place to rest and get away from all the noise when sleep and rest are needed. There are quiet beautiful trails, a little pond and even a relaxing water feature to enjoy on this property. So pleased overall!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful hosts. Very knowledgeable about the area. Great attention to detail in a charming getaway.
Quiet and serene surroundings. We will visit again!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Everything was wonderful. Kathy and Rick are very welcoming and kind. They were thrilled to have two rambunctious kids run around and tolerable of all their shenanigans. The unit was just what we needed for our family of 4 for a quick two night stay. Lots to explore in the area and on their farm.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My three year old son and I had a lovely, peaceful weekend here. Kathy and Rick are wonderful, warm hosts and their property is beautiful. Kathy even made us a delicious cake and sent us home with extra slices! And Rick drove my son and me around the farm on an ATV. The space is spotless, comfortable and has everything you need. Highly recommended."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Not only are there great trees growing on Kathy and Rick's property, but our relationship with the place has evolved every step of the way. The nature, the birds, well-kept paths in the woods, the delicious cake of Kathy and the conversations with Rick - as warm and attentive hosts as rare!!! The rooms are well maintained and clean - we had a great rest here and would like to come back any time!!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a real gem-- if the hosts were my neighbors we'd be best friends!!! Fabulous property, lots to do and see in the area, extraordinarily clean and relaxing, great getaway!!! We will be back!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our time very much ... Rick and Kathy are great hosts!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was one of the Best ABandB we have stayed in
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful place to stay! Kathy and Rick are very friendly and helpful and the place is so comfortable, clean, and perfectly secluded within the trees. It is also a short distance away from the Blackwater Wildlife Refuge, the Harriet Tubman NPS Visitor Center, and the Harriet Tubman Museum, all of which I genuinely recommend. Rick can give you all kinds of info on the BWR, which I strongly suggest going to in the early morning hours, you will see all kinds of active wildlife. In between the sight-seeing I enjoyed the peace and quiet on the tree farm and took advantage of my time there to catch up on all my reading. Highly Recommended!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great hospitality. Clean,spacious, comfortable. Fresh bakery made muffins were very satisfying."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A wonderful find on AirBnB. An exceptional location in every way, beauty in surrondings. the home, the hosts. Look no further."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed the stay. They welcomed us and gave us a lot information for our travel. You can enjoy beautiful voices of birds in the sweet garden. Actually that’s awesome. The room is completely clean and everything that we wants were there. You can visit to Ocean city or Assateague national seashore around 1 hrs. I definitely recommend to stay here.
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"Rick and Kathy are the warmest most welcoming hosts!
Their place is immaculate!
History surrounds their farm and the area… don’t miss this one!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Kathy and Rick are wonderful hosts. Their property is set back from the road and had many acres to explore. We stayed here with our kids (ages 5 and 10) and made excursions to the Harriet Tubman byway, Blackwater and Smith Island. I wish we had more time to just chill on the property.
Our kids loved visiting the chickens and Kathy & Rick invited them to help feed the birds which delighted our kiddos.
Th space itself is just as described, comfortable, and worked very well for our family. Be sure to wear closed toed shoes when walking the property in the evening for the sake of not getting bitten too much by mosquitoes"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great and reliable place to stay! Cleanliness and felt like home! Hosts Kathy and Rick are fantastic
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was truly a pleasure not only staying at Rick's and Kathy's tree farm but also hanging out with Rick (sorry we missed you Kathy!).
The property
The tree farm is a lovely place. There are walking trails and wild life right on the property. There are feeders for birds and squirrels all around. The backyard has a shaded gazebo area with swinging bench and frog pond where I spend hours just sitting around watching the many cardinals, hummingbird, goldfinch, crows and squirrels. Even spotted a fox from far away! Be sure to bring your binocular if you want to watch some birds (or if you're lucky Rick might have one around).
It's 4-5 minute's drive from the Maryland Blue restaurant, awesome seafood place, and not too far from Blackwater refuge, Harriet Tubman Museum, and Blackwater Adventures (kayak rental).
The owners
Rick was a great host, on the first day he greeted us when we arrived and told us what amenities are available on his property and what points of interests are in the surrounding area, even telling us how to navigate at the Blackwater refuge. On the second day after our adventure we came back to the property and he spent some time chatted with us and sharing a beer with us, telling us about the history of the property and the refuge (that Rick is heavily involved), which we were only all too happy to hear about. He even took me on a ride on his John Deere Gator (utility vehicle) to show me around the property so if I wanted to drive around myself later - which he very nicely offered for me to do all on my own - I can be familiar with the surroundings. We just really appreciated Rick's time - this is why we travel, to see new places and meet new people! We think this is our best AirBnB experience (and we have a fair amount).
You can't go wrong with this place!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful hosts who go well above and beyond in their hospitiality. Saw many cool birds, kayaked, saw the trails, and explored many great recommendations from Kathy. Rick gave us a great background on the history of the property. Unique and memorable stay. Thanks again Kathy and Rick!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great house, fantastic hosts, good location, delicious scones. I couldn't have been happier to stay with Rick and Kathy."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just an amazing place! Rick and Kathy are very warm and welcoming. This was the first airbnb we stayed at, and many stays and years later, Madison Nature Getaway is still the best airbnb we have ever experienced. If you're fortunate, you'll even find some of Kathy's blueberry scones on the table- simply the best we have ever had!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great spot. Kathy and Rick are very accommodating. The space was clean and nicely decorated. My favorite part was being able to walk through the woods. Recommend a stay.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We booked this trip hoping for a quiet family escape for my husband’s birthday. We got so much more out of this experience!! Everything in the guest house was immaculate and well thought out. The hospitality was unmatched. There were guides to the area in the house, but Rick and Kathy also provided valuable guidance. Kathy even baked a cake and provided a decorating kit for our young daughters. Our girls were absolutely obsessed with the farm—it felt like going to stay with our favorite aunt and uncle. It was also a beautiful location for nature lovers. We could have easily stayed for a week and had plenty to explore."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Besides being absolutely wonderful hosts, Kathy & Rick provide a beautiful cottage, as well as, a spectacular piece of land full of opportunities to reconnect with nature. The living space was very comfortable and clean. Kathy & Rick are extremely helpful & very knowledgeable about the area. Don’t hesitate at all about spending time here, the memories will be priceless:)"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathy and Rick are exceptional hosts! Look forward to their warm and generous hospitality. Their Nature's Rest is a destination unto itself, not just a place to stay. Songbirds, waterfowl and wildlife abound in and around their wooded retreat. There are scenic walking trails in and out of a wooded forest with a beautiful pond, complete with a hanging wooden porch swing to sit and take in the peaceful view while listing to chirping frogs and singing birds. Just outside their home is a covered, but open gazebo with vintage iron chairs and glider, surrounded by bird feeders and a garden with a babbling fountain. Great place for coffee, reading or to sit and have some great conversation with your hosts and hear stories about the farm and how it came to be be. Kathy's baked goods are also a welcome treat to enjoy. Was just looking for a quiet place to stay for a few days to enjoy some fishing nearby with a friend, but was truly impressed with all our hosts had to offer when we decided to spend the day at the farm one day because of windy weather. Planning a future visit with my wife."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place and even better people!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable, private accommodations in a beautiful and peaceful setting. They greet you with open arms and fresh baked goods. Kathy and Rick are great hosts and great people."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our second time staying here and it was just wonderful as the first time. Very clean, cozy space. Was so nice to have a fire in the wood stove. The grounds are beautiful and serene! Kathy made us delicious pumpkin bread and blueberry scones, which we truly appreciated. Both she and Rick were gracious hosts. They share great information about the area and are so pleasant to talk with. Will definitely stay again, whenever we are in this area."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,We had the BEST time at Kathy and Rick's and can't to go back! The suite is spacious and beautiful and is so very serene- it's just what we were lookingfor!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this AirBnB! The guest space is attached to the main house, but it is entirely separate. We had our own entrance and porch swing. Inside, the main room is large. One half is a living room and the other half is a dining room with small kitchen (large fridge, microwave, small sink, drip coffee maker (with coffee, filters and sweeteners), dishes, silverware, napkins, placemats, towels, dish soap, etc.) The bathroom has one of those walk-in tubs that you see in magazines. We just used it as a shower. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The place is beautifully decorated and the temperature was easy to regulate. The property is as gorgeous as any nature park and we roamed around during the day and even at night under a star-studded sky. There are outdoor seating areas to enjoy the scenery and the many birds who dine at their bird feeders. The location is ideal for getting to Cambridge, Blackwater NWR, and other activities. Kathy and Rick could not be more attentive to what we needed/wanted. They are kind people and have interesting stories to tell. We had an outstanding time at this AirBnB."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A comfortable, beautiful sanctuary which allows you to just relax and wander peacefully. Kathy and Rick are excellent hosts and offer everything one could ask for. Even homemade baked goods awaited my arrival. Wonderful stay."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"When you read everyone else's review of ABnB hosts that are all glowing - five star ratings, you aren't surprised to find a cute-as-a-button apartment that is clean-as-a-whistle, hosted by lovely friendly people. So, I won't go on and on of what a great stay this was. Kathy and Rick are as wonderful - in fact, even more than- they are described in everyone's reviews. We hope to go back in the spring to see the wood duck babies from the blind on the pond. How cool will that be! Oh yes, the warm blueberry scones are pretty sweet too!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved my stay with Kathy and Rick. Super clean, wonderful amenities and great hosts. I highly recommend."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kathy and Rick are excellent hosts. They go above and beyond in making your stay excellent. Kathy’s blueberry scones are delicious 😋
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathy and Rick are just great hosts and wonderful and accommodating people, with great tips on local activities and eating options. The apartment is roomy and private, and borders on their picturesque tree farm, which is rightly prized and a great haven for local wildlife. They are both active connecting people with nature, Rick particularly with nearby Blackwater NWR (a great place to see eagles and waterbirds). We were fortunate to sample Kathy's baking - literally the icing on the cake to a most enjoyable stay!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"this Airbnb combines a lot of elements to make for a great product. the property itself is located within an active tree farm, and a wonderful private comfortable space for lodging. we arrived to a plate of fresh baked chocolate chip cookies, a lot of help in picking the best places to see and dine, and hosts which helped us delight in eating a dozen steamed Chesapeake Bay crabs. highly recommend staying with Kathy and Rick."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A very wonderful place. The farm was very picturesque, quiet and peaceful. It was close enough to town to go out to eat, but far enough to enjoy the peace and quiet of the country. Host were super helpful, easy going and friendly, like old friends. The accommodations, were clean, quiet and comfy."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfectly delightful. Kathy and Rick are such kind, welcoming people. Location is beautiful. I was in town for a family event, a wedding, so I did not have the time I wish I had to explore their farm, but that saves something to do next time, because I certainly plan on a next time. Charming place to stay. Cozy, yet plenty of room. Everything was spotless, and most comfortable. I could not have wished for things, from finding the location, to communication, to be easier. Highly recommend. Thank you so much Kathy and Rick, I shall return."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rick and Kathy's place is a haven for nature and a great place to unwind.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice couple. Very clean inside. The screened in patio offers a great space to eat/cook and relax. We will be renting again.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I don't even know where to begin, Rick and Kathy are some of the nicest people you will ever meet, they go above and beyond to make sure you are enjoying the maryland experience. There property is very beautiful and well managed, and the hospitality is unbelievable!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful weekend stay at Kathy and Rick's place! The apartment is a great place for a couple to stay--quiet and comfortable and in a beautiful location. We loved walking around the tree farm, relaxing at night in front of the wood stove while playing games, and exploring the area. Kathy and Rick were wonderful hosts who welcomed us and were available when we had questions, but also gave us lots of privacy. The apartment was very clean and COVID-safe with wonderful treats for breakfasts and snacks. We enjoyed hikes at Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge, exploring the Harriet Tubman Byway Tour (there's an app with an excellent audio guide), and eating outdoors at Portside Restaurant. Palm Beach Willie's also looked like a good safe outdoor option with music, though we didn't make it there this time. This would be a great area for cycling and paddling, too. We can't wait to come back and stay at Kathy and Rick's place!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect Low-key Weekend Getaway...
We spent a weekend at Rick and Kathy’s. When we got there we were really impressed with the space. There were snacks put out for us and the fresh muffins Kathy put out were amazing. Immediately Rick and Kathy let our 6 year old feed the chickens that are running around which absolutely made his day. After that they took us on a ride around the farm on their gator (like an ATV) and then handed over the keys which was another highlight of the weekend as we took it out quite a few times while we were there. On the second day we drove over to the Spocott windmill and saw the windmill, the single room schoolhouse, and the blacksmith shop. We stopped at Emily’s produce and bought some fresh food and then we fished the pond on the farm. The pond is stocked with largemouth bass and fishing was such a fun experience. Rick and Kathy took us for another ride around the farm and talked about the history of it and then let our son plant a few trees which he loved. That night we sat around a fire with Rick and Kathy and talked about life and ate smores. By the end of the night our son was calling Kathy “Aunt Kathy.” Sunday morning we packed up and went biking at Blackwater Wildlife Refuge and headed home. Overall on the farm we saw turtles, caterpillars, chickens, deer, frogs, and fish. I can’t recommend enough that you book time to spend at this magical place, especially if you have children that are curious about the outdoors."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathy and Rick really are Super Hosts! They were very accommodating with our last minute booking (when the weather changed) and did their utmost, without being intrusive, to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable. The farm is a wonderful place to relax and we loved the chickens and exceptional birdlife. There is plenty to do in the surrounding area and Kathy and Rick were helpful with suggestions and recommendations. We had no concerns about COVID - the place was spotless and there was appropriate social distancing at all times. Highly recommended."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Kathy and Rick are by far two of the most gracious, hospitable, and generous hosts we have encountered in our years on Air B&B. Their place is exceptionally clean, well located, and fun! Highly recommended. We will definitely be returning, and soon!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, peaceful spot in a true Eastern Shore of MD atmosphere. Lovely little apt. attached to owners’ home, but with separate entrance and privacy. As this was our 1st venture away from home since Covid arrived, we wanted to feel safe and Kathy and Rick couldn’t have been more friendly and welcoming - we thoroughly enjoyed chatting with them, including when we ran into them at the local watering hole, Palm Beach Willie’s! But were never intrusive and even sent us on our way with some fresh eggs from their fun flock of hens. The living space was spotless and they are following all Air BandB safety guidelines to assure visitor comfort. Their wonderful tree farm is located very near Blackwater NWR, so if nature walks are a fave this spot is a gem. Snacks, fruit, yummy muffins, coffee, juices, and milk were all kindly provided. Not a full kitchen, but grilling is certainly an option and we found plenty of outdoor dining options, within 10-20 minutes (Cambridge is nearest town) We started each morning with a walk about the farm and then ventured farther into Chesapeake country for hiking, biking, and kayaking - it is a glorious part of the world for nature lovers.
In summer, be prepared for ‘skeeters- but it is worth it!
We truly hope to return because each season must be beautiful - and Kathy and Rick were so sweet!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really appreciated the friendliness of our hosts Kathy and Rick. The location near Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge was great, very quiet, and private. The breakfast/snack goodies - cereals, freah fruit, milk, juices, and baked items were perfect and much appreciated. They have a lovey property as well, with birds, turtles and other wildlife. The rooms were very comfortable and clean, plenty of room for our family of four. If you’re looking for a quiet getaway in the Chesapeake Eastern shore, we recommend giving this a try."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family of four had an exceptional two night stay with Rick and Kathy. The greeting was warm, space private, immaculately clean, and beautifully decorated. They provided lots of good quality snacks, including milk, cereal, and coffee, high quality linens, and thoughtful touches we might have forgotten. Above all, the location was wonderful. Just 15 minutes from our kayaking tour in Blackwater Wildlife Preserve, and their farm itself was open for hiking, fishing, and wildlife spotting. My kids ( 9& 11) loved feeding chickens and touring the farm on Rick's Gator, and both have asked if we can go back for another stay this fall."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place and extraordinary services! Kathy and Rick are the best people to visit and rent their beautiful space. We had great time and we will visit them again! My husband and I recommend it to everyone who is looking to have a true rest. Great place! Thank you, Rick and Kathy for your warm hospitality!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathy and Rick are truly super hosts. Their generosity, helpfulness, and friendliness can't be beat. I was there when hurricane Isaias hit, and although the wind was fierce and the rain was pounding, I felt very safe in the extra-secure space they had built. I loved taking walks on their property and enjoyed getting to know them. It's a very special place!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The hosts Rick and Kathy cultivated a very special getaway in this beautiful part of the state. The tree farm offers a great opportunity to observe the local wildlife and has quick access to excellent food and day trips. Rick and Kathy are generous hosts and we look forward to cracking open the farm fresh eggs they sent us home with.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Kathy and Rick are extremely welcoming people and have a lot of BEAUTIFUL land to be explored while staying in a lovely little place connected to their house. They were very open to us and I consider them friends! Would 100% recommend staying here if you love nature and good country folks.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kathy and Rick were the perfect hosts. This could not have been a more wonderful stay. Kathy and Rick were warm and friendly and the place is spacious, inviting, and sparkling clean! We are planning to go back!!!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect spot for us to visit with our 2 year old.
We had high expectations after reading the other beaming reviews, and we were not disappointed. Kathy and Rick were amazing hosts who made us feel at home immediately. They made sure we were always comfortable, but it never felt like they were hovering. We enjoyed chatting with them, hearing about the farm and the surrounding area. Even before we got out of our car, they checked to be sure we were on the same page about wearing masks to be safe during the Corona virus pandemic. They even sent us home with some souvenirs.
The living space was sparkling clean and well decorated. We appreciated the little touches, the snacks and breakfast they provided, the bug spray (which we definitely needed in July), the fluffy towels, the comfortable bed, the brand new crib for our toddler, the rocking chairs looking out over the bird feeders . . .
We had a blast exploring the farm, too. Our toddler loved riding around in the Gator, walking around the pond, scoping for wildlife, and admiring Rick's tractors & backhoe. And especially feeding the chickens! We made good use of the provided grill and screened-in pavilion for dinner.
This is not a place where you'll find a bustling town or lots to do (though Cambridge is only about 20 minutes away), but if you're looking for a quiet getaway surrounded by nature, check it out! We visited the nearby Blackwater reserve, with a few hiking trails and a driving route. We rented a kayak to go out on the Little Blackwater River. We ordered crabs from Lindy's that were among the best we've ever had, and super reasonably priced.
Highly recommend!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great time at Kathy and Rick's house! The place was sparkling clean and there are so many extra touches to make your stay more comfortable. Kathy and Rick are very welcoming and want to tell you about the area. We had fun exploring the property on their Gator and the breakfast and snack foods were a treat. For a bigger breakfast you can pick up a sandwich at Woolfords store. A great place to fish, kayak and relax, and dinner at Jimmie and Sook's was delicious."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Kathy and Rick's place is one of those rare discoveries that you will want to return to time and time again. Where to start? Communication prior to booking was great and they were happy to answer our questions about the area, what we might see and what we needed to bring. A couple of days out from our visit they kindly warned us about the possibility of very poor weather over our weekend (which thankfully didn't eventuate) but this is really a hallmark of how caring and thoughtful they are, both as hosts and as people.
We were driving from DC and after months of COVID stress we needed a peaceful break with our kids. We arrived at Abend Hafen in the late afternoon and the whole place was full of birds (including hummingbirds!!) coming down to the birdbath and feeders in the late afternoon light. Kathy and Rick met us on arrival and showed us around our accommodation, which is adjoins their house but has plenty of privacy. I should mention that the photos on the website do not do justice to how beautifully the small house is set up. Everything is finished to a really high standard, and with so many cosy and personal touches, including freshly baked cookies and fruit loaf, and so many snacks and goodies for breakfast. They have provided lovely, high quality linens and towels, and the fridge was filled with berries, milk, juices etc. No detail has been overlooked, and there is a wonderful bookshelf filled with books about the area, birding guides and information about the Blackwater Reserve (an incredible place, don't miss it!) and their management of the forest around their property. We asked for more information about their forestry management and were very happy to get a mini presentation about it, and we spent quite a bit of time with Rick and Kathy hearing about the area and just chatting, but if what you want is a quiet and uninterrupted getaway, they are also very considerate about giving you your space.
The property itself is amazing, and our son had a wonderful time driving around on Rick's Gator. We thought it so generous that he was willing to let a kid drive it, but this is the lovely people they are -- our kids had the best time just hanging out and chatting, helping feed the chickens and learning about all of the amazing birdlife. Rick showed them how to build a bluebird house that they were able to bring home with them, and they couldn't have been prouder or more excited. We almost thought they were going to cry when they said goodbye to Kathy and Rick!
So much more we could write, but it's most important just to say that Kathy and Rick are two of the loveliest and"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of our favorite Airbnb experiences of all time. Kathy and Rick are incredible hosts - they treated us like family! They provided excellent local tips, repeatedly made sure we had absolutely everything we needed to be comfortable, and gave us total free reign to explore their tree farm! We learned a lot about forest conservation and felt like we had rested for a week instead of a day and a half at the end of our stay. We're coming back in September! We could not possibly recommend Kathy and Rick's place enough."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We cannot praise this AirBnB and its hosts enough! They excelled at every segment: outstanding hospitality, exceptional friendliness, and impeccable facilities and amenities. This is a truly unique place, and Kathy and Rick are true Superhosts and just wonderful people whom you won't forget once you met them.
The tree farm is huge, and you feel that you are staying in a real forest full of different plants and animals. You, as a guest, have access to every corner of the farm, and can easily spend a day or two simply exploring the Abend Hafen. Kathy and Rick are great story-tellers, so you won't feel bored from any perspective. Also, Kathy is a savvy baker, who makes unbelievable scones to-die-for.
The part of the house intended for AirBnB guests is large enough for a group of four, and is as clean as a good hospital. The kitchenette is equipped with useful appliances that allow you to make some simple meals or reheat food. Also, a BBQ grill and extra space is available for cooking in netted pavilion nearby. Since we have stayed for 4 days and because we like to cook, we brought a portable butane 1-burner tabletop stove and a multi-cooker with us, and it worked just great for us.
Dorchester County has a lot to offer: we biked, kayaked, visited local winery and brewery, saw some historical sites in nearby Church Creek and Taylor's Island. Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge is a must-see site in the area. There are other interesting places but most of them were temporarily closed due to coronavirus. Still we did not have enough time to visit all places of interest, and plan to come back and stay at Abend Hafen as soon as an opportunity arises.
Remember, Abend Hafen is a gem and Kathy and Rick are Superhosts and wonderful folks worth meeting! :)"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is truly unique! Kathy and Rick are friendly and welcoming hosts with a wealth of valuable knowledge about the Blackwater Region. The room is cozy and perfect for a couple and property is a working tree farm with trails, a pond, a swing, and photo blind for bird lovers. We loved the many chickens and enjoyed meeting each one. We also enjoyed talking to Rick about the history of the area and its natural wonders. We could not have been happier with our stay."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing Airbnb, super nice space and generous hosts. Kathy and Rick were super friendly and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We hope to be back!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was such a treat to land at Kathy and Rick's oasis. From the moment I stepped on the property, they treated me with such kindness and generosity. I felt apart of the family instantly and it was really fun sitting and talking with them about the area and life. I found it a very peaceful spot and I was able to really relax. I enjoyed biking from their place over to a secret beach that Kathy told me about and of course wandering around their property. Wonderful place to stay! I was sad to go."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rick and Kathy are WONDERFUL! We had a lovely time at their place. We had our own private section, with our own entrance. The place was super quiet and cozy. They provided us with fruit, yogurt and baked goods for breakfast. There were tons of snacks available to us too! The place was extra clean and well maintained. THE FARM IS HUGE! we spent an entire day just exploring the farm. We went there during the corona virus outbreak and it felt safe and clean. Rick and Kathy maintained their distance, wore masks and cared about our wellbeing. They they loved telling us about the farm and the wildlife refuge when we asked, and they invited us to have drinks with them which was lovely! If you're not a chatty person like I am, then you'll be left to do your own thing."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a nice place, very clean, perfect gateway from the city ! Rick is passionate about nature and a very kind host ! Definetly recommand to friends"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a beautiful property with acres of beautiful trees and a pond. Lovely place to walk in nature.
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Katy and Ricks place is a true gem. Not just the environment but the two of them truly welcome you and make you feel right at home.
I loved the step in tub. It’s one of those that you close the door and then fill the tub. So amazing! At night, I opened the windows and listened to the frogs and cicadas...so soothing.
I’m planning on returning next year and this time, I’ll be saying longer."
2020-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing hospitality. Kathie & Rick miss no detail! From the home-made scones, impeccable space and the nature-filled land that they share with their guests! Best airbnb yet! A little piece of heaven!!"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Top-notch ratings for hospitality, comfort, and sparkling clean space! Kathy and Rick are wonderful hosts who love to share the beauty of their farm with others, and the thoughtful touches--especially the breakfast and snack supplies--made our stay very enjoyable. Thank you! We'll be back!"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay with Rick and Kathy who are wonderful hosts. The place is super clean and comfortable. Rick gave us a very informative tour of their beautiful property. We wouldn’t go anywhere else when visiting the area.
2020-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Comfort, quiet, and thoughtful touches make this one of the top Airbnbs I've ever stayed in. Can't wait to bring family back for more than a one-night stay. The hike through the property's lob lolly pine acreage with its pond, photo blind and natural beauty is worth the trip alone. Having quick access to Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge and the surrounding area is a definite plus. Rick was most interesting as he shared his knowledge of the area and history of the amazing trees on his property. An A-plus stay for sure!"
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rick took excellent care of us with helpful suggestions. Their place is a beautiful, nature infused location which is a welcome change and so close to Blackwater NWR."
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathy and Rick are Super-hosts, who have warm and cozy guest accommodations that are kept neat and very clean. Their location on the Eastern Shore, near the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge, offers outdoor activities, eagle sightings and other birds and wildlife. Or you could settle in with a good book, whichever suites you. We would definitely recommend this to friends."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great spot and hospitality and thoughtfulness was great.
2019-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is exceptionally clean, and Rick was a fantastic host! The pictures don't do it justice. Nice quiet place very comfortable and all the touches that make a place a home where there."
2019-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was warm and welcoming. it was just the quiet escape I was looking for the weekend mn,,b g"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was a unique and wonderful experience staying on Rick and Kathy's Tree Farm! Kathy was out of town, but Rick was the consummate host in every serving and engaging way. Our accommodations were spotless; there was various breakfast foods and beverages available; and there was a variety of local information which was in our living quarters and which Rick provided separately. We like to bike and kayak, and the area was not only accommodating but actually ""focused"" on these outdoor recreational activities.
Rick and Kathy's Tree Farm also was truly a ""unique"" Airbnb accommodation in that their large farm also provides wide walking paths and many sites for viewing and photographing wildlife......in many settings of woods, marsh and fields. We will definitely return!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Kathy and Rick's! They are great hosts, so attentive and informative. The accommodations are sparkling clean, comfy, cozy and peaceful. It's a great place to connect with nature, take a walk in the woods and enjoy a bonfire. The kitchen was stocked with yummy breakfast options, healthy snacks and delicious fresh baked scones. AND, the friendly chickens were a bonus!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rick and Kathy's is the best experience that we have had with an Airbnb. Fresh baked scones, a refrigerator and basketfull of treats, and a tastefully decorated and clean place to enjoy the Eastern Shore. Hospitality is their gift!
So many nice touches. They were awesome with our little boy. We will be back!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful place! The hosts are super friendly, the apartment is very clean. There are lots of extras. We especially loved the wooded tree farm.
Rick and Kathy treat you like family and immediately make you feel at home."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Kathy and Rick's place is amazing: A historic tree farm near the Chesapeake Bay. Kathy and Rick provide a personal check in with history of the farm and the home baked scones were wonderful. I would definitely book this treasure again!
2019-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Me and my parents were doing a road trip and around Pennsylvania, Virginia and Delaware. We decided to take a stop in Madison and found Rick and Kathy's place. The place is very nice and calm and has everything you need. They are so hospitable! I recommend going to the blackwater visitors center where you can see birds of prey from an observatory, and if you're lucky you get to see a bald eagle."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful spot, great bird watching, best of all great host"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Outstanding, Rick and Kathy were great hosts and the place was very charming and clean. Will definitely go back again. Great for anyone who wants to fish in the area, boat access nearby."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I wish I could give more than 5 stars! What an amazing experience. Beautiful farm, wonderful people, comfortable place. They shared details about the farm ecosystem, I got to see the chickens and the hospitality was second to none! Super clean and well stocked with food. So much to do and see within 20 minutes. Can't wait to go back. Thank you both for taking such good care of Lola and me!!!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a gem. Kathy and Rick are focused on building a true experience with their stay. I was given privacy within the separate apartment while encouraged to explore the property, join the couple for breakfast, and receive a tour. They let me use their atv (the gator), lent me boots and toiletries, offered to get me food from the store, and provided me a local history lesson to help me with my book. As a solo traveler, this was the perfect place - quiet, private, but conveniently located - to work on a solo project.
This b&b would be great for families, couples, or friends, but it’s also a great place to escape to, alone, and enjoy a quiet weekend in the countryside with big skies, big trees, bird watching, and relaxing. And if you ever get lonely, Kathy and Rick are right there to chat, recommend local spots, or share a cup of coffee. The property is lovely, but the hosts are what make it truly shine. I left feeling like a friend."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was perfect. We loved spending time with the hosts. They have great Tipps on where to go. Hopefully we can stay longer the next time.
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a lovely place to visit. Rick and Kathy have added many thoughtful touches that make this airbnb extra special. We really liked having a living room, kitchen, and even breakfast! Clean and comfortable. And, right in the middle of a tree farm!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a fantastic time at Rick’s and Cathy’s. It is a true refuge near the real thing (ie Blackwater). Cathy had made us scones, and Rick was incredibly generous with his time and impressive fount of knowledge about the local wildlife. The ´apartment’ was like a deluxe safari experience- wonderful sleeping and great amenities in a beautiful, natural setting. A five-star experience."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Outstanding! Kathy & Rick are the most hospitable hosts. They accomdated us on a same day request. They have created a beautiful space for their guests, that has both a sense of love and pride. We enjoyed our time on their beautiful property and hope to visit again."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kathy and Rick were absolutely the best hosts you could wish for. They were kind, thoughtful, and affectionate. My family had a blast at their farm. Also, the wildlife we observed on the farm was fascinating. Would definitely recommend and visit their place again. Thanks once again to Kathy and Rick :)"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Kathy and Rick are outstanding hosts with a lovely property. The room space is very comfortable and larger than expected. Breakfast included a large quantity of fresh, delicious berries along with yogurt, muffins, oatmeal, cereal and assorted drinks. Would stay again!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kathy and Rick are friendly, warm, generous hosts! I was in Cambridge with a friend to hang my art show at the Dorchester Center For The Arts, and it was a perfect, immaculately clean place to take a break after a long day of hard work. The homemade scones were a delicious surprise.....If only I could rent by the month!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the best AirB&B stay we've ever had! Kathy and Rick are outstanding hosts. Their place is immaculate, and the extra special touches, especially the fresh baked goods, are wonderful. Kathy accommodated our special dietary needs (vegan & nut-free) in providing both breakfast supplies and delicious baked treats, and she even agreed to custom make a birthday cake for our daughter (separate payment, since this was additional to our stay). Rick and Kathy are excellent conversationalists and provided great information and tips about the local area. They even lent us a cooler, beach chairs and a quilt when we went to Assateague State Park for the day. We also greatly enjoyed the guided tour of their tree farm. Their place is quiet and offers excellent bird watching directly from the unit, as the double sliders open out to the bird bath and feeder area. They are convenient for cycling, kayaking, exploring the Blackwater Nature Reserve, historic Cambridge, and getting out to the beach. In addition, the farm itself offers walking trails and a pond for wildlife-viewing, fishing or just sitting in the swing and reflecting. If you're looking for a place to relax and take a break from the stress of work and city living, this is the perfect spot with great hosts. We will be back regularly."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a great stay!!
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kathy & Rick- thanks for going above and beyond with our 2 college students. They were both very pleased with the hospitality that Rick showed them. They even said they signed your “guest book” . As host you both went above and beyond to make their stay memorable!
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect spot to relax and appreciate nature, great bird watching spot"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Kathy and Rick have a generous nature and love for the world around them. They provided wonderful breakfast selections. Their little piece of this earth is brimming with nature. It is a gift to be able to share it with them.
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was absolutely fantastic. Rick and Kathy welcomed us with open arms and a cozy space. Everything was clean, and they even stocked the fridge and pantry with snacks, drinks, and breakfast items.
We were in town for the Eagleman Ironman Competition which made for very early mornings. Kathy was quick to respond and even offer help at any hour of the day, including providing chairs for us to take to the event at 4am! They also provided us with umbrellas, a cooler, beach blankets and extra towels for our excursion. Kathy baked us chocolate chip cookies which our kids devoured, and Rick took us on a tour of their extensive property. I cannot say enough nice things about them, or our experience. We highly recommend booking with these lovely people!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is definitely a farmstay, off the beaten Cambridge path (though right on the Harriet Tubman byway). Plenty of space and super friendly hosts---in addition to fresh baked goods, we got a tour of their lumber farm and even an annotated map of Blackwater Refuge with highlighter marks for every bird nest with chicks. A wonderful place for anyone who wants a good perspective on the Eastern Shore in a nice location."
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Being in Kathy and Rick’s home was such a blessing. They have the most beautiful Airbnb and they are the most hospitable, loving and joyful people ever! We highly recommend this place. It is incredibly clean, peaceful and comfortable. Kathy and Rick go out of their way or make you feel welcome and comfortable. We appreciate them so much!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Discovering Madison Nature Getaway was like winning the lottery - spacious, spotless accommodations in a beautiful setting with abundant wildlife, and thoughtfully stocked with an assortment of breakfast items. Not just coffee and tea, but fresh fruit, muffins, juice, yogurt, hot & cold cereals; Kathy and Rick go above and beyond the usual expectations to assure a comfortable stay. And they were generous with their time, sharing information about the farm, the local wildlife, and background about the points of interest. Don't miss Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge or the Harriet Tubman Museum!
And for a really fun time, share a table at Palm Beach Willies with Rick and Kathy and enjoy some great conversation; they've led interesting lives and are delightful dinner companions.
We'll be returning next year, looking forward to more of Rick & Kathy's hospitality and hoping we'll be lucky enough to again be there when Kathy's baking peach cobbler :)"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"An utterly charming spot, especially for birders and other nature-lovers. The unit was well-equipped, with a completely stocked larder. Rick and Kathy are the sort of hosts you dream about -- friendly, informative and respectful."
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This location is a wildlife wonderland. Nature is bountiful in many forms: frogs, turtles, woodland ducks, screech owls, and many birds along with their babies; it's a hidden paradise. The accommodations are excellent. The space is quite large with a living room, dining room, kitchen, large bedroom, and a full bath. The queen size bed was so comfortable I felt like I was sleeping in my own bed. The space is spotless and meets every need from extra towels to a fully equipped kitchen. There are snacks and fresh fruit to squash any hunger, and a full-size coffee pot, which my husband was so excited to see. Lastly and certainly not least are the hosts Rick and Kathy. They are warm and welcoming and very accommodating. We ran very late (work and then traffic) and yet we arrived to find Kathy and Rick smiling and waving, happily greeting us. The getaway is peaceful and relaxing yet conveniently located near Blackwater Refuge (an amazing bald eagle experience).
Image sitting in a rocking chair on the deck, watching the birds play in the baths while being serenaded by frogs….a great way to end any day."
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kathy and Rick were the most kind, generous and thoughtful air bnb host I have ever met. If you’re heading down the eastern shore in their general direction, they’ve got you covered. The place is great, comfortable, and charming, and their local knowledge, resources and commitment to the environment is impressive. Five-star folks and a five-star air bnb experience!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Incredible hosts, in an amazing place. I woke up with a cold my second day there, and Kathy showed up with DayQuil and Tylenol Cold & Flu within minutes of hearing of my plight. The rooms were pristine, towels better than Hyatt, the best coffee I've ever had. If you're looking for peace, quiet and relaxation, this is the spot. Their passion about the area and especially the Blackwater Reserve is inspiring and their recommendations were great."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed one night,A nature-lovers paradise!
2019-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is such a hidden gem! It doesn’t appear to be much as you turn off the road, but to the grounds are simply amazing, and Rick is so knowledgeable about the forestry, the ecosystem, and the surrounding areas, including the wildlife refuge. Kathy was away, but Rick was generous with his time… Taking us fishing, showing us the property, and making sure we had whatever we needed. I was traveling with kids, and he included some pop tarts in our selection of snacks! Actually, the selection of food and drinks was quite generous :) The living space was immaculate, very comfortable, and clearly shows the hosts have put a lot of thought into their home. I was simply cruising the Eastern shore for some fishing spots with my boys and am so glad to have stayed here. I would highly recommend this for anyone with an interest in ecological tourism, especially given how close it is to the refuge, lots of local waterways, and other outdoor spaces."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cozy, quiet, clean sanctuary. Very peaceful and nice touches, such as breakfast food and snacks and wine. Kathy was away, but Jim did an amazing hosting job, showing us around and making sure we had everything we needed. Would definitely return."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Madison Nature Getaway! The hospitality was wonderful! Rick took us on a tour around the farm on his Gator which was an unexpected treat! He took us to the photo blind at the pond where we watched all the beautiful wood ducks fly in. My husband and daughter later tested their skills fishing at the pond where they caught bass and sunfish. Our family of 3 only stayed one night but we could have easily stayed longer. The space was very comfortable and nicely decorated. Kathy and Rick thought of everything and more, from the cute books all around to the games to the well stocked continental breakfast which was way more than we expected. We would without a doubt do it all over again!"
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rick is very knowledgeable and a great lover of wildlife. The b&b was spotless....highly recommended. Very thoughtful and kind hosts...every need taken care of in advance!!
2019-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Aben Hafen farm is a lovely get-away that is the perfect blend of remote yet close to some of Dorchester County's best tourist destinations: Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge, the Harriett Tubman Underground Railroad Park and Visitor's Center, and the cute town of Cambridge. Plus, it's smack dab in the middle of the Harriett Tubman Underground Railroad Byway, a driving tour that can be downloaded and provides a moving audio history. The space itself is cozy and was perfect for our family of four. It was clean as a whistle, the beds were comfortable, and there were plenty of pillows. And the farm provides a perfect backdrop, with beautiful walks through the woods and to a picturesque pond that comes alive in late winter with wood ducks (and hosts other water birds--such as great blue heron--the rest of the year). Kathy and Rick could not have been nicer or more gracious hosts who can provide keen insights about local life and opportunities. We highly recommend this to others who want to enjoy the slower pace and pastoral beauty of Maryland's Eastern Shore. I'm certain we'll return!"
2019-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The ultimate Chesapeake experience with folks who love life!
2018-11-01,5,Stayed one night,We so much enjoyed our stay with Kathy and Rick. They are so very welcoming and interesting. The place is perfect and we especially enjoyed the wood fire on a cold and soggy night! We hope to see them again. We highly recommend this place to everyone!
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet, peaceful. Off the beaten path. Clean and comfortable"
2018-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved our stay at Kathy and Rick’s farm. Great location and wonderful hosts. We’ll be back!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,The Oyster House was beautiful and tranquil. It was perfect for our family and made our short but fun packed stay totally worth it.
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,The location and the guest house were really great - very happy with our stay!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,very nice stay! beautifully refurbished house and great location/easy access. Kristen was very responsive and even arranged pick-up of forgotten items after we left. 10/10 would stay again!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Place was great! Quiet and clean, perfect for our family weekend."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Brandon’s home was perfect for my stay. I slept great too. The house was clean and so nice and new. Brandon has been super responsive since I made my reservation. I would definitely recommend this lovely home in Cambridge
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"We were visiting our Airman at McGuire AFB for the week of Thanksgiving. We decided to drive to Washington, DC to spend Thanksgiving and found this home. It is very cute and clean. We probably should have stayed in a place closer to Washington, DC, which was about an hour and a half drive and then a 3 hour trip back to McGuire AFB. We did have a great Thanksgiving. This home was very spacious, it was clean and uncluttered and provided a nice stay for our weekend."
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is a nicely equipped, new condo. The welcome basket was a nice touch. Everything you need is provided. We enjoyed our stay, but found the booking process a little strange. Brandon asked personal questions about why we were coming and wanted to know the age of my sister. He also did not disclose an extra contract we needed to sign prior to coming until it was too late to back out. This contract and any of his restrictions should be on the listing. The area is fun to explore and the complex feels safe."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Brandon’s place was beautiful and perfect for a family vacation! The house was spotless and extremely comfortable, and the views and surroundings did not disappoint. Our family especially loved the community pool and seafood restaurants. Brandon was really helpful and available. Would definitely recommend!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Brandon’s airbnb was an incredible find. Perfect for families and our small little ones all under 6 years old to a newborn. Exactly pictured as described and walkable to many amenities. Incredibly clean and quiet. Spacious and relaxing. Modern and bright. Perfection. Host was so nice and communicative (left us a goodie welcome box) and it felt like a home away from home. We will be back!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was great - exactly what we wanted. Nice, clean, and big. Extremely well decorated and homey. Pool in neighborhood was perfect. Very easy to walk into town. The code for door didn't work when we arrived but Brandon was easy to reach and fixed it right away. Highly recommend."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Brandon's home was just perfect for my family! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Cambridge and look forward to visiting again! The home was immaculate and had everything we needed for a relaxing, stress-free trip-comfy beds, cozy throw blankets, lots of living space, plenty of smart TV's and a very thoughtful welcome basket! My kids and I loved having the bikes available to take to the pool or to town. The marina across the street is a great place to walk and relax during the evening hours. I would highly recommend this property to anyone wanting to visit the Cambridge area!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brandon’s place is spotless, everything is new and clean. The unit is well stocked with bed linens, towels, toilet paper, pool/beach towels, basically everything you need. Brandon was friendly and easy to communicate with. There are a few cute restaurants within walking distance. We also used bikes that are available at the unit and went paddle boarding in near by St. Michaels. All around great experience. Thank you Brandon!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was phenomenal. Everything was great and we enjoyed the area. The house was clean, organized, and even smelled good. Every expectation going into this house was exceeded. I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a quiet spot with ample amounts of things to do."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Brandon and Melissa’s home was beautiful, clean, modern and well-appointed! Nice views of the water and sailboats, and a lovely community, walkable to the downtown. The townhome had everything we needed for a long weekend, and more!
I highly recommend their home and look forward to return in the future!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family has been coming to the eastern shore every summer for many years, and this is by far the best airbnb we have ever stayed in! Great amenities, easy check-in, and amazingly clean. Our little one (3.5) felt right at home, and mom and dad could relax right away. From the evening walks around the marina to cooking in the fabulous kitchen, we made so many memories. I (mom) also had to work remotely for the week, and the downstairs living room was a great, quiet, and bright remote office :-). Brandon’s instructions were so thorough and clear - everything was a breeze. We look forward to coming back soon!"
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"enjoyed our three day stay with Brandon. photos matched the place, good location, nice pool access. host responsive and provided local recommendations. left a really nice welcome note/treats on our arrival"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"What an amazing getaway place! It is in a great location, close to many shops and restaurants and a short drive from other scenic attractions. It is ideal for bird and wildlife enthusiasts, as well as those who enjoy nature! Brandon’s place had everything you could think of! Beautiful, comfortable, and fully furnished apartment with free parking, stunning views, and has everything you actually need to prepare a meal. Brandon was a great host who gave us many great recommendations for spots to check out! We will most certainly return to enjoy this little piece of heaven and would highly recommend this AirBnb to anyone!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed a weekend stay for a nearby conference. The house is a lovely as pictured. Brandon was a great host providing clear check-in and check-out instructions. Would definitely recommend or stay again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"My family had never been to the Eastern shore but a friend recommended Cambridge. What a hidden gem of a town, and Brandon was a great host. Very responsive and helpful with suggestions of what to do in the area. The townhouse is well equipped with all the creature comforts, all kinds of coffee, fully stocked kitchen, and REALLY comfortable beds. Seriously like better than a nice hotel. The house has a great layout for two families, although it was just us and my mother-in-law. We used the bikes a lot. I wished we could have taken advantage of the kayaks but it was a little too cold. We loved Phippins Craft Center for the kids and Blue Ruin for the grown-ups--delicious food, craft cocktails and trivia. High Spot was delicious with vegan options and beer from the local brewery. The highlight was Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge but the Harriet Tubman museum was also great and very interactive for the kids. We did a day trip to St. Michaels as well. Would definitely stay here again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family visited Cambridge for Spring Break and had a wonderful time. Brandon’s place was spotless, it was very comfortable, clean and peaceful, with all the amenities provided. The location was great, we were able to walk into town for dinner and spent a day at the Hyatt hotel swimming pool which was a short drive down the road. The pool on-site was not open for the season yet. We were very lucky with the weather. All in all a great time spent at Brandon’s home."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay! The house was beautiful, spotlessly clean, and had every amenity we could have needed. The wi-fi was strong enough for us to both work with ease when we needed to, and the TV and comfortable couch in the living room was a great way to relax and unwind at night. It has a garage which is very convenient to use when entering/exiting the house. We'll certainly stay here again the next time we're in Cambridge! It was a wonderful experience and I recommend this house very highly!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This vacation home is truly perfect! Our family stayed here for a week and we just didn't want to leave! This is the first time the whole family has traveled together since the pandemic, and we could not have asked for a better setting, more enjoyable trip, or a more accommodating host. The house is in a great location, with views of the water from inside, and the sunset views are stunning. The home has all the amenities one could possibly need while on vacation and is tastefully and cozily furnished. We prepared most of our meals in the spacious and well-equipped kitchen. We had a great time visiting the Harriet Tubman Museum and the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge. I'm looking forward to returning to this house. Brandon had been a wonderful host before, during, and after our trip! THANK YOU FOR THIS AMAZING EXPERIENCE!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our family spent a wonderful long weekend here, and it was without a doubt one of our favorite vacations. The house was exactly as described, and there were plenty of activities for our children to keep them entertained while we were there. Crabbing, fishing, kayaking, and exploring the historic downtown were among our favorite activities. Brandon was very communicative and accommodating. He even left us a welcome gift when we arrived. I would highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone, and hope to return someday soon!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This home is beautifully furnished and designed with thoughtful touches throughout. Our dog appreciated the yard and we appreciated the beautiful bedding, the air conditioning, and comfort of the living room and screened patio. The location allowed for easy parking and lots of exploring. We were very pleased with our stay."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"What a beautiful house! When we got home, it smelled very good, everything was spotless!!1
Communication with the host is easy and fast. The neighborhood is also nice!
Give me a perfect note!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bring coffee, there's a coffee maker. We bought food but not coffee. I love a cup first thing in the morning; instead of buying coffee for the house, we walked to Black Waters coffee shop."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Family of 4 coming kin to visit relatives. Great place!!
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"We were welcomed with a personalized sign and a basket of treats, nice personalized touch.
The pictures were an accurate depiction of the property.
Would have been more convenient/ efficient for our group if the second bathroom had a shower instead of a free standing tub.
Would return without reservation."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a lovely stay here and would happily return in the future. The house was spotless, comfortable, and well-equipped (including the kitchen). The wifi worked well enough to support two of us working remotely. The beds and bedding were great. Our dog appreciated the fenced-in yard and the two parks that were short walks away. The house was a 10-minute walk from some Cambridge favorites, including RAR Brewing. Adina was a very responsive host, and she provided some excellent recommendations! So did the neighbor (Boats and Hose is not to be missed - the best crab cakes we have ever had). Highly recommend a stay here and using Cambridge as a jumping off point to explore all the Eastern Shore has to offer."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely home, responsive hosts, clean, comfortable, and quiet. Easy walking distance to downtown. Highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I think they need to add 6 Stars, because this was truly a 6 Star accommodation. Such a lovely place, and everything looked as pictured if not better. My family had a wonderful time and the only bad thing was us having to leave. I know I will be back in Cambridge in the future to see family in the area and this is the only place I plan on staying at from now on. Thank you again to our host."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great Home!
Excellent, Beautiful, Spacious and Super Clean !
Will definitely come back !"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I booked this incredible home for my first Ironman due to its proximity to start and finish lines and I was blown away by my experience. We felt right at home. Everything we needed was at our fingertips and the place was spotless. Great decor and plenty my of space for my family to relax before the big race. The best part about this home is the location. I was able to walk everywhere including downtown to bars and restaurants. If you’re participating in Ironman and or Eaglemam, this spot is perfect. .43 miles to finish line. .6 miles to start.
I would highly recommend this beautiful and spotless home for your next trip to Cambridge. I really lucked out. Thank you Adina!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This cozy Cambridge home is very quaint, clean, and nicely appointed! The remodeled kitchen is just gorgeous and so easy to cook in. Adina had all the helpful things on hand we tend to forget (foil, spices, condiments, dishwasher solution etc.) and the cabinets had more than enough cooking supplies to help us feel at home. There is even a dining room and table with a bar cart--which was perfect for making cocktails. The living room furniture is a comfy spot to sit as a family and watch a movie. The beds were very comfortable and we were so impressed by the little touches from Adina and Bobby like the welcome basket, bath salts for the tub, and sunflowers when we arrived. We loved being walking distance from downtown Cambridge -- you gotta stop into RaR brewery and Ava's pizza -- and easily accessible to walks on the waterfront. St. Michaels is about a 35 min drive and super easy day trip. We'll be back!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved my stay at Adina and Bobby’s. The neighborhood is fantastic. One block to the water. Short walk to the marina. Bunny rabbits in the backyard. Just peace and quiet for days. I lived on the screened-in back porch. It’s the perfect place for everything. Did morning yoga there. Plugged in my laptop and did work and took meetings. Ate meals. Sipped wine.
The house was spotless and had every amenity you need. If you want to cook, the kitchen is fully-equipped. There was a lovely welcome basket of snacks and wine. The beds are really comfortable, and you’ll sleep well in the quiet neighborhood.
I’ll definitely be returning again and again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Adina’s Cambridge Cottage was a picturesque stay in a nice quaint neighborhood on the Chesapeake Bay! The home was warm and inviting, and I truly enjoyed the complimentary amenities that were provided. I would 10/10 recommend!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed at Adina's place while attending at wedding at the Cambridge Hyatt. We had 3 adults, 1 toddler, and 2 dogs - the place was perfect for us! First, there are 2 full baths and 3 bedrooms with ample space and beds. Second, there was an enclosed yard and enclosed back deck, both for the dogs, baby, and accompanying guardians to enjoy. Third, it was just blocks from the water - the main attraction for us. Finally, the house had so many small Eastern Shore touches that we sincerely enjoyed - from the artwork to the welcome basket with Rise Coffee and St Michaels wines. We would highly recommend and would stay again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve stayed in Airbnb’s before but this is my absolute favorite!!! It was peaceful, clean and charming. We saw bunny rabbits every morning, had coffee and listened to music on the enclosed porch, sat in the back yard to sun bathe, took long baths in the claw foot tub and we even ventured out to visit the Harriet Tubman museum . This is a home you don’t want to leave for the weekend. The beds were incredible. The house had absolutely everything you’d ever need. My friends and I had a blast . It’s less than 10 mins. from the Main Street in Cambridge and within 10 minutes of your shopping needs. The host are professional and thoughtful! ( they left a goodie basket on the kitchen counter filled with goodies i.e. local wine, specialty coffee, energy bars and more because they knew we were celebrating a birthday! ) This is my 2nd time staying here and the only place I plan to stay when I return. Honestly I didn’t want to leave but I can say I felt rejuvenated! Thank U for having Us!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best Airbnb I’ve stayed at in a while and it’s been years since I’ve stayed somewhere. 10/10 would recommend! You will not regret booking here, feels like a home away from home. Hosts were great and responsive, what more could you ask for! Can’t wait to stay again in the future. Thanks for bringing hospitality back. Thanks for going above and beyond!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The home was pleasantly decorated and comfortable. The owners thought of everything you would need for a home away from home. Plenty of dishes, utensils and cookware. They even provided hand soap and paper products along with a welcome basket! The neighborhood is quiet with friendly neighbors and close to downtown restaurants and shops. It’s also bike friendly. Private fenced backyard was enjoyed by our dogs and the screened porch was great. Only problem was how steep the stairs were and how low the ceiling was in the stairwell. I’m only 5 ft and my head was close to the top of the stairs. This is typical for houses this age but something to be aware of if you’re tall or have trouble navigating stairs. Another note the secondary bedrooms utilize a pass through which wasn’t a problem for our stay as we only needed one of them. However you could get around that by locking the door to the bathroom and the pass through bedroom for privacy. I will recommend this home to friends and family"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had an incredible stay for an Eastern Shore long weekend. The house was close to town, near the water and several parks, and a great jumping off point for exploring further afield. Everything inside was modern and comfortable, and we appreciated nice touches from the owners like a welcome basket and bathroom equipment for our toddler. We will be back!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,As advertised. Very comfortable home for us and our dogs. We brought our own sheets to cover the couch. Walked to dinner one night. Fenced in back yard was great for the dogs. Lovely home and we felt comfortable and very welcomed as soon as we stepped inside!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a perfect Eastern shore getaway! Adina and Bobby were wonderful hosts and their house had all the amenities and comforts of home with beautiful decor. I would highly recommend and look forward to going back!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great find! Super close to parks and water, we were there for an Ironman race and couldn't have gotten a better place! We walked to race check in, in the am. Lots of extras in kitchen and bathrooms. Beds are comfy, furniture is beautiful and comfy. There is a back porch screened in! We' ll most likely be back."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, wow,wow! A beautiful well furnished home with touches of old and modern smartly combined. The home came well equipped with items that are easily forgotten right down to all kinds of kitchen utensils and serving dishes. Kudos to a job well done! Adina’s instructions on departure times were insightful and very helpful. Do follow them! I totally enjoyed the quietness at night and the easy going days walking the neighborhood to the marina and downtown to restaurants and shops. My dog enjoyed the big yard immensely along with the walks to the marina park. Definitely coming back soon! Already my friends are making plans to book the property. You won’t regret it at all!
Thanks Adina and Bobby for making my birthday weekend a great one! Evelyn"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed a wonderful girls’ weekend at this beautiful house. It’s the perfect jumping off point to explore all the towns of the Eastern Shore, and it’s in east walking distance of local spots in Cambridge.
It’s spacious and comfortable for cooking and hanging out. We especially loved making meals in the big open kitchen & aperitifs on the screened in porch. Adina was a responsive and helpful host. Hope to stay here again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Gorgeous house so cozy! we had a great time
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Adina & Bobbie, our stay was such a wonderful experience. You have a lovely home. It was so cozy, which made me want to a stay a few more days. This is my hometown and it was so good to come home. Everything was so well decorated . We enjoyed the back porch and of course we grilled! The kitchen was amazing. I cooked every day. I couldn't stay out of the claw tub in the bathroom.
The beds were the most comfortable I've had the pleasure to sleep in. Anything that you desired was there for your convenience . I will be back to this wonderful home soon. Thanks Adina & Boobie. You are two great hosts."
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,Absolutely adorable cottage and incredible hosts.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful 2 week stay at Adina's. We got to play with our 18 month granddaughter while her parents teleworked. The house was perfectly suited for all of us and our various activities. Everything was shipshape and we were particularly amazed by the well-equipped kitchen and the screened back porch.
The house is conveniently located: close to the water, walking distance from a park with playground and a small beach which our granddaughter very much enjoyed and to great restaurants in downtown Cambridge. The neighborhood is very quiet and the neighbors were very nice. We got to visit Oxford and St Michael's which are nearby.
To top it all, we had the best welcome basket and note of any AirBnB we ever rented. Thanks Adina!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Awesome kitchen! Nice and cozy home!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house was absolutely perfect for our recent visit to Cambridge. We were in town for a wedding and Lia's home was an ideal home base for our family of four, as we had a number of different events to attend in the area. Not only was the location perfect for our travel but there was the added bonus of being in town during the Cambridge Classic Power Boat Regatta, which we got to enjoy watching right from the comfort of the beautiful dining room and backyard. The home is filled with lovely touches that made our stay absolutely delightful and the Choptank river views are so serene and peaceful. Lia was the perfect host and I highly recommend this great property to anyone looking to visit the Cambridge area. We would absolutely return if our travels bring us back this way!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a beautiful and peaceful setting. The home was very clean and well appointed. Everything you need was included and more. Lia was the ultimate host. Our family really enjoyed our stay.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is unbelievable. The photos look beautiful but being there, you realize they don't do it justice. Besides the beauty of the surroundings and the fact that you're essentially in a cul de sac so there's no traffic (excellent for when travelling with kids and if you want peace and quiet), this house is the best equipped house/property we've ever stayed at anywhere in the world. Think of anything you'd have at home to prepare a meal, toys for the kids, entertainment, outside hanging out, and they have it and more. It feels rather like someone is lending you their own well equipped house to stay in. There are many beautiful trees on the property that make for a paintable landscape. The feng shui of the house is amazing. The rooms are well isolated from the noise of the main living spaces. The patio and outside space is absolutely enjoyable. We had to check out by 11 and we made sure to stay until the last minute. Thank you for our amazing Stay Lia and Jeremy!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This home is in a beautiful setting and had everything we needed. Lots of places to sit outside and enjoy the view. The backyard was peaceful at all times of the day. Very tidy and well maintained house. We loved our stay!
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"A small group of friends and I stayed here for a long weekend and felt like we lucked out on the best AirBnB in the area. The indoor space was clean and had plenty of seating/space for hanging out and playing board games. But the outdoor space was the star of the weekend - there’s great seating looking out on the water, a grill and a solo stove, plenty of space for lawn games and a stunning and peaceful view. Lia was a very responsive host who answered my questions ahead of time to ensure we’d have everything we needed. This was the most well-stocked AirBnB I’ve ever stayed in and the check-in and check-out processes were super simple. Ultimately, this AirBnB was AMAZING and I hope to come back again."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,We loved staying here for a friend’s birthday weekend! The home was absolutely stunning and comfortable for our group.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved this house
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a raucous time with three kids 10, 7, and 5. They loved the house! Highlights for them were getting badges from the Harriet Tubman center and National Wildlife refuge."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend a stay here. The house is perfect, in a beautiful, peaceful location, with great views. It’s an easy drive or little walk into town, it’s large and roomy, very clean and organised. And Lia is very responsive. Very nice all around!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"AWESOME! Lia's place is so beautiful, peaceful, comfortable, and well-equipped! We were also amazed at how clean it is. It feels like a brand new house and is filled with quality furnishings and materials. The rooms are spacious and there are so many nice places to sit and relax or enjoy a meal.
The beds are super comfortable and we had extra blankets and pillows. The bathrooms are spotless and beautifully tiled and we had extra towels. There are clear instructions to use all the appliances and TVs. Check-in and check-out are easy and quick. The back deck is perfect for relaxing and bird watching. When we arrived we saw an eagle catch a fish in the pond and fly off!
The roads are quiet and nice to run, walk or bike on (provided bikes are in great shape!).
The house is just a few minutes from downtown Cambridge and all the great restaurants and shops, and close to everything on the shore.
Lia really went above and beyond to make our stay perfect. We hope to return often!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our second visit to this delightful home by the water. Highly recommend!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home in a wonderful location! You can see in the details of this home that Lia wanted things done right. They are. The home is lovely and very functional. She's thought of everything! From the fixtures in the bathrooms to the comfortable beds, to the two zone HVAC system, and the parts and pieces in the kitchen, all the way down to the s'mores kit: Lia has created a wonderful and inviting space for folks to use to relax!
We only stayed for the weekend. Now that we know about this place, we'll be back.
Our purpose for visiting? Seeing the winter migrating birds at Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge. Blackwater is only ~ 20 minutes away and is an amazing place for seeing and being in nature. If you are into nature/birding and looking for a great place to stay, Lia's place is a terrific option. In fact, you will likely be able to see the bald eagle in the top of the tree by the Choptank river each morning you're there! Lia was lovely to deal with and very responsive."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a perfect airbnb! So perfect that we might ask to buy the place ourselves :)
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay at our favorite home in Cambridge! We were so impressed with the space and amenities that we had to return this year. Thanks again Lia for making us feel right at home.
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful spot! Terrific setting. Home updated and comfortable. As well equiped as could be hoped. Responsive host. Five star plus.
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"We loved the space
It fit the need for my family to celebrate out granddaughters first trip to the eastern shore.
The location is awesome and the host was extremely responsive.
We will stay at this house again"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lia’s place is absolutely beautiful, as are the immediate surroundings. The house is right on a small lake, with the bay within sight. It is newly renovated throughout, nicely furnished and very well stocked with everything you will need for an exceptional holiday. The neighborhood is very quiet and only about a mile from the center of Cambridge. There is a really good coffee shop/bakery in town and several good restaurants. St. Michaels is a half-hour drive, and it is well worth the drive.
Lia is a responsive host. She contacted us ahead of our stay with a range of suggestions of things to do and see in the area. She was quick to respond to any question and always helpful. I highly recommend the house and the host!"
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"Lia’s home was AMAZING! I could not say enough good things about it! They thought of everything and you do not need to bring anything except your clothing. They have it all! It is like being in a hotel (towels, linens, soap, shampoo, hair dryers, ironing boards, toilet paper, fans, pack and play, alarm clocks). The home was exactly as pictured and everything was literally sparkling clean. They made it very family friendly with games and toys for the kids and even child friendly plates, cups, and utensils. The home is surrounded by the most beautiful views and quick drive away from town. Lia is very informative and responsive! My family and I can’t wait to go back! My favorite Airbnb I have ever been to!"
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"I booked Lia's place for a girls weekend getaway for my birthday. It was absolutely beautiful and so peaceful. The house is right on the water and there are adorable ducks around the area. The house was perfect and Lia is an amazing host. Always so responsive and gave great recommendations. :)
The town is also beautiful and Lia's guidebook was very helpful. Definitely recommend Ava's pizza and Blackwater bakery! They were delicious. I will definitely be back for another visit."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lia’s place exceeded expectations. It was super clean and well equipped. A really nice touch was the presence of labels on light switches and various pieces of equipment. And full instructions for all the equipment. The ducks and geese were a little unnerving but very cute. It was a perfect place for a relaxing stay.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a wonderful time at Lias place! Great Airbnb. Would definitely stay again!
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Such a beautiful home!! We could not say enough good things about this house and the hosts!
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Lia’s place was absolutely beautiful! The whole house was recently updated. Wonderful fresh new linens, comfortable beds, plates, cups silverware all new. The house is so much bigger than we thought. We loved sitting at the extra large kitchen table and outside on the deck over looking the water. The ducks kept us entertained, little cuties! We enjoyed swinging in the tree swings too! It was the most perfect place for a cousins girl weekend! We took a drive to St. Michaels on Saturday but the rest of the long weekend was spent creating great family memories in this beautiful house! Lia was very responsive and checked to make sure we had everything we needed. It felt like home! Thank you Lia!"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful immaculate home. They thought of EVERYTHING to make your stay comfortable. All details of the listing are accurate and Lia checked in to make sure everything was OK. 5 star all the way.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home and description totally accurate
A real home from home we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves
A great base to visit other areas like Oxford, St Michael’s and Black Water Wildlife Refuge
If you like birding it’s a great area
We watched a Bald Head Eagle hunting and catching a turtle and a snake swim across a pond
Great pizza in Ava’s in town
All in all a great experience
Lia has done a fabulous job 👍"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is incredible. The house shows that the hosts pay attention to make for a beautifully appointed place. The property is located next to a pond and also offers a beautiful view of the river. There is room for a family or group of friends to relax and enjoy the allure of Cambridge and the Eastern Shore. The kitchen offers all amenities to cook up a great meal, but if you’d rather relax on the deck or in the screened gazebo and order in, there are great restaurants nearby. We had a memorable visit and plan to return."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lia and Jeremy’s place was absolutely beautiful and serene. There were solid, delicious local choices for food nearby (excellent recommendations- thank you!) the scenery was unmatched, and the house and its amenities were perfect. We had everything we needed during our stay and then some. Our kids enjoyed the hammocks and the use of the guitar especially! Thank you Lia and Jeremy for a truly memorable stay!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What an amazing place- clean, comfortable, had absolutely everything you can think of, spacious and modern- it was great for our family and it will be amazing for yours!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing house with such beautiful scenery. Great and lot of amenities. Perfect for a quiet and peaceful getaway.
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful home with positive vibes made us feel right at home. Large common areas was perfect for family time. Have plenty of memories captured in the beautiful backdrop of lake/harbor! Lia’s responsiveness was greatly appreciated!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The pictures do not quite do it justice—Lia’s place has a beautiful unimpeded view of the Choptank. Unusual lot characteristics (backing up onto a pond that flows into the river) make this possible. The setting also makes for great bird watching. There is a screened in gazebo attached to a huge deck overlooking the water. Very private and close to downtown Cambridge. Great place and hosts.
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,One of the best places we have ever stayed! 5 star!! Lia and Jeremy went above and beyond as hosts. They thought of every details and provided us with everything we need for a relaxing and fun family getaway. We even got to enjoy the 4th of July firework show from town of Cambridge from the comfort of the deck! We can’t wait to come back soon!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hands down - this is one of the best Airbnb homes we have ever stayed in (and we have stayed in many both in the US and in Europe). The home itself is beautiful - inside and outside. The accommodations - beds, linens, towels, kitchen supplies, furniture - were all beyond what you normally find in a short term rental. And the setting is simply amazing. We loved watching the geese and ducks in the pond and the sailboats on the river. It was so totally relaxing to stay at Lia's home! And Lia is a super host - so easy to communicate with and super responsive. I sincerely wish we have another opportunity to visit the Eastern Shore just so that we can stay in Lia's home again."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Lia’s home was the perfect retreat for our group! Extremely well appointed, every amenity you could need, clean, and well labeled. The views of the pond and bay were beautiful and there was plenty of space for us to spread out and relax. She was very proactive in her communication about the house and went the extra step to make sure we were accommodated. I would highly recommend this home and host. Thanks again Lia!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lia and Jeremy's house is beautiful, very new, spotless, scenic and very well equipped. We very much enjoyed the water views and found the home to be a comfortable, relaxing and peaceful retreat. It's an easy car ride into the main part of town, and to the the grocery and fish market. Lia is very lovely, responsive and helpful. We will want to return as often as we can!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great weekend at this stunning home! Well-appointed and comfortable in a beautiful location, we had everything we needed and then some. We will definitely stay here again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,beautiful house with amazing pond and river views. clean and updated. loved the kitchen and bathrooms. close to town but private.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lia’s home was beautiful and had the perfect backyard for relaxing and playing with kids! The amenities from phone chargers, to kitchen supplies, to night lights, provided us with everything we needed and more! Would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a nice getaway that is close to restaurants and shops!"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Just a note…wow.
We had an exceptional stay. The location is beautiful. The house was ultra clean and well laid out. Beautiful attention from the owners, to ensure a pleasant stay. Availability of 2 bikes which is a plus.
I would recommend it in a second."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful home! Lots of amenities, fantastic views of the river,comfortable furniture, elegant fixtures, first class kitchen, primary bedroom and bathroom were amazing. I’ve been to alot of AIRBNB properties …this was our favorite! Lia was fantastic …very responsive and helpful! Loved this home!"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"We had a small girls' weekend getaway to celebrate a close friend before getting married. We wanted a location where we could all hang out and enjoy eachothers company. This location was perfect. The house was beautiful, and everything we needed in the kitchen to prepare meals. We loved the big kitchen table, allowing us to enjoy meals together and play games. The water view was amazing. Gorgeous sunrises. The yard and deck were perfect to enjoy the lovely weather."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful, comfortable and clean home with great kitchen for making meals. The host, Lia, was quick to respond to requests and gave us great recommendations for walks, restaurants, etc. Our favorite part was the backyard and deck with a spectacular view of the water. So private and peaceful, we definitely want to return!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Best equipped Airbnb we've ever visited. Had everything you could imagine from kitchen equipment to bikes. Very clean and owner is immediately responsive. Location is essentially on a private lake with tons of wildlife. Back porch is divine. You don't ever have to leave! If you do, the town is only 4 minutes by car."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and tidy house, the view is amazing, you can see the lake from the living room, the house is at the end of the street, very quiet, not far from the shopping center, my friends and I are really super satisfied with this house, and will go again"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lia’s place is amazing! My family has stayed in Airbnbs all over the U.S., and this was one of the best experiences we have had. The house is gorgeous and stocked with everything you could need. My family of seven felt right at home here. Some of our favorite things were: waking to the sunrise over the river/pond, climbing the tree in the backyard, reading/napping in the gazebo, riding our bikes to downtown Cambridge, RAR brewing, and the short walk (or bike ride) to a local playground. We also did day trips to Assateague National Lakeshore and the Blackwater Wildlife Preserve — both of which were well worth the trip. This was also possibly the cleanest Airbnb we have ever stayed in and had everything we needed to stay in and cook for ourselves. If I could give more than five stars, I would!"
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,The place was awesome and Lia was very responsive and extremely helpful.
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"I reserved Lia's place for a Team Retreat and I have to say it was absolutely GORGEOUS! The views alone were breathtaking, and the home was everything the listing said it would be. It was spotless, has beautiful views, fire-pit, friendly wildlife, and an Ah-mazing and fully stocked kitchen. Lia and Jeremy thought of it all and even had a printer on site with paper and ink for our use. My Team and I left feeling rejuvenated and cared for. I will be back for sure, maybe by myself next time to soak even more of it in. Book it!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic visit, the house was stunning and very comfortable."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a gorgeous retreat! I came with 3 friends on a girlfriends getaway, and we were pleasantly surprised at how well appointed and spacious this beautiful home is - not to mention the absolutely incredible view.
The beds were so comfortable, great lighting, a relaxing wood burning fireplace. The place was huge, super clean, and not one amenity was missed. The attention to detail was apparent! Oh, and the record player was an awesome touch.
We enjoyed our morning coffee overlooking the Choptank River and Pinks Pond. The town is super close, so it was easy to pick up meals or cook together in the chef's dream kitchen.
The door separating the living area from the bedrooms was great, I never felt like I was disturbing the late risers.
We took the 5-minute drive into the quaint town of Cambridge for brunch and shopping. We also enjoyed staying in to walk the neighborhood and huge park overlooking the river. What a relaxing weekend, we will definitely be back!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful time at Lia and Jeremy’s house! The house was gorgeous and fully equipped with everything we might need. They are so well organized with all the instructions for the house, local recommendations, etc in one place! We would definitely stay there again!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the home and location! Very peaceful and a great view. Lia has done a great job on setting up the home, everything we could have thought of (and more!) was there!
Very happy with our stay and looking at returning this spring!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,This spot is absolutely stunning! The views of the river are incredible and the house is warm and inviting! Lia is a pleasure to book with. Downtown Cambridge has lots to offer with its quaint boutique shops and some very delicious restaurants. The area is quiet and private yet just 2 minutes from downtown. You will not be disappointed with your stay in this beautiful spot!
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"Very nice house and scene is beautiful.
This house has only one bathroom with a shower. So be mindful of this as this can be an inconvenience for some."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lia & Jeremy’s home was the perfect Christmas getaway for me & my family! We found their home welcoming, clean, spacious, well stocked with toiletries and kitchen essentials, firewood, and personal touches throughout. The location and view (OMG the view!) provided the perfect quiet, cozy, and serene escape. Lia & Jeremy were excellent hosts! They were responsive and went above and beyond to make our stay a comfortable and memorable one. When the day arrived it really was hard to leave...but we will DEFINITELY be back!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home with an amazing view! The perfect location for a small group getaway or family gathering. Lia and Jeremy are thoughtful hosts and provided all the necessary amenities to make us feel at home.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lia is an incredible host with a truly beautiful home. She went above and beyond to care for us throughout our stay: quick responses to questions, a fully stocked kitchen, piles of firewood, aesthetically pleasing toiletries, seasonal decor, etc. the list goes on! 3 generations of my family stayed at the home and everyone found something to love. We hope to visit again soon and often!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful site with all the amenities needed for a perfect getaway. Well equipped kitchen. Convenient location on the river with ability to launch our kayaks. The hostess was friendly, helpful and responsive. Plenty of space for two and we easily made it work for three adults with an air mattress. Farm.location is quiet and peaceful. Beautiful stargazing at night.
.."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay at Lisas place. Perfectly located for us to get in the water and do some kayak fishing. The tiny house was super clean and stocked. Met Lisas husband who was very welcoming. Will definitely return in the future on our next fishing trip to Blackwater!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed at the Little House a couple of times now, and it has always been a wonderful experience. Lisa and Pat are great hosts, and the accomodations are perfect for us. We look forward to our next visit."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely love the little house on the farm! This was our 3rd visit and we'll be back again next year! Thanks for a great visit Lisa and Patrick.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay ! My son and I got to spend a week together in the perfect place for the two of us. Our hosts were friendly and the entire location was as described. We are hoping to book again next year.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our visit and will definitely return. Mosquitoes were a little annoying but that’s to be expected in that area.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an absolutely perfect place to stay - the house looks just like the pictures, it is very cozy and comfortable, the entire house is immaculate, and the surrounding area is extremely peaceful and quiet. The house is a short distance to Blackwater Wildlife Refuge (the reason I was there) and Harriet Tubman National Park, and not far from restaurants and shopping. Lisa left the porch light on for me, knowing I may be arriving after dark, and messaged me shortly after arrival to make sure everything was satisfactory. The kitchen is well stocked with whatever is needed to cook meals at the house, although there is also a pretty comprehensive list of local restaurants and shopping, along with brochures of area attractions. It is obvious the hosts put a lot of thought into the comfort of their guests and providing whatever is needed during your stay. Absolutely fantastic Airbnb, and I will definitely return."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I absolutely loved loved loved this tiny home in the country. It was everything I expected. The home was lovely and relaxing and well appointed. Lisa even welcomed me with Happy Birthday letters under the tv which was so thoughtful. She even apologized for the tropical storm that put a damper on many of my plans.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a real gem. It was tastefully decorated and upon entering the house, it just felt like home. Lisa is a great host and it's no wonder that she's a super host.
The house is a prime location for those looking to participate in the Ironman race."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Lisa's place. It is very quiet, comfortable, and clean. She left us great suggestions for places to eat and things to do in the area. We borrowed the kayaks and explored the waterways around the house one afternoon which was incredibly convenient and saved us a ton in rental fees. The house was very comfortable and the kitchen has everything we needed. We'd definitely stay here again and would highly recommend this place to others."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very peaceful and convenient location with direct water access to Blackwater Animal Refuge. I will be happy to come back here again!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place and perfect for visiting Blackwater Refuge and Hooper’s Island.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and I had a great weekend! The house was so well decorated and had everything we needed. We also had a great time kayaking behind the house. We will definitely stay here again!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Second time visiting. Just as nice as the first! We look forward to spending another great weekend here next year. Thanks Lisa!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,We are very enjoyed stay at Lisa’s little farm house. The host is very kind to offer us fresh towel during stay if we needed. Furthermore we have unexpected guest for a few days and she wouldn’t mind and explain where the extra bedding are. The decorating of the house feel so welcoming everywhere and the bedroom is outstanding. Thank you for let us enjoyed stay at your little farm house. We will be back and will recommend our friends to your little farm house.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa is a wonderful host.
Just minutes from the refuge and from town"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect spot for a quaint Blackwater preserve getaway. We primarily stayed here to adventure in the park and got exactly what we were looking for: easy access to the water with host provided kayaks, 10 minutes biking from the entire preserve, and a comfy place to rest our heads at night after enjoying the park. There’s a pair of cranes who appear to live right by the house!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house is clean, well furnished and relaxing. The surroundings are really beautiful and calming with great sunsets!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I think I have stayed at the tiny house a half-dozen times.
Lisa is the perfect host! If you want privacy, that's what you'll get. If you, like me, have questions about the area or the workings of the farm, she is more than happy to share her wealth of information!
Very quiet, very clean.
We were lucky enough to be there when the wheat was being harvested. Such a treat for city people like us. There were trucks and combines, but we barely heard either."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed staying at Lisa’s property! The house was clean and exactly what the listing showed and described. The actual property where the house was located was amazing! Also, Lisa is a great host that is quick to respond and willing to go the extra mile for her guests. We will definitely be back!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lisa was probably the easiest person I’ve ever booked through! She was very helpful and responded quickly to any questions I had. Will book again next year!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa place is awesome, so nice. Clean and updated. They were wonderful and accommodating"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such acute, quiet, and quaint little spot. Super easy to find, easy to get in, all in all it was an amazing time. great to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city and just enjoy some peace and quiet and the surrounding nature."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at the tiny house, it was so good the first time, we had to come back. As before, Lisa and her husband are incredibly friendly and always responsive. The tiny house offers modern amenities in a small cozy space surrounded by beautiful eastern shore scenery.
The best part about this trip? This time, we left ENGAGED! So now this location will always hold a special place in our hearts. ☺️"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I love this place! Far better value than a hotel and an excellent base of operations for exploring Blackwater. If Lisa will have me back, I will become a yearly regular at her place. Enthusiastically recommended!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"All my expectations were exceeded at the relaxing tiny house in rural Dorchester County. The house is perfect, serene and adorable on the grounds of a working farm and along lightly trafficked roads ideal for bicycling. Lovely views of the countryside. Very zen."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful place to stay. Laid back and beautiful scenery. Lisa was very helpful and communicated perfectly! So close to Blackwater as well as Cambridge for all your needs. 10/10 would recommend and will be back!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent Airbnb! The best one around Blackwater NWR. The place was spotless. The location was very convenient. Thank you!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay for the weekend. Very close to Blackwater Refuge. Place was very clean and quiet. Very good communication. Would stay there again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and very relaxing.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were return guests and can't wait till our next visit. The ""Little House on the Farm"" is so perfect for two. We love the setting and was welcomed by an eagle fishing in the pond one morning. We were taking pictures of wildlife before we even started the car to tour Blackwater Refuge. We highly recommend staying here."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It’s impossible to say just a few words because it was so wonderful! So here goes. During Covid when we were all homebound I would look through Air BnB’s and dream of all the places I would visit. This home was on the list. Turning into the lane, then opening the front door I realized dreams do come true! What a joy it was to experience all there is to see and do in this beautiful county. Then to come home at the end of day and stay at this lovely home. It may say it’s a little house. Let me tell you this little home delivers in a mighty big way. I would think of something I needed and there it was at my fingertips. The beautiful decor, and the sense of peace it gave you. A goods nights rest and expectations of another great day. They say a house is made of brick and stone but a home is built on love alone. This little home is big on love. Grateful most of all for such wonderful host and their gift of hospitality that they share so generously with others."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay at a unique location very close to great trails in the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an adorable place to stay. The farm setting is peaceful, beautiful, and right on the doorstep of Blackwater Wildlife Refuge. My husband and I were there specifically for the Refuge. Being able to be that close was perfect. The house had everything we needed to be comfortable and make meals. More than enough room for the two of us. We enjoyed the quiet and peace. Sitting on the dock out back to watch the geese was an added bonus. We didn't miss the WIFI and cable. It's a nice chance to just unplug and get back to nature. We will definitely be back."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Little House on the Farm met my expectations and then some. I loved being able to take nature walks along water and around fields going right outside the door. Not having to drive a car for several days was a true vacation. I was able to calm down my city anxieties and get into a rhythm of reading, writing, meditating which is exactly what I intended. I imagine that in warmer months with kayaking available would make the place even more desirable. I only spoke with Lisa on the phone and she was always prompt and helpful. This place actually fits the description."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful house and a beautiful property
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the third time we've stayed in the Tiny House. It is such a great little place in a great spot for birding and exploring. It is clean, well-kept and Lisa is a great host."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa's place was great! We booked this place for its accessibility to Blackwater Refuge for a birdwatching trip and were thrilled with the easy access to Blackwater. A bonus, it's so close that you can see birds from the airbnb's windows as you're getting ready in the morning - we saw a bald eagle from the window Saturday morning! Cambridge MD isn't too far away (about 15 min) and is a nice small town with some good eating options. The house was thoughtfully appointed and had everything we needed; I especially liked the heater in every room, including the bathroom, since I get cold. We had a great stay and would definitely stay again!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a treasure! We got there later than expected but Lisa had the light on and we entered from a long drive and meetings all day to the most peaceful farmhouse. From the warm fall candle scent when we arrived to the warm cozy heaters, well appointed furniture and peacefully decorated accessories all on a beautiful piece of land. It was exactly what we wanted for a weekend sanctuary to relax and unwind. You don’t want to miss Black Water Bakery. We went Saturday for breakfast and lunch. Ava’s Pizzeria for dinner and back to Black Water for lunch Sunday before we left. I give this air b&b a 10/10! We will send our family and friends for sure!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely amazing stay. Lisa and Pat are excellent hosts who were very attentive to anything I asked for. Their tiny house on the farm was perfect for me. Access to the Blackwater was great as was access to Cambridge. The home does not have cable, wifi, internet access so, as long as you come knowing that (it's in the home description) you will love the place as I did. Unplugged, off the grid, and quiet with amazing hosts!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed the tiny house so much for our weekend getaway! Everything was clean and well maintained, which made it great to spend time in when we weren’t out and about. Being very quiet was a plus and made us feel isolated but comfortable. Lisa was fantastic to work with, making sure to answer any questions and make sure everything was set for our stay (including fire wood for us to use!). We will definitely make an effort to visit the area, and stay here again if we can!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is fantastic. The home is even nicer than the pictures. With a sitting room, bedroom and full-size kitchen, it's very comfortable. There are lights everywhere you want them, including sconces behind the bed's headboard – perfect for reading in bed.
If you are interested in the natural beauty and history of the area, the Tiny House is centrally located to everything. Stay awhile and do it all; the landscape is mesmerizing. In the Tiny House you almost feel like part of it because it is situated on a working farm. While I was there, they were harvesting (corn, it looked like), but a guest could still come and go, launch a kayak (you'd have to bring your own), and watch the herons float on by."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lisa went above and beyond to make sure our stay at the Little House was perfect. The Little House was perfectly located and had all the necessities to make it a great vacation. We had such a great time visiting the Blackwater Refuge
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,So thankful that this wonderful little place was available again!! It was just as great as the 1st time!! It’s on a Beautiful Historic Farmland!! Clean & stocked with everything you’d need to relax!! Close to Cambridge & all that it has to offer!! Lisa & Pat are wonderful host!!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The tiny house on the farm did not disappoint. Lisa thought of all the little things to make us feel at home. A perfect distance from town and a great place to stay for Ironman Maryland.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great hosts and a great stay. The farm property is quiet and peaceful. The tiny home is cozy and supplies much that is needed, from recommendations to pots and pans to cook a favorite dish. Great access to a body of water for kayaking or fishing. Kind hosts!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem!! We just loved this place. Great location for the Blackwater Refuge, Harriett Tubman sites, and strolling in the town of Cambridge. It’s a tiny house but absolutely comfortable and has everything you need. Will be back."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! Exactly as it was pictured! Homey, comfortable, very clean and perfect weekend getaway. If your in the area and looking for a place, it’s a must stay. Quick 10 min drive to downtown Cambridge if you are looking for places to grab a drink or dinner. Lisa was extremely quick to communicate and would accommodate any request. Would definitely return!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Tiny House was perfect as usual! We kayaked and took a guided fishing trip from Blackwater Adventures and snagged 3 huge snakehead. Thank you Lisa and Patrick we love visiting your farm!!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful host and wonderful stay. We will be back!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The tiny house on the farm was absolutely just perfect. It was so clean, decorated brilliantly and had everything you needed. We will most definitely be back. Thank you!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay and recommend the tiny house to anyone looking for a great weekend base at the Blackwater Refuge area.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean quiet just want I was looking for!!
What a great weekend"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely speechlessly incredible home, and even better HOSTS! It is clear that Lisa and Pat put such care, attention, and hospitality into every detail of their guests stay. From little things like making sure cozy blankets are set up by the DVD player for movie night, to bigger things like making sure all the essentials are stocked in the house (including a million extra pillows, washcloths, pots/pans, Tupperware, coffee, EASTERN SHORE spices, you name it!!), and to even BIGGER things like setting up our outdoor adventures with a ready-to-light fire pit and taking the time to check on the rivers’ water level to see if we could kayak (thank you again Pat for spending your Sunday doing that for us!!). And on top of all that, Lisa pretty much planned our entire itinerary weekend with her amazing suggestions the whole month leading up to the weekend (thanks for answering all my questions Lisa!) and then has so many pamphlets and even a binder of fun things to do once we got into the house. Amazing!
But besides the incredible care and hospitality, the house and property itself are just breathtaking. If you want to stay in, the home is skillfully decorated to feel like a larger space than it is, and it’s super comfy indoors with fantastic ac units that hold the temperature to perfection. If you’d rather stay nearby and just want to explore the property, it is so quiet and private and perfect for bird watching or kayaking. Or, if you want to go out you’re super close to downtown Cambridge for amazing restaurants and water views (definitely recommend Rar brewery and Blackwater Bakery next door!). The great thing is though, you are close to town but feels like you’re out there on your own. (For single women: perfect place to stay if you want to feel like you’re staying away and “out there” because it feels so quiet and private, but Lisa and Pat are right next door if you need them for anything!)
Overall, this place is just something so special. Overall, these people are just something so special. I highly recommend the tiny home over any other “resort” in the area! Thank you for everything Lisa and Pat!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our 4th time at the Little House! Still as perfect as the first time we stayed. Very quiet. Very clean!
The area is lovely in any season, but there's so much to do in the summer with Blackwater NWR and kayak rentals 5 minutes away!
Lisa is a great host - responsive but not intrusive."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had not intended to book a place without wifi or laundry (don’t make reservations until you’re caffeinated friends!). I was a bit bummed when I realized what I had done. However, after staying here, I do not regret it one bit! Lisa could not have been a better host. As a note: there are laundromats in Cambridge, and Verizon wireless works well, so I just used my phone as my hotspot.
Her place is spacious, clean, and very well provisioned! I have stayed in AirBnBs in 6 countries, and this is one of my all time favorites. There are enough dishes and cooking utensils for 4 people. She also provides lots of cleaning supplies (not all hosts do). She cautions guests that it may be noisy due to being a working farm, but we did not experience that (it’s summer, and the AC units provide background noise). However, the bugs are no joke (I got 18 bites THOUGH my pants on a windy night). She communicates very well and is super respectful of your space. Anyone we spoke to in the area told us how lovely they were, and we agree!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Great Little House! Highly recommended.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The tiny house was more than we expected, beautiful and clean and close enough to everything in Cambridge and the surrounding area, really amazing!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Little House on the Farm is such a delight and a gift for those visiting the area. It’s right next door to Blackwater Refuge which is a gem of a place for birders, photographers, kayakers, bikers, etc.
It is quite obvious that Lisa takes extremely good care of her place and is thoughtful about what makes a place relaxing and welcoming.
Thanks again Lisa for a wonderful time! We don’t need to look further and will always choose to stay at The Little House when in the area, if available!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful farm location with its own resident heron. Our hosts were fantastic and the house is so cute and well designed. Close to vineyard, fishing, trails, and Cambridge."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our third stay at the little house and it was just as great as our first. Very clean, not-too-small, space in a gorgeous area. Very quiet, with lots of birds and wildlife in the immediate area - Blackwater NWR is minutes away. Two mature eagles flew over while I was having coffee this morning and the osprey put on a show.
We were lucky enough to watch the combine reap the wheat across the road. It was better than TV for us city folk!
Lisa is a fabulous host. Doesn't intrude but is just a text or steps away.
Will return yet again!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot, right on the farm and only a short drive away from the Blackwater wildlife refuge. The house looks tiny on the outside but feels big on the inside."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely amazing town had such a great time the house was spotless,decorated so sweetly,10 out of 10!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The tiny house had everything I needed for a great stay. The location is beautiful and very close to Cambridge where I was commuting for work. I got great trail running recommendations. It was nice to have a home away from home!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Lisa’s tiny house. It was clean, quaint, and perfect for our stay."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a lovely stay here! Everything was very clean and safe which allowed us to feel calm and peaceful during our visit. Check in was simple and any communication was quick. The space (inside and out) was well cared for. 10/10 would recommend staying here!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a hidden gem. Our stay exceeded our expectations and Lisa was so wonderful. This is now our go to in the Cambridge area.
I would love to give the ""Little House on the Farm"" 10 stars."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Lisa is the best! Her house was so nice and accommodating!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lisa is an excellent host and very accommodating. We loved the tiny house it had everything we needed for a weekend get away.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place on a quiet farm out away from the town lights. Hosts were great and communication was excellent. The house was clean and comfortable.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Little House on the Farm is ideally situated to take advantage of both the Blackwater Wildlife Refuge and all Cambridge has offer. We loved the quiet isolation of the farm and the accommodations were second to none.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a perfectly positioned little gem for anyone visiting Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge or the surrounding area. A great little launching place for exploring the area, all fresh and clean and comfortable. Great communications, clear directions, quiet setting just a few minutes from Blackwater and the surrounding trails and launches."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing, comfortable, and has everything you need. It’s so close to everything and it’s peaceful!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a plenty spacious spot to enjoy the natural beauty and remoteness of the Blackwater area.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A cozy and comfortable place for one or two, remote and quiet. Lisa has thoughtfully prepared and maintained this gem of a space. Looking forward to return visits!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location for exploring Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge. Also close to Cambridge and some very good restaurants. Lisa is an excellent host. The tiny house is lovely and clean and had everything we needed for our weekend stay. The location on the farm offers some fantastic views of changing weather.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Tiny House on the Farm is the perfect home base to enjoy all that Dorchester County has to offer: great food, history, biking, paddling, and more. The house is clean and comfortable, and it is evident that Lisa put a lot of thought and care into decorating this house. After a day of biking the local roads or paddling one of the many paddling options, we enjoyed coming back to the house and sitting outside by the fire, or sitting on the sofa and enjoying the view out the front door (one morning, a bald eagle flew by right in front of the door). Lisa's seemingly unlimited knowledge of the area led us to the best crab cakes and tuna tacos we've ever experienced. We enjoyed our stay very much."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Second time stay and it's still immaculately clean. Like, you could eat off the floor clean. We stayed over the Christmas holiday and the tiny house was festively decorated and included homemade cookies!
Lisa is very responsive to all questions; a perfect host."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is our second time staying here. It is a great little house in a perfect location for Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge. The house is really nice and spotlessly clean. Lisa is a great host.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderrul stay at the tiny house. Wanted to be near Blackwater Wildlife Refuge, as biking there was the focus of our trip. We enjoyed having our own space and a refrigerator. Nice to be out in the country.
The house is lovely. Lots of amenities. Very quiet and private, of course."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place to stay feels like home
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Since I'm local and renovating my house it was a great place to stay with privacy and close to home so my girlfriend could see where I'm from. Riding by the farm occasionally I truly thought the pictures were deceiving but it's much roomier than I imagined. Very comfortable and very well decorated. Allyson absolutely loves it. I wouldn't have expected any less knowing the family. Versus a hotel to stay near home, we will definitely be back after my next tugboat hitch in 3 weeks. Thanks for everything. Wish we could have gotten a chance to catch up more."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,the tiny house is very nice and I would highly recommend it to anyone needing a place to stay in the area.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tiny little piece of rural paradise. Beautiful tiby home with everything we needed to just relax and enjoy.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really nice, clean place and the owner went the extra mile letting me check in a little early"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay. The place was extremely clean, comfortable, had all of the amenities I needed and was conveniently-located. I look forward to a return stay at some point in the future."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We can't think of a better place to stay for a few days or even weeks! The ""tiny"" house is perfect for two - tastefully designed and furnished, simply and comfortably laid out, clean and efficient with everything one needs. While perched on the edge of a large working farm, it is quiet and peaceful, and the business of the farm is a fascinating sidelight. Have a talk, if you can, with one of the farming family and discover or rediscover a hard, but deeply rewarding way of life. Take advantage also of the river and refuge - there is nothing quite like it anywhere else in our part of the country. And don't miss out on the host's warm and welcoming hospitality!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"amazing place to stay: Quiet, clean and great host. I will definitely keep this place on the top of my list next time I go to the area"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa's place is a great location for a stay in Blackwater. It is also not far from Cambridge. During our stay we fished in the backyard and bridges around the place. Very convenient for a fishing trip. Lisa was a great host as well. The place looks like a little cabin from airbnb but has everything including utensils, plates, stove, fireplace, etc."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Little House is a remarkable retreat on a beautiful farm. There were no farm activities to disturb the quiet country setting. It is just minutes to both the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Historical Park and Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge - neither should be missed during a visit.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were in town for Ironman Maryland and this tiny home served as the perfect base camp. I’d highly recommend staying here to anyone looking for a quiet getaway just outside of Cambridge. We also had a great time kayaking just outside the front door!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for a weekend getaway and had a great time. It’s a cozy little house that’s a short drive away from Cambridge and an even shorter drive to the wildlife preserve.
The hosts were excellent and check in and out was a simple and smooth process."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Blackwater Refuge- Kayaking launch!
I needed a short getaway, I love kayaking but didn't bring my own. Lisa was kind enough to let us use her kayaks. There's a launch right on the property. the house itself was immaculate. it was quaint, clean, and comfortable. Lisa was responsive to my many questions from the moment I booked my stay. I would definitely recommend this stay and will come back for a weekend away on Blackwater again! Thank you kindly!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at the Little House. It was clean and comfortable and very thoughtfully decorated. The close proximity to Blackwater was a real plus. The lack of WiFi was a plus for us. We hope to return in the fall to catch the migratory birds. If you’re planning a trip to Cambridge or Blackwater we highly recommend the Little House.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The location was so peaceful and quiet - the perfect getaway to refresh from my busy life. The place was soooo clean and cozy as well! My friend & I really enjoyed our stay. The location was also super close to the Refuge (highly recommend to visit there!). Highly recommend this place!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful accommodations, very clean! Beautiful details in the ‘tiny house’. We enjoyed our stay and we loved the surrounding area. Hope to be back so we can kayak and hike around! Thank you for the great stay!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super clean not-that-little space! Very cute with enough room to stretch out. Kitchen had everything needed to cook a meal, including some basics in the cupboard. The bathroom and shower are pristine!! Comfy bed. The farm is lovely and only 5 minutes from BNWR entrance.
No WiFi, but the Verizon signal is very strong - I was able to do Zoom meetings with no lag.
Lisa is very quick to answer any questions!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa’s place was AMAZING.
I am from Maryland but have never been to this part. I wanted a get away with my partner where we could be away from the noise but still find things to do.
Firstly the space is bigger than you think by reading “tiny home” but it is plenty for two people.
The kitchen has everything we needed, living room was spacious (if they had a bigger tv I would have been stuck lol) but we found plenty to do outside, and the bed was amazing.
Natural light made its way in despite the large beautiful trees they have so I still got my content. There is no WiFi so I used my data but my partner did not have hardly any internet, she didn’t mind but keep this in mind if you must be on your phone/laptop.
We did not get to use the kayaks but they were there so hopefully you can if the water permits! Lisa gave us bikes and we rode EVERYWHERE.
I can definitely say our favorite part was star gazing at night. We parked my car and laid out and saw so many shooting stars (possibly an alien or two; unconfirmed atm). Thank you so much Lisa, can’t wait to post these clips to my TikTok & IG! @iamorlandojames 😁"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa and Patrick’s home was very quaint and lovely. We enjoyed relaxing and the activities around town. If we ever go back, which we intend to, we are definitely staying in the Tiny House :)"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a fantastic stay at the tiny house. It was very spacious as well as super clean. The kayaks are a nice touch and gives you something to do in your free time. It was located fairly close to shopping centers and just 2 miles from the Wildlife refuge. If you’re looking for a great place to stay for a getaway in Maryland this is it! Definitely enjoyed our trip and will look to stay here again in the future
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful place to stay near Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge, Cambridge MD, and the environs. Peaceful, beautiful farm setting with easy access to birdwatching, kayaking, biking, and sightseeing. Downtown Cambridge is only about 15 minutes away. One thing to know is that the ""Little House"" is really not that little and is quite a comfortable size for two people. Very clean and well maintained, with all the amenities you could need."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay with just the right friendly privacy we enjoy. Comfortable, with everything we could want in the Little House and decorated with great taste too! Definitely planning to come back as soon as 2022 dates open up. The location is perfect with easy access to Cambridge, Blackwater Refuge, the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Museum, and other historic sites. We didn’t use the available kayaks due to the heat and insects but would love to next time!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The tiny house was beautifully decorated and provided plenty of space for two people to stay. The area is gorgeous and quiet. There is everything you could need at the house and anything else you could want is just a close distance away. My husband and I loved everything about our stay here and would love to stay here again.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place about 15 minutes from town to give you peace and quiet. One of the cleanest and cutest places you will probably get to stay at. Perfect to travel to so many different locations!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I decided to book the tiny house as a surprise long weekend birthday trip for my girlfriend and we had an amazing experience. For anyone who loves outdoors activities such as kayaking, biking, and walking while exploring beautiful Eastern Shore landscapes, this is the place for you. The tiny house is located very conveniently to plenty of activities near Blackwater Refuge. The interior or the tiny house is absolutely gorgeous and very comfortable. The owners, Lisa and Patrick, go above and beyond to make the stay enjoyable. We had an awesome experience and plan to return in the future."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our recent five night stay in the little house on the farm was a wonderful experience from start to finish. For two guests it is surprisingly spacious, we never felt cramped, even after spending a rainy afternoon indoors. The house is very clean, nicely decorated, comfortable temperature and is situated on a lovely property. Whether you want to kayak or just enjoy the wildlife from the dock, the water access is a wonderful feature. It is the best of both worlds, immersed in nature and just minutes away from towns with dining opportunities and museums to learn about an area steeped in historical significance. The hosts are respectful of your privacy and a joy to converse with. A great vacation!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great and comfortable stay on the eastern shore! The tiny home is close to downtown via car or bike! The hosts are on site and have great recommendations for activities around town.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lisa's place was just as advertised! It was a perfect size for the two of us. Her farm was quiet and easy to find. The tiny house is very cute and nicely decorated! We would definitely come back!
2021-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Good stay
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This house is perfect for a nice getaway. So cozy and peaceful. The host is lovely and accessible at all times. I enjoyed my stay and will definitely be returning.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a quiet, charming little house on a farm that you can see stars at night because it’s dark enough. It is perfect for city dwellers to get away for the weekend."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a place to go for relaxation and beautiful surroundings, the ""little house"" on the farm fits the bill. Lisa is a host willing to help in any way she can to make your stay enjoyable. The interior of the house is done in colors and decor that create a warm and comfy experience. A list of restaurants and places to visit also add to your overall experience. This Airbnb is a spot I will revisit in the future."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa’s place is really great! It is just as pictured. Well appointed, nicely decorated, and super clean, which is important to us! We were looking to bike Dorchester County and this was the perfect location to ride out the drive to Blackwater Wildlife Refuge, or to explore points beyond. This is a bike friendly area, so go for it! Lisa is perfectly responsive. We highly recommend the little house on the farm!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location for easy access to Blackwater Refuge. The ""tiny house"" was well equipped, clean and beautifully decorated. We enjoyed the peaceful setting on the farm. After launching our canoe from the property's bank, we spent a relaxing day fishing and bird watching. While on the farm we spotted deer, fox, bunnies, turtles and eagles. Lisa responded immediately to our inquires and provided a private escape from the hustle and bustle."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay with Lisa was top notch from beginning to end! The small house was really not all that small, and it was just as depicted in the photos, only better.
Perfectly clean, quiet and a great base for us to explore the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge and the various Harriet Tubman historical sites. Both are very close and Cambridge is just a short drive away as well.
Communication was excellent and Lisa answered our questions promptly and fully.
We hope to return, thanks so much Lisa for everything, a very memorable stay."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautifully decorated, designed for comfort, and placed in the ideal location. Oh, and I can’t forget to mention the fabulous hosts who go out of their way to accommodate.
The Blackwater Wildlife Area is a very special place for us, a place to enjoy nature, ride bikes, kayak, enjoy great food or do nothing at all. This house was perfectly located to put us in the middle of everything we love about the area.
As mentioned, there is no WiFi, but if you can’t go a few days without it, then you probably don’t get what makes this area soooo special.
We cannot wait to return."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect spot. Great access to the town. Lisa and Pat are fantastic folks.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little house on a beautiful farm-immaculate and comfortable! Friendly hosts! Kayak rental right down the road. Cambridge is close and has nice restaurants. Next time we will bring bicycles!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location for exploring the Black Water Wildlife Refuge. Has everything you need for a home base.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A very pleasant place to stay while visiting Blackwater NWR. Super convenient to the Refuge. The house was cozy and perfectly maintained. Highly recommended!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for a place to go to relax & enjoy some of what the country life has to offer, this is your place!! Located on a beautiful farm not far from Cambridge! This location is perfect for those that want to travel around Dorchester County & enjoy all that it has to offer! Felt great to be back in the country & to be around nature!! Lisa is an amazing host! This Airbnb was the cleanest most practical we’ve ever stayed in!!!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,our stay was lovely and relaxing. The tiny house on the farm was very enjoyable and met our needs. Warm and welcoming and taken care of. Great location for being on eastern shore of Maryland.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our 3-night stay at the ""Little House on the Farm"" exceeded our expectations. First and foremost, this house did not seem ""little"". It's cozy, sure, but it's plenty large for 2 people and we never felt crowded. It's actually 3 rooms: An eat-in kitchen attached to the main living area (with couch and arm-chair), separate bedroom, and full-size bathroom with large shower. The house is on a secluded farm, located across from the main house, and near a large pond. The house appears to be recently constructed and is in fine shape, very clean, and comfortably furnished. The built-in electric heating unit did a fine job of keeping the entire place warm. Lots of natural sunlight during the day and good lighting in all the rooms for the night. Window blinds for privacy. No wi-fi (we knew this ahead) but the signal for Verizon cell service is strong. If you like nature, the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge is a mile down the road and has several good hiking trails (short and moderate length) and a drive-through nature road. We spent a full day there and got to see bald eagles in their nest. (Bring binoculars!) All in all, this was a great place to go for a socially-distanced get-away. We both highly recommend the ""Little House on the Farm"" ."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Lisa and Pat's little house on the farm. It is perfectly located for exploring Blackwater NWR at all times of day, as well as convenient for an outdoor lunch in Cambridge. The house is very clean and well equipped with everything we needed for a weekend away from the city. Lisa was very responsive and helpful in answering all of our questions. We can't wait to stay again on our next visit to Blackwater NWR!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was perfect. Thank you!
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely, comfortable little house in a great location for birding and exploring. The little house is beautiful inside and the location is quiet and pretty. Lisa is an excellent, communicative host."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed a few days over the thanksgiving holiday. We wanted a quiet few days and had never been to this area. The Little House was perfect. On the inside it’s beautiful and comfortable. We really loved everything about it. The chess board and cards came in handy. The tv gets three channels which for this trip was totally fine. We enjoyed driving and hiking in the area.
Lisa gave us so many great trips for the area. The food we ate in this trip was some of the best. Bombay Tadka, Old Salty for thanksgiving, Snappers... the mugs were a perfect touch as well.
We would totally recommend this and go back."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa’s little house on a farm was just what I needed to celebrate another trip around the sun. She communicated promptly to every message. The home was spotless clean and thoughtfully appointed, equipped with every comfort needed for my stay. The farm is as breathtaking in person as it is in photos. Thanks Lisa for providing the perfect respite!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is perfect for a quiet getaway. It is situated in a gorgeous natural setting close to the Blackwater Refuge and Chesapeake Bay. It is very private, clean and tastefully decorated in a modern farmhouse theme—quite adorable! Responses were immediate from our hosts."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful time at Lisa and Pat’s this past weekend. Very comfortable place and even better location! Looking forward to the next time back!
Thanks again guys!!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable place to stay away from the hustle and bustle. Well equipped kitchen if you planning on doing some cooking. Perfect location to stay if you’re going to the Blackwater wildlife refuge.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely tiny house exactly as pictured near the Little Blackwater River. The house is beautifully decorated and very comfortable, the kitchen and bath have nice touches, and the bedroom is very comfortable. Various brochures and maps for bicycling, paddling, and local history are provided in the house. The somewhat rainy weekend did not allow me to kayak or sit outside to enjoy the sunset so I hope to visit again though weather cooperated long enough for a nice bike ride at nearby Blackwater National Refuge and the local roads. I also drove by car along the Harriett Tubman Underground Railway byway listening to the audio guide on the free mobile phone app. The historic town center in Cambridge has some nice restaurants such as Theo’s, RAR Brewing, and Vintage 414."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a gem! It's located on a beautiful farm with a lake, about 15 minutes from Cambridge. The views are spectacular. The hosts are very responsive and helpful. I'd highly recommend staying here!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a great time at Lisa’s tiny house on the farm. It was very clean, very cute and she even left me a birthday cake as she knew we were traveling to celebrate my birthday. She was very communicative and very quick to respond. Overall we had a lovely time and hope to go back!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I really enjoyed our time at the Little House on The Farm. The house was cozy and nicely decorated just like the pictures. It was also well equipped with everything we needed to make breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The surrounding area made the perfect backdrop for our impromptu photoshoot, it was beautiful. Lisa and her husband Patrick were great hosts, making sure we had everything we needed to enjoy our little adventures. Communicating with them was very easy and quick. We highly recommend this place!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa went above and beyond to make sure my spouse and I had an awesome wedding anniversary trip, and even left us champagne and a cake! The lake is also gorgeous."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay at the ""tiny house"". The house was well appointed and the kitchen and bathroom were well equipped. The farm is beautiful and the location is great for access to the wildlife refuge or to put your kayaks in. Lisa was quick to respond to any messages and was good about checking in with us. We would be happy to stay there again if we're back in the area. Thanks again for a great stay!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great spot for kayaking and biking. Paddling from the house was fun and there are many put-in spots nearby. The house is very comfortable and has everything you'll need for a relaxing stay. Lisa offered great dining suggestions and was very quick to respond to questions. We'll be back soon, I hope!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa's Tiny House was easy to find and very close to Blackwater Wildlife Refuge. It's also a short drive into downtown Cambridge. Travelling in the time of COVID-19, we were looking for a place that was a little more isolated and this place worked great. Check-in was super easy and contactless, and we were able to enjoy our 2 nights there without any issues. Clean, modern, well appointed, and remote. It was a nice place to relax, a nice change of scenery, and Lisa was a perfect host."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Wonderful hosts. Very quiet. Loved my short stay. Will definitely check and see if available next time I head to thpe area
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Little House on the Farm is strongly recommended for a visit to the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge. Across the lawn is the BWR water! The house is spotlessly clean and completely equipped. The location is very quiet and peaceful and you're smack in the middle of the Eastern Shore's wet low-country. The owners are very friendly, thoughtful and ready to assist in any way. Fantastic place."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed here as part of a long weekend to see more of the eastern side of Maryland.
The location is away from the usual hustle and bustle and located right next to water access, which gives some lovely views even from the accommodation. The farm grounds made a relaxing and scenic location to unwind.
The accommodation itself was sparklingly clean and fully kitted for the majority of stays. There were toiletries, coffee-making supplies and tons of extra luxuries which really made our stay extra special.
The host, Lisa, was particularly attentive and responsive - giving us lots of helpful recommendations on where to visit and making sure our stay was as comfortable as possible. She really went the extra mile for us and we would definitely stay here again if we were in the area. What an amazing place!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"A restful week away in a beautifully appointed little house on the Farm. Full of comfort and charm, Lisa provided for even the little details. Easy access to nature trails, kayaking,bird watching, and choice of restaurants. A great place to stay for an overnight or several days. Thanks so much!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I spent three nights at Lisa's house and had a wonderful experience. She is an amazing, super responsive host. She made us feel welcome and offered excellent suggestions. The house is well appointed and it was the perfect place to get away for a few days."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I enjoyed a 2 night stay at the little house and had a wonderful time. The place was sparkling clean and even though they have only been renting for a few months, the attention to the little things showed. The kitchen is well equipped with plenty of teas and coffee. The bathroom was stocked with soaps and shampoos and plenty of soft towels. We enjoyed walking around the farm early in the morning with our coffee and watching the sun rise over the silos. There is water access right out the door and took advantage several times to relish in the quietness. We will definitely visit again!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay. Lisa really went above and beyond as a host--we appreciated her thoughtful communications with us, and all of her recommendations were really helpful. We loved that she had a very detailed binder full of information on local attractions and dining. The space itself was absolutely lovely. It was very clean, cool, and cozy. Lisa provided some mini toiletries just like a hotel, and the kitchen was well stocked with staple cooking ingredients, coffee, and bottled water. There's no wifi, but there is a TV with a DVD player and a nice selection of movies. We also loved the location. The farm was just lovely and it wasn't far from many restaurants in town, kayaking/Black Water Wildlife Refuge, and the Harriet Tubman Museum (closed at least right now due to COVID-19 but we'll have to come back). The house is also only about 1.5 hours from the beach, so a beach day trip is easy from there. Overall, this was the perfect getaway for us, and we would stay there again!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We spent two nights at Lisa’s Small house on the Farm. It’s
A renovated modular office turned into a spectacular modern farm house getaway. It was cleverly done, and cozy, yet spacious, too. She greeted us on arrival, and we had a comfortable stay while we were looking at properties in the area. The design and furnishings were beautiful, and it was spotlessly clean. We couldn’t have been more pleased. This is a new AirBnb and I can wholeheartedly recommend it!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa's ""Tiny House"" was lovely to stay at. We ended up picking it last minute, but are so glad we did. It was beautifully decorated-- very new and modern, but still cozy. It was absolutely spotless when we got there as well. The kitchen was well stocked with what we needed in order to cook a few basic meals, the only thing we didn't have was a corkscrew, not a big deal. If we are ever back in the area, we would definitely stay there again. I cannot recommend enough for anyone else considering it; it's one of the nicest Airbnbs we've seen."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa and Patrick were amazing hosts. This was our first trip post-covid and we could not have asked for a cleaner stay / better experience. We were the first people to stay in the ""Little Home on the farm"" and the space was beautiful. Lisa was extremely attentive and strove to make our experience the best possible. For example, she provided us with many local recommendations for food, attractions, and activities."
