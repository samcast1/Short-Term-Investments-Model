Comfy bed. Comfy chairs and furniture. Lots of snacks and sodas. Popcorn available. This place was such an oasis."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my third visit to Karen's place. I love it there because it feels like I'm staying with family or friends. Lovely place in all ways.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Karen was to work with!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Shalom cottage was such a hidden gem. I visited while in town for a wedding, and had such a comfortable stay. It felt so cozy and homey, like I was staying at my grandparents house as a kid. It‚Äôs evident that this property is a labor of love, and Karen takes great care of it.
The bed was incredibly comfortable, the alpacas were adorable, and having a hot cup of coffee on the porch in the morning was so serene. I‚Äôd never been to South Dakota before my stay, and this cottage alone is a reason to return. Thank you, Karen, for sharing your beautiful property with me!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We made last minute arrangements and were late for check-in...but we were welcomed with open arms and the Porch Light on!! Thank you for a wonderful stay. So peaceful and calm sitting on the porch with my coffee!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"5 stars? How about 500 stars. The cottages are amazing! There‚Äôs a chalk board on the front of each to let you know which is yours. Very welcoming and cozy cabins. The bath was ginormous with the kitchenette very accommodating for us, and the most amazing part: The ALPACAS! There was a jar of alpaca treats to feed them and they love that. Very friendly and derpy animal friends. If you need a getaway or have something to celebrate, GO HERE!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Karen was an excellent host and her place on the farm is just as great! We were traveling from Mount Rushmore so we unfortunately didn‚Äôt get to the Airbnb until late that night but we had no trouble getting into the Airbnb and Karen was very understanding the next morning of our situation. Seeing the alpaca‚Äôs and feeding them in the morning was a fun experience to cap off our visit. We will definitely be returning to Karen‚Äôs place if we‚Äôre coming through SD.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Karen,
Thank you!! You are certainly and super host!! We look forward to returning! Thank you for making us feel so welcome and at home."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our one night stay in the Shalom cottage. It was very private and peaceful. Slept well in the comfy bed with plenty of cozy blankets. Fed the alpacas with food provided. Heavy rain overnight and we were cozy and dry.
Would stay there again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quaint little cottage for two. Rustic feel with all the comfort amenities.
The farm is a great get away for couples or families with little ones; however, the cottage would probably be too small if more than two of you. Plenty of other options on the farm to choose from for families with children.
A short drive from Brookings (SDSU) and Flandreau.
And of course, who doesn‚Äôt like llamas, er Alpacas."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay in the Shalom Cottage very much. It was a cute, cozy, comfy and quiet place to be. We had everything we needed. The bed was comfortable - we hadn't slept on a Murphy bed before! It's a beautiful farm and the alpacas are fun to see. Brookings and SDSU are close by if you have someone there to visit. Thanks and we'll be back soon!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Karen is a delightful host. Directions she provided led us straight to the cottage even at midnight we had no trouble. The cottage was cozy, homey, and functional. The property was beautiful. We stayed here while visiting SDSU and it was a great place to stay."

We will definitely come back and stay again."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A real farm!! One of the best hosts we have ever had. This place is a destination. An experience that will leave you looking to move out of the city ASAP. If you need larger accommodations then they have a larger unit on property also. We loved our stay!!

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I‚Äôve stayed all over, Cape Cod, New Orleans, Manhattan, Boston, London, Moscow, LA, etc. In all of my time traveling I have not stayed in a location better thought out, and with such decoration. The host has done a fantastic job, and is one of the nicest and most helpful hosts I have ever experienced. If you‚Äôre planning on traveling through South Dakota, or need a place to stay in the Brookings/Sioux falls area, this needs to be your first choice."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay that is close to Brookings, SD. We were visiting for a graduation and it was the perfect place to stay and you can feed the Alpacas if you want! Karen would immediately respond if any questions came up."

2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"5 stars for letting us give snacks to the alpacas and dogs and there are great snacks for people too. It's definitely a remote cottage, as advertised. We appreciated how easy it was to communicate with Karen, she was super welcoming and accommodating. Recommendations for fellow city-folks: bring boots you don't mind getting muddy, bring your own shampoo and conditioner, and don't come expecting a petting zoo or ""modern"" decor, this is legit cottagecore."

2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This little cottage with friendly dogs on property and also alpaca (they provide alpaca snacks if you have time and inclination) had a sweet Americana decor theme, and lots of friendly touches - candy, drinks, chips, lots of reading material etc. The host, Karen was really responsive and helpful. We had a plumbing issue with the shower during our stay and she was right on top of resopnding to it. If you need somewhere to stay in this area, this is quiet and lovely! Suggest mapping to Enoch Farm vs the address so you don't end up in a cornfield :-)"

Our was stay was only 2 nights, but it was private (which I love), yet I knew close enough to the house that we weren‚Äôt totally alone if we needed anything.
The animals were great. Nice dogs with treats available inside the cottage to give them üòâ I‚Äôve been thinking about adding an alpaca to my farm gang and these guys really made me want to go get a couple! Loved the name tags!!

The farm itself was quiet, and peaceful at night. The dogs were friendly and the alpacas.....well, they are alpacas. By that I mean, they are curious critters, but don't like to be touched. ü§£üòÇ
Check out all 3 spaces the hosts have to offer. They are unique in their own way.
Highly recommend this place as a place to stay, and we will definitely be back some time."

We were amazed by the stocked kitchen, the thoughtful decor, and the comfortable bed. Our room also had a large selection of books, dvds, and games. We easily could have spent several nights and will be back."

2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Enoch Farm is well maintained and the B and B houses are beautiful, clean, modern inside, with fascinating collections of art objects and odds and ends. Comfortable beds and everything we might need were there for us. All we needed were our own clothes and shoes."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Shalom Shack is cuter than the pictures. It was a wonderful place to relax and unwind.

Would definitely recommend and return."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Karen was wonderful and generous with her treats and her time. I arrived late at night and my place was unlocked with a sign outside welcoming me by name so I knew I was in the right place! She stocked my fridge and gave me little treats throughout my stay.

Highly highly recommend.
2019-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our stay at Enoch Farm! Fresh pastries and a stocked fridge awaited us. The space was comfortable and had everything we needed. The farm is quiet and beautiful--and who can resist visiting the alpacas out back?

2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Driving into the entrance to Karen's farm was our first clue that this was going to be an unusually delightful experience. It didn't disappoint in any way. There were wonderful discoveries in creative reuse of farm buildings, repurposed and decorated with so much imagination and artistry in a beautiful and peacefully quiet rural setting. There were several alpaca including an adorable 2 week old to watch. At night be sure to go outside and see the vast prairie sky full of intensely bright stars and the Milky Way. We enjoyed a dramatic lightning show. Karen is a most welcoming and generous host....we had a wonderful stay."

2018-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Karen's farm is a lovely, homey oasis in east Dakota farm country. After a long drive from out of state, the cozy Shalom Shack was exactly what we needed! It was clean, warm, and full of personality, with drinks and breakfast food already in the fridge (and treats for the farm critters to boot!). We enjoyed our visit with Karen as she showed us around the property, and she was so thoughtful to find toys and other helpful things for our 9-month-old son.

2018-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Enoch Farm is a treasure! We stayed in the Shalom Shack for one night‚Äîit was a last-minute snag on AirBnB, and I still can't believe my good fortune. Karen welcomed us warmly and even provided some fresh-baked scones for our enjoyment (yum!). We had all the creature comforts‚Äîlovely bed, well-equipped kitchenette, and even a TV for settling in to watch some Netflix. We had so much fun feeding the alpacas and chickens, and even took a short bike ride to watch the sunset.
Karen's spirit and hospitality made the stay so special. We loved hearing about the history of the property, plus all the faith and hard work that have gone into restoring it. I hope to come back for a longer stay as soon as I can manage it! Thanks, Karen!"
2018-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Karen is a fabulous host and Is generous with all the little details. We found a full candy bowl and a bowl of wrapped snacks. There were fresh eggs in the refrigerator and butter for frying them. Coffee and tea, cool drinks were there as well. It was fun to spend the night on a farm. We did experience some trouble finding the farm though. We arrived late in the day and our gps sent us the wrong way. Luckily there was cell service and we were able to call Karen and get directions from her. By the time we arrived, it was 11pm. Karen came out to greet us to make sure all was well. How very nice! Be aware that the distances are far and many roads are gravel."

2018-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Cozy and comfortable! Karen was a great host with an awesome farm place. We'll definitely stay again!
2018-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"My first AirBnB trip and Karen exceeded all my expectations. The room was tidy and stocked with friendly offerings from bottled water to homemade treats. When we worried over the heat of the day, she made sure the A/C was up and running long before we got there so the room was cool and pleasant. I would definitely stay and again and recommend to family visiting the area."

2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"We needed a place to hold a late Thanksgiving, with space enough to feed 12 people and have sufficient space for a walker or two. Hannah's home worked beautifully for us. And with the 4 bedrooms, 7 of us from out of town had a comfortable place to sleep. The kitchen had plenty of pots, pans, dishes, etc. Plenty of space was made for us in the refrigerator. The ambience on shore of the snow-covered lake was beautiful. And bonus - Hannah was one of the most responsive hosts I've encountered. A great place to stay."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was wonderful place and Hannah was great!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I cannot say enough good things about our stay. It was amazing. Hannah's place is lovely. It was wonderful waking up to the lake view every morning. We really enjoyed being out of town but still close (15 mins) if we needed something.
The house is so comfortable. During our 5 day stay we had any where from 3 to 9 people and we were never crowded. There are several outdoor spaces to enjoy, even a screened in patio for when the bugs are bad. The grandkids were in heaven with the trampoline and swingset.
The kitchen is fully stocked. Everything you need to cook is there including a couple of grills. We made all our meals at the house.
We have stayed in Airbnbs all over the world and this was our favorite. We are already trying to plan another trip to stay there.
We highly recommend Hannah's place and consider ourselves very lucky to have stayed there."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My family of four includes two teenagers, and we kept them busy here! Kayaking, paddle boarding, fishing off the paddle boat. We brought our bikes too. We used the trampoline & of course the tree swing into the lake! The deck is beautiful & sunsets are to die for. We really enjoyed the grill & cooking to enjoy every minute of our lake time. All the bedrooms are nice & clutter free. The house was very clean & the welcome book has everything documented well. On a rain day we all enjoyed catching up on tv on hulu, netflix, disney. This is a very nice lake home!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was so much fun! Will definitely try to return next year!
2022-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,Great location and access to the water. Our kids loved the rope swing and watching the sunsets every night.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was beautiful and a great place to gather. We had an amazing place to gather friends together that hadnt seen eachother in a couple years. Everyone had something to do and there was pleanty of room to gather together or spread out.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,I would recommend this house!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was a perfect get away for a large group! Both adults and kids loved it here.

The house is comfortable and a perfect haven by the lake. The host were so friendly and quick with communication.
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful house in a great location. the lake was amazing and all the outdoor space was perfect for our son's graduation weekend. We took full.advantahe of the paddle boat and kayaks on the lake and the yard games were so much fun. Hannah and Adam are great hosts. Their communication is top notch! I would definitely stay here again!
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,"Hannah was quick to respond, had great directions for everything. The house was accommodating and we had a great relaxing time at what we call ‚ÄúSpring Break for Old Ladies‚Äù! Thank you!"
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,Great place! 100% recommend! Beautiful and peaceful!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Stayed there in the winter and had a tremendous time. Very comfortable and views are great. Access to board games was a huge plus. If we had this great of a stay in the winter, I can‚Äôt imagine how much more fun it would be in the summer months. Great, responsive host."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent place to stay!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house is exactly as they explain & Hannah is very accommodating! Beautiful location!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very relaxing and beautiful. Just plain old cozy! You can‚Äôt go wrong with this place.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Hannah's house is perfect! Great location, great layout. Everything you need is there."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This lake house is amazing. Lake Campbell is a nice quiet lake with lots to do! We thoroughly enjoyed the tree swing. Kayaking is always fun. The deck & pergola with gas fire pit really topped it off. The decor is stunning! Really appreciated the usage of condiments too. Rented houses before where we even had to bring salt & pepper. We will be back!!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Hannah's home was perfect for our family gathering!! The kids had SO much fun on the rope swing, kayaks and swimming area. There was tons of space to eat meals together, play games and each family was able to have their own room. We absolutely 100% highly recommend!!!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Fun at the lake! We had a great stay here with the family! Got in the water everyday (the rope swing is so fun!), there are a few different golf courses nearby, Brookings is just a short drive away, and our daughter loved all the toys in the house. The lake is also super quiet which made it a relaxing vacation for us."
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"Hannah was a superb host! The lake house is beautiful, comfortable, and relaxing. My inlaws and I spent four amazing days there. My nephews spent hours playing in the lake, we played board games in the evening while watching the amazing sunsets from the back porch. Everything about our stay was wonderful! I highly recommend!!"
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"Had a lovely stay. Boys fished, girls laid around sunning themselves. Or playing in the lake. 20 mind from Brookings, SD. Now the kids, by kids I mean my nieces and nephews 16,17,18, and 20 respectively. Played card games with the adults. Had movie night every night and just got to enjoy spending time with them before my nieces leaves for college."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This amazing lake house is so homey that you don't want to leave. Even though we ended up with a rainy Saturday day, Hannah had plenty of bored games to keep us busy, plus big couches for afternoon naps. Hannah was easy to get a hold of for questions, and keep us in the loop with some repairs the house needed before our trip. The covered screened in porch was perfect for some drinks and games, while kids were sleeping inside. Plenty of room for our group of 8 adults and 3 kids. The front yard was amazing for yard games while the kids played on the play set. We had such a great time and look forward to a future trip."
2021-06-01,3,Stayed with kids,"This house has a really beautiful location! The lake is lovely, and we saw some stunning sunsets. It was a bit of a mixed bag in other areas. I‚Äôll start with all the good!
Pros: The house had nice spaces if you have a larger group. We had 5 adults from 3 families, so it was nice for everyone to have privacy.
The house itself was also immaculately clean. That was #1 on our list, and it delivered.
Lovely outdoor spaces: the deck off the living room had a dining space where you could enjoy the stunning views, there was a pergola with
a gas fire pit for evenings, and a screened in lower deck for when the bugs were bad.
Easy contactless check in with a keypad was great.
There were plenty of throw blankets everywhere, and extra pillows in closets. Those were really nice touches.
We loved the cute breakfast nook!
The rope swing provided hours of fun!!
Cons: The ice maker in the fridge was broken. For some this may not be a dealbreaker, but it was huge for us. It was close to 90 degrees all week, & we ended up just buying a $100 ice maker in Brookings. Being 15 minutes from town, it wasn‚Äôt feasible to just go buy ice every time we needed it. I intentionally looked at the photos before we left to ensure the fridge had an ice maker, so it was a bummer.
The advertised paddle boat did not work - only one side pedaled/steered. This was really disappointing, because it was one thing my parents would have been able to do on the water.
The central air kept parts of the basement freezing while the upstairs was really stuffy.
The downstairs bathroom was fairly unsafe - the faucet handle is broken so just spins, so whether you were getting hot or cold water was a gamble. Twice the handle came off in someone‚Äôs hand. We didn‚Äôt feel safe letting the 5 year old take a shower in that bathroom.
The shower curtain rod isn‚Äôt installed properly, so it fell and hit people in the head twice as well.
There was a random step between the basement and kitchen that several people hurt themselves on.
There was very little room in the fridge for our food, and I was surprised that so much of the owners food was in there. I understand they live there when they‚Äôre not renting it out; it just surprised me that the fridge wasn‚Äôt cleared out.
Having two family members with us who were an electrical engineer and contractor respectively, they felt a lot of things in the house weren‚Äôt up to code, so they saw things no one else probably would.
Overall, it was a decent stay, and most importantly, we got to spend a week together as a family! I think the owners got a lot of things right; for us, some of the things that were really important didn‚Äôt deliver, but for others, it wouldn‚Äôt matter at all!"
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,This house is great for bigger gatherings and has all of the coziness of being at your own home! The stay was great- we had everything we needed and had lots of fun with the outdoor amenities!
2021-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,Love Outdoor seating
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,This cabin is so adorable and comfortable! We enjoyed our stay so much and are already talking about coming back. Hannah is a very responsive host and made the stay very enjoyable.

2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family of 11, from ages 3 months to 76, enjoyed four days at Hannah's over the Thanksgiving holiday. It is beautifully decorated and very comfortable with lots of extras like books and games. It was a good fit for us with a 2 year old and a 3 year old and an outside dog. We hope to come back in the summer when we can enjoy the outdoors more.
P.S. There was lots of fridge and freezer space available, which we really needed for all the food we brought."
2020-11-01,5,Group trip,Hannah was great to work with and house was awesome
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I can't say enough good things about this space. We have twin toddlers and her home is completely baby proofed, and she has more than enough toys to keep them entertained both indoors and outdoors! If you don't have kids - there is plenty for adults. The view is amazing, and the space is so clean, warm and inviting. We will definitely be back!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hannah's home is beautiful and comfortable. It's like being in a safe, stylish, relaxing haven. We came here to spend a few days celebrating my husband's birthday and it was perfect. The kitchen has everything you need, from cooking tools/cookware to condiments to cutlery and plates. The living room has a great couch with a beautiful view of the lake. We had coffee each morning on the back deck and all we could hear were the sounds of nature. Hannah's home is located conveniently close to Brookings so getting into town to check out various antique stores and food options was very easy. The bed was very comfortable and waking up to the sun and the lake and the sound of birds was amazing. In additions the home has a lot of toys and safety features for children. No matter where you are in Hannah's home, you are comfortable and surrounded by beauty and thoughtful touches. We loved our stay and highly recommend staying in Hannah's home if you have the chance. Thank you so much!!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great home for a family right on the water!!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was just what we needed. The area was quiet, both street wise and boat traffic wise. It was perfect for us and our 3 yr old. We used the kayaks, paddle boat and the rope swing. Hannah was very generous in letting us use all the lake floats, toys, etc. and our daughter loved it all. The spot on the lake was great, about a half mile morning paddle every day to the beach where we played in the sand. We also used the grill and fire pit quite a bit. We were so glad to have everything included at the house so we didn't need to bring a thing in terms of cookware and entertainment."
2020-08-01,5,Group trip,"Great location, use of kayaks was awesome to kayak on the lake every morning. It wasn‚Äôt a busy lake at all. We loved sitting on the deck for every meal and if the bugs got bad we were able to sit in the screened in porch."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a beautiful home! The views are stunning inside and out. Plus, we absolutely loved the rope swing into the water and taking the kayaks out in the water before sunset. We will be back!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Awesome house and location.
Lake was so peaceful and just a short drive to town.
We made sure to get back from town around 6pm every night so we could spend a couple hours sitting outside and enjoying the great views and cool breeze.
Downstairs was a hit for the kids with their own area to hang out and play. The little one just loved playing with the kitchen set and toys!
Really wished we could have stayed longer.
Hope we can get back in the near future!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The lake house was just perfect for our getaway. Plenty of space decorated beautifully and so many things to do just at the house alone! Hannah does a great job making everything kid and family friendly, so you really do not need to pack much at all to entertain - it's all there! We would definitely come back again!!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is the best place to stay in South Dakota. Picture perfect lake front home with amazing amenities, especially for kids, and a fantastic host. You won't regret staying here. Highly recommend."

Hannah was super responsive, the house was beautifully decorated and very clean, in a perfect spot right by the lake, with lots to do for all ages. Can't wait to go back next year!"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hannah worked with us when our last minute wedding changes had to occur due to COVID-19. She was amazing to work with and very quick to respond to my millions of questions. We loved relaxing on the porch at night and sitting on the dock all day. There is so many different fun things to do that we didn't even get bored while it rained all of one day. If you are looking for a fun place to relax in the Brookings area, this is 100% it!"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Hannah was a wonderful host and easy to communicate with. She has a beautiful home with an amazing view of Lake Campbell and so many ammenities to keep kids big and small busy all day. If you have young children, this is the perfect place to stay since it's already child friendly. We also appreciated her suggestions on local restaurants to try, which took a lot of the guess work out of our evenings. It was such a peaceful way to take a break from our hectic lives and we hope to stay again in the future!"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a great place to stay. If you have little ones, like we did, it was PERFECT!!!! Plenty of fun things to keep the kids busy and happy, even on cold and rainy days. Also, the amenities to help keep the kids safe and comfortable were numerous. As far as the adults went, it was great for us. Along with our two kids under 4, we had a total of 5 adults and had plenty of space for sleeping and for hanging out and having dinners. The weather for our trip wasn't great, but we took full advantage of the home amenities such as Netflix, grill and games. It was just what we needed to relieve the stress of being quarantined for a couple months"
2020-03-01,5,Group trip,"Great location right on a nice little lake, perfect distance out of town, and very easy to get to. The place itself is really NICE. Plenty of room and very comfortable. Hannah was great to work with. Our stay was great Definitely will stay here again if it is available the next time I am in Brookings area."
2019-12-01,5,Group trip,"Hannah is an INCREDIBLE host! This is the third year in a row that we have utilized this home for a student retreat, and it‚Äôs become one of the highlights of their year. The space is beautifully decorated, and so cozy. There are ample bedrooms, and lots of ‚Äúhang out‚Äù room throughout the house.

2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely can‚Äôt recommend staying here enough. Far exceeded any and all expectations. We all couldn‚Äôt get over how cute the house was and how perfect it was for a little weekend vacation. Plus Hannah was an absolute gem !! Super responsive and very kind. We almost had to cancel due to flooding issues on roads around the house, and she was beyond understanding and willing to work with us. If you‚Äôre thinking about staying here .. do it !! :)"
2019-09-01,5,Group trip,"Hannah is an amazing host! Her home is beautiful, tastefully decorated, clean and convenient with a beautiful view! It was perfect for our family of 10 and for those family that visited from Brookings and Volga! We would definitely visit this home again in the future."

2019-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Gorgeous house with a decorating style straight out of Pinterest :) Hannah was quick to respond and very attentive to our questions and needs. Place is a bargain for the price. We had a large group with 8 adults and 6 kiddos and my sister's dog Colby, we didn't feel crowded at all. Kids enjoyed the lake, fishing, kayaking, swimming, and spending time on my brother's boat (Hannah let us tie the boat to their dock all week). Couldn't ask for a better view of the sun going down over the lake, sipping on a cold one :) 5 star review for sure. God bless."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great home on the lake. Awesome view from the deck in the evening.
2019-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautifully decorated home, so stylish and cute. Great place for families with little kids - baby gates are up, crib too - made it so easy. Fun outdoor seating areas - we ate most of our meals out on the deck, and roasted s‚Äômores over the fire pit from the pergola sitting area. And the rope swing is a blast. Highly recommend this place!"
2019-06-01,5,Group trip,We really enjoyed our stay at Hannah's place. We had wonderful weather and were able to enjoy the deck and pergola areas during much of our stay. The sunsets were amazing!!

Many great memories were made at your home and we appreciate your hospitality!

2018-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,An amazing home with the best view:)
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures do not do the home justice. This lovely home is so cozy and comfortable. Hannah is a very gracious host and the amenities were numerous. The weather was quite chilly, it even snowed while we were there, but none of that diminished the gorgeous views from the house. Hannah was very easy to work with and I would highly recommend this home."
2018-10-01,4,Group trip,Great place to stay and I'd stay there again.
2018-08-01,5,Group trip,"Hannah responds quickly and has the house ready for your needs. Our group loved the house, the lake, and the location. It was perfect for us for a long weekend! The house is charming and has a ton of room for guests and hanging out comfortably."

2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Hannah and Adam's home is lovely! Everything from the bedrooms to main living space to the large deck and outdoor space, everything was clean and well-maintained. For a family of nine adults, two kids (one on the way!), and four doggos, this place couldn't have been better. It was especially great for the kids, as everything is child-safe.
If you're looking for a crystal-clear lake, you won't get that here. However, the water was warm because it's a shallow lake, it wasn't overly crowded (even on a sunny Saturday), and Hannah and Adam have fun amenities for the lake (kayaks, floating rafts, ROPE SWING!).
We would LOVE to stay again and again."
2018-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Hannah's house is the perfect vacation home. The home is newly remodelled and looks like something straight from Fixer Upper on HGTV. So lovely! There is a lot of room inside, which is super child friendly and comfortable. The seating areas outdoors are perfect for taking in the beautiful lake views. We loved having the kayaks to explore the lake. And the house is a prefect distance from Brookings if you want to go to town for dinner or a movie or some other reason.
Hannah was extremely good at communicating and did everything she could to make sure our stay was enjoyable.
I highly recommend staying here. It is absolutely great for a lake vacation."
2018-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Hannah was proactive, super responsive and friendly! The house was the perfect place to accommodate my family, my sister's family, and our parents for the weekend. Great place for kids (and would also definitely recommend Brooking's Children's Museum!)!"

2018-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Hannah's home is beautiful and comfy! We loved staying there. Her home convinced my parents and sister that Air B&B is the way to travel!
2018-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This place is amazing! Super stylish and well done, peaceful serene location, couldnt have asked for more. One left and a few miles down the road and youre in old town Brookings. Hannah is super sweet and responsive, you will not regret booking."
2018-04-01,5,Group trip,We had a great girls weekend. The place was adorable and cozy. We loved that all of us could sit around and chat and not worry about neighbors like we would have at a hotel. Thanks for being excellent hosts (even when Mother Nature sent us snow in April!)
2017-12-01,5,Group trip,"Great house for a gathering! Wonderful family room-kitchen-dining area. Great if you have a little one! No need to bring jumper, sleeper, etc. So cute and trendy! Would love to come back in the summer months :)"

2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean home. Accurate site description. Hannah was very responsive and easy to communicate with and she has decorated her home beautifully. We had a wonderful experience. It fit our needs perfectly. We celebrated our mother's 85th birthday by bringing family members together from Alaska, Canada and Nebraska. It felt like home without any of us having the burden of hosting the mini reunion at our houses. Many happy memories were created in our short stay, even though the weather didn't cooperate."
2017-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Expectations were high coming in, and they were exceeded! Fantastic weekend in a fantastic home in a fantastic location. Our family cannot wait to come back."
2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Lake Campbell home exceeded our expectations in all aspects of our stay. The home is tastefully remodeled with a combination of rustic, nautical and modern themes that create a warm and inviting space. We enjoyed being just a few steps from the lake, the large second story deck, amazing lake views from the living room, the fire pit, 4 wonderful kayaks, great functional kitchen and a big surprise for kids and adults alike....the rope swing. The location is right on a paved road with lots of privacy. The home is baby and toddler friendly with toys, crib, and everything needed to care for the youngest members of your family. Hannah was very responsive to all of your questions and was the perfect hostess."
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was wonderful. The home was cozy, comfortable, and decorated beautifully. We enjoyed lounging on the sectional in the morning, playing in the spacious yard or in the water during the day, and enjoying the beautiful view on the deck. We enjoyed kayaking, fishing from the dock, and spent several hours on the rope swing. I would highly recommend this home to anyone looking for a quiet getaway near a city that provides all the essentials you need at reasonable prices."
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Hannah is such a nice and gracious hostess. Any and all questions we had-- she answered right away. The house is AMAZING. It is so rare that pictures and advertisements truly represent the properties you are shopping for but in this case-- the pictures exceeded our expectations and more than accurately represented the property. The house is beautifully decorated and so comfortable-- couch is so comfy and the kitchen is perfect for cooking. The beds are amazingly comfortable and the whole house is extremely clean. The view is incredible-- beautiful lake and quiet and peaceful. I can't say enough about how much we enjoyed our stay and we will definitely return! Thank you Hannah!

The beds were comfortable and the living room/kitchen area was spacious. It was clean and well stocked with dishes, pans,etc. We will definitely be coming back!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second year here and is perfect for our family. We had 12 people and most the time you dont even know where everyone is at, as it is so roomy and private. With 3 levels and 4 living rooms. The adults and kids love this place! Spacious, gorgeous home with lots of games. We can put our boat and jet skis in and out right in the backyard next to the sandy beach area. With 2 docks on site and a bridge just down the road, much fun was had catching several fish. Also in walking distance is a bar and C store. And if the weather will not cooperate, you can bring the bean bag tournament into the garage, as there is more than enough space to entertain in there also. It was perfect!"
2023-05-01,4,Group trip,Great location for family reunion especially for wide range of generations.
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Our stay at Jeff's Lake Campbell house was Awesome! Very peaceful location on the lake. Lots of things to do at the house and very well kept. Clean and comfortable, almost didn't want to leave.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were in town for our son‚Äôs wedding on 12/30/22. A beautiful winter wonderland! Timed perfectly between winter storms. This house was very cozy and perfect for our family of 8; 6 adults and 2 children. There was more than enough room for everyone to have their own space & privacy. Actually bigger than what we needed. We played family games late into the night, with much laughter‚Ä¶best of all‚Ä¶without the risk of waking the littlesü•∞
The big dining room table, was a plus, we had just enough chairs (10) to invite the bride and groom over for brunch the next dayü•∞
The large garage was another bonus! Especially during the winter & for this special occasion.
We were so happy that we chose an Airbnb over a hotel room. We would have needed at least 3 hotel rooms and would not have been able to cook meals together, relax and create so many fun family memories!
Jeff was very responsive & answered any questions we had very quickly. We didn‚Äôt run into any problems with the house.
Thank you!"

2021-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,A comfortable home for a large family!!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Charming little apartment. Loved the extra touches‚Ä¶ games, tv on when you arrived & very clean. My only one small complaint was you could hear conversation in the morning from downstairs‚Ä¶. But if you are a semi-early riser (grandson wanted to sleep til 10üôÇ) it‚Äôs great!!!!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved our stay! The historic nature of the building was great, very clean and comfy beds! There was even a welcome card and snack waiting for us!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our one night stay here with our family of five. My daughters loved the built-in bunkbeds‚Ä¶ They seemed to be regular length, but more narrow than a normal bed in case that helps you plan! They said they were very comfortable and they felt very safe in them! The queen beds were comfortable with fluffy cozy linens, and the place has a lot of character and charm! We got donuts from the bakery for breakfast, which were yummy‚Ä¶ I recommend the Bavarian cream bismark. We felt very comfortable there and got a great nights sleep! Thank you!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Could not recommend staying at Carleens place more! Such a lovely apartment in a charming setting..

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We came up from Missouri to celebrate a graduation, and the Loft was a perfect place for our family. We walked around town, visited the riverside and the park, and bought groceries from the store right around the corner.
Carleen was a great host, and made our stay very enjoyable.
Flandreau is a quiet, peaceful little town, with a beautiful river, and lots of interesting culture. We really enjoyed meeting and talking to different folks as hung out in town.
We were only and hour from De Smet, so we went over and visited the Laura Ingalls Wilder homstead site from the Little House on the Prairie book series while we were there."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Carleen's loft is super stylish, exceptionally clean, and it's even larger and airier than it appears in the photos! Carleen was a fabulous host, always responsive, friendly, warm & welcoming, and full of great recommendations for nearby places to eat & drink (if you go, I'd echo Carleen's dinner recommendation of El Rinconsito, just a short block away - it was delicious!). There are a surprising number of restaurants, cafes, bars, and even a boutique taproom & live performance event space all right downtown Flandreau and within a stone's throw of the loft. I'd absolutely stay here again the next time I'm passing through the area!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Second time staying here. Very nice, quiet apartment. Very comfortable bed. Carlene is a great host and is very responsive. Highly recommend."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My children and I went to the area to enjoy the sights. Went to pipestone national monument and state parks near by to go hiking. The Airbnb was cozy and clean. I really enjoyed going to the establishment they have downstairs. Enjoyed live music and drinks. The environment was very friendly even though it‚Äôs a ‚Äú bar‚Äù it was very family friendly. Everyone was sitting around playing games and had their children and danced. It rounded out my trip to go and relax and listen to music and have drinks and play games. I would recommend staying at this Airbnb.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Carleen‚Äôs place was lovely. Really well decorated and had such interesting local pieces all around the place. The beds were comfortable and there were plenty of cozy blankets around in case you wanted more layers. My kids loved the bunk bed set up!

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was perfect for what we needed - quiet little town with an easy to get to place. An adorable old building with clean updates in a cozy space. Kids loved the bunk beds and the bedding was great - my mom even said she liked it and she is hard to please! Carleen was really helpful and responsive. I'd recommend it to anyone needing a place in the area. If you are cooking and need special appliances, check with Carleen before heading out. The kitchen cooking area is small so it only has the basics, which was just fine for us. The open layout makes it feel very spacious. The bedrooms are not huge but there's plenty of room to move."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,By far the best price to quality ratio of any Airbnb I‚Äôve ever stayed at. Travel a lot for work and this has been my favorite spot. Safe location with plenty of parking. Bars/restaurants/grocery store all within walking distance. The inside of the home was clean and looked great. Some of the comfiest beds I‚Äôve ever slept on in a rental. Fantastic water pressure with plenty of hot water in an old-time tub. Great spot. And best of all great price.

We would stop again if passing through this area."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A fantastic experience! We needed somewhere close to Pipestone, MN that could accommodate 4 adults for a week. This AirBnB turned out to be available and it was more economical and enjoyable than the hotels. Plus we could walk most places -- grocery store, drug store, bakery with coffee, mexican restaurant, bar with live music. A very short drive took us to a burger and ice cream stand next to a park that overlooks the river. Carleen was helpful and messaged us from time to time to make sure that everything was okay. We would definitely stay here again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed staying here! Very comfortable and within walking distance to restaurants and shops. Carleen was very helpful and so friendly. We would definitely stay here again!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Carleen‚Äôs place was even more spacious than we expected!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautifully remodeled in the heart of the old downtown. Minimalist style with nods to the history of the building and the Lakota peoples. Comfortable beds and good air conditioning - nice for the summer.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the second stay for us and we would definitely stay again! Just bring your bag!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The loft is spacious and clean, and Carleen is an awesome host! The bed and towels were so soft and inviting. It was a calm and cozy place to stay.
Make sure to get a donut at the bakery and hang out at Sioux River Spirits. This is small town life at its best!"
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,Thank you for the excellent communication.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Always so comfortable and inviting! It‚Äôs our go to place to stay now!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a delightful stay! The property was clean and well tended too. We loved all the books and enjoyed a bakery breakfast at the beautiful table. It was a great place for us to rest on our travels west.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed the stay! Communication was great and check in was easy! It was clean and cozy! There was also little cafe across the street that had really good food! We would definitely stay again!
2022-06-01,2,Stayed over a week,"Carleen is a nice host and she's a quick reply. Stayed for 6 months, it's not a good long-term stay property."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great hospitality! Very comfortable apartment. A good restaurant across the street and a good bakery right next door. Carleen is a great host with lots of very nice touches on the apartment. Highly recommend
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,very nice place to stay

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very quiet and cute in the heart of downtown Flandreau. The beds were quite comfy. It has all the amenities needed for a weekend stay.
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Cool, fun loft with great western and native American style. Extremely clean with lots of fun touches. The built-in bunk beds were adorable and would be great fun for little ones. Really nice selection of local books and games if you wanted to just hang out but also close driving distance to Pipestone National Monument and Devil's Gulch state park for outings. Beds were most comfortable I have experienced at an Airbnb. Historic building so a few rough edges around baseboards, tub, and kitchen ceiling but just part of the atmosphere of an older place. My only reason for rating this place 4/5 instead of 5/5 stars was the broken oven knob. Big reason I stay at Airbnb rentals is to be able to cook and have good meals with family and friends in a private setting. We couldn't cook half of the food we had planned without the oven. Carleen did state that she had a new knob ordered so hopefully not a problem going forward. I would definitely stay here again."
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Quiet rooms above a store. Bakery next door.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Flandreau is a charming town and Bend in the River makes a quiet and accommodating base camp from which all your area travels can begin and end! Carleen‚Äôs Superhost status is well deserved. Her space is clean enough for our grand babies to crawl around and had everything we needed to feel comfortable and welcome.
2021-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, quiet place. The beds were incredibly comfortable, which is a deal breaker for me. Clean, well appointed. Enjoyed the stay. Would like the sofa to be a little more forgiving, but all the lush pillows gave the cush and support I like. Many thanks!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is such a cozy place, super clean and Carleen is awesome!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I am from Flandreau, all my family is there. With our families growing its easier and more convenient for my family to stay here. It's clean, spacious, and we all get our own beds. We love that it's next to our favorite Bakery and a block from my dad's! Always a pleasant stay!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, impeccably clean. Very quiet at night for a good sleep. A lot of useful information from the hostess.
Overall, no complains. Highly recommended."

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Do not hesitate to stay at Carleen's apartment. It is spacious and comfortable and far more interesting and attractive than one can see through photos. Carleen has an wonderful sense of style and design, combining vintage with American Indian and contemporary pieces. She has thought of everything you might need for a lovely weekend in the Flandreau area. We primarily spent our time in Pipestone and Luverne, but enjoyed visiting the bakery next door and the shop below, as well as El Riconsito down the street. We hope to stay here again some day."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space exceeds expectations. It was beautiful and relaxing and a lot of amenities. The owner communicates regularly to ensure satisfaction. There are a lot of great places in the town, but it's also close to other locations. I would recommend this place to anyone."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place! Very spacious. It was easy to find and easy to get in. The beds were comfortable. Carleen had tons of extra supplies on hand in case we forgot anything and even left us some treats. Very kind. There was a TV with Roku available as well as games, puzzles, and a guitar. Several cafes nearby and noticed a few bars as well. Great respite on our road trip. I was sorry to be there so short - got in late and left soon after having coffee in the late morning. Zero complaints, strongly recommend! My boyfriend‚Äôs input for the review - ‚Äútell them I really enjoyed the beer and guitar, thank you‚Äù"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Loved the location and the hosts! Carleen was quick to respond to questions and the loft was exactly what we needed. Small town with great people!
The Bakery downstairs was a daily stop, nummy. The Cafe accross the street is a gem!
Don't forget the 25 steps though when considering this space.
We loved it and will definitely ask for it again!"

2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a lovely stay! The host is exceptional and the space is cozy. We enjoyed a couple local spots and appreciated the relatively short distance to Brookings - would definitely stay again!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I would live in this spot it‚Äôs so cozy. It‚Äôs above a shop in their downtown which was neat and it‚Äôs not too far from Sioux Falls downtown. 2 queen beds and 2 twin bunk beds so there was enough sleep room. If I have to travel around the area again, I‚Äôll be on the hunt for this air bnb."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely lovely! Carleen was great to work with and it was a nice stay on our way to Yellowstone
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This please is awesome! The home is comfortable, well decorated and carleen is the best host! Above an adorable shop in a quiet quaint town! Definitely glad we stayed here."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a little gem of a place -off the beaten path and a perfect respite from a long day of driving! Carleen was very communicative and even left us a couple of local craft beers in the refrigerator! The place was spotless and very relaxing. The decor tastefully done and we were so happy to walk in and hear a little music playing to welcome us!! I would recommend this place to everyone!üòä
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,A great place for us to stay while visiting family in Dell Rapids.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Carleen‚Äôs place was very clean, classy and comfortable. We only stayed one night passing through town but I loved being right downtown next to a cafe, bakery and a cute little shop. Carleen communicated all the necessary details. We enjoyed our brief stay!"
2021-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Very unique place. The kids love the bunks in the wall (asking us to build some at home). Limited kitchen space, so got a dinner out. Loved that we could close off the doors to contain our little. Thanks for the nice stay!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carleen's place if very comfortable and could easily accommodate 4-6 people but the bathroom is on the small side. Flandreau is a friendly, welcoming community and there's lots of hidden gems including restaurants, coffee shops and ice cream!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful spacious loft .gray value , great location and wonderful local shops"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super comfortable place that feels like home
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We arrived to Carleen‚Äôs place in the afternoon and the space was exactly as pictured. The space had plenty of room for our family of four and even though the kitchen is small, it was plenty big for us to do our cooking. Carleen was an awesome host and it was nice chit chatting with her about the town. We would stay here again if going through the area."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We were visiting Pipestone National Monument in Minnesota and relatives in South Dakota. This location in Flandreau SD turned out to be perfect for us. It is a spacious two-bedroom apartment over a store on the main street with a bakery and cafe and small park right nearby. The stairs up to the apartment and the charming but uneven claw foot tub might be a problem for some with mobility issues. But it was very comfortable for our family.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay . Clean and comfortable. Air conditioner worked great ! Carleen was a very attentive and knowledgeable host .
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a perfect and lovely place. It was beautifully curated and allowed my family of 7 to spread out and relax.

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking into hiking Blue Mound , Pipestone , Devils Gulch and Pallisade this is a great central location. We traveled 4 hours to stay here and I would do it again in a second. The space was so clean and cozy and had everything we needed. Their was only two of us but the space is large enough for 5 adults and 2 kids on the bunks. We had a steak at Mad Mary's in town and it was delicious. We had such a lovely time."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,I was looking for a more affordable place for my family of 5 to spend the night. This place fit the bill. I had no problems finding it and we all slept well
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a nice, quaint, clean space, with plenty of room to spread out. Perfect place to stay for a getaway without the hustle and bustle of a hotel. Carleen is a gracious host, and readily prepared to attend any needs of her guests. When you pull up to the building, you'll notice the pride of ownership and the attention to detail."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved my stay at Carleen‚Äôs place. The loft is beautiful, clean and comfortable."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"I can‚Äôt say enough good things about Carleen and her place. From the warm welcome to the exhaustive list of recommendations for our travels across the state, she went above and beyond to ensure an exceptional stopover. I hope to return some day!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice, quiet, and relaxing!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment was very clean, quiet, and comfortable! And so cute, in a restored older building. It felt like a true get-away."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The minute I walked through the front door and up the steps into the apartment, I knew I was going to thoroughly enjoy my stay. A wonderful smell wafted through the air, relaxing music was playing and the place was open and airy and simply but wonderfully decorated. I slept soundly each night I was there. Carleen is a 10 star host!! Don't pass up the opportunity to spend some time here!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable and quiet spacious and clean highly recommend
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,A great place to stay. Affordable and comfortable - all the right things to make the visit great.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,If you have the chance to stay here you should grab it! This is an absolutely perfect loft. ‚ù§Ô∏è
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Bend in the River Retreat is an absolutely quaint and peaceful experience. My best friend and I stayed for a quiet girlfriend's getaway. We loved all the little touches - exquisitely soft sheets, decor chosen to reflect the land and the people of the region, products with a purpose (bathroom hand soap that supports women who are getting out of difficult life circumstances), and just enough kitchen supplies to dine in. The stay was exceptionally quiet (which is what we needed) and the stay was a refreshing respite. We walked the Main Streets and tried out a few of the local businesses and took a day trip to shop downtown Brookings. Carleen was an excellent communicator and was so sweet and kind. Everything was exactly as she described and we appreciated the ease of everything. This will most likely become an annual trip for us!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The loft is absolutely adorable with a bathtub for relaxing and two big soft beds. Everything was very clean when we arrived and Carleen was nothing but great both over the phone and in person, going above and beyond to make us feel at home in Flandreau with the locals. There isn‚Äôt that much storage space in the kitchen, so we would recommend bringing a tote or two if you plan on cooking a lot. The location is great with a grocery store, laundromat, and gas station all within a short walk/drive away. The owners of the shop below are very sweet as well. Overall we are so glad we found this place!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is full of thoughtful touches. She has the best fuzzy blankets. The decor is nice and welcoming. Communication was great. My only disappointment is that I didn't make time for a bubble bath in the awesome claw foot tub. I would definitely stay here again.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Well worth it.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!

2020-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,simply beautiful
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The asthetics of the apartment were stylish and cozy. Lots of light and room. Perfect for a pandemic get away. I was nervous to be in SD, but the majority of people wore masks while out and about. We enjoyed secluded gems such as Pipestone National monument and Palisades State Park."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,beautiful and amazing
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful loft in a historic building. Really fun place to stay.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a neat place! Super comfortable and clean. Small-town hospitality at a lovely and interesting place. Close enough to walk to restaurants and a grocery store, plenty of safe parking right at the building. If I could give an award for Best Bath Towels this place would be the winner. Bonus: Carleen responded quickly to my inquiries and was a perfect AirBnB host. I would definitely return here if in the area."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Very cute little place! Lots of great local restaurants.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is gem of a spot in a desolate area. They have appointed the space well, with a great aesthetic and design sense. Carleen's communication was helpful throughout. If you're a light sleeper you may be startled by the rumble of the furnace that is a presence in the space...but it does keep the space warm."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We LOVED staying here! We tend to take trips out of season & out of the way. We prefer a quiet place, with unique experiences away from crowds. This place delivered. We loved the quaint loft apartment, great parks nearby & family-owned restaurants (with online ordering & quick take-out!) If you‚Äôre looking for a little getaway this fall or winter, we highly recommend Bend in the River!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"In a time of pandemic uncertainty and restlessness; what we found at The Bend In The River flat so lovingly appointed ; was a comfortable and peaceful retreat with all comforts of home. Try to find anything you have forgotten not tucked into a drawer at carleens.
The merchants in town were equally welcoming and accommodating.
Hoping to be back soon.

2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"A charming, relaxing space with great communication and hospitality!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This AirBNB is literally PERFECTION! It is so cozy, clean and has everything you need for a weekend away. Carleen is a gracious host who is quick to communicate. It is a beautiful home and surpassed our expectations greatly! 10/10 would recommend!!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our second stay there in a month. We really enjoy our own space when traveling to town to visit my family, who all live in Flandreau."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay, such an adorable place!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Located in a quintessential small town, thus BnB offers the perfect escape for a quiet get away weekend. Very large rooms, well appointed. Very comfortable setting. The town has some nice restaurants for breakfast, dinner, takeout. Grocery store around the corner. Hosts communicate well, offer suggestions and are very responsive. I would highly recommend."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved our trip to Flandreau! Our host provided plenty of different destinations in about a one hour radius. It was the perfect location to explore south East SD and south west MN. We loved the minimal and trendy design and this Airbnb is a true retreat. Everything is designed for rest and leisure. We had a big table for games and eating. A bakery right next door. We can‚Äôt wait to visit again!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fun, hip"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We make trips to Flandreau two to three times a year and usually stay with family. I have looked at this place multiple times and given the circumstances for coming back this time, my husband and I decided to stay there. We loved it so much, we booked it for our next trip in September. It worked perfect for our 7, 5, and 2 year old and the bunk beds were a favorite. Carleen was quick to respond and the place was very clean, with an antique but modern feel!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Chic, cozy, and clean in a small but charming town!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,This place is an antique gem with a modern flare. Super comfortable and very unique. Carleen is a great host. Loved her place and would love to stay again when we are back in the area.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little find! Comfortable beds, charming atmosphere and small town."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow, if I could give more than 5 stars, I would. Carleen was incredibly communicative and I could feel she truly wanted us to enjoy our stay. The apartment was a slice of heaven in, in my opinion, a sort of Hollywood movie set town. I loved the bars and the bakery located just 2 seconds from the apartment. Do yourself a favor and book this place‚Äîyou‚Äôll love the small town feel against the contrast of Carleen‚Äôs modern apartment."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I LOVE THE HOST CARLEEN! The best host I‚Äôve ever encountered! She gave us a lot of helpful tips before our arrival and all questions are promptly replied! One tip you will definitely have to listen to her is about the cops in town! We got a $95 speeding ticket for 5mph over 20mph limit. It was midnight and we were just ONE block away from the property trying to locate it! If you have a out of state license plate! Better drive very slowly!
Enough with the bad experience.
Carleens place is a gem. It‚Äôs very clean, quiet and comfortable. There‚Äôs a guitar on the wall for guest. We arrived to town around 9pm, and almost all restaurants are closed. She was so kind and asked if we need her to bring any food to us! Checked in with us time to time to make sure that we got there alright. And even after we left, she was trying to help us find a place to stay near Yellowstone park. I just love this girl!! Treats guests like friends!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great little spot!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Cool upper loft apartment. Perfect for us. We will be back!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is such a comfortable place! Carleen is an amazing host and offered great support and thoughtful treats. Our family of 6 enjoyed the space and actually wished we could have stayed longer.:)
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"So blessed to have found this place...loved the town of Flandreau and its history and the space was AMAZING .... my boys loved the bunk beds and played many card/board games in the loft living space .... we were able to cook and eat around the spacious table...even had fresh herbs growing in the kitchen ....loved its clean authenticity (great wood floors and exposed brick) and Flandreau was such a peaceful, friendly town...the bakery next door did not disappoint and Carleen‚Äôs suggestions were precisely what we needed. We enjoyed the pipestone monument and walk to the waterfall and had an epic night at our very first Flandreau rodeo ! Honestly, I wish we could have stayed longer and visited all the unique towns nearby. Carleen was super helpful and responsive to all my messages and was super cool when we accidentally took the remotes ! This was a truly memorable stay on our 3 week road trip cross country!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful open apartment with lots of natural light! Felt at home in Carleen's place.
2020-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"A two bedroom, upper floor apartment with sunshine and charm. Carleen has a real eye for decorating - the place is just lovely! Clean, all amenities needed were provided, great view, lovely small town, friendly folks all around. I would recommend Carleen's without hesitation."
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent! Couldn‚Äôt have asked for more.
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I stayed at the Bend in the River as a home-base for a weekend in nearby Brookings. The first thing we noticed about the space was how much room there is! It truly has so much space to stretch out. The view overlooking the Flandreau streets below really provide an urban feel in a quiet rural setting. One thing we particularly appreciated was the list of suggestions that Carleen, our host, left for us. It gave us a comprehensive look at the nearby restaurants and attractions to check out. We really liked the donuts from the Flandreau Bakery right next door! With all the space, the quiet setting, and the proximity to nearby Brookings or Sioux Falls, I would definitely recommend this space for pretty much any couple, family, small group, etc."
2018-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,Enoch farms is a very relaxing and delightful place to stay. The owner's poured years of hard work and creativity into creating a very special bed and breakfast and venue location with real charm and character. The owners are very down to earth and accommodating.
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay in the shalom shack was more than expected. Awesome clean and complete with everything and more you‚Äôll need for your stay. Greats hosts and beautiful BNB.
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very romantic little house on the Ranch, far away from the main roads and traffic. The cabin is lovely decorated with an eye for detail. The bed is very soft and comfortable, the area so quiet, we really slept well.
Karen is a very friendly and welcoming host, she showed us around their beautiful Ranch which has more guesthouses. The cabin was very well equiped, suitable to cook a simple meal.
We visited the Pipestone memorial, very nice with museum and small shop. After that we went to Garretson to see Devil‚Äôs Gulch, the Jesse James legend, wonderful.
We had a great time, would visit again. And Keebah the dog is lovely!"
2018-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I strongly recommend any place of Karen‚Äôs! She is thoughtful and considerate, a great communicator too! I hope to stay with her one of these days and sincerely recommend her as a very professional and kind host."

We loved it."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I celebrated our 38th anniversary at Emmett and Ann‚Äôs place and had an amazing time. The home was super clean and very comfortable.

Tom & Roby"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Emmett's lake cabin was everything we could have wished for. It was very, very clean and also furnished with everything we needed. The setting was beautiful and peaceful. In all respects, staying at Emmett's place was a terrific experience."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful, relaxing and serene week. The setting is beautiful. The lake is fairly small so it is quiet. I enjoyed watching the sunlight dance on the lake and the leaves changing. It rained one day. I watched the storm clouds and enjoyed the fireplace. The cabin is immaculate and well-stocked. Softest sheets ever! Bed was very comfortable. When it looked like there might be a storm with hail, Anne offered me a place to park my car in the garage. Emmet and Anne are amazingly generous hosts. This was my second stay with them and my husband and I will be back!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home. Emmett and Ann were very nice and communicated as needed. We had a great time. Would stay again!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a beautiful lake home. The owners were very friendly and responded to anything we needed in a timely manner. I will definitely recommend this to others.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home lots of space and I was very comfortable. Definitely plan on coming back
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ann and Emmet were extremely amazing hosts. We will be back for another stay.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely accommodation and setting. The cabin is clean, comfortable, and supplied with all necessities and very nice amenities. The setting is rural, peaceful, and easy to navigate. The hosts are very responsive, flexible, and friendly. We had a very relaxing and enjoyable stay-it felt like a true retreat."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Emmett and Ann are kind and generous hosts! Also very accommodating and helpful with recommendations. Their residence is beautiful, clean and well stocked with any household items needed. It was hard to leave when the time came! I highly recommend a stay here for anyone visiting the area."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an excellent experience! The cabin was immaculate and well-appointed. Everything you could possibly need was there. The decor was welcoming and perfect for a lakeside cottage. We were greeted by a special surprise because Emmett and Anna knew we were celebrating our anniversary. The setting was serene and peaceful. The lake was lovely, small and quiet. We would return in a heartbeat."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Emmett and his wife were amazing. they greeted us when we arrived and gave us a walk through and made sure we knew about lights,fans, ac and tv. They provided a grill and a hair dryer which should be added to their amenities. The place was beautiful! They were super kind to the kids....even though they can be rowdy. Emmett saw that one of thd kid's bike chains came off and put it on without being asked. They provided firewood and helped us get it started on one of our nights. They showed us a calmer part of the lake when the winds picked up at their place so we could continue to fish and the kids could swim. They made a list of area events going on for the kids because it got chilly for the kids in the water. The experience was true midwest hospitality balanced with privacy and peacefulness."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place and view. Had everything you needed. When I had questions the owner was there to help. Beds were too firm for my preference but worked out well for the others. The couch was super comfortable though!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great one story, easy access home for my elderly mother to enjoy. We were only around in the evenings but the living space was very comfortable with multiple seating options. The landscaping was beautiful and we enjoyed sitting on the swivel chairs on the dock one night. The wifi worked great. The beds were comfortable and the shower had good water pressure. The AC did not work but there were multiple ceiling fans and a standing fan to help cool the area. If staying in the summer, I‚Äôd be sure to check the AC is repaired. There were complimentary snacks, which we enjoyed and Keurig coffee pods as well. Emmett was very responsive and friendly."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"You will never meet such kind and helpful hosts! I had 2 - 12 year old boys with me and they kept busy with fishing++
Emmett gave us kayaks to use as well as setting up a fire pit area. There was an ourdoor smaller grill ...perfect for what we needed. They even took the 3 of us out on their pontoon. üåûThey both went over and above was any host would have to do ( I even have some fresh aspargus to take home). An absolute must stay vacation. I will definitely returning!!
Thank you both!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Quiet and relaxed nice place to get away.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I jokingly told Emmett that I didn‚Äôt want to give the great review it deserved, cuz I wanted to keep our find a secret. We enjoyed everything about the place. This was a Spring stay for 4 adults."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Incredibly clean. Well supplied with many essentials. Well furnished, Very comfortable for family time. Our only gripe was the mattresses were extra firm, too firm for our standards. Everything else was wonderful. Beautiful space and well layed out."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Emmett and Ann were great hosts, very accommodating and helpful during our stay. The space was clean and well equipped. We would definitely stay here again."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,Emmett an Anne were wonderful hosts! They worked well with our unique situation with flexible dates for my out of state job. We have already discussed bringing the family out for another trip in the future for a relaxing vacation! Cabin was spacious and very well supplied and more than the description could have portrayed. Worth the price for a home away from home!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location on the lakefront. Very welcoming hosts. Clean and comfortable - mattress is very firm in the primary bedroom. Definitely recommend.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a homey ‚Äúup north‚Äù feel! Stayed in the ‚ÄòLoon Room.‚Äô Amazing owners with all the touches of home and the lake view is spectacular.

The toy kitchen was an absolute hit for our little kids. We didn't get to use the deck or backyard as it rained most of the weekend but it looked very relaxing. nice bonus to be able to use the garage if needed.

It was exactly what we planned for. A quiet weekend together, watching movies and laughing. The beds were very comfortable, all appliances worked, dishes were all spotless, not a speck of dust anywhere. The house itself was really cute and did feel like a home for us away from home. The neighborhood was quiet, which made for great nights of sleeping, nice location for being in town but not around the college. Molly was really quick with instructions and any questions I had for her. In the future we will be booking with Molly again for visits."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very peaceful and pleasant stay at Molly‚Äôs comfortable home. We felt lucky to find it on short notice, as our relative passed away the day before and we needed a refuge to plan the funeral. We loved the neighborhood and easy access to everything in Brookings. The kitchen was a delight, the beds were comfortable, and everything was spacious and clean. Our two small cousins came over and played happily with the toys and the play kitchen."

The garage was a nice plus, as was the giant, streaming-equipped TV. We would have no doubts about returning again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Overall a great place to stay. Our two kids loved the toy kitchen set and having a backyard to run around in. We enjoyed having the space vs a hotel.

With about everything you need. Some added things like toys for our kids were unexpected and great to have after a long car trip. We had a couple of issues while there but for the most part I found her very responsive. Some bathroom cleaning issues however -which she was made aware of and I believe she will rectify for the future‚Ä¶ unfortunately her cleaners did not do a good job and she was out of town so it fell on us.

There are also 2 bathrooms, one upstairs and one in the basement. Kaira was super accommodating and flexible in allowing us to check out later than anticipated due to tournament games, which we were super thankful for considering we had our dog with us.

Definitely plan to stay here again!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,We had a really good experience here. Kaira is good at communicating and wants guests to have a nice stay. It looks like the house might be lived in part of the time as there are a few personal odds and ins around. There are three bedrooms (one does not have a door on it) and the basement space downstairs helps the space feel bigger. Great location - 15 minute walk to downtown and a block from Hillcrest Park. Recommend!

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Willow Run is a great place to stay. There‚Äôs not much to do within the town itself, but that has nothing to do with the residence. Hosts were very kind and gracious. We had a lot of snow days and the hosts made sure to clear the drive and walkways of snow. Was very excited to receive a gift basket that included stuff for our little one. Very thoughtful hosts."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Our friend group used this place as a meeting point for a reunion weekend as it was centrally located for all of us. The property was nice and well kept. The house was clean and updated nicely. We really enjoyed the area as it was peaceful and relaxing. The lake being across the street for us wasn't an issue since the road was actually very quiet during our trip. We had a great time relaxing on the deck and playing games in the yard. The public beach and bar/grill being walking distance was also a huge plus for us. The hosts were very friendly and extremely responsive to messages. I appreciated their openess and honesty with the post and cummication. There were no surprises. What they advertised is what we got. We would definitely stay again.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Karen's ""barn"" was perfect. I put barn in quotes because it did not have a barn feel. There was such a cozy feeling that enveloped us upon our arrival. Karen was responsive and went out of her way to meet us. I would stay here again and again. The decor is reminiscent of a high end antique shop. As I told Karen, it's glorious."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We were looking for a quiet spot to finish out our vacation, and Karen‚Äôs beautiful barn was just right for us. It is so comfortable and beautifully decorated, with all sorts of fun antiques, color and textures.

2024-05-01,4,Group trip,"It was a great place to enjoy family time. It was out in the country, peaceful and close to Brookings. We came for SDSU graduation and invited some family.

2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,I was very glad to find Karen‚Äôs place on short notice. It was warm and comfortable. The alpacas were a fun addition. The space itself was very unique. Kind of like sleeping in an antique store. Karen was accomodating and extremely responsive.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at the barn this time was somewhat unplanned for as we had a death in the family. Karen was very prompt in working with us to accomodate a very short notice and help us with our needs. We are so grateful for a special place to stay during our time of loss.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Step back in time with this little gem! Unfortunately we stayed a quick overnight and didn‚Äôt get to enjoy all this barn has to offer but it‚Äôs a great place with lots to do and see.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Karen and her family are the most inviting people you‚Äôll meet! Whether you want to strike up a convo with them or be more private, they‚Äôll honor your wants and needs to a T. You can‚Äôt find a more intriguing, comforting place to lay your head - staying at Karen‚Äôs is bound to be a story within itself. She is a gracious host and provides a very homey atmosphere the entirety of your stay. I‚Äôd recommend staying here to anyone!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Barn Airbnb! We had a quick overnight stay on a business trip & would loved to have stayed longer as it was a very peaceful stay. Beautiful setting in the country but close enough to town, if needed. The Airbnb was very spacious with plenty of amenities and seating areas. Also, we loved the decorations in the house! The alpacas in the backyard were an extra added bonus :) We will definately stay again, if in the area!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,This is our groups 4th time at Karen's farm. It's a perfect peaceful location we all look forward to every year now.

My only regret is that we could not stay longer. 10/10."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was exactly as described and more than I was looking for! Karen was great to communicate with and even took time to come out to talk with us when we wanted to know more about the history of her place and the alpacas. We were blessed to be able to stay and be able to explore the beauty of South Dakota!

Room to hang out and room to have your own private time. Fire pit outside of the barn, fireplace inside the Shalom Cottage. The alpacas were adorable! The accommodations were very clean. Every kitchen accessory you could want was provided. I had a favorite mug that was there that reads,‚ÄùI need a day between Saturday and Sunday‚Äô‚Äù. So true when you stay here. I can‚Äôt rave enough about the location, accommodations, and alpacas! Karen is a super-DUPER host! Thanks and many blessings to Karen and the Enoch farm.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I love this place and keep coming back. Thank you Karen! See you again soon!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Karen's place was well equipped with lots of interesting items throughout the space. The alpacas were an extra bonus!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had such a great time! The place was very cozy - we enjoyed lounging around the comfy couches and chairs visiting. Karen was very friendly and helpful in the overall process. We found the beds to be comfortable and slept great. Our puppy enjoyed exploring the house and when it was time to leave, we had a hard time coaxing him out! We recommend this place to anyone looking for a fun place to stay when in the area."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,So happy to stay at Karen‚Äôs place again! Everything is perfect! She goes out of her way to communicate and make sure you have all you need. I will definitely keep staying here every time I am in the Elkton/Brookings area.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I‚Äôm happy to be a returning customer. This home away from home is comfortable, peaceful, and quiet! Karen is a wonderful host with very responsive communication. I can‚Äôt wait to be here again in a couple months!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The place was amazing, no shortage of things to see! Also nice and cozy"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,A unique and cozy space with so many unique items to discover. Perfect for family gatherings and appreciated the kids toys for the children as well.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The ""Barn"" at Enoch Farm is like a home away from home. The accomodations are so comfortable and it is very easy to communicate with the hostess Karen. Her property and accomodations are very clean and comfortable! When I want a beautiful place to stay...a home away from home, I'm going back to Enoch Farm! Thank you Karen for the special place to stay!"
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,we love staying here when all 8 of us girls get together. Karenis always great at communicating and making sure we have everything we need. see you next year!!

2022-10-01,5,Group trip,Enoch Farms is the perfect place to stay no matter the occasion. Karen is an amazing host and takes great pride in her farm. We will definitely stay at Enoch Farms again!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and I came out from MA for my job and it fit perfectly with what we needed and for the duration of our trip. Karen's property was gorgeous and she made us feel very welcomed and at home! I would totally come back to the Farm!
2022-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,Unique and memorable! We loved the peace of the farm with easy access to Brookings. Karen is a wonderful host!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Remote, quiet, and uniquely special converted Airbnb barn. A must see if you ever travel through this area. Extremely friendly and kind host. The homemade breakfast option was so convenient and above other Airbnb offerings."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Enoch Farm and our host Karen are absolutely the very best. The ristine property, the accomodations and communications are always superb. Karen works hard to be sure your stay is the very best! We continue to return to Enoch Farm because it is an amazing place to stay! Thank you Karen!"
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful place to stay! So fun!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay! Karen was quick to respond to questions and had the AC going for us when we arrived. The indoor space worked well for our family of 6. We especially enjoyed the outdoor space with basketball court and room to play catch. The kiddos made multiple visits to greet the alpacas! All in all, a great weekend!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very unique place to stay. Convenient and host is onsite for any questions or issues. The place was clean and it provided us what we needed while we were there.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the location people and housing
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing Airbnb to stay at! I stay at a lot of airbnb's for work and I can honestly say this is one of the best. A lot of people leave vague reviews to be nice, but you will instantly feel comfortable here and will want for nothing for a nice stay."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a hidden gem of a place! Beautiful and peaceful country setting with all the comforts of home. There are even some cute alpacas to provide entertaining viewing outdoors! Karen is amazing hostess, and you won't regret ordering the homemade breakfast burritos and pastries that she thoughtfully leaves in the fridge for you! I highly recommend the Barn at Enoch Farm!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Karen is the sweetest and you‚Äôll love your visit!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our 2nd time at the farm and our 1st time staying in the barn. It is a wonderful space with lots of decorations to take in, books and magazines to flip thru. The kitchen is fully stocked with things you need to cook for a family.
The farm is wonderful as well. A peaceful place to relax and forget about life for a few nights.
We will definitely be back."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay close the Brookings. The ""barn"" slept our entire family with room for more. There was a fire pit with firewood provided which we spent the chilly evening enjoying. Plenty of amenities, lots of fridge space, and a smart tv helped keep the kids distracted."
2021-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Would stay here again
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The farm stay with alpacas and the living space were respite for me and my parents. The kitchen had everything we needed for cooking every meal for 2 nights. There is plenty of space in The Barn! Be prepared for staying in an antique store of sorts. There are a lot of items with price tags ready to be sold. Although some might like this style including my mother, the extra ""stuff"" may not be for everyone. Karen and dog, Keeba, were welcoming which we appreciated. I did not appreciate the Trump sign in the front yard. As long as you know it's there when booking, you won't be caught off guard. For that reason and the antique store feel, I give this place 4 stars instead of 5."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent host and very clean. spacious accommodations. A few too many nick-nacks for the taste of a male hunting party maybe, but then again, reminds us of our favorite aunt's home.
Great location for our needs and quietly secluded. We will be back next year."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Karen's place. There was plenty of room for lounging together but also room to get away for privacy. The fully stocked kitchen allowed us to prepare our own meals and even though we didn'tget a chance to use it, there was a fire pit available outside. This place had tons of personality and Karen was a very responsive host. We had a great stay!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a very restful and soul filling peaceful night -- our dogs settled in nicely and we were charmed by the alpacas! Karen is a wonderful host!
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"Nicely kept, beautiful location, all the accommodations, highly recommended!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a cute barn space with a lot of room for guests! It was just me and my dog and had a huge space. Karen was very accommodating and for a small fee had a delicious breakfast ready for heating up. The Alpacas are a fun bunch, too!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Karen‚Äôs place is amazing!!! The decor is so fun to see and enjoy. So appreciate the great communication and extra special touches to help you feel welcome. It is also very peaceful and we enjoyed a great nights sleep. Can‚Äôt wait to go back!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great stay! Great place!
2021-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"An amazing pocket of green trees within the farm fields. The unit is a wonder of antique-type decor (picnic baskets, post cards, toys, even a piano and guitar). Lots of books for all ages with historical and Christian themes. It‚Äôs evident there is an artist in residence - even the bathroom cabinet was decorated with Psalms bible quotes. Many bedrooms where the beds were covered in what appeared to be hand-sewn quilts. Lots of space!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Karen's place is 10/10 awesome! A great country get-a-way with some very cool Alpacas to check out. Highly recommend!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is a true labor of love. The farm was so relaxing and Karen is a very kind person. We enjoyed our 4 night stay in the farm and hope to be back.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Karen's updated barn is spacious, and well-furnished for a relaxing stay. I would describe it as a cross between an Americana museum, antique store (many of the historic items are labeled for sale), and comfortable home-away-from-home. We cooked, and found the kitchen well-supplied, but also, Karen had delicious gluten-free muffins in the fridge for breakfast (a minimal additional charge). Karen was there when we arrived and responded immediately when we reached out. It was a lovely stay!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This converted barn is such a cool and unique place to stay! It perfectly broke up our road trip with its location, and Karen was incredibly accommodating and provides everything you could need. Our GPS took us to a cornfield, but Karen anticipated that and sent us helpful directions! If you stay here, take some time to look around at all the special things they‚Äôve collected and put on display in the barn. Of course, the best part of all was feeding and hanging out with the alpacas!! Would absolutely stay again."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect little getaway with food, beverages, grocery store and local museum a mile away. Karen is a fantastic host! I already miss the alpacas and Keeba!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This barn is amazing - probably the coolest and most interesting place you‚Äôll ever stay in. It‚Äôs furnished with all kinds of interesting antiques. It‚Äôs very comfortable and comes with a ton of amenities. There are a bunch of alpacas on the property which are fun to see. Lots of room for your dog to run around too. I highly recommend this barn!!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great, relaxing atmosphere. Karen was wonderful and she provided good communication and hospitality. We enjoyed a fantastic all-around experience. Definitely recommend!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow, what an amazing space! I read the reviews but was still blown away when I walked in. My toddler had so much fun playing with the toys and looking around. Just a warning, if you have a little one like me, there is a lot of interesting things to look at and touch so youd have to really keep an eye on them the whole time! For the adults though, there were so many cool things to look at and gifts to buy. The beds were very comfortable. Karens blueberry cake and breakfast burritos were amazing. The kitchen was stocked with drinks and snacks. Karen thought of everything. Can't wait to go back!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Karen was a great host and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at her unique home. The breakfast burrritos and caramel rolls were an added bonus! I would visit again.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really unique experience! Incredibly creative decor and layout- very comfortable for a small family. Quiet and out of the way. Karen made us feel welcome with snacks and breakfast offerings- this was really helpful since it‚Äôs out in the country, plus it was a holiday. Would definitely stay here again."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying here and the property is beautiful! Our 4 year old loved all the toys in the barn, the sandbox, feeding the alpacas and playing with the dogs and we did too! Karen was so friendly. Would definitely stay again."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a peaceful, beautiful stay. Karen added so many lovely touches---cinnamon rolls, breakfast burritos, scented candles and music greeted us. The barn is decorated so beautifully and the beds are really comfortable. The alpacas were adorable! Highly recommend Enoch Farm for your stay!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"A quiet stay, comfortable beds and I'm pretty sure Karen thought of everything to make this place an enjoyable stay. We enjoyed our stay and a bonus that breakfast burritos were included. Our daughter was excited to play piano even though we arrived late...she found new music to play. A beautiful property and it was clear that a lot of love went into it."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a slice of heaven. What a treat to stay at Karen‚Äôs place it was warm and inviting and so much fun to walk around see the alpacas and look at the beautiful farm. The furnishings and all of the little things around the house and the attention to detail were much appreciated. It is a wonderful place to stay and close enough to South Dakota State University if you‚Äôre visiting your student this should be on your list of accommodations. Our only regret is we couldn‚Äôt have stayed a little bit longer the breakfast burritos and coffee cake were wonderful. Thanks for the memories!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a beautiful property. Mature trees and landscape nestle the farmstead in a veil of peace and quiet in the middle of miles of farmland in every direction. Grounds were immaculate. I stayed in the barn which was exceptionally clean, spacious, and very homey with all kinds of interesting nooks/areas to explore. Fans of American Pickers will appreciate the decor. Karen does a wonderful job of making you feel welcome; lots of extra touches to make your stay that much more enjoyable. I wouldn‚Äôt even bother looking anywhere else if I come through this area again."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Not that far off the beaten path, however you feel like you are a world away! Converted barn was a wonderful place to stay, and very dog -friendly. Karen greeted me upon arrival and then delivered warm cinnamon rolls after I settled in. Her homemade breakfast burritos were also a treat. Loved all the antiques and cool stuff throughout - lots of room to spread out. I had work to do for part of this trip and WIFI was excellent. Highly recommend!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"wonderful country housing. Karen, the host,.was amazing and went above and beyond"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Enoch Farm is a great place to stay and conveniently located to amenities. Clean, comfortable, friendly hosts, super quiet and relaxing. Karen provided cinnamon rolls, breakfast burritos and little snacks for us...very thoughtful!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved the stay in Elkton. Unique and cozy.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay and the alpaca's were a really fun experience! Karen is very kind and accomodating!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at the Barn and were absolutely blown away!! The Barn is huge and is so beautifully and uniquely decorated! Lots of handmade crafts for sale as well, including postcards, coffee mugs, books, magnets, etc. We especially enjoyed all the places to lounge around and the TV room area, as well as the cute coffee bar with a hand-crank bean grinder! Karen was a wonderful host, left notes in the home to help our stay go smoothly as well as homemade cinnamon rolls and delicious breakfast burritos! Extremely peaceful and quiet, we honestly cannot wait to go back!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You will everything you need to accomodate your stay. A very welcoming atmosphere and wonderful hosts.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Sweet & comfortable place! Very open floor plan which was appreciated after traveling in a car for a while. 2 bedrooms but lots of little nooks & places to relax. Toys for kids, lots of books & magazines to read & playing the piano was fun. Cinnamon rolls were there for our arrival & breakfast burritos were in fridge for the next day. Coffee, snacks & drinks were also available. Really interesting decor - vintage & handmade items. Many of these items were priced so you could shop while you were staying there. Nothing too expensive, just cool/kitschy items that will be fun to decorate with. Very clean too!!"
2021-02-01,5,Group trip,Very nice. Worked out well for our family get together.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Second stay at Karen's. Awesome host. Great place to stay.
2020-11-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay during our hunting trip. Karen was very accommodating and the place was welcoming. Many fun memories were made. We would gladly stay again.
2020-11-01,5,Group trip,This was the perfect place for our family hunting trip! The place was very spacious and fit our group of 10 very comfortably. Karen was such a great host and made sure we had everything we needed. The complimentary breakfast was definitely a bonus we weren‚Äôt expecting too! Delicious homemade cinnamon rolls and breakfast burritos. If we ever make our way back to Elkton we will definitely be booking with her again!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved having my baby shower at Enoch farm! Highly recommend!!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a wonderful place to stay! Truly an amazing retreat. It felt like staying in a combination of an antique shop and my aunt's farmhouse- what could be better? How about alpacas?! My son woke up the first morning there- stepped out to visit the animals and ran back in and cheered ""WE GET TO DO FARM CHORES!"" Everything was amazing- from the cozy nights under a quilt, with the bright stars outside to waking up to homemade cinnamon rolls and morning walks with alpacas and dogs. We will definitely be back!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a great time!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Enoch Farm is wonderful. Karen has somehow managed to make the big barn space feel cozy. You are always within arms reach of a blanket or coffee cup, and there is plenty to do if you feel active instead. Alpacas are more than cute and the country road is great for a bike ride or walk."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Karen's property has become our go-to place when we're travelling through South Dakota. The spaces are full of charm and life, the farm setting is beautiful, and Karen goes above and beyond in so many ways -- from the handwritten signs welcoming us to our lodging, to the treats and handmade goodies she brings, to the binders and magazines full of local tips. She even interrupted her farm chores to bring an alpaca over to our 2-year-old so he could get a closer look! The farm is a special place. Don't miss it if you're in the area!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So many positive things have been said; there is little else to add. One more plus that I would add is that the short amount of gravel road leading to Enoch Farm was very smooth and isn't a concern for low-clearance cars. I would like to dispel some of the claims made in Kate's review, from July 2020: Kate wrote, ""so much potpourri."" During our stay there was no noticeable potpourri, just a clean, nice atmosphere. In Karen's description of the barn she invites her future guests to, ""enjoy our vintage eclectic style"" and that is exactly what you can expect. I found Kate's descriptions of ""knick-knacks piled up"" and ""just piles of stuff to move out of the way"" to be highly inaccurate. Lastly, there are not, ""religious verses painted on every surface."" There are some verses and other quotes incorporated into the decor. The barn offers plenty of open space interiorly and exteriorly. Karen has bettered the interior space with her creative finesse since the posted pictures were taken; it is cooler than you can imagine."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Eclectic place in the middle of farms, beautiful, green and spacious. Fully stocked kitchen, bottled water provided and firewood for a bonfire outside. The alpacas are cute and friendly- Karen was very welcoming and lovely to chat with. The double beds can be a little tight for two grown humans. Other than that, lovely stay!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed our stay at the barn - this is a very fun and unique place to stay and Karen and her husband are so nice - we got to meet their Llamas while they gave our car an unplanned jump start before we could head out - gave us a bit more time to get to know them.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Enoch Farm is the perfect spot for a quiet weekend getaway. It's far enough in the country that it's quiet and peaceful, but close enough that you can drive into Brookings for food or anything else. We appreciated the comforts of home, such as fresh baked goods and enjoyed that we could relax on the farm with the company of a couple of friendly dogs, some alpacas, and some beautiful grassy, shaded areas."
2020-07-01,3,Stayed one night,"Odd place, like sleeping in an antiques store. Religious verses painted on every surface, knick-knacks piled up, doilies, so much potpourri. Huge Trump flag out front. Comfy bed, big kitchen, but just piles of stuff to move out of the way. Friendly welcome, pretty farm, sweet llamas."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"There are no words i am aware of that do Enoch Farms justice. I wasn't prepared for how beautiful the setting was, combined with the perfect details in the bungalow. I was only there for one night, but i will be planning a second visit! Thank you Karen for such a warm welcome and even warmer setting. God Bless you and your family. (The alpacas were adorable!)"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a tranquil spot. Come and relax. Karen will take great care of you.
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the barn! So much to see and do! I really enjoyed my stay. Can‚Äôt wait to work in the area again so I can stay again!
2019-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was like staying at a general store, lots of things to do and look at."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Awesome host.
2019-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"First time staying at an Air BB. Awesome experience! Spotless house. Great host. Very accommodating, welcoming and great communication both before and during our stay. This was the perfect place to stay for a hunting trip."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Karen is a great host, she decorated the house for our family Christmas!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a wonderful space for a girls weekend in Elkton.
2019-10-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful place
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I love this place more every time I stay here! Karen is great and there are so many great touches that it makes us always feel comfortable and right at home. It's a perfect distance to SDSU!
2019-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice night. Meeting the alpacas was fun.
2019-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful place with so many things to look at in the building. We really enjoyed the stay. The bed was great.
2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at the barn with our large family plus 2 additional guests.
We noticed our personalized welcome sign right away upon our arrival, and Karen was there to greet us and get us settled in. Very friendly and personable lady. The barn is comfortable and outfitted with everything you need. Plenty of places to sleep for several people. Even breakfast options were provided. There were toys and books for the kiddos, and they enjoyed feeding the alpacas and Keeba, the dog.
I would definitely come back if we find ourselves in the area again. Thanks for making us feel right at home."
2019-08-01,5,Group trip,"Wonderful place to rent for a weekend! We did a Bridal Shower in the upstairs loft and it was beautiful! A little hot as there was no AC, but stunning!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to unwind and enjoy the family. Karen was very friendly and we plan to be back with more friends and family.
2019-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We just got back home from a trip to this beautiful parcel of land. When we booked this AirBnb, we didn't really know what to anticipate. Little did we know, we would be driving into a little slice of paradise. Let us just say -- we are so sorry, Karen, for being a few minutes behind checking out. We couldn't get up this morning because hands down -- that was the most comfortable bed we have slept in. We couldn't get up this morning because we didn't want the experience to end the night prior. It seemed that every time we blinked, we discovered something new in the barn. The space was brimming with eclectic individualism, history, and positivity. Relaxation came easy and the highlight of the trip was revisiting the night sky. We have forgotten what it's like to be in simple quietude.
Thank you so much for letting us in your home! We will remember it always!
Jen+Chris"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Enoch farm was a beautiful place to stay. The kids loved the alpacas and the dogs. It is off the road so we were not concerned about them just exploring outside. The barn was so neat and had so many places to sleep and all the supplies needed. Would definitely would
visit again."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Karen was such an amazing host. Her special touches were so thoughtful. Her place is a unique and amazing place to stay and recommend it to anyone traveling there. As kids put it- Totally Awesome!
2019-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Had such a great time at Enoch farm! Karen was very attentive and thoughtful. She was very accommodating for my family which included my 13 month old. It was fun to feed the alpacas and explore the farm a bit. Everything was comfortable and inviting. I would highly suggest staying here if you are in the area.
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fun space with lots of decor, some of it for sale. We had a lovely stay."
2019-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,What a fun place to stay! So many special touches to make the visit even more special. My kids loved loved the animals. So comfortable and relaxing. Loved it!
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, very unique! Really enjoyed staying in the barn."
2019-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Charming, spacious and private! We had a wonderful time last weekend and had enough room that we could have doubled the size of our party! The decor is perfect for the space, and Karen was always quick to respond. Thank you!"
2019-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was great. Would book again if in the area. Rooms we super nice and comfortable. Didn‚Äôt get a chance to feed alpacas.. maybe next time. Quick drive to Brookings that‚Äôs where our event was.
2019-03-01,5,Group trip,"Karen's place is a gem. it was freezing outside, but the hospitality was warm and friendly. We were looking for a place to stay for our destination. Little did we know we found a new destination to visit again!"
2019-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,A great space with a warm fun inviting atmosphere and surprise treats and snacks around every corner.
2019-02-01,5,Group trip,Amazing place! 10/5 stars!
2019-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Love Karen‚Äôs place, this was our second time staying there while visiting my daughter at college. Love that they added a big fridge. It was very cozy and warm during the cold weekend!"
2019-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I would say the photos do this place justice but it is even better than the photos. It had a very warm and inviting feel. So many personal touches and notes the communication was great we knew what to expect. And who wouldn‚Äôt want to stay on an Alpaca farm. There were even fresh cinnamon rolls and bacon and eggs in the fridge to make our stay more comfortable. I would suggest anyone who is thinking about staying here to do it you will not be sorry you did. I stayed one night for a funeral and if time would had allowed, I would have stayed longer. It was a homey comfortable place to stay while we were in town."
2018-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Relaxing space that has everything you need. Friendly owners!
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay. It is relaxed, inviting and wonderful touches of home. Highly recommended. My whole family loved our stay."
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enoch farms is a beautiful place to stay. Karen is quick to respond and the very welcoming. I would totally recommend this for anyone staying in the SD or SW Minnesota areas.
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Karen is an amazing host! So many nice touches, even a welcome sign with our name on it!! We stayed in the barn and it was so lovely and such an amazing space to spend quality time with family!"
2018-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,What a great unique place to stay. It has a very country feel to it. It is quite and peaceful out in the country. It might not be the most beautiful construction on AirBNB but it is a very comfortable space. There is lots of room for everyone to spread out. When we arrived we found the place was stocked with some snacks and drinking water. Check in was easy and Karen was very responsive. The only caveat I would leave is that sound travels very well inside the barn so I would suggest turning on the furnace fan to help provide some white noise. It was a perfect stay for our family of 5.
2018-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable.
2018-08-01,5,Stayed one night,The barn was perfect for a gathering of leaders from my church. We had a luxurious and comfortable space to do some strategic planning for the upcoming school year. It was perfect!
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Heaven on earth - don‚Äôt think twice, book it! Great host, beautiful property, interesting design, and artful touches. I wish it was closer to home for regular weekend trips with the family."
2018-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,A fun farm country time. Getting away from the city lights to enjoy the stars & roam free in the wide open spaces!
2018-08-01,5,Group trip,INCREDIBLE!!! Way beyond our expectations. Karen was very accommodating and helpful for suggesting places to see. Best Airbnb experience yet.
2018-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our family had a great time visiting the barn at Enoch Farm! The grounds were beautiful and our kids got a taste of country freedom. :) Karen was a great host and we felt very comfortable during our stay.

2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay.
2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Karen was a wonderful host, not only to us but to our little girl and puppy. She was so warm and gracious and took us on a hay ride in the evening which our little one just loved!"
2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nelsons' farm is an incredible place to escape the busy mundane 9-5 life! We came with our 2 year old and she had a blast hanging out in the chicken coop and harvesting eggs (even though a few of them didn't make it, oops). Place was incredibly cozy. Felt like home.
The day of check-out Karen took my kid out for a ride in the trunk of a small tractor. It was super fun!
One small less convenient of things - mosquitos. It was a wet hot season and we didn't totally blanked out and forgot to bring a bug repellent. So if you are stopping by sometime in the middle of the summer, grab that, it will come in handy.
Other than that, stay was perfect!
Thank you for such a lovely stay, Karen & Family!"
2018-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Karen accommodated us even though we arrive later than expected and she was very kind. She even made homemade brownies and left my cat some special cat food! The place was sweetly decorated and perfect for our night in South Dakota as we passed through on a road trip.
2018-07-01,5,Group trip,Loved it!
2018-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We loved it, its a good place to bring the children ."
2018-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A diamond in the...corn fields. This place was awesome! We were really impressed at the size and comfort of our lodging (the Barn). Not just beds, but bedrooms and a kitchen and common space with books and games and DVDs. The snacks were awesome because we were a bit of a drive from restaurants. Our kids loved the grounds with all the animals. The dogs greeted us and are well trained and don't jump up. The kids fed the chickens and gathered eggs (which we ate for breakfast) and got to feed the alpacas too. Our host even took us on a golf cart/wagon ride all over the grounds. Above and beyond, we would definitely stay here again."
2018-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is amazing!
The hostess is fabulous. She invited my kids out to harvest fresh eggs and feed the alpaca. There were toys and books for the kids to enjoy.
For the grown ups she had so many extras I couldn't possibly list them all. Fresh eggs for breakfast, gluten free options, 3 kinds of beer, 4 kinds of coffee, too many options to count in the soap department, extra cots and linens and so much more. A piano, some bongos and a guitar were also available.
This place is fabulous. I can't wait to go back. My kids can't stop talking about it. Love it!"
2018-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was awesome! The kids loved feeding the alpacas and chickens. Very clean and uniquely decorated. Karen was great. Would refer to anyone who is looking for a laid-back weekend. Plenty of room and cold AC!

2018-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Enoch Farm! Karen and Steve are top-notch. Their hospitality is unmatched. We loved having all the room and the kitchenette since we have children with food allergies. The kids really enjoyed having toys and games available, and were excited about seeing the Alpacas and chickens. The unique decor was so fun! The kids would like to move in permanently. It was so nice to have a home-like atmosphere while traveling. It was so restful and refreshing. We will definitely stay again when we are in the area!"
2018-02-01,5,Group trip,Great space. Easily fit the entire team we brought up. Karen was incredibly nice and helped us throughout our booking. They made a fantastic breakfast for all 15 of us. The house was also very close to Brookings which was important to us.
2018-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed the cozy and spacious accommodations. Karen and her husband were very friendly and went out of there way to make our stay positive. We would definitely recommend this Inn! We would like to keep it a secret so it doesn't book up fast, but we know that wouldn't be a kind thing to do! We stayed at the Inn in the winter and can only imagine how beautiful everything is in the spring and summer! AWESOME INN!"
2017-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have only positive things to say about our stay! The barn was clean, and welcoming! More than enough space for 3 adults, and 3 dogs for an annual family pheasant hunting trip! The full kitchen allowed for us to prepare our own meals; plus, plenty of dining space, and a nice bar area! In addition to the facility, Karen and Steve are the most wonderful hosts. Karen was very responsive to questions/messages, and her hospitality was off the charts! She brought us farm fresh eggs and gourmet coffee :) We highly recommend staying here!"

They even invited us into their home (we rented an adjacent building) to watch Monday night football with them and made us popcorn!
Check in and check out were a breeze. Karen was a fabulous communicator, very prompt. Our lodging was exactly as described. We stayed for 3 nights during a hunting trip. The Barn was perfect accommodations for 3 men and a dog-we couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. I can't say enough great things about Karen and her husband. Don't hesitate to stay with them!!!"

When I needed to contact them with a question or two they responded almost immediately. Very clear responses, very very respectful. The house was clean and had a beautiful clean smell. There was 6 beds and room to sleep more if needed. The kitchen was fully stocked. Everything you could want or need was there. Just bring your food! They have fans in the closet if you need a fan.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The pros - This lake house was charming, and worked perfectly for our family visit. Four adults could comfortably stay here, several times we had four adults, two teenagers in the living room without feeling squeezed. Stacey was a great host, friendly and communicative. We cooked several meals and had what we needed, plenty of dishes and the dishwasher worked great. The main/master bedroom bed we found to be comfortable, but my two BILs stayed in the lower of the two other bedroom bunks and they said it wasn't very comfortable, but mileage may vary because comfort is subjective. The only con I would note is that the back main bedroom was much colder than the rest of the house. The portable CO had a thermometer that read much colder than the Nest which was outside the door, oddly. Stacey was responsive and offered a space heater, but we figured out the right setting. Another review called this a hunting cabin, this cabin is MUCH nicer than that description. We had a great stay."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Stacey‚Äôs place on the lake was all myself and our group could have asked for.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The peacefullness was amazing so where the sunsets and neighbors well worth staying a week . On a fishing note it was a few day before we found fish anyone coming to the lake to fish a sweet spot is left of the boat ramp on a gravel hump that comes up from 15 to seven feet . On staying at the cabin make sure you bring all groceries ya need mom and pop store is very nice and close but very pricey closet walmart is 30 min down I 29 .

The screened in porch was nice when it rained with cushioned chairs and a gas fire table. Everything we could have wanted for fun in the water was available including life jackets. We rented a water mat and paddle boat for an extra fee. The location is close to town if you forget supplies. We would love to go back again! Stacy was great with communication and was super friendly.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful place and well furnished for the family. Have plenty of games, indoor and outdoor basketball along with a kayak and paddleboat for fun activities.
