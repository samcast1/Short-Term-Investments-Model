2024-03-01,5,Group trip,.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The Mesa House is gorgeously arranged, clean in every corner, with modern interior design that also feels homely. Also, the entire house smells great! My family and I enjoyed our stay, there’s plenty to explore in Jefferson City (check out the local coffee shops, Yanis Coffee Zone in particular). Tara was extremely responsive to our needs during our stay, stepping in to help us with a small issue despite it being a holiday. We felt at home, which was greatly appreciated. The neighborhood is quiet, no noise, no drama, no frills. Perfectly residential while still being close to the attractions of Jefferson City. The kitchen was well equipped with everything we needed to make home cooked meals. Overall, it was everything we were hoping for. Great spot!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"All amenities are on point! She really did think of everything you might need. Location is just as described and very peaceful. While our weather wasn’t the greatest, we were still able to enjoy ourselves playing bags and such under the house and still have great views of the river. Beds were very comfortable and so was the living room furniture - great for lounging with a good book. We will definitely be back!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great space for family get together. Super clean and accommodating. Had everything needed and then some. Great host and great Airbnb.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great host. Peaceful location. Clean and well appointed. Enjoyed our stay!!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Audrey was very responsive and kind. Very nice communication. Home was very clean and well-equipped. Great!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spotless! Location was peaceful and seemed safe. Host was responsive. We enjoyed the spacious deck overlooking the river, and when the wind was too high, the indoor seating was comfortable. There were plenty of windows and natural light. The kitchen had ample space and was reasonably well stocked for an Airbnb. The beds were comfortable and I appreciated the open shelving and multiple wall hooks. The hot water pressure was good. We had looked forward to kayaking, but the currents were way too fast, and then the water level dropped significantly, so if kayaking is your thing, have an alternate plan. Rock Bridge Memorial Park was only a 35-40 minute drive and had a good variety of hikes. We also enjoyed watching and listening to the trains pass by. If noise disturbs you, pack earplugs. Overall, very pleasant stay."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at Audrey’s home. Everything was clean and organized and we had everything we needed. Audrey was easy to communicate with and very responsive. We will definitely stay again.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The view was amazing. The neighbors were all so nice and hung out for a bit around the fire. They had nothing but great things to say about the host.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very responsive host and home had everything you need
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay !! The kitchen was well stocked with coffee and creamers. Beautiful scenery. Comfortable beds. We enjoyed the deck. Having morning coffee while watching the Osage river is an awesome experience. We fished from the dock and got a few bites. We would love to return during the summer. The state capital and former Missouri State Penn are 15-20 minutes away and very fun to visit for history buffs. We highly recommend Audrey’s Osage river getaway.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We couldn't have been happier with our stay and can't wait to make a return visit. We spent 3 days fishing, artifact hunting, and relaxing by the fire overlooking the river in the evenings. I would 100% recommend Audrey and her beautiful Osage River home to anyone wanting to get away."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay very much! The Get-away cabin was very accommodating with everything needed for a lovely vacation. Being next to the river was very relaxing!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful home right on the water. This little cabin was perfect for my husband and I as well as our 2-year-old and our two pups. The home had everything we could possibly need and more! We have stayed in our share of Airbnb's and this home was more equipped than any other rental we've stayed at - kitchen had everything, bathroom had everything, toys for kids, kayaks outside ready to go with lifejackets.... You name it- they had it! The area is peaceful and the neighbors are kind. We'd recommend this place to anyone & everyone looking for a nice, relaxing vacation."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place just to go and relax and get away from it all.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You're just a few minutes away from Jefferson City, but it feels like your a million miles away. So peaceful, right on the river."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Was definitely an amazing experience, there was stuff for everybody to do games and books, corn hole game, kayaks, which we spent hours and hours on them, caught lots of fish. Did a bunch of swimming The water was perfect for that! Nice big sitting area with windows all around to see the river, every corner was extremely clean, also had a nice big deck right off the kitchen, where we ate all of our meals! It was definitely something I needed, was a great stress reliever, especially going out early in the mornings, and listening to all the wildlife and birds, waking up, and especially the trains going across the bridge, and the train whistles, echoing through the hills, not too close to be noisy and not too far away were you could hardly hear them just perfect! We all went as a family. nine of us slept in there, the boys just threw camping cots on the floor in the front room was plenty of room for that! Will we go back again? Absolutely! Just looking for another break in my schedule. ;)"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great house/amenities/extras. Super clean and equipped with everything we could need. Heather was very helpful with tips around town on a busy holiday weekend. Highly recommend and if we are back in Jeff city we will choose this spot again!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our 2nd stay at Heather’s place! We love it! So clean! Comfortable beds. Quiet neighborhood. She has thought of everything you could possibly need during your stay. She even left some water bottles in the fridge for us, knowing that we would be spending both days at the state track meet. Will definitely stay here again when I need a place in Jefferson City!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was the best Airbnb we have stayed at! We loved everything about the area and charm of the house. The beds and sheets were so comfortable.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We come to Jefferson city quite often to visit family for holidays, birthdays, etc. We've stayed in numerous places in town and this is our new favorite. Host provides a plethora of everyday things a family would need. All types of seasonings, foil and plastic wrap, extra batteries, crayons and coloring books for kids, etc etc etc. Host was extremely responsive and kind. They let us check out a bit late so we could go to Easter lunch after church with our family and it was greatly appreciated.
The decor here is on point. It feels very cozy and fun. Decorated better than our own house 😩 lol. We will always seek to stay here from now on when we come to town."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I don’t usually write lengthy reviews…but this one is long. To say that this AirBnB was one of the best experiences we have had is an understatement. Heathers house was adorable throughout. You would notice cute little touches throughout, which makes it feel like your home while you are there. The couches in the living room were comfortable, and there’s plenty of comfy blankets and pillows for vegging out. The kitchen has everything you need, easily located in the various cabinets. The washer and dryer came in super handy. But, the best thing? Little things like mints, wash clothes for makeup removal, a checker board end table, laundry detergent, fancy hand soaps 😊….choose this place….you won’t regret it."

We were here for the big freeze that came over most of the USA and outside temperatures did drop to negatives, but the house stayed warm and we were comfortable - the side walk and walk way were shoveled soon after the snow stopped - they took great care of us! Highly recommend this location for your stay in Jefferson City."

There were lots of “little things” available ( like brand name soaps, ziploc bags,qtips, make up wipes, paper plates, games, lots of spices, an iron etc) all were awesome to have there. Those little things in a nice home definitely made it feel like home! We really enjoyed the big dining room table and coffee room/back porch areas."

2021-10-01,5,Group trip,This was a wonderful little cottage to stay at. It's super clean and so organized and every little detail was thought out! I absolutely loved every minute of my stay. Heather was super fast at answering any questions I had. I will definitely come back whenever I go to Jefferson City.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute Cottage near everything! The home was fully equipped with everything we may have needed and more. Heather provides wonderful amenities like Bath and Body works hand soap and Dasani waters. She was great at communicating with us and provides instructions for everything, down to the shower, in the home. The cottage was just a few minutes drive from stores and restaurants, which was very useful for us since we weren’t too familiar with the area."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This home is beautiful! The place felt homey and comfortable but had many luxurious touches. Located in a quiet area but still close to everything. Heather was an amazing host with prompt replies and very accommodating with my odd schedule.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I would recommend this beautiful cottage. It was clean, cozy, & comfortable! Furnishing were wonderful. Thank you Heather."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved the place and location, probably the best AirBnb house we've stayed at. Close to the JC downtown area, parks, and the Katy Trail - we biked from the house to the trail twice while there. The kitchen was easy to work in and has all the utensils needed for regular meal prep. Will stay here again for future visits."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Heather had perfect communication from start to finish! It was the perfect sized cottage for 2 people and every little detail was thought out. I will definitely return if back in the area!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home, comfortable and clean. Location was perfect for Jeff City stay. Heather was great with communication."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We booked this location to be close to relatives as we had a family death. We stayed in this home for a week. It was by far the best! Cold water bottles in frig when we arrived. The home has new top load washer and dryer in basement. There were laundry pods, dryer sheets provided. They have details throughout the home and instructions for everything you need to use or borrow. The cabinets are labeled in the kitchen so you don’t have to keep searching. Baking and cooking supplies are all here. They have sugar, flour, oil, pan spray, quite an assortment of spices especially for grilling. Plenty of dishwasher pods and soap. Bath and Bodyworks kitchen soap and hand-soaps. Kitchen cleaners and dishtowels/dish scrubbers. Coffee bar with coffee pods and sugars. Plus handy instructions on how to use the coffee maker. Ziplocks, foil, wraps available for use. Trash bags and info regarding recycle and trash day. The photos are exactly what you get. The upstairs bedrooms have comfortable king beds. Clean bedding. A/C units in windows upstairs have remote control. Ironing board and new iron. Quiet neighborhood. Parking info as driveway is shared. The shower/tub is upstairs. Dove bodysoap and members mark shampoo available. Laundry chute is upstairs. Wifi and tv’s worked great. We made several meals during stay and everything worked great. Make your own ice as frig didn’t have ice maker. I brought my own tea pitcher. There are measuring cups and measuring spoons. Backyard had bunnies most evenings. I would recommend this location to anyone. The couch has foldout bed and bedding was easily located. Pack n play was in upstairs closet if needed. Table is tall top but there is small kiddie table and some kid activities.
Not alot of privacy in backyard or deck as its open to all neighbors in this neighborhood. We are used to privacy fences but it wasn’t an issue just different for us. The street is not a thru street so traffic was limited. Full set of plates, bowls, silverware, knives and everything need for grilling except the food.
Love this place❤️❤️❤️"

The central location cannot be beat. From High Street Coffee to Southbank Boutique, make sure to leave time to explore the beauty of High Street.
Mary went out of her way to accommodate our infant, providing toys for all ages and even a high chair and pack and play, which was so thoughtful and helpful.
One thing to be mindful of:
BEDROOMS: The third bedroom is a converted entryway off of the kitchen, with bunk beds and French glass doors. Recommend this room for kids, early risers, athletes and those possessing very minimal luggage.

We did find this house to be a little loud during sleeping hours. If you are a light sleeper take that into account- emergency vehicle sirens driving by and diesel trucks unloading at prairie farms.
I’d stay here again :)"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kim’s place was lovely. We really enjoyed the uniqueness of the house as well as all of the quirky decorations placed strategically around the living areas. Hosts had a book dedicated for guests to doodle in before leaving! Will definitely stay again soon!

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Great and easy stay!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim's place is the perfect 3 Bedroom if you want to stay near the heart of JC. Also the location lends to it being private which I liked. The house itself was really clean and well maintained. My only complaint is that it has a smell that I guess lends to the house being 100 years old. That is my only complaint. Other then that the Bedrooms were large and very nice and clean and everything there was kept up and done really well. I would definitely stay at this BnB again in the future if Kim will let me lol
-Nard"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was very busy with work while I was in town, and Kim's cozy and quirky home was perfect! The location was incredibly convenient.

2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Kims place was exactly as it lists. At first she was uncomfortable with our group because we had a little bit bigger group than allowed but she accommodated to all of our needs. Very nice and responsive.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Kim's Airbnb rental proved to be a delightful revelation. The décor had a charmingly eclectic flair, and the three roomy bedrooms were impeccably clean. The bathroom and kitchen were also spotless, and the convenience of a washer, dryer, and a relaxing backroom added to the appeal, all exactly as Kim had described. Situated ideally in the heart of Jefferson City, it was conveniently near the stunning Missouri State Capitol building. Major retail destinations such as Walmart, Target, Sam's Club, and Kohl's were just a stone's throw away, along with an array of dining options. This charming abode truly won us over."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This house is an eclectic gem. Private space with a wonderful porch. House is old so expect some quirky spaces and flow. Very clean and fun decoration.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the vibe of Kim and Tylers place. They were great hosts and made sure we had everything we needed for our stay. Their place was central to a lot of restaurants and shops. Would recommend booking their place to others.

The inside of the house is very charming, and everything was clean and comfortable. It’s so cool to see how they have saved this old house in downtown JC."

Tara is an excellent communicator with proactive messages and quick responses. The Mesa house is a great place to stay for a while."

Imagine a fairy godparent with an extra dash of cool dedicated ti ensuring you have the very best time. The house manual? It's more of a treasure map leading to pleasure. Pay attention to the tiny details sprinkled throughout—it's like the host is playfully challenging you, sparking eye rolls and delighted chuckles, especially when you realize you've been outsmarted without them even being there. It’s tough to spill all the thoughtful touches aimed at ensuring your safety, outstanding service, and a good laugh without ruining the surprise. Just go for it; it’s every bit as enchanting as promised. You’ll be daydreaming about your next visit before those red velvet curtains close."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the variety and beauty of the BDSM equipment. while my husband is experienced Dom, I am new to BDSM and this gave me an opportunity to experience using equipment I had only seen in pictures and videos. The furniture was beautiful and of excellent quality. The LED strip lights added great atmosphere.
The only issue we had was the ceiling in the bedroom. It was difficult to get in and out of bed without bumping your head."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The host was amazing! The dungeon was immaculate; very clean and in like-new condition. First class furnishings, and they spared no expense!
As far as equipment, you will likely want to bring your own toys from home. Aside from a set of cuffs and a few percussive toys, there isn’t much beyond the furniture, so you’re on your own there. However, given the intimate nature of the space, we preferred our own.
As you can see from the photos, the bed upstairs was a little tricky getting in/out of, but otherwise was clean and comfortable. The mattress was a medium-firm gel foam, I believe.
The bathroom was similarly clean and everything was new.
All in all, it was a wonderful experience for me and my wife, and we can’t wait to get back!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was amazing! After recently watching the series How To Build A Sex Room on Netflix, the wife and I wondered if there were any *spicy* locations. This place did not disappoint and was much bigger than the photos made it look like. Even without the spicy furnishings, the home is beautiful. All of the little details they've put into the place made it all the better. The lighting, the music, the artwork throughout all fed into the vibe but not overdone. Will definitely be back and I wish there were more like this."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Host was absolutely perfect. He volunteered to mail back a tiny piece to an expensive set that was left behind. He accommodated a late checkout and responded to everything immediately. I am truly shocked how beautiful the place was and how accommodating he was as well as how much thought went into every small detail. If you're looking at this Airbnb considering it... Just do it! You will not be disappointed.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had the BEST time at DungeonJC! We had been wanting to do something like this for quite some time, and finally booked this rental for my husband's 45th birthday. It did not disappoint and was more than worth it! It was extremely clean, the lighting and hey Siri in every room was very nice, and the furniture was very legit, sturdy, and exactly as described. The whole place was much more beautiful than the pictures do justice. There's plenty of cleaning supplies and amenities in the house, everything you could think of. Squeaky clean. The couch was not only gorgeous but comfortable. The host was very accommodating to an early check in and/or late check out with our fluctuating schedule, which made the little over 4 hour drive even more worth it! This is the cheapest rental I've found in this ""genre"", and it lived up to all our expectations and more!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a really lovely stay here. Loved the house and my bed. I was a little too aggressive with the toilet flush (the one in my home requires a strong push) and broke it! Zach was over so quickly and fixed it. He was friendly and warm. Would recommend anyone to stay here.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a perfect little 2 bedroom home. It was very clean and fully updated. The Kitchen was also fully stocked with all items needed to cook and feed a small family. We had a very quiet and enjoyable stay.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved it! Very clean, the beds slept great, we loved that it had the washer, dryer access & a large refrigerator for our stay! Not to complain at all but we found the bathtub to be a bit slippery for my parents when they showered, and some kind of bar too grasp ahold of for safety would have helped them & made them more comfortable too, the front door threshold step was elevated a little bit too much for my parents too but other than that, everything was absolutely perfect for our stay and we really enjoyed it! We hope to stay again when our travels take us to Jeff City hopefully in the near future!
Thank you so much, Maria Lyne"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely home that is very clean. The bedding was quality and the beds were firm without being overly so. Very comfortable stay - had everything we needed in the kitchen to make meals.
The only negative was the neighborhood. The direct neighbors were very nice and were so friendly when we saw them in the morning - but there are some sketchy places surrounding. I wasn’t super nervous, but it’s worth mentioning as it was a bit of a surprise for us. Given that the home itself is top notch, it was just weird. I would 100% recommend this place."

2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"This property is a great option for groups or families looking to stay in or around Jefferson City. We were a group of six staying for three nights for a wedding nearby (Daisy Farm ~15 minutes away), but with activities as far away as at Lake of the Ozark (~45 minutes). We were able to walk to downtown and the capitol pretty easily. There's also a coffee shop and whiskey bar immediately across the street. So location-wise, this is a great spot.
For the house itself, it was also great. We really enjoyed spending time on the shaded front porch (sad we didn't get a chance to use the pool table). It was clean and exactly as pictured. Bobbie was great and easy to communicate with. I would recommend this house to anyone looking to bunk up in Jeff City!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Finding accommodations for two families consisting of six children and two adults is no small feat, but Bobbie’s home made it a piece of cake! The home’s layout was perfect for the kids to have their own space upstairs for games, movies, and fun, while downstairs still had ample room for cooking, eating, and adults to relax.
The king size bed mattresses were the perfect balance of firm and soft, and the linens made us feel right at home. It was quiet and peaceful each night of our stay.
Bobbie was incredibly prompt in all of our communication, both before and during our stay.
This home is in an extremely convenient location, no matter where you are headed in the Jefferson City area!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This should be a masterclass on the perfect Airbnb stay. Everything was perfect. You can see the capitol building from the airbnb and it is a stones throw from everything Jeff City.
All of the finishes in the airbnb were perfect; stainless steel appliances, the beds were high-end (tempurpedic?), amazing pillows, the host was very communicative. Again, masterclass on an Airbnb.
The key takeaway is that this place is severely undersold and I will be staying here every time I’m back in Jeff City."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Came to Jeff City for a wedding we had a perfect location for every where we needed to go. Beds were great, very clean, and the pool table add entertainment for my group. If I ever need to stay in Jeff again this will be my first choice!"

We loved the layout and amenities in the house. The kitchen was great to cook in, and the big screen TV and pool table made for a fun atmosphere. We also hung out in the back yard with the solo stove. Beds and pillows were quite comfortable, too.

Seriously, there wasn’t a speck of dust anywhere! The neighborhood is quiet and safe. Beds are super comfy. We enjoyed the nice view of the back yard with great outdoor furniture.

2023-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"The one and ONLY difficulty was getting into the Airbnb, this particular space requires that you text the host an ETA which determines when they will send you the keypad code. I failed to see that policy when picking this place and ended up waiting outside of the Airbnb for a bit for the host to send the code.
Aside from this, the space was beautiful, clean and comfortable- highly recommend for families. We only stayed one night and wish we could have stayed longer!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This was an excellent place to stay. Extremely nice.

Extra plus to me was lack of knick knacks (I have small kids and adorable items have to be put up for safety). The hot water is hot, the water pressure is great, the A/C held up to Missouri heat and humidity. Huge tvs, fast wifi, a bathtub for the kids, and a generously sized shower in the second bathroom. Jason was helpful and very responsive to messages. Don’t bother with any other places, just stay here and thank me later."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for hosting me.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Always great to stay at one of Jason's properties in Jefferson City. The home we stayed at this time was spotless, with a very nice open floor plan in the main living area/kitchen, a huge master bedroom suite with separate bath, his and her walk-in closets and a work desk.
Both of the two bedrooms and the living room were equipped with large screen televisions. The bed linens and pillows in both were top quality and very comfortable. The large, separate laundry room had plenty of shelving and counter space along with a separate sink and laundry supplies. All of the appliances in the kitchen were new or newer and spotless as well.
All in all great value for the money at a location near to restaurants and attractions in the area. Jason as always was quick to respond to any questions we had and he kept in touch to make sure our stay was trouble free. Basically, I wouldn't stay anywhere else when I'm in town.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were in town for a wedding and chose to stay at Jason’s home- it was immaculate. It smelled so clean when we walked in, and it looked absolutely untouched. Not a speck of dust. It was so comfortable to walk into after a long drive and event. The televisions in the master bed and living room were HUGE! So nice to relax in a place that felt just like home. We will absolutely use Jason’s place again over a hotel! We can’t recommend it enough."

It was in a convenient location, Jason’s communication was great, entry was simple, the home was super clean, and the beds comfy."

2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Had a great stay at liz's place. It was comfortable and easy to find things in the area that we needed. She even had floss sticks which came in handy, cause I didn't realize I forgot mine til I went to use it."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"It was a great experience!
We could tell the host really put thought and effort into the decor and items in the home, and a great price for a full house with a kitchen and multiple bedrooms.
The stairway upstairs has one step that is slightly taller step which was a little tricker for my older mother-in-law to get a hang of. It’s worth keeping an eye out for that if you have anyone in your party with a mobility concern. Overall, a great place to stay."
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Liz’s place was super clean and comfy! She even worked with me to get an early check-in.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"very nice place to stay, we like to stay here while in Jefferson City"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay and relax.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My family enjoyed the house very much and spent most of our time there. Very comfortable beds and the shower had awesome water pressure! I would recommend Liz as a hostess and the house is beautiful!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Liz was an amazing host. Her home was warm and cozy, everything we expected. Liz was very friendly and quick to respond. We were in town under less than ideal circumstances, and she was very welcoming. Also offering to refund a night when we had to check out a day early to head out before a bad storm hit our home state. She definitely went above and beyond. Thank you for being a great host!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. I highly recommend it. Often a tay in Jeff city for work often. easily one of my favorite stays. Will definitely be looking this place up next time I'm in town. Top notch!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable, pristine accommodations close to downtown Jefferson City. Walkable neighborhood. Easy parking. Responsive host. Highly recommend."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful lovingly restored home. The very spacious over-sized master bedroom afforded us a good night sleep in the comfortable bed. The spacious kitchen is well stocked. In addition to a large dining room and comfortable living room, laundry, and two outdoor porch sitting areas, there are thoughtful small touches throughout this aesthetically pleasing home from lovely bathroom linens to a step stool in the kitchen to lots of clothes hangers. Although it is quite near an adjacent a three-plex building and although the other unit in the duplex overhead, it is so so quiet. A short walk away from Jefferson City's historic downtown, the quiet and peacefulness extends to the neighborhood with a mixture of homes and offices, Efficient communication from Ryan made us feel welcome."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable place! This place is very well stocked in the kitchen and the bathroom. I appreciated the extras- a welcome basket, a few water bottles in the fridge, spice rack, coffee filters, laundry detergent and a charging station in each bedroom. The neighborhood was quiet, close to the capitol and great restaurants. I would stay here again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay and I have already made reservations for two more visits later this year. (See my December 2023 review for more details.) It feels like a ""home away from home"" -- something that I really appreciate when I travel to Jeff City for work. Ryan is a welcoming, responsive, and flexible."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,very nice clean house. good proximity to downtown. lots of attention to detail. fully stocked kitchen. very responsive host. would stay again.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was in Jeff City for a work, and it was delightful to have a relaxing place I could call my home away from home. Such a wonderful alternative to and a million times more comfortable than a hotel. Ryan is very responsive and accommodating. The home is spotless (really spotless!) and extremely comfy. The welcome basket was a delightful surprise and much appreciated after a day of travel. Street parking right in front of the property was always available, but it took a little getting used to because I'm out of practice parallel parking on a hill (and it was a bit more challenging in a rental car). The home is conveniently located near Deborah Cooper Park on Adrian's Island which I found to be a delightful place to walk. I've already booked my return visits for 2024."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful renovation. Kitchen and bath really well done. Felt right at home. Walkable to downtown restaurants. Highly recommend staying at Ryan’s place.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ryan’s place is very clean and well stocked
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such thoughtful and kind hosts ready to please at the drop of a hat, I can’t say enough about Ryan and his delightful fiancé, two considerate souls.
The accommodation is warm and inviting with everything one needs. Plenty of space and so tastefully decorated. Clean? Absolutely bloody spotless deserving of six stars.
We would stay here again in a heart beat!!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay and got to be together as a family. The place was lovely,.:"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My husband and I both agreed this was one of the best Airbnbs we've stayed in - so clean, well stocked kitchen, felt very comfortable and safe the whole time. We are considering relocating to Jefferson City, and this was a wonderful introduction to the city. The location was perfect and we were able to walk all over downtown."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ryan's home is very welcoming, charming and clean. He is extremely responsive and kind. We truly enjoyed our stay here, and highly recommend if you are traveling to Jefferson City or Columbia!!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I were staying in Jefferson City to do research for a few days. We finished up early and were able to check some local historical places. While it was too hot to walk much, the location is not far from downtown (just a few blocks away) with access to lots of great local restaurants. Ryan's place is on a quiet street. We parked right out front and got in quickly. The unit is very clean and welcoming (I love the glide chair!) and the kitchen is excellent! We made several meals and felt right at home. It's a lovely and simple restoration of a great older house. If we ever get back to the area, we would stay again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ryan was a very helpful host. I've never used AirBNB before, so it was all new to me. He was responsive within minutes from the moment I booked. Very useful local suggestions and a really well appointed home. I would go back again if I was in the area."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect, comfy spot in Jeff City. We loved how walkable the area was. And we are still raving about that deep kitchen sink and the plush couches!"

2022-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Ryan’s rental was exactly what I hoped for for our stay! Super comfortable and there was so much thought put into the amenities and remodel of the vintage apartment. Ryan was tremendously helpful when we ran into an unavoidable problem, and he got the situation resolved for us quickly. I cannot recommend this rental more highly! Book now!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location for sight seeing. We were able to walk to the Capital, historic downtown and was an easy drive to Fulton to see the Winston Churchill Museum.
The apartment was spotless - I so appreciated how clean and clutter free the space was. If I make my way back to Jefferson City I would stay again."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and free of clutter. Nice decorations. Walking distance to coffee shops and downtown. Everything we needed in the kitchen. Very nice welcome basket and waters in the refrigerator. We would use this duplex again when in the area.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ryan's stay was perfect, we came to visit family in Jeff City. The apartment was close to local restaurants and parks, but still felt secluded and safe. We especially loved the welcome basket and all of the local recommendations. Would absolutely stay again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super clean and everything we could have possibly wanted was supplied. Lovely welcome basket was appreciated. All the linens and towels were very soft. Comfortable furnishings and lots of space. Nicely updated home in great location.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Immaculately clean, extremely well-appointed, beautifully furnished, and gracious, responsive hosts. We will definitely stay again next time we're in town."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the most fun we've ever had at a bnb! Ryan communicated with us quickly and clearly, and he was very friendly. The house was immaculate, comfy, and well-decorated and included tons of practical items you would expect to find plus many extras, such as a welcome basket and brochures about surrounding attractions. We walked to the capitol every day, and there were so many things to do on High Street between the capitol building and the bnb. We ate on the strip on two different days, shopped in the shops, played a card game in another venue, and completed a walking tour of downtown Jefferson City using the brochure left for us by the bnb's host. We wouldn't have needed the car the whole time we were there, and we would have had just as much to do. I'm definitely hoping to come back and stay again someday!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is so nice and comfy and a homie feeling. So welcoming. Truly felt like home while we were there for 7 days. When returning we will hope to stay here again. Easy access to everything and walking distance.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ryan was a great host. The duplex is so cute and decorated to the T. He provided nice amenities like toothbrushes and toothpaste, shampoo, etc. We loved being able to do laundry since we were riding the Katy Trail. Check in and out we’re super easy. We all agreed it was one of the best Airbnb places we had ever stayed."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Definitely Book this space. The home was clean and beautiful. Located just three blocks from the penitentiary which was where we were going. Ryan Thought of all of our needs in advance. Attention to detail is a strength of his! We loved our two night stay !
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. Very clean, nice places to eat close by. Host responded quickly to any questions that we had.i would recommend this unit to anyone."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Tricia's place was one of the nicest air bnbs we have stayed in. Super clean; nice furniture; comfortable beds; fluffy towels; wonderful showers and kitchen well stocked. Tricia was quick to answer any questions I had prior to check-in. It was between 5-10 minutes to downtown but grocery and fast food closer. We had a group of six that were riding Katy Trail and the hot tub was a great ending to our day. I will say if you plan on using it, turn heat up as soon as you get there so it is warmer by the time you want to get in. The patio by the hot tub was peaceful and private. Beautiful set up. If you are coming from Katy Trail and don't have a shuttle it would be a bit of a ride with some hills and riding in traffic so we were happy we had our own support vehicle to shuttle our bikes. (approx 6.5 miles from trail) Our entire group had nothing but positive things to say about this place. We would definitely stay here again!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Tricia's house was clean, spacious, up to date, and in a great location. We were in town for our daughter's wedding and Tricia's place was within minutes of the venue, restaurants, or anything we might need. The house sits in a beautiful neighborhood and check in and out was simplistic. There is a hot tub that's enclosed as you walk out of the basement, but we were too busy to enjoy it. Tricia was very informative and responsive from the beginning. We would definitely stay again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Spotlessly clean and well optioned place, with lots of great little touches. The hot tub was a perfect way to relax after a rough day.
Check-in and out was super easy, and we didn't need anything while we were there.
Great spot, and will definitely keep this on our list of must-stay!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and comfy!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing place. Made us feel right at home.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean and cozy home. Hot tub was pristine and private with nice deck views. We didn’t cook but kitchen was very stocked with amenities. Coffee and creamer being available was a nice bonus. Location is easy to find and home is located in a quiet neighborhood. There was some street noise when sitting outside but otherwise peaceful. Close to restaurants and shopping. Appreciated having a carport for parking and quick access to the inside for loading and unloading. Having shampoo, conditioner and body wash was a nice convenience. Plenty of clean towels for both bathroom and hot tub were readily available for use. Enjoyed having options for tv viewing both upstairs and downstairs and each bedroom."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home! It's so peaceful. Quiet street. Close to everything. They had lots of boardgames, which was nice. We ended up taking the first bedroom on the right, we thought the bed was super comfortable! & the QUILTS!!! It was a short but really good stay."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"My colleagues and I stayed one overnight and were so comfortable! Super cute home, loved the hot tub with the privacy fence/walls, and I appreciate the basic supplies available in the kitchen.

2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The inside of the house was cute, clean, and had everything we wanted. Tricia was gracious about our request for an early check in too. Only one thing stood out that was a problem. The hot-tub. The water was murky and based on the recommendation of a hot tub owner, it wasn’t safe to use. This was unfortunate, because that amenity was the one reason we chose this house. I did reach out to the owner about this, but the response wasn’t exactly what I had hoped for. “You should have let me know sooner” and “it was fine the last time I checked” isn’t what I call sympathetic. All and all we still had a nice time, but it could have been better."
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"Absolutely amazing! My first experience with Airbnb, but will definitely do it again. House was amazing and had everything we needed to cook our meal and watch the NFL playoff game. Was a gathering of friend for a special occasion and the house was exactly what we need!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Tricia’s place was just as described and was the perfect weekend get away!

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"The Mimosa House is adorable!! Spotless, Comfortable & Adorable!!! The hotub was refreshing and so private with the extra tall privacy fence! Would highly recommend."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay immensely!
Tricia was a fantastic host in every way. The house was comfortable, extremely clean, and located in a quiet neighborhood. We would definitely choose to stay here again the next time in the area!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,This house was perfect for our girls' weekend! Plenty of beds & bathrooms and space. We had 3 cars so the driveway worked perfectly. And it was convenient to pull up next to the side entrance door to unload! There were plenty of linens and kitchen amenities. We would definitely stay here again and recommend to our friends! Thanks for helping to make our weekend the best!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay at Tricia’s Airbnb! You won’t regret staying here! Super clean, great modern/new hot tub, three king beds and three bathrooms, lots of dishes, blankets, towels, and all the things you’ll need! Seriously, book it!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Check in was super easy. My family and I arrived and felt at home from the moment we walked in the door. The house was immaculate and the back porch was amazing. My family and I enjoyed playing cards on the porch as well as the hot tub. There is a guest book with amazing restaurant recommendations. My family and I had a wonderful stay and would definitely book again. Thank you for sharing your wonderful place with us.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family was only there one night to be close to an event on Saturday. It was such a sweet house, I would have loved to have more time there. We enjoyed the hot tub. The kitchen was perfect to make breakfast before we headed out for the day."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best Airbnb every stayed in.
Thank you Tricia"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"We were in Jeff to visit relatives for the long weekend. Tricia's place was close and convenient to their home. Tricia's home was lovely and spacious, and with three bedrooms and three baths, there was plenty of room for the five of us to spread out and feel comfortable in the space! I LOVED the decor and it was beyond clean! As a self proclaimed germaphobe, this is always the most important aspect of any stay for my family!!! This is such an upgrade to a boring hotel! I would 100% recommend this Airbnb to anyone and actually already have! Kuddos to Tricia for providing a wonderful experience!!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A really cute house! Had a lot of necessities, a good quiet neighborhood."
2023-08-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Great place it’s huge and beautiful! just bring your own pillows and a soft blanket to lay on, the bed and the pillows made it hard to sleep at all super uncomfortable pillows, really hot. Other than that literally one of the best Airbnbs ever."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a perfect spot for the weekend! Amazingly clean, unique and thoughtful touches, and extremely comfortable furniture! We also appreciated the easy check out! We will definitely stay here again!!"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Super place to stay. Quiet. Clean. Perfect for the couples we traveled with. ZERO complaints.
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Place was very clean. I did not like the white truck that kept passing and video recording made me feel unsafe or somebody was spying on. I think the internet router should be moved out I had problems when I first got there It took about 5 hours to get fixed if I had access to the internet box I could have unplugged it and plugged it back in and had internet right away. The owner was aware of it and got someone there as fast as they could as they were out of town.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Me and my family stayed here for two nights. The house had a good amount of room and space for our family, everything was clean, and very comfortable. I loved all of the board game options! The neighborhood was very peaceful during our stay and it isn’t too far from town. Everyone we talked to while we were in town was extremely friendly. Tricia was great to communicate with. She was quick to respond when I had a question or needed something. She knew we were brining our one year old and laid out some special baby soap and wipes for him during our stay, which was so thoughtful and sweet."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,everything was clean. everything we need for the week.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,As soon as you walked into the house you felt at home. The property is perfectly located with easy access to the highway as needed. The home was immaculately clean and amazingly decorated. The outdoor area was key to relaxing at night right before bed after a long day with family. Highly recommend!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Tricia's place is definitely in the top 3 of our ""best places we have stayed"". She was very proactive in contacting us, even offering early check-in, although we weren't able to take advantage of it. The house is even larger on the inside than it appears in the photos. We only stayed 1 night so did not really make use of many of the amenities, but it seemed at first glance to have everything necessary, and everything was extremely clean. We spent most of the evening on the deck and were impressed at the lack of bugs despite the proximity to the woods. The hot tub was very clean and worked flawlessly. Our daughter really enjoyed having the entire basement (which is MASSIVE) to herself.
All in all a great stay and we would definitely stay here again!"

2023-07-01,5,Group trip,The place was perfect! Exactly what the pictures showed! It was clean and very accommodating!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,What a wonderful stay! The house is beautiful with comfortable furnishings and charming decorations! The area is private and best of all is the outdoor space… a beautiful tree lined private yard and furnished deck with hot tub! I can’t wait to come back next time I’m in Jefferson City!
