2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Crystal‚Äôs house was great and perfect for a weekend getaway! Walking distance to a few local attractions that become nightly rituals (Bubbles Ice Cream and Carlsons Root Beer stand) for our stay. Having the house be dog friendly was a huge perk as well. Short drive to the beach and lots of great restaurants. We will be back!!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay at Kamala‚Äôs. Very clean and private. Very easy to access. Thank you for being a great host üòä
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect little space for a quick trip to see Indiana Dunes National Park and Michigan City.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was great! Nice cozy spot that was nearby everything at a reasonable cost. I spent the majority of my time out exploring and you can‚Äôt beat the local market, dunes, and tons of other spots to explore."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kamala‚Äôs place is a great place to stay for a long weekend visit to the Indiana Dunes area. It‚Äôs comfortable, pleasant, affordable and convenient to the Dunes national and state parks (assuming you have a car). My wife and I have stayed there twice and look forward to returning."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Kamala was a very friendly and responsive host! The inside was as pictured, clean and cozy. The outside, however, did need some maintenance. While it wasn‚Äôt totally what was expected, the location was very convenient and was in a seemingly safe neighborhood! It was a very quiet and private area."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"my husband and I stayed at Kamalas place for a weekend while in town for a wedding. We don't normally book shared or attached spaces, but this one proved to be very private, and the self check-in also helped with that! There was some strange knocking sounds the first night that gave us a little pause, but being so close to nature, it really could have been anything. The space was clean and gave us exactly what we needed for the weekend away!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a nice time at this Airbnb :) the location was pretty quiet and peaceful and just what we needed for our chill little Lake Michigan vacation. The studio was spotless, decorated cutely, and most importantly very comfortable. Would stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kamala's place was clean and calm. There was a nice TV to watch from the bed, coffee, and some cleaning amenities like shampoo and conditioner. It was a cut and dry stay, relatively private, and felt like a little apartment, exactly as it was described. It was exactly what I was looking for for a short trip local to the area. Kamala was also very accommodating and responded promptly to all my messages. I was very satisfied with the space!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was great, the place was peaceful. It was easy to access and was exactly as listed. This was also in a good location only being about 10 minutes from the beach."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to relax. 10 minutes to the lake and attractions. Grounds were beautiful, birds in abundance and no one bothered me. I will be going back. Thank you."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place for a young couple to get away and explore the Dunes and surrounding areas
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An amazing and beautiful place to stay. Truly a great place to have a weekend get away from the city and experience the small town life instead.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was lovely, the owner was helpful and responsive! I enjoyed all of the windows, nature, and it was a clean area. The bathroom was nice, pillows were comfy, there were extra amenities if you needed them, and a cute set of binoculars were on the table for bird watching. Air conditioning worked well, too. If you‚Äôre into TV, there was a really big flat screen. It rained during my stay, which I loved because I enjoyed the sounds and the vibe. It was a really good spot, I would stay here again! :)"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable, private, peaceful stayüòÅ"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The studio was a perfect getaway from the city and was such a charming spot. Very close to the beach and local activities. Kamala was very responsive to any questions we had and gave clear instructions on how to get to the house. Thanks for a lovely stay!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I enjoyed our three-night stay. The place was comfortable and attractive and had everything we needed. It‚Äôs an easy drive to Indiana Dunes with beaches, birding and hiking. Kamala was responsive and helpful. We would stay there again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect spot for my son and I!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Can‚Äôt think of a better setting for a weekend stay when visiting the Indiana Dunes. The flat has a delightful view to a garden that‚Äôs truly a forest and the flat was clean, well organized and very functional. Kamala was very friendly and responsive. A wonderful stay."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for the hospitality!

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2022-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I stayed here for 10 nights while working in the area. Nice, quiet, very clean and comfortable. What more could one ask for? Good hot shower, comfy couch and bed. The mini-fridge could use a defrosting, but it still kept things really cold! Maybe consider installing an outdoor light post along the walkway to the door. The little solar lights don‚Äôt work in the dark after an overcast day."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommended
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location is perfect for visiting Indiana Dunes N.P. & state park, as well as many attractions in the area.
Very welcoming place to return to after full days exploring the area. The place is clean & had everything we needed. Would definitely stay here again. Kamala is a great host and communication was perfect."
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,quite and quaint. had a lovely stay this last labor day weekend. would recommend.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a gem! It was a great place to retreat from the city for a few days. Very picturesque setting with all the trees, pond, and creek running through the back of the house. Communication and check-in were easy and Kamala is a great host! Highly recommend this cozy studio."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent. Very nice place in a very pretty neighbourhood.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, out of the way but still close enough to everything you would want to do! Definitely recommend."
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The place was a cozy little stopover for us. The place overlooks a lovely pond and field and it was a relaxing place to stay. Michigan City is only a short (10 minute) drive to get to restaurants and beaches. The wifi worked great - we had multiple video conference calls without a problem.
It's important to note that there isn't much of a kitchen - just a microwave and a mini fridge. We mostly ended up eating out."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This little studio had the perfect amount of space. Kamala has a big TV and a nice cozy couch. This is the perfect hidden gem Airbnb. The bed was extremely comfortable too! Her property was gorgeous and so quiet. I love the private entrance into the studio .
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great little place just outside of town! Loved the view of the little lake!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot. It was in town but felt like it was in the country because of all the timber around. It was tucked away and private but felt very safe.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a gem of a place. It‚Äôs more spacious than you might expect. Everything was as listed. Clean, quiet, tucked next to trees with so many windows to enjoy the natural light. The windows do lock and the house is in a quiet neighborhood and tucked back, so it feels private and safe. Easy access to he beach, outlets and New Buffalo. Kamala was great at responding. I highly recommend staying!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay for a great price. So many things to do in the surrounding area. Would go back again!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The setting is very private and feels like it is out in the country despite it being in town. The apartment has lots of windows, which makes it very bright. There is a fridge, an electric kettle, and a pour-over coffee maker, but nothing else. If you plan to eat anything at the apartment, you will need to bring plates and cutlery as is appropriate. Our host was very accommodating during our stay!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Kamala‚Äôs was amazing! It was so clean and cozy. The pond and greenery were both fabulous. So close to the dunes, New Buffalo and even Union Pier.
I want to address some concerns other guests had -
The windows ARE old but they definitely do lock. We felt safe during our entire stay.
The bed is firm but nothing too uncomfortable. In fact, we loved it.
We will definitely stay here again if we ever visit the area!"
2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice and clean, just as advertised. Quiet and close to everything. Good price compared to others in the area!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"so cute and cozy! relatively close to all things you could want to do in the area, loved it!!"
2021-12-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Host had great communication and was friendly. The room was very clean and spacious. I ultimately did not stay the night because the old windows did not lock and the passcode would be easy to guess. As a young woman traveling alone, these were reasons for concern."
2021-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great place for a quiet weekend away! Cozy bed, nice big TV, easy drive to area attractions."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Expect a great stay here. Quiet, peaceful, and in a great location.
Amenities are as stated and very clean place.
Would definitely stay here again for a wonderful getaway."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I enjoyed our stay at Kamala's. It provided us a warm and cozy shelter after hiking many dunes. The property was also beautiful even in the rainy, cold October weather."
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our weekend stay in Kamala‚Äôs place. It was quiet and a nice relaxing stay. The bed is not hard like the other reviews more so soft in our opinion. We‚Äôd recommend it for a weekend stay.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Unit was clean and well-kept. Host was proactive and responded quickly. Would highly recommend!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my time in this studio! The views are lovely, it had everything I needed, and I was very cozy. Other reviews mentioned the firmness of the bed, but I found it quite comfortable."

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,everything was great
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kamala's studio was perfect for a weekend getaway. Kamala was very accommodating and communicative. It was exactly as described and more - cozy, stylish, and private. The private and natural setting was perfect and we never felt like we were staying in someone else's home or in the way. As others have mentioned, the bed was very comfortable but be aware it's pretty firm (which we didn't mind). We found it helpful to bring in an extra cooler to manage food and drinks as the mini fridge is very small. Hoping to stay again soon!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location! Situated easily to get to all of the local attractions or just escape and find peace and quiet. Easy no-contact check-in.

2021-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Get place if you want to a little getaway but still within easy driving distance to the city‚Äôs attractions.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have nothing bad we could say about our stay at this place! It was sparkling clean and so cozy. The bed was so comfortable. We messed up our dates and contacted Kamala the day before we were supposed to show up and she responded immediately and was able to make arrangements for us which she definitely did not have to do! wlWe were sad to leave such a cozy place and can't recommend it enough.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and the host communicated very well with us! Exactly what we were looking for
2021-05-01,4,Stayed about a week,"This is a large, quiet, clean room, in a nice neighborhood, which is perfect for two people who do not need a kitchen. The small fridge and microwave were adequate for us, since we were eating elsewhere during our stay. The hostess is very responsive and friendly, and the price was right."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kamala has a lovely space, we only wished we couldve spent more time there!"

2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic stay, and the location was perfect!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kamala's place is fascinating, unique and beautiful. It's set back from the street, feels very isolated, rural and sort of wooded. A pond, stream nearby, woods, beautiful bird chirping in the morning, and yet it's close to everything. Highly recommended!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was exactly what we needed! Really comfortable with great coffee, a nice TV, clean bathroom, a few other nice amenities and was very close to all the Michigan City places of interest. Super easy access to Indiana Dunes and wineries/breweries."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice house would stay there again
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great value and location. Very short drive to downtown Michigan City as well as Indiana Dunes National Park. Kirby and Taryn were very responsive and left lots of local recommendations for places to go and things to do. For anyone traveling with a toddler or young children, there is a park less than a block away that is worth exploring as well. Would definitely recommend to people interested in the area."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cant wait to book it again!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Looking forward to our next stay
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had no issues with the property. We did not get to utilize the new Hot Tub as this was a short business stay for meetings.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing and beautiful home! Enough to fit my entire family of 8. The host was very responsive and checked in a couple of times to make sure our stay was going well. I would strongly recommend others to stay at this location. This was my first Airbnb and the hosts have set the bar high for any future Airbnb‚Äôs we may stay at. Thanks again for the great experience!
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"Big Blue is the perfect name for the house!
Loved it.."
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,Everything perfect!
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"Planned a ‚Äúpost holidays‚Äù couple retreat with friends! It was the perfect weekend get away after a busy holiday season!!
Place was perfect for the 8 of us!! 10/10 would recommend"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Terrific hosts and great stay!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were able to find our destination easily. The house was located close to restaurants, shopping and Walmart. The house was described accurately and looked like the pictures. The only thing that we didn‚Äôt like was the view of the backyard. It was not like the picture. Overall the stay was great. Would recommend to others and book again in the future."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thanks for having us!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Exceptional property. Plenty of room. Very responsive to all our requirements.
2023-12-01,4,Group trip,
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"Had great stay, host is very responsive and cater to your needs. The host give us the early check in and late check out which I found really great. The place is pretty nice, comfy, homie and have enough essentials for more than 10.
Overall nice place"
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Host was excellent- we had all the information needed before check in. Home was clean and exactly as expected. Check out instructions were clear. Would come back!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Big Blue was just as advertised and was the perfect place for our family to relax and enjoy time together. The house had everything we needed and then some!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful stay! Responsive and friendly hosts! Place was as advertised. Comfy and cozy house, with plenty of room for 2 adults and 4 kids to spread out. House was nice and clean! Hot tub was great, and bottle of wine to welcome guests is a nice touch! Would certainly stay again!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"It was a pleasure staying at the Big Blue. The home had plenty of space, was in a very convenient location and was well appointed. Would definitely recommend!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,There was 8 of us plus an infant and this home was so spacious and clean. There was plenty of room for all of us. It was even better than I expected. We loved how close everything was and there was so much to do within 5-10 minutes from the house. It was awesome! The host went above and beyond to take care of us. We are already planning a trip to stay here again. If I could give more than 5 stars I would!
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Some of the mattresses were a bit uncomfortable, but overall, it is a great place. Highly recommend!"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Our stay was great! Easy check in, within 5 minutes of pretty much everything we did, super clean, and great communication with the hosts! Had beach toys, nice beach towels, and LOTS of bath towels which is always great staying with a group of 10 girls! We enjoyed our weekend!"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,My family and some of my old friends got together and had a great weekend catching up and they got to meet my son! Rained the second day but we still had enough to do and enough space for all of us!
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful home in a central location! The neighborhood & backyard scenery are a bit off putting, but nothing to be worried about. 5 to 10 minutes from the beach, casino, outlet mall, Indiana dunes, and a ton of restaurants! Plenty of things to do to stay busy which is a plus! Host we‚Äôre very friendly & communicative, to ensure we had what we needed for a relaxing weekend! A couple of downsides to the property were that the fridge isn‚Äôt connected to a water line, so no ice or water. With such a big house that holds up to 12 or 13 people, I would‚Äôve expected to see more mirrors. Only two full body mirrors outside of the bathroom mirrors, causing it to take longer for everyone to get ready. No dishwasher or garbage disposal. This last one is more of a personal preference, but there are only 2 tvs in the house, one in each of the main living areas, no tvs in the bedrooms which was a bummer. Overall my group had a great weekend getaway & would definitely stay again!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Amazing hosts and amazing place. Super close to everything!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, spacious home with thoughtful touches. Hosts went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed and were very responsive. We took a trip with friends/families with kids and while the house isn‚Äôt ‚Äúbaby proofed‚Äù per say, its not a home with dangerous corners or breakable items and our group felt totally comfortable here (kids ages ranged from 18 mo to age 8). Bedrooms were spacious and two living rooms gave us plenty of space for all. Kitchen counter space for large meal prep was a bit lacking. No dishwasher. The house had everything for cooking for a large group and hosts are kind enough to stock the house with enough TP, coffee, trash bags for your whole stay which is so helpful.
The back deck was great. The hot tub was clean, safe, and in excellent condition. It was the highlight of our stay!
Just a note for renters- we booked it thinking it was walkable to the beach, and it‚Äôs not really because of the road route. Still a very short drive."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Kirby and Taryn were great hosts and provided us with a wonderful house for our family vacation to Michigan City! I highly recommend and will definitely return.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay! Thanks for everything! The home had everything needed and extras that make the vacation awesome.
Thanks again!!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"My friends and I had a great weekend getaway here. The location is great, close to the beach, casino and outlet mall. There are a lot of things to do in the neighborhood but the weekend we came it rained most of the time so we enjoyed our time indoor. The host prepared everything for us to entertain so there was no time we felt bored. The place is really beautiful and cozy. We enjoyed our stay there and would love to visit again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Excelent vacartion home. Eveething was so perfect, it feels like our own home."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family enjoyed our stay in Michigan City at Kirby and taryn's place. It was very close to the zoo, the pier and lighthouse. It was also nearby to the Indiana dunes State Park. We enjoyed the hot tub and there were lots of bedrooms. It was all very clean and new feeling."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a beautiful house with responsive hosts. No issues or complaints on our end. Neighborhood was nice and quiet, and great location for both Michigan City and Indiana Dunes National Park. Tons of space, very clean and beautifully decorated. We had a great experience."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Great spot for a weekend getaway. Just a quick drive to the beach, restaurants, casino etc. It was nice having several bedrooms both up and downstairs (to allow guests to spread out). Hot tub was a great feature as well!"
2023-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The home is in good condition. The hosts were super nice and responsive. The hot tub had not been serviced in a while when we got there, and a service company had to be called. However, the hosts went the extra mile to make it right. The backyard view is NOT what you would expect, which was a bit jarring, given what was shown online. The house was cozy though, and served all our needs well. Once the hot tub was fixed, we had a good time."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Great place and hosts! Near by everything we wanted to do - beach, hikes, breweries and restaurants. Good internet and enough space for 11 adults where it didn‚Äôt feel cramped. Kirby and Taryn were so friendly and proactive - I‚Äôd definitely stay at one of their places again."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful house very clean
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Loved my stay here! They were easy to communicate with! Easy to find and nice and clean. I highly suggest this place to stay if your in the area. Nice place for big groups of people to stay.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thanks for hosting your place
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Had a lovely time staying at this Airbnb! The house itself was a comfortable space to stay in, and there was lots to do in the area. If you're looking to spend some time relaxing on the beach, gambling at the casino, or hiking the Indiana Dunes, I would recommend booking a stay here!"
2023-05-01,3,Group trip,"I was very excited to book this property. I just had a few concerns. It does appear to be bigger online than in person. The king bed was hard, the grill was dirty, the couches in the basement were hard as well. I just wish for the money it was more comfortable. I love the decor and the fire pit. Besides that it was doable for my partner‚Äôs birthday weekend."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing! Amazing! Amazing! From the finished basement with extra bedrooms to the hot tub. My kids called it ‚Äúhome‚Äù. Thanks again to the entire team for a wonderful stay.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved it!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay and very active hosts that will cater to any need you have. Thanks for allowing me to stay at your place!
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,owners respond right away.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Kirby and Taryn's place is beautiful and spacious with room for my whole family! the house was clean and the beds were very comfortable. Plenty of space in the yard for the kiddos to run around while the adults enjoyed the fire pit! We had an excellent time while we stayed.
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,We really enjoy celebrating our anniversary at the Big Blue House. We loved the house so much we have now made plans to return 3 more times this year. Kirby & Taryn are the perfect hosts and are very accommodating. Thanks for letting us enjoy your home.
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,I had a good time the place was exactly what I imagined my family and I enjoyed ourselves we stayed the weekend! Easy to find and a great location there was a skating rink not far which made everything perfect ü§ó I would definitely visit again!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was awesome. We had no problems at all during our stay and the hosts were continually checking with us everyday if we need anything at all. They had kept a nice guide which has activities listed for almost any kind of a person. Overall we had a great time here. Thank you so much Jennifer, Kirby and Taryn. We will definitely come back."
2023-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The home offered the space and bed and bathrooms for our family. The floors are noisy when walking around. (The basement bedroom right below) I was aware the home is not baby proof, we had a hard time keeping our toddler off the open stairs. Not enough living room furniture but had plenty in the basement area. The hot tub was enjoyable. Close to outlet mall and restaurants. The home was a little expensive with the $200 cleaning fee."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, clean and spacious home near the beach, restaurants, shopping and more! The hot tub was pristine and perfect for a relaxing weekend. Highly recommend!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super clean cute little blue house. Perfect for a small girl‚Äôs trip, the hot tub was excellent in the cold weather.

During the peak season this would be a great location as it‚Äôs extremely close to the beach."
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,Comfortable and spacious for medium sized groups looking for a convenient spot in Michigan City. The communication was excellent and would highly recommend booking with this host.
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,We rented the blue house for a New Years couples retreat with some of our friends. The house was perfect for the group! Had plenty of seating to all eat together as well as seating downstairs for us all to hang out. It is right around the corner from the casino or about a mile and a half from the outlet mall. It‚Äôs also only a mile from beach access! An easy walk or quick drive. I recommend staying here!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Enjoyed our stay with our 3 adult children, their spouse/significant others and our 1.5 year old granddaughter.
The lower level was a great place to play games.

2022-10-01,4,Group trip,"Good place! There were a few slightly noticable issues with chalking and loose handles as well as very small and uncomfortable chairs (the beds, on the other hand, were incredible) but overall, a good place to stay!"
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"We enjoyed the experience and location greatly! Many things within short driving distance, and for our group of 10 there was plenty of space for all of us. Extremely clean and the hosts were very communicative throughout our stay. Would definitely stay here again!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family of 6 loved our stay at the big blue house! My 6 year old daughter wouldn't get out of bed on the last day because she loved the house so much and didnt want to leave.
The hot tub was so nice after a long day of hiking. Communication with the hosts great. They even called us not long after we left to lt us k ow we'd forgotten a library book there. Thanks for that!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Big Blue was a great stay and we would come back again. There are plenty of rooms and the downstairs space made for perfect getaway for the children and family fun.

The location was perfect and super close to many places (groceries, shopping, zoo, hikes, lake)."

We would definitely stay there again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was great! Communication was perfect, the hosts were really responsive both before and during our stay. Location made it easy to go to the beach, park, zoo, and the dunes. There was a huge amount of space for our two families, the kitchen was well stocked, and we enjoyed s'mores at the fire pit both nights. We didn't end up using the hot tub, but it's on the list for next time!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house was perfect. The space is maximized to allow for lots of guests without being cramped, every aspect of the house was immaculate, and the location was incredible. Seemed like every place we went was within about 5 minutes!

A necklace was left and she sent us a message immediately to let us know and help with that as well! The house is very spacious and clean. We really enjoy our time together in both living rooms and the outside area. This home is in a great location. Very close to Indian Dunes, Warren Dunes, New Buffalo and Union Pier, just to name a few!! Also close to a mall, a casino, hiking trails, and breweries. The neighborhood is quiet and had zero problems! We really had a great time making memories with friends and definitely would come back in the future!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful 5 bedroom home, exactly as described. This was a perfect setting for a family vacation. The house has everything you need for a nice long weekend, is close to the beach, dunes, outlets, winery, brewery, playgrounds, the zoo, grocery stores, a small farmer's market, etc. The neighborhood isn't walkable but it doesn't seem like much in Michigan City is, and there's plenty of parking available at Big Blue. The neighbors are friendly and we didn't have any issues with noise. We would stay again if we return to Michigan City."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The cleanliness is what I noticed instantly. The whole house was beautifully renovated and they did a great job with all the details. There was enough towels, sheets, toiletries, etc. There was games for us to play and enough space to mingle around inside and outside.
The beach is about a 15 minute walk and a 3 minute car ride. I must say though that there isn‚Äôt much parking available by the beach but that has nothing to do with the house.
They had towels and some beach toys for the kiddos and we took advantage of the hot tub one night. The ice maker wasn‚Äôt making ice but they answered us right away and offered to bring us ice until the ice started coming out.
Very friendly and attentive customer service."
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,A great location so close to the beach and such a cute home with beach vibes!! Had a great time - thanks for the wonderful host!

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very quick response time and impressive communication. The house is very clean, newly renovated, well thought out and decorated. Made us feel very welcome and comfortable. Beach is a 10-15 min walk. Nearby several breweries and restaurants by the water. Indiana Dunes national park is only 15 mins by drive."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time at ""Big Blue""! The whole family group loved the aesthetic decor and the hot tub! All instructions and labels were very helpful.

It was also really cool sitting out on the porch and seeing fireflies:-) Would stay again!"

2022-06-01,5,Group trip,Our family of 10 had a great time at the big blue house! The beach is just a couple miles away and absolutely beautiful! The kids loved the beach despite it being a bit cold! The zoo is very close by as well and so worth the $8 entry fee. The abundance of parking around the house is ideal and the house is very clean. The owners truly thought of every little thing we may need! The back deck was our hang out and our favorite memories from the trip were laughing and making memories on that porch!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great communication! This property was exactly as described. I would definitely stay at this host's house again.
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"Perfect place to visit with family or friends. The house is located at the center of everything, Casino, Beach, Restaurants, Grocery stores, Shopping outlets. Jennifer‚Äôs response time was impeccable! There were a couple of things that needed to be replaced during our stay, but the fact that she acknowledged it so fast made me feel at ease. The jacuzzi was great to relax at the end of the day. I am definitely booking again when we come back to visit with family. Don‚Äôt hesitate and book, they really go out their way to make your stay as comfortable and relaxing as possible!!!"
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,Fantastic house and hosts! So quick in responding and answering any questions we had!

2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"Kirby & Taryn‚Äôs ‚ÄúBig Blue‚Äù was an amazing stay for a weekend getaway. My friends and I had a wonderful time and the jacuzzi was the icing on the cake, especially if it‚Äôs chilly out. Jennifer‚Äôs communication is great and everything listed was just as expected. ‚ÄúBig Blue‚Äù is close to so many places and I will definitely come back when I am in the area!!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great, clean, cozy house. We used for a team of four for business purposes for ParentCamps with Gary Public Schools. Great communication! If in area, would stay again. Even though close to train tracks, you do not hear them at all."

2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Kirby was beyond accommodating and attentive. The house was comfortable and we had everything we needed during our stay. We would certainly scope out their other properties or stay at Big Blue again, especially during the summer, since not too far from the lake."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was my first Air B&B renting experience so I was a bit nervous. I can truly say the quick response time to my questions, the welcoming vibe of the home and the little touches Kirby & Taryn provided, not only, subsided my nervousness but impressed me. Me and my family truly enjoyed our stay.
The home looked just like the pictures and the home was stocked with practical things and little extras that were very useful for a stay away from home. If I need to stay in Michigan City again I definitely plan to rent this home."

2022-03-01,5,Group trip,"The home is a beauty! The host is super responsive, helpful and pleasant. There is plenty of space and 2 full bathrooms. We had no complaints at all. Although we didn‚Äôt use the hot tub, it was clean and available for our use! Five stars and worth every penny!"
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,"We has a great stay at Big Blue. Perfect spot for a girls weekend away. Hot tub felt so good with the lake effect snow coming down. Less than a mile from the Lake. 2 miles from the cute little down town. The house had everything we needed and was really comfortable. We were able to secure a late check out which made our Sunday morning very lazy. Thank you again Kirby, Taryn and Jennifer!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A great place for a family trip: enhanced clean, cozy and lovely decorated house. Close to Chicago and Lake Michigan shore. An outdoor hot tub was a pleasant bonus! Thanks for hosting us, definitely would love to come back one day"
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,What a wonderful home!!! We had a girls weekend during a snowstorm and had the most amazing time! The hot tub was so fun in the snow. The home was very clean and well stocked. We will certainly be back next year.

The beds are comfortable. Location was pretty nice, about a 5-10 minute drive to majority of what I needed. Overall I really enjoyed my stay and definitely will come back if I‚Äôm in the area again!"

2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was charming and just the right size for our two families to hang out and game our days away. The table upstairs was perfectLy sized and located for our gaming getaway next to the kitchen and hot tub for in-between rounds. It was clean with plenty of towels and necessities, and close to a supermarket for all those odds and ends so you don‚Äôt have to over pack the food stuffs. They communicated well and appropriately (not too much to little) and were very responsive with any questions. Would totally come back, and recommend to anyone looking to visit the area!"
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,"If you are looking for a spot close to the beach, stores, and restaurants this is the place for you! Not only is the location convenient, but it comes fully stocked with kitchen equipment and other amenities that were exactly what we needed.

Small, yet meaningful touches were EVERYWHERE throughout the house‚Ä¶ quite honestly, they thought of everything!
Oh, and the hot tub was Amazing‚Ä¶ yes, even while it was snowing! Let me also say, they were THEEE perfect hosts! Very responsive and even went out of their way to help resolve issues I had with my Airbnb account.
I don‚Äôt want to forget to say that the price compared to the value of the accommodations‚Ä¶ just can‚Äôt be beat!!!
We will definitely be back again!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, clean and cute"

2021-11-01,5,Group trip,"Great people to work with and super quick to respond. Fully equipped house, plenty of room! Upon arrival the house was very clean and welcoming. We had a great time and hope to go back soon!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Kirby & Taryn's place for a company retreat. The place was big enough for everyone to have some privacy and feel comfortable. The communication and check-in / check-out went very smoothly. The place was equipped well and nicely kept.
We did have an issue during our stay with regards to a smell that was uncomfortable and present in the house upon our arrival. The hosts apologized for this noting that it was likely from a dog that had been brought into the house without their knowing, and offered a small refund. Beyond the smell, the only other thing of note that differed from the listing was the view from the house. The back windows and yard border a manufacturing business, which makes the place a bit less secluded than we had anticipated."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect house. We rented it for college visits in Chicago and South Bend. The pictures are exactly what the house looks like. Its updated and very clean. The owner clearly take a lot of pride in their house.
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,It was the perfect house for our group‚Ä¶very spacious but still so cozy! Everything was so clean and accommodating! The communication was great and very helpful.

2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"Great location, very clean, and spacious. We enjoyed getting to catch up with family around the fire. The hot tub was relaxing on the cool nights with a glass of Sangria you left for us! We all look forward to staying again!"
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,This was one of the cleanest places I‚Äôve stayed. It is not huge but feels very spacious with plenty of space for more than one family to gather. Hosts were absolutely wonderful and quick to respond to any questions. We LOVED our stay.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I popped in on a last minute switch from getting rained out of a camping trip. I can say that great showers, functional kitchen and a hot tub was definitely the right call.
Clean, easy to find, super smooth check in. These guys have the air B and B thing dialed in. I was with with 2 other dads and we had so much more extra space than we needed."
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,Once you pull up to this property you'll see how nice it is! The whole place is very nice and perfect for a getaway! If you want something that's like a home away from home I'd suggest this property!!!
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,"Awesome stay,
Attended a wedding in the local area, so wanted a place for me and a family of eight. Needless to say we were very happy with Big Blue.
This location had more than ample space, with a peaceful and relaxing setting. Definitely recommend booking for a stay here."
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,Really enjoyed the house. Prompt to reply regarding any issue.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,"Big Blue is a great place to make your home base in Michigan City. Clean, well equipped, with nice spaces to hang out inside and outside. Cute decor and nice linens make it super comfy."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at Big Blue. It's a little smaller than I expected from the pictures, but even with 6 adults and 5 kids it had plenty of room to accommodate us. There is plenty of dining space, though the kitchen is small. It could use some more seating in the upstairs living room, especially since the sleeper couch has a bar in the middle that makes the middle seat unusable. The bathrooms were great and had plenty of towels and wash clothes.
Kirby, Taryn, and their assistant Jennifer were all great to work with. They are very responsive. We had to cancel our original trip due to sickness and covid tesring, and they were very gracious with rescheduling."
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,"We, along with a few other families, opted to stay here as our home base for our trip. The neighborhood is quiet, very residential. nothing ""fancy"". felt safe and was very quiet.
the house is bright blue..can't miss it. upon arrival we thought our collective families wouldn't be able to fit but the space is very thoughtfully laid out with nice upgraded touches to this older split level
communication was great and on a cloudier day with the kids, we even received recommendations on where to go nearby as an alternative to the beach. hot tub was super clean. house was very clean. overall a great stay."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"For 4 adults and 2 kids we had so much space and freedom and time to relax. The description and photos are very accurate! The hosts are super nice and super thoughtful, and respond very fast!!It is very close to Chicago so we are already planning to come back!
Place is well equipped, with great bedrooms, great bathrooms. The living spaces are awesome and hot tub is clean and is a good way to end the day!
It is at a 5 mins drive to anywhere, casino, restaurants, beaches, zoo.
I would recommend it to anyone!
Well done hosts, hope you stay in business for years to come!
Eduardo"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A very cozy and family friendly home with a lot of sleeping options. We came with two young boys and an infant so having space to move around was key. Very close to beach, zoo, restaurants etc - out of no where the Jamaican restaurant was amazing!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was very clean and perfect for our multi family gathering. It is close enough to walk to beach. Some in our party did walk, however, packing coolers and stuff, a car is needed. I would rent this house again."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved staying at this home. Pictures and description are very accurate. Clean and great layout. Easy location to get to the beach and other amenities.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a great stay! My family (my parents, brother, my husband and 2 young kids) take a trip to this area every year, and this was the best house we've stayed in thus far. Very clean, very great communication, easy check in. Everything is in good condition like the grill, bathrooms, beds. Super close to the beach, we would drive 5 minutes to Washington Park Beach almost every day ($15 parking). There's also a small playground that's walking distance (Canada Park) for our 4 year old. The hot tub was nice to have something fun to do when you cant really leave the house because of a baby. We picked blueberries at Billy Boy's (no frills, very easy) which was also very close. Overall, great stay!"
2021-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This house is very clean, comfortable, and tastefully decorated. The kitchen was well stocked. We enjoyed using the BBQ and the fire pit to make s'mores with our kids. It was walkable to the local beach, though we drove a short distance with all our beach gear. The king bed was very comfortable. The hosts responded quickly to questions. The only surprise was that the backyard fence butts up against a more industrial looking facility. I would recommend this place for future visits."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay at Big Blue! Kirby and Taryn are fabulous hosts, extremely attentive but very respectful of privacy. They knew we had a large group and asked whether we might need an early check-in, which was a very kind offer! There was a complimentary bottle of wine waiting for us upon arrival, and the entire house was very clean.
The living space was great for 8 adults. There are two living spaces inside, plus a deck out back that are great for playing board games (which we did a lot of!) or just chatting. The new hot tub is amazing and the evenings cooled off enough for us to enjoy it, even in July! There were plenty of supplies for our group, including extra bath towels, paper towel, toilet paper, trash bags, and condiments in the fridge.
The king bed was very comfortable, although the queen beds were just average. The house does back up to an industrial facility (separated by a tall fence), so there‚Äôs not much of a view, but that didn‚Äôt bother us since we spent most of our days at the dunes/beach! This is clear in the listing, but just remember that there‚Äôs no dishwasher. We purchased paper plates/plastic utensils and it didn‚Äôt end up being much of an issue for us.
Thanks for a great stay at Big Blue!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was perfect. Plenty of room, great location, very relaxing and comfortable. Our kids loved it! We‚Äôd definitely stay there again."
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"This place is FANTASTIC! We had a group of 8 friends and it had more then enough space, was very clean and was in the perfect location.
Look forward to staying here again!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Big Blue House did not disappoint. Are crew of 11 had plenty of room and had a blast just getting to tell stories at the table,hot tub, fire pit. Beds are good, kitchen big enough for a dinner for all."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay at this home. It was clean, had everything we needed, loved the updated bathrooms and bedrooms! The beds were comfy and there was plenty of blankets and pillows. The communication with the owners was easy and always had a quick response.
The hot tub was a great addition and we were able to enjoy it at night!
We were disappointed that a late check in or late check out couldn‚Äôt be accommodated.
A few things to note;
The listing mentions it but there is no dishwasher so I would recommend brining plastic plates.
The floors creak so the downstairs bedrooms/area can hear every step happening in the living/dining/kitchen area. Light sleepers should choose an upstairs room."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,LOVED THIS HOUSE! If we are ever in the area again we will be booking one of their rentals! Thank you for a wonderful stay!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved our vacation here! The house is very close to the Washington Park beach and all the places we wanted to go. I was very impressed with how quickly Kirby and Taryn communicated with us when we had questions and got back to us. We will definitely stay here again if we go to Indiana Dunes again!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was an amazing stay. The host communication was great as well!
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"We had such a great time at Kirby and Taryn's place. It was very well prepared as an Airbnb, had multiple rooms to accommodate all of my friends and I. The kitchen had everything we needed to prepare dinner, breakfast. The outdoor terrace was really inviting to spend the afternoon chatting. And their management reached out to us with instructions previous to our arrival and checked in during our stay to make sure we had everything we needed. Thank you so much! Would definitely stay here again"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great time! Plenty of space for 6 adults and 2 kids. Close to everything. Hosts were constantly in touch even before our stay and definitely during our stay.
2021-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The inside of the property is aesthetically beautiful. It was very clean, all the beds were very comfortable (except for the trundle bed) and showers were great. The kitchen was well equipped, but there is no dishwasher. Kirby and Taryn were very responsive to our inquiries.
We were not there for the beach, zoo, casino or outlet mall. They are close but not walkable. Perhaps to the beach but that would at least a 15 minute walk.
We did use the deck on the back but not the hot tub. The view from the back of the house is an industrial park.
We rented this property to attend a funeral and needed accommodations for 10 people, which suited our purpose and was more economical than a hotel."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was perfect for our large family. We enjoyed the hot tub! Very clean when we arrived. And the communication with the owners is great!
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay. Check in is super easy and it is very easy to find since the whole house is bright blue. Loved my time here.
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,We had a great stay and would come back again!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wifi is very smooth. Shower rooms are very clean. Tv for basement is big which is nice. BBQ grill is very nice. Outlet mall, Zoo, and lake are very close to Big blue."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Kirby & Taryn were very friendly and easy to communicate with. The house was just like the photos and it was in a great location!
We also appreciated the information binder that was left upon check-in, it was very helpful :)"
2021-04-01,3,Stayed with kids,"The home, in general, was beautiful. The pictures were accurate, and the location was not far from the beach, zoo, and mall. I believe this would be a perfect stay for the summer months since it's so close to the water. The outside deck is a bonus for the family to enjoy some outdoor fun. Communication between the hosts was on point, in fact, the best I've encountered. The kitchen was equipped, and everything was decorated with taste. This is a perfect place for teens since the house has upstairs and downstairs rooms; everyone can have their privacy! We ran into some unfortunate issues while staying in the home, so I am not rating this home a five-star visit. IF those issues didn't happen, this would be a five-star stay. Thanks, Jen, Kirby, & Taryn, for your care and concern during our visit."

2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a cute house and very well decorated. The rooms are spacious for having five bedrooms in that house. It‚Äôs a short drive to the lake, dunes, and restaurants. It does back up to a railroad track but we never heard the train."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home, like new, great location and value. It looks just like the photos. The beds are comfortable, the towels are lovely, there are nice TVs and kitchen and appliances are brand new. The deck is nice and we walked on the beach nearly every night. I thought it was a great value. I have high standards for design and this house has plenty of space, some decor but no sad knick-knacks. A very clean, new feeling comfortabIe and tasteful place to spend the time youre not at the lake. If you go off season, you may want to bring a humidifier, as the house has gas heat, which can be drying."

Meals on the deck and reading in the courtyard made for a relaxing long weekend. And we find the charms of Tryon Farm, with long hikes on the trails, enduring. Plus we biked up to Michiana (where the beaches are public) for a stroll along the lakeshore. Jill is a very responsive and helpful host."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property is perfect for two. Very private, quiet, and quaint."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A perfect place for couple's getaway with multiple lovely little outdoor spots to sit. That the interior is on two levels makes it seem perfectly spacious. We had a great time.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was lovely. Just as advertised. Clean and full of natural light. Lovely patio and outdoor space with ample shade and comfortable seats. Very quiet on the property. The farm is absolutely beautiful. Less than five min stroll to the fishing pond- spent most mornings there fishing and the fish were numerous. Catch and release but had a blast catching them so if you enjoy fishing I highly recommend bringing your fishing gear . Trails and farm roads are perfect for walking and being in nature. Very close to several beaches and after being in the crowds coming back to this property really felt like an oasis.

The fuzzy handcuffs on the chair next to the bed with the trilogy of 50 shades of grey was a little odd but gave us a good chuckle. In case you want to know the key was in the cuffs so they can be used and in case of a emergency there is a extra key in the kitchen üòÇüòÇüòÇ.

No matter the issue they are willing to find the solution. No matter the question, they are ready with or to find an answer. their teams they work with including maintenance and cleaning professionals are just that. Professional!!! I am so proud that we did not choose a hotel. If you're looking for a great host with a feel for at home stay, this is for you. It is so comfortable and cozy. Little house feels big. The pillows and beds, and couch are super comfy. Even the pull out bed in the basement is very comfortable. The kitchen was set up very nice. Things you would think of forgetting they have ready for you!! The only thing I forgot to bring from home this time was lotion. My one year old whom does not take very well to new places/ people felt right at home and loved to venture around. Thank you for the wonderful experience."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We met friends here for the holiday weekend. Instructions were very clear and made getting in easy. It was well-maintained and extremely clean. Love the decor (bedspreads and plants) TVs were easy to use. Sound machines in each room. The couches were comfortable. Everything we needed, from the bathroom to Wi-Fi to the kitchen, was provided. The downstairs was a great place for the kids to play as well as well as the adults.
While there, we were looking for local light shows for Christmas and as well as adjusting the thermostat, which initially wasn't staying at the temp we wanted. Our hosts were quick to reply and give us the information they had and assist with the thermostat.
It was very quiet and peaceful. They had communicated there were train tracks close by, but honestly, even those were not loud. Most of the time we didn't notice."

Provided beach towels, a bottle of wine, oil, salt, pepper, and seasoning, coffee, shampoo, conditioner, body wash‚Ä¶all the little things that are so much easier if they‚Äôre just there. Those little details made our trip so much simpler.
I like their minimalist checkout rules where we weren‚Äôt running around sweating trying to check everything off the list before 10 am.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Very clean, great communication. Perfect sized for our family of four. The hosts made great use of the space when decorating. A couple things to note: bring an eye mask if you‚Äôre a light sleeper as sunrise shines through the blinds. Also, only one bedroom has a ceiling fan so you‚Äôll have to turn the AC down low at night to keep cool or bring a small fan with you. Otherwise it was a fantastic stay!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cute little house that is easily accessible to stores, beach, etc. Communication was great; there was a small issue with ants when I first arrived and within minutes a solution was proposed. No one noticed the train sound, so don‚Äôt let that deter you. Overall, a good experience and the hosts seem really great."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The four of us had an amazing stay in this home. It was exactly as pictured and less than 10 min from the nearest beach. The host left behind sweet touches that made our nights stay even more appealing. Highly recommend!

The house was well organized, well appointed, very nicely decorated, and all the appliances worked well. It was great to not have to worry about the little guys making too much noise, like we would have in a hotel, and there was space for them to play with their presents from Grandma. The basement was perfect for checking out the new remote control car!!! It's also nice to be able to do our own cooking, rather than restaurants all the time. This was a great stay, thanks to Kirby & Taryn!"
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,"We stayed here while we were in Michigan City for my mother's funeral, and I can't express how much we appreciated a home environment to decompress and grieve. So much better than a cold hotel room.
This home was perfect for our family of 5 adults because it gave us space to rest, gather to talk, fix meals and eat together.
Kirby & Taryn have thought of so many details to add comfort. The beds are very comfortable, and they offer extra blankets and towels.

And the place is SPOTLESS...one of the cleanest homes we have ever stayed in!
We would definitely return to this location!"

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the cleanest Airbnb we have ever stayed in. Great location and everything we needed. Lots of thoughtful touches and very caring and communicative!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for us! The beds are comfy (I had a white noise machine in my room), the living area and kitchen are well equipped and it is close to some great places to eat, a coffee roaster and winery."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable, great location. Would love to come back."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Was close to all the things we wanted to enjoy. Zoo, beach, outlet malls, and Indiana Dunes. Cute, remodeled, clean home. Comfy beds. Plenty of towels. Left all kinds of goodies and unexpected extras. Also, messaged me after check in throughout trip to make sure we had all that we needed. Will definitely be back. My kids had so much fun."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and comfortable place. They provided bathroom toiletries and laundry soap as well as coffee. Great communication and very easy to check in and out.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cutest little house in a great location! Close to downtown and the shore. House is just precious, with attention to detail in each room. We stayed for three nights, and felt right at home. I appreciated the ‚Äúno shoes in house‚Äù policy, and the cleanliness of the house. (We had some really sketchy experiences with some airbnbs in the past, and so chose this house almost exclusively on the cleanliness rating; it didn‚Äôt disappoint!)
Things we loved: comfy, clean furniture in living room. Lots of space for the three of us to each do our own thing if needed. The basement is such a nice space, and I‚Äôd love to bring our parents or some friends with us next time. I appreciated the shampoo/conditioner provided, as it was one less thing for me to pack. We loved the location, as it was close to the shore, and easy access to other towns (Valparaiso, Chesterton, etc). We were able to explore the area and be home in no time.
Things to consider: yes, there is a train nearby. You can hear the whistle, but I actually liked it. I didn‚Äôt have to use the noise machines provided in each room, it wasn‚Äôt that loud. And we were used to the noise by the second night. The house smells nice, which I love, but my hubby is sensitive to smells, so just a heads up for anyone like him. It was mainly the fabric softener, nothing overpowering or like plug-ins or room spray.
Tl;dr: highly recommend, great house, room for all, very clean and comfy, close to beach and shopping."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay near Indiana Dunes! Home was very clean, cozy, and cute. Absolutely no issues with the process or stay. Nice beds, couches, driveway and walkways. You can hear occasional trains but they're not loud or bothersome. Great home, hosts, and stay!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for a quick getaway.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,4th year of going to Michigan City for a girls trip. Kirby and Taryn‚Äôs place is well put together and clean. Beds are comfy and lots of room to chill and relax. Definitely better than the hotels in the area. We have gone to three different hotels years prior and their place is a thousand times better! Highly recommend!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location, very affordable, was as advertised."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a good location for my crew. We were within 10-20 minutes driving distance to everything we did. The beds were comfortable and we felt like we were right at home! The hosts were also very easy to reach, very helpful, and so so kind. The house had towels and shampoo available for use too. Each room also had a sound machine (white noise) which was the BEST while traveling with 2 toddlers. The house isn‚Äôt toddler friendly but it was easy enough to move the glass decor to a higher location. All in all we had no issues with our toddlers exploring this home. Very smooth & easy stay!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house is more beautiful in person. It is very close to everything. You will find everything you need at the house. Very clean and comfortable.

2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was exactly what the pictures show! Very clean and well stocked. I appreciate all the modern furnishing and decorations : ) My family of 4 really enjoyed staying there. The train noise did wake me up a couple of times on the first night, but I got used to it and didn't hear it on the 2nd & 3rd night. A perfect and cozy place for a little weekend getaway!"
2021-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We had a good time, everything was as described and the place was so cute, clean, and wonderful. The hosts were excellent communicators, responded quickly, had great tips and suggestions to make the most of our trip, and overall very sweet. The only downside to this place was the location: it is right by a busy road and the train tracks and the train goes by at all hours (even during the night) so the noise levels were bothersome for our family, as we are all light sleepers. Other than that, highly recommend!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice place! Conveniently located to the dunes, restaurants, and Michigan."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect choice for our long weekend getaway. We were two couples looking to take a short vacation to explore a new town.

2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"Very clean, great space, and the pictures are exactly what is pictured! The king bed is on the firm side but did sleep well every night. Just outside of the busy streets, but close to both Michigan city, and New Buffalo for the tourist attractions.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family of four found this home to be perfect for our stay in Michigan City!
The home was clean and inviting. The beds were comfortable and the sound machines were helpful. My daughters loved the foosball table, Google Home (for impromptu dance parties) and sand toys. We made good use of the fire pit and we also really enjoyed that the kitchen was fully equipped to make meals. One of my girls was even able to make a cake!
In addition to the feeling ‚Äúat home‚Äù in this space, we were happy to find that we were close to many activities. Billy Boy‚Äôs Blueberry Barn, Washington Park Bach, and the downtown area of Michigan City were all new adventures for us. My husband and I loved Fiddlehead and Zorn Brewery. Ice cream at Bubbles was our daughters‚Äô favorite spot. Day trips to Indiana Dunes Park, Sawyer, and St Joseph were also possible because of the great location of Pottowattamie Place.
So many great memories were made!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have 3 young children and this was our first family vacation! What a great experience! Upon finding out that a rocking chair would make our stay better, Taryn went and BOUGHT ONE! Let me tell you, that spoke volumes to us! In addition, there was a sweet note, some snacks, mints and some INCREDIBLE local red wine left for us! The house was so nice and everything from the comfort of the beds to the simple, yet tasteful decor just added to our experience! The basement was a perfect bedroom for our 2 older boys to run, play, and relax at night watching tv. I would highly recommend this host!"
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"We had a great stay at Kirby and Taryn‚Äôs place! The house was exactly as pictured, very cute, very comfy, and very clean!

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a super cute home that is conveniently located if you plan to visit the Indiana Sand Dunes. You will need to drive into town but the house is clean, comfortable, and the hosts communicate all the details you need to access the house and visit the area. I would want to stay here again if I came back to this area."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location and well worth the cost
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"This is a great little house, located super close to multiple beaches. We chose the location for easy access to New Buffalo and it worked perfectly for us. (If it's your first time in the area and you're a burger fan, we recommend Redamak's; going there again was kinda the impetus for our entire trip this time.) There are plenty of other things to do in the area too, which is nice. Check-in was easy, along with communication, and the welcome bottle of wine was a nice touch. If we return to the area we'll definitely be looking into staying again!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a gem. It's an upstairs apartment in an older house (stairs that are a little narrow and steep like they had in those days) and is absolutely beautiful. It has a gorgeous kitchen and a lovely dining/living room area, and the bedroom is nice as well. The bathroom was clean and had shampoo, conditioner, body wash and towels all ready to go. It's near a good amount of restaurants and only a couple of miles from the beach. I highly recommend Zorn's Brewing for dinner and Dune Billies for breakfast! We would definitely stay again while visiting family in the future."

The cons are that there are several restaurants that are not open until after memorial day weekend. However, there were still some eating establishments close by.
We didn‚Äôt use the bikes or hot tub, but glad the options were available. The kitchen was great! Lots of working space and plenty of pots, pans and knives available. The water pressure and temperature in the shower was great! It was a great place for a getaway."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was such a cute little house!! It was peaceful and in a calm area even with the school close.
It‚Äôs close to the beach and many other places or you can just stay in the quiet house.
It was relaxing, clean, and comfortable.
Courtney offers everything you need and more! Courtney was responsive and quick.
Definitely want to come back!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the best girls trip we‚Äôve been on! Super cute house and neighborhood. Convenient location, we were able to check everything off of our activity list, as well as relax and enjoy the amenities of the Airbnb. This is the perfect place for a relaxing and fun trip!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The stay was great! The house is very clean, it was a very short walk to the beach, and the hot tub was wonderful. She also communicated very quickly and was super helpful with any questions I had, both before and during the stay. We will definitely come back. One thing I would suggest is to bring your own bag of ice if you are planning on having multiplesnow cones. They do have an ice tray full of ice, but if you're not patient and want multiple snow cones, bring your own ice like we did. We greatly enjoyed the stay."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful gateway in Michigan City with a bunch of amenities!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had to come to Indiana for work in a couple surrounding cities and we landed at Courtney‚Äôs place. The check in was very easy and the house was clean. The sun room was a very nice area to sit and do some computer work. Beds were very comfortable and the hot tub was great! My daughter loved the snow cone machine and the near by playground! Nice place!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful, cozy house. It was easy to feel at home here."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cozy, peaceful place to stay! We stayed here for our anniversary as a mini getaway for the weekend and couldn‚Äôt have been happier with how it went!

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Clean, clear instructions."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Charming and comfortable. We loved it. Would definitely recommend.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a lovely stay at this property during a family reunion weekend in Michigan City. House is spacious with charming touches and a nice find when many other rentals in the area were much more space than we needed. This house was just perfect! Only thing I would have asked for is a toaster. You can toast English muffins in a broiler but it‚Äôs sun-optimal. :)
Thank you for a great stay!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved this Airbnb. The cute beachy and serene theme throughout! The hot tub out back inside a private fencing. The house was just gorgeous. The kitchen was amazing. The sunroom area was so gorgeous for coffee in the morning. Everything about this place said ‚Äúrelaxation.‚Äù The little town of Michigan City had some awesome eateries within walking distance of this Airbnb. The lighthouse was only a five minute drive away. It was only a 15 minute drive to Indiana Dunes park. I can‚Äôt say enough how much we loved this place! I would highly recommend. The coffee bar set up was cute too. And the beds were so comfortable I didn‚Äôt want to be out of mine. We used this for a mom‚Äôs relaxation getaway and boy did I feel relaxed! Thank you Courtney!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Would def stay here again. Loved everything about it
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very pleasant stay in this attractively furnished and comfortable house. The hot tub was a nice feature. The host was helpful, welcoming and proactive with communications. We really enjoyed our stay!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Courtney‚Äôs place was great! The king sized bed was SO comfy (need to know the brand!). The place was clean and cozy. Great location.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Courtney was quick to respond and happy to welcome us in the Airbnb app. She was a gracious host, and the house was the perfect place. After we settled in, we felt at home. The kitchen was just right for preparing our food and well planned. The accommodations were several, and some were above grade, i.e., the towels, hot tub, dishes, and the bikes. We used them all. We will return when we can."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful weekend at Courtney‚Äôs place! The bikes were a great addition so we could bike all around Michigan city. Would stay again!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home was perfect for our small girls trip, riding the bikes to the beach and then coming back and jumping in the hot tub felt like a true vacation. Courtney was a great host, very responsive."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was beautiful, beds super comfy, very clean. Peaceful neighborhood and near the beach. We had a lovely break."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Excellent stay. Clean. Comfortable linens. Plenty of towels. Safe environment for young kids. Playground across the street and walkable beach were excellent bonuses.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Tastefully decorated home with plenty of space and great amenities. We loved the new hot tub, made s‚Äômores around the fire pit, had coffee in the sunroom, and road the bikes to Washington Park and the lighthouse. Lots of extra touches were a bonus - flavored syrups for coffee, nice soaps and lotions, snacks for the kids. We drove to the beach (close by but lots of items) and found street parking. We enjoyed being in a quiet neighborhood with a large yard and old trees. Definitely recommend!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family of four loved our stay at Sugar Babe Beach Retreat! The house was perfect and exactly as pictured/described.
The layout, fenced in backyard yard, and minimalist decor were ideal for my young kids. As a family, we enjoyed the hot tub, playing board games in the sun room, walking to the beach, and playing at the nearby school playground. My husband and I both raved about the beds. They were extremely comfortable.
Courtney was extremely helpful and had shampoo and toilet paper dropped off early on in our stay once she found out they were out.
Without hesitation I would recommend this home to other families looking for a quiet, walkable beach getaway."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I love Michigan City, and the Lake Hills neighborhood, and this house was perfect for my boys and me. It was charming, and well appointed. The hot tub was a great way for my sons and I to relax after a long day at the beach. Courtney was very responsive and friendly. If I could give her 6 stars, I would!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very walkable to the beach! Very clean and awesome private backyard. Has some beach supplies and a little wagon which was helpful. Everything we needed in the kitchen & bathroom. Beds were super comfortable. We used the 3 seasons room as a bedroom and it worked really well and was comfortable. Thank you!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Love the place. Walking distance to the beach. Place was cozy, had everything we needed. We did reach out for paper towels as we ran out of it and they deliver them fairly quick. My daughter loved the snow cone machine.
We definitely enjoyed our girls get away."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My family had a great time at this beach house - the space was comfortable and clean, we had everything we needed. I love the back patio room! The short walk to the beach is just right to get the blood moving."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"House was as described and host was quick to respond to texts. We realized we were short some towels soon after arriving and more were delivered in less than an hour. (We do wish we would have had more bath towels so we wouldn't have had to do a wash every day.) We loved having beach chairs and beach towels available to use. There was food in the fridge when we arrived which we have never experienced before in a rental and we found a few ants in the kitchen each day, but we alerted the host and was told they would be treated for right away."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice place to stay. We enjoyed our visit.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great house, great location, and very well appointed place with everything we needed. Really, we thought this place couldn‚Äôt be beat for the price for what you get. You can walk to a more private beach in just minutes, or drive to the city beach access (our preferred option) in just a couple minutes.
The house itself was very well appointed and lots of space, especially with the sunroom in the back. We loved having the hot tub out back, as well as the grill and fire pit. The beds were nice and comfortable, the kitchen had everything we needed, and the bathroom was nice as well.
Host was very responsive and gave clear instructions on check in and check out and was very easy to work with. Would definitely stay again (and in fact, already booked for next year thanks to our experience)!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place for a beach location. Walkable distance to a nice public beach and lots of good restaurant options close by. Great host and quickly responsive. I would definitely stay here again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice place near good food and beaches.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Super place! Don‚Äôt hesitate to book this if you are looking for a nice and clean place not too far from the beach.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,this house was perfect for our family of 5. my favorite thing was the delightful king size bed. soo comfy!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a clean, modern house! Everything that we needed was already furnished, including a wagon and sand toys! Communication was great and they were so easy to work with. House was within walking distance to the beach. Will stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time! Very good location, walkable to the beach and zoo. Easy drive to the outlet mall and New Buffalo. We really enjoyed the sunroom at the back of the house."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A really sweet, comfortable house. It was clean, well-appointed and spacious. We loved the hot tub and the sun room. And the beds were pillow-soft and comfortable!! A great stay!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Courtney‚Äôs place was excellent! We stayed two nights and had a great time in Michigan City. Highly recommend.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very comfortable, sweet space. Would definitely come back!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This such a beautiful, quiet, relaxing place to stay. I came with two girlfriends for time away from our (precious) children, and it was all we hoped it would be. Long soaks in the hot tub, early coffee on the back deck, and a fun night in with grilled chicken, corn, and board games. We also enjoyed a delicious meal at Leed's Public House, fed birds at the Washington Zoo, spent a chilly 30 minutes on the beach (we were going hell or high water), and made some great finds at the shops on Franklin St.
The house was super clean and comfortable and has very reasonable check out requests. We had a great time and plan to come back not only with each other, but with our families. Thanks for a great mini vacation!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay and plan to bring our family again next year!
Thank you for your communication and for creating a great space to relax and go to the beach! It had everything we needed from beach towels to utensils and the washer and dryer were such a perk!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed the beach chairs, sand toys, and wagon as well as directions to walk to the beach. We thought the home was very clean! We really enjoyed using the sunroom. We were happy with the cleanliness of the house! The house is in a 5 min distance to shopping, restaurants, and a cool coffee shop! It is within 20 min to Indiana Dunes National Park (which is where we went)
Additional: We went out back to check the hot tub and we thought it kind of smelled funny and didn‚Äôt look right. This didn‚Äôt bother us because we weren‚Äôt planning on using it. I also didn‚Äôt say anything to the host because it didn‚Äôt impact our stay and didn‚Äôt want to bother them.
The sheets are superb on the beds, but the pillows are small and really soft - so may want to bring your own pillow if your picky (We aren‚Äôt)
May want to bring additional throws or blankets!
Overall a great stay and perfectly fit our needs for what we wanted and expected and planned to do!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was our favorite Airbnb yet. Perfect space for our family of three. Walking distance to the beach and a couple of restaurants and a short drive to Indiana Dunes NP. We loved the fenced back yard and the king bed was comfortable. It‚Äôs a quiet neighborhood. The hot tub and snow cone machine were nice features. We had a great stay!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location for close walkable access to beach. Our two young boys took full advantage of the playground a block away. Would stay again, thanks."
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,I had some problems with the wifi. The host clarified that it had never happened before and refunded me a partial refund seeing as I only stayed for one night rather than two. Very kind and thoughtful. The place was beautiful and serene.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was initially confused by the two thermostats, but it got figured out. The house and beds were comfortable, and the kitchen well stocked with dishes, flatware, pots and pans."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a fantastic time!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was great for a girls weekend. The weather was nice so spent the majority of our time on screened-in porch and in the hot tub. The decor was super cute, too! Michigan City is the halfway point for my best friend and I so we will definitely book again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay here. The house is really lovingly and nicely decorated, you immediately feel comfortable. Everything was neat and clean, there were even fresh flowers on the tables. One highlight was the conservatory from where you could watch the birds and squirrels in the garden. The area was quiet and without much traffic, so you could safely walk or by bike to the beach. There was coffee available, which tasted great and the whirl pool was great too."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cannot wait to come back!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place to stay. Plenty of room for our small family to relax on a week away.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place for a weekend get away!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second time and definitely won't be our last time. We LOVE how relaxing this home is. We love walking the neighborhood down to the lake. We also love being able to sit and read (or for me, to finish writing my book). Michigan City has plenty of places to go it IF we're wanting to get out. BUT if you're needing to rest and relax, this is THE spot."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect short get away. Great communication, short bike ride to the beach, house was clean and everything was great. If your looking for an affordable place close to the beach with a great host this is it."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place for a weekend getaway. It's walking distance to the beach and near many restaurants, wineries, and breweries. The neighborhood was so quiet and sitting out in the hot tub each night was so relaxing. The bed is extremely comfortable and Courtney really makes the place feel like home."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our third time visiting Courtney's place during the dead of Chicago winter. It's a great spot to escape the city for a long weekend, enjoy the hot tub, work on a puzzle, and watch some TV. The house has everything you need, and the sun room gets beautiful light. We love it here!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay! Really great rental.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Courtney‚Äôs place was the perfect location for a weekend getaway that was convenient to many of the restaurants and watering holes we love in the Michigan City/New Buffalo area. The house was beautifully decorated and homey, and the neighborhood is quiet. We especially loved the coffee bar! We had a minor issue after checking in, and Courtney was very responsive and had someone come right away to fix it. We will definitely check to see if the house is available for future visits!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved our stay here! The house is so cozy and was perfect for a couples getaway. The hosts had great recommendations for the local area too and made us feel right at home. We had a tiny issue with the thermostat when we first arrived but the hosts were super responsive and came over right away to get it fixed. Would definitely stay here again the next time we‚Äôre in the area!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was lovely and our stay was amazing. The kitchen was well stocked with pots and pans and baking dishes and cookware, cleaning supplies so we could clean up our messes were easily found, all their instructions were easy to find and follow, they included a wonderful resource of local restaurants and things to do, and there were little luxuries like nice lotion and a snack bin that really made all the difference. I‚Äôve already recommended the place to several friends! It‚Äôs a beautiful little retreat and my partner and I can‚Äôt wait to go back in the summer when we can go to the beach. An amazing stay all around."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved Courtney‚Äôs place! It was very clean and relaxing. We loved the location it was close to the dunes and many yummy restaurants. We also loved the hot tub!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"ideal location near pier, food and zoo!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriends and I stayed here for a weekend getaway and it was just perfect. The house was not only clean and perfect for our group, it was decorated very well with every thought given to the guests. We loved the back porch that had it's own extra heater. The kitchen was more equipped with everything needed (including food staples/condiments) than I'd ever seen before. Some of us took a walk to the beach which was nearby. But we otherwise stayed in during our time together. The hot tub was icing on the cake! Speaking of cake, we forgot to bring candles with us for a b-day celebration and I reached out to Courtney to ask about the closest place to get some and she offered to bring us some!!!!! And delivered it right away!!!! We were so appreciative. To be serviced like that, was above and beyond. We are hoping that we can do this trip annually, next time in the warmer months so we can take advantage of being so close to the lakefront beach."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our second time at one of Courtney‚Äôs places for a quick hot tub getaway, close to the beach and hiking at the Indiana Dunes. Exactly as described, would stay again!"
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,We had a great time!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect for our family of four! Looks exactly like the listing - super cute decor, very clean, comfortable beds, great space, and nice touches (coffee pods and syrups, snow cone maker, games, bikes, cozy blankets, etc.). We loved the hot tub! The hosts were very friendly and communicative. Literally everything you would want in an Airbnb. 10/10 recommend!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was as described
Nice amenities for the small stuff such as coffee pods we brought the wrong kind and she had them available . We have used Airbnb many times. It‚Äôs nice to see condiments and spices for our use though we didn‚Äôt use them. So much nicer and comfortable than renting a hotel room."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful house. Great place to stay.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect get away! So relaxing and exactly as described! Very clean and so many amazing perks!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is by far the best airbnb I‚Äôve stayed at! The place is EXACTLY as described and then some! So many thoughtful touches.. check in/out was easy, the bed was SO comfortable.. honestly the perfect, relaxing getaway.. shower pressure is amazing.. no issues at all!! Would 30/10 recommended!!!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the cleanest airbnb I've ever stayed in, bar none. It was light-filled, comfortable and had tiny touches that made it homey, like the syrup for coffee and the bikes (that I didn't use, but would have in the summer). The hot tub was lovely to relax in, and the bed was super comfortable. The neighborhood was private, and felt safe and peaceful. It was a quick walk to the beach, and I can imagine in the summer it would be nice to be a quick jaunt away from the beach-front properties and the noise that they'd entail. I'll be recommending this to friends who visit the area."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house was beautiful and Courtney was such a great, responsive host! So many cute and thoughtful touches. The house was also in a great location, close to downtown and the outlet malls, which were so nice."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Super cute, super clean place.
We just wanted a quick weekend get away from Chicago. This was perfect - an easy hour an a half.
The weather was pretty chilly - it‚Äôs Nov - to be expected. That didn‚Äôt stop us from using the hot tub and snow cone machine!
We hit the outlet mall, casino, escape room, laser tag and a few great places to eat.

Would def consider coming back.
Checkin and out was easy, flawless communication with host."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Courtney and Lora have the perfect stay for anyone looking for a comfortable, cute, and perfectly located spot. We loved the hot tub! Beds are very comfortable.. Courtney coordinated a surprise engagement for me which was also an extremely kind and amazing gesture! We look forward to staying again in the future."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really great place. Very cool design and lots of spaces to hang out. It has two bed rooms but there is a pull out couch too. So lots of places to sleep. The walk to the beach is real easy. There is a lot to do around the air bnb too. Outlet Shops, restaurants, casino, and lighthouse museum are all a five minute drive. Great location!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great spot. Easy access to so many great places, excellent food and a unique National park!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice spot for a getaway. Clean, cozy, and short walk to the beach."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"easy comfortable stay for our getaway. the house was decorated with cozy artsy touches and we felt right at home. this place gets a lot of lovely natural light. we felt we had a lot of privacy at this location both inside, and outside to enjoy the hot tub. soft comfy beds. we felt extra comfortable with home touches like a well stocked bathroom, and kitchen. the location is also great. we like it cold, and we really enjoyed visiting the beach and seeing the sunset and fall colors. lots of great local restaurants and shops nearby."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here! It was very clean, comfortable, and the hot tub was awesome! I highly recommend staying here!"

We loved the sunroom and spent most of our time in there. Definitely enjoyed the fire pit as well. We found lots of fun things to do in the area. We‚Äôll be back!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really truly one of the best AirBnB‚Äôs that I have stayed at. Listing is spot on accurate! I have had more than one surprise bad stay at some other AirBnB‚Äôs but not here! I don‚Äôt have a single complaint! My only advice is not to be startled when you open the door and you‚Äôre in the garage! That is the correct entry point! And as I said I‚Äôve had a few bad AirBnB experiences and in my mind I thought I was going to walk straight into the house so when I saw garage my brain for 2 secs was like ‚Äúoh no!‚Äù All in all this place is just super great!
The pros:
King bed is sooooo comfy!!
The hot tub was awesome!
Very clean
Plenty of room
Entire house to yourself (no shared walls).
Close enough to walk to the beach

We were there for a few days to get away from home but still work. The wifi was great and there was plenty of space to work.
I would absolutely go back to this or any other place Katie had."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This small two-bedroom house on a corner lot was perfect for my husband and me. It was immaculate. The kitchen and eating area are very large and well-stocked. The bathroom and laundry room are good- sized and also well-stocked. There is a small deck with two grills for good weather (which unfortunately we didn‚Äôt have). The decor is very pleasing, and everything seems so new that I‚Äôm sure it must have been recently renovated. The neighborhood was quiet for the 3 nights that we were there. Beautiful blinds on all the windows gave us privacy. The queen-sized mattress in the master bedroom is extremely comfortable. It was easy to communicate with the hostess. I really can‚Äôt think of anything to complain about at this airbnb."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Deanna‚Äôs place is wonderful! I had never been to. Michigan City before. Staying in this cute cotttage was completely comfortable. It was easy to find and access. My daughter and I walked 5 minutes to have excellent Jamaican food at Cool Runnings and a lovely breakfast close by. Both are about a 5 minute walk. Both were clearly popular with summer visitors! We also walked down to the beach. I complain about long walks, but this walk was very enjoyable! The neighborhood in the area is friendly and easy to explore. The beach has plenty of soft sand and a great view of the lighthouse.
My daughter and I took the South Shore Rail into Chicago over Memorial Day weekend and enjoyed watching the stops along the way. It‚Äôs an easy train ride and gives access to great parts of Chicago.
I have always traveled to New York, but I have fallen in love with Lake Michigan and the cottage at which Deanna warmly hosted us!
Loved the handle getting out of the shower!
and the cottag"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Deanna cottage in Michigan City stay met our needs and expectations,  close distance to city Center and good restaurants and Chicago in less than 1 hr was perfect to my needs. The place is in a quiet neighborhood it is well kept,  clean , quiet with everything for everyday cooking.
Although not needed , Deanna was always pending for anything needed,  access is easy."
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"We enjoyed an amazing five-night stay at Deanna's house, which is not only cozy, beautiful, and well-equipped but also thoughtfully arranged.
The space effortlessly accommodated our group of six and given the cooler temperatures this time of year, we creatively utilized the extra bed from the sunroom, placing it in the living room along with the sofa, ensuring a comfortable night's rest for the two of us.
Our host provided us with excellent recommendations for nearby attractions.
Also, the strategic location of the house, conveniently just an hour from Chicago, made our stay even more memorable.
We express our appreciation to Deanna for her hospitality and understanding, especially for granting us additional time during check-out. We highly recommend this charming Airbnb to anyone seeking a cozy and well-appointed retreat."
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"Enjoyed our stay, thanks for letting us check out late with no charge. I have never met a host like you before! We had the best experience!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,I parked my semi in the back. From then on was like coming home to grandmas house for real. House had everything. Comfortable from beginning to end. Woke the house up to the smell of thanksgiving dinner ‚ù§Ô∏èüòä. I‚Äôll definitely be back.
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We loved the home. It was nice and clean and had everything we needed. The only suggestion I would make is to hook up the master bedroom tv to some sort of cable or hook up a smart one. Location was nice and host easy to contact.
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,This was a delightful and immaculately clean cottage. It was perfect for our weekend stay with our daughter and two grandsons.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Deanna is a wonderful host, she was extremely helpful with everything. Her place is cozy, and has everything a family needs!!! Thank you so much Deanna!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay while working in Michigan City.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Deanna‚Äôs house was truly awesome.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cozy, comfy little spot very close to the beach. We'll definitely come back and stay here again when the weather is better!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Excellent, quite and clean location a few minutes drive from the Indiana dunes NP. The house was clean and self sufficient. We were a group of 4 people and had a very comfortable night after hiking all day in the national park. Deanna was responsive and allowed flexible checkin and checkout plans."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Deanna is a wonderful host and what a fantastic spot! Feels like you're home the moment you enter. Neighborhood is super cute and extremely walkable to the beach, zoo, a charming lighthouse, marina, food (Cool Runnings, WOW!). Eclectic shopping district on Franklin St just a 5 minute drive. (My purse strap broke during my visit so thanks ReNew Consignment Shop!)
Perfect Birthday getaway! Look forward to visiting again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy little cottage. Feels very inviting like visiting Grandma. Deanna is a great communicator and very responsive. Looking forward to our next trip to the area!!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful Labor Day weekend stay with the kids!! Walking distance to the beach (3 blocks), zoo and Washington Park. Great little neighborhood. Cozy beach home with everything that you need and very quirky. Felt very much at home. Deanna went above and beyond with communication and flexibility! Thank you!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful stay. The place had everything stocked for things needed for the stay. Very responsive host who allowed flexible check in. The lake near by was also wonderful. Thank you!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent communication and thank you.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Booked super last minute to see the northern lights ‚Äî like booked two hours before check in. Anna responded immediately and worked with me to make sure it happened! The house is a short walk to the lake and we got a beautiful show.
The description of the home was super accurate. Great instructions. Thank you, Anna!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was everything we wanted while visiting relatives. The location is so peaceful, serene, and quiet. The house is really wonderful.
The ad says it is in the middle of being renovated, and there are lots of updates -- please know it doesn't feel like a construction zone at all. It feels like a home! This is such a departure from many airbnbs that feel impersonal and all decorated with similar cheap d√©cor.
This is someone's vacation home, where there is a lot of love, and it feels that way.
The kitchen is INCREDIBLY well supplied, we had no problem cooking anything we wanted, everything we needed was there. Not just a few pots and pans, but really high quality pots, pans, tools and appliances, etc.
Sure, it's an older home with some character, but for us, that made it even nicer to stay in. We had ZERO problems at all, and got to enjoy all the amenities that this home offers.
I would not hesitate to stay here again. I feel honored to give the first review."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The location of this place is amazing. It is right next to a walking path straight to the beach and the path has padding so you can easily pull your wagon along it. The unit is small as you can see from the description but worked well for our family of four for a few days to hang out on the beach. For the price I don‚Äôt think it can be beat. My only recommendation would be that they add a few more kitchen essentials like baking sheets/pans and a measuring cup. And perhaps some of the basics like salt, pepper, oil would be nice. And an extra blanket or two. But those are just a nice plus. We very much enjoyed our stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Immaculate cute home not far from the beach.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I loved the attention to detail at this Airbnb. When I went to cook, there were good utensils and pans. When I went to wash dishes, there was soap, sponges and a drying rack. When I needed extra blankets, I found them easily. Loved it and the area right around the Airbnb is super cute."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough about this place. It is very well described. It's perhaps the cleanest place I've ever stayed - and that's really saying something. In my experience AIrbnb locations are generally very clean. The furniture and kitchen supplies are fairly simple but very comfortable and serviceable. The equipment and supplies for little ones and games for all ages are excellent. The location is tremendous. We saw lots of deer and wild turkeys. It's very private for its location - a short and easy walk to the beach. A short part of it is a narrow, fairly steep path through the woods so you couldn't take a stroller or wagon that way. The only thing that disturbed the quiet was the daytime hum of the nearby school's utilities. It's a short walk to two local restaurants, Cool Runnings and Dune Billie's. Dune Billie's is an outstanding breakfast and lunch spot with wonderful food and friendly service. We definitely hope to come back!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great long weekend stay. Super close to the Lake and food (Dune Billies was a 10 minute walk each morning for coffee and a blueberry muffin). Would definitely stay again (hopefully longer next time).
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Didn‚Äôt spend 2 much time in the cottage. Was outside the whole time. Had a good time.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great little house just a few minutes from the beach. Home was exactly as presented and the shuffle board table was a fun touch. The beach trail was easy to find and very walkable for our family. It was a little too rugged to pull our wagon so we did drop that off with the truck then walk back but it was an easy trip! Would definitely stay here again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was very very clean and had so many thoughtful touches. We enjoyed the game room and cooked most of our meals in the kitchen, but grilled two nights. The beach was beautiful and clean. There were towels, beach chairs and beach toys at the house. We saw deer and turkeys walk by the house in the morning and evening! It was a great location and comfortable stay."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Awesome place. my sisters and I went here for a girls weekend. the accommodations were great! Close to everything we wanted. house spotless. Thought of everything! will do it again! Thank you
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The stay was fantastic! The walk to the beach is very close and they even provided more than enough chairs and towels for everyone headed to the beach. Highly recommend!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"very nice and peaceful, the deer where right in the yard it was pretty cool. good location and very clean"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Spent a long weekend with my wife and daughters. Had a great stay and enjoyed the short walk to the beach.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Overall good place for the price and location. We stayed as we were heading to Sandusky Ohio.
Location was great for our family of 4. Recommend Hesston train and New Buffalo.
We would stay here again if passing through. Worth it for price and location."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great little place go to the beach! Had everything we needed and check-in was easy. We didn‚Äôt attempt the hike to the beach because we had a toddler and wagon in tow, but we did see multiple people walking in that direction. The deer and turkeys around the house in the morning and evening were beautiful. Would definitely stay again!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The trail to the beach is a little bit hidden, but Bob & Antionette give great details on how to find it. The house description and pictures are 100% accurate. Clean, great linens, stocked kitchen items, beach items available. This is our second time to the ""yellow house"" and we know we will be back again. Highly recommend.
*Also, since it has some woods surrounding it, every morning we saw deer out the front window while enjoying our coffee. This was big excitement with the kids!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and short walk to beach! Just what we needed
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our family of 5 loved this house! Everything was provided for our stay and the extra amenities were awesome! Great communication with the host.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay. It was quiet and cozy and had everything we needed. We did drive to the beach because our beach wagon did not fit on the trail, but it was a very short drive! Our kids loved the game room. We hope to stay here again!"
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay. Close to the beach! The owners sent great details for open and close procedures. My recommendation to future guests would be to bring your own pillow and shampoo/conditioner!
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"Quaint, cozy house close to the beach. We enjoyed our stay here! The house is small but we made it work. We loved seeing the deer and being close to the beach!!!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Adorable & clean place to stay close to the beach! Our kids loved the trail to the beach! The attached garage made it perfect for our beach wagon and toys! So many extras in the home for a fun and convenient stay!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Excellent place to stay
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful home. Had everything we needed, and so close to the beach, casino, and bars! Would love to go again :)"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Stay was great. No issues.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great
2022-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,The house was very clean.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect spot in a quiet neighborhood within walking distance to the beach. Cool little hidden trail on the way. Very clean home with everything we needed.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Within minutes of a ton of stuff to do.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Clean house
Close to the beach, great for a small family like ours. Highly recommended"
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,"The front porch was perfect for hanging out at the house and morning coffee. The beach walk was very easy to get to, but we did drive down to drop our things off at the beach. Location was great! The house had everything we needed! Thank you!!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Adorable place. Loved the beach theme. Perfect location. Only a few minutes from the beach.
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"This place is right in the middle of everything! Perfect for a weekend getaway whether you have kids or not or a group it was everything we needed! Walking distance to the beach and restaurants. Located a couple minutes from Blue chip casino, a zoo and shopping! VERY CLEAN! They had everything we needed! Beach towels, chairs, even games in case it rained! Just perfect hosts! Can‚Äôt wait to come back!"
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"Communication was excellent. Airbnb is nicely located with access to the beach, shops, and attractions around the city. We can‚Äôt wait to stay again!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Can't say enough about how great this place was. We have two little ones and this was perfect. Close to the beach so was only a two minute drive. The walking path would be great if the kids were older and we didn't have so much stuff. The game room in the garage was perfect letting them play and not have to worry too much. The place was extremely clean as well which made us instantly comfortable. Each morning we were greeted by a family of deer eating from the apple tree in the front yard. The kids loved it! Adults did too actually. Everything just worked out so well. Highly recommend!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A lovely place and a short walk (or drive) to the beach. Great communication with Bob & Antoinette. House instructions and rules were clear. And the ‚Äúgame‚Äù garage comes in handy on rainy days (we had a few!).
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our family enjoyed your beautiful home. VERY CLEAN all round. The kitchen was equipped with everything we needed to cook. Grill on site. Easy walk to the beach. Sidenote> If you have alot of beach gear just wake up early and bring the car down and park on Illinois street. Plenty of games for the kids and beach chairs and umbrella. One thing that's great is the smoke and pet free policy. Will be back yearly. Thanks again!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"‚ÄúThe Yellow House,‚Äù as our three year old calls it, was perfect for our family vacation. The house was spacious for the three of us with our daughter really enjoying the kid friendly garage area (shuffle board, kid‚Äôs table). Everything was clean & well stocked. The path to the beach goes through a wooded terrain. If we stay in the house again we‚Äôll plan on driving the short distance to park closer to the beach entrance as the walk was a bit difficult for our toddler. Sheridan Beach is absolutely beautiful and was never crowded while we were there.

Be sure to keep the blinds open early evening ‚Äì we had deer visitors each night of our stay, which as a delight for all of us. The Washington Park Zoo and the outlet mall were really close and great to visit. Overall, the house was great and we had a fantastic time. Thank you to the great hosts!"
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,Convenient and clean house within walking distance to beach. Girls night by the fire pit playing games roasting marshmallows. Everything you need!
2021-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Small quiet house, near beach. Trail to beach is tight and downhill going and uphill coming back. Tough trek for wagon/stroller.
Perfect for a small family or couple looking to spend a few quiet nights away from home!"
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,Very clean and the house was well stocked with things needed for a nice stay! Close enough to the beach where you don‚Äôt have to drive but you do have a little walk! We enjoyed our stay!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Clean and very quaint
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is a gem of a cottage in Michigan City. Had everything we needed for our family of four. We loved being able to walk down to the beach to take a quick stroll but for longer stays we parked down on the street next to the walkway so we could lug our beach gear easier. The town itself seems like it‚Äôs has had better days and the restaurant selection was lacking. But we were happy with our quiet beach experience and hikes in the nearby state and national parks.
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,Great stay !
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful place to stay, clean and well organized! Close walk to the beach!"
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"Great house, no issues at all."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice location.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Stellar location with a short and private walking path to the beach. The home was comfortable and the kitchen had most needed items. Lots of towels and bedding. The Wifi worked well. The game room, games, and beach items were helpful for the kids traveling with us.
You do have to provide some of your own basics such as shampoo/conditioner, olive oil, spices (beyond salt/pepper), laundry detergent for the washer/dryer, and ice.
Also, bring your own firewood if you want to use the fire pit. There is a great outside table for meals."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice, bright little cottage in a great location. Note that there‚Äôs no dishwasher. Also, since we stayed over a long weekend, there was noise and loud music from partying neighbors at night till about 10:30pm."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very clean & cozy. The trail to the beach is through a wooded area, if you are loaded up with kids, toys, and strollers it would be best to drive- perfect short cut for adults and older kiddos. The second bedroom is open to the living area (wall does not go to ceiling) so if others are awake the noise will travel. The bonus space in the garage was great. Note- there is no dishwasher. Wonderful experience!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location near the beach. The garage converted into the perfect outdoor living room space. Couldn‚Äôt have had a better spot for our family vacation.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very clean and comfortable - and great location within walking distance of the lake!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great stay! The cottage had everything we needed and was exceptionally clean. Communication with the hosts was easy and prompt. Would recommend to anyone looking for a nice spot in Michigan City.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was amazing, and it was in a nice area which was very quiet. Definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a nice place to relax"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very nice little cottage, good location near the beach and downtown Michigan City. It was nice having the garage with shuffleboard and other games! Note that in the bunk bed bedroom the wall doesn't go all the way to the ceiling, so it will be noisy for sleeping if people are still awake in the living room / kitchen part."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute and quaint. Easy path to the beach, near a ton of great restaurants and breweries. Clean!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home was perfect for my husband and I for a weekend get away. We have two small kiddos (who were home for this trip) but this home would have been perfect to bring them too! This house was PERFECTLY clean. Great location to downtown Michigan City (great restaurants, breweries, etc) and great access to Lake Michigan! We‚Äôll defiantly be back!!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The location was great! We loved the short trail to the beach. Plus all restaurants and shops were a quick 5-minute drive from the house. The bonus/game room also works really well as a study area. Our daughter was able to use it for studying and her online classes.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cottage was clean and very comfortable. The short walk to the beach is so worth it.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cute cottage. Great location and close to the beach.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had just come from camping the night before and we‚Äôre grateful the space was sparking clean and so comfortable. We had a great experience and I would definitely stay here again.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Excellent location! Super clean, cozy, and welcoming."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a cute spot! Really nice for our family and the girls LOVED the bunk beds! Bit of a walk down a steep hill to the beach, but driving and finding parking there was EASY!! Close to everything, we really enjoyed our stay in the ""yellow house"" :)"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My 3 year old says ""yellow house my friend"". It was my friend too. Very clean. Great extra touches (puzzles in the garage & coffee). The closest beaches (stop 2-13) are closed but that's the pandemic. Would stay here again & again! Also, carry out from bridges for dinner is highly recommended."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very cute cottage perfect for family! My son 5 loved the game room with puzzles and the pac-n-play and high chair available made it easy to travel with my 10 mo. old. The beach is a very short walk away and the dunes are a short drive, making it easy to alternate between lazy beach day and a more active hiking day. There was some confusion on whether the beach by the house was actually open because of the current COVID situation, so make sure you check, but we had a fun, safe, social distanced holiday!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A nice clean and stylish space, close to the beach."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed staying at this cottage so much! The cottage was close to the beach and the neighborhood was so quiet. My kids loved the game room. Bob and Antoinette made our stay so comfortable and we appreciate their extra little touches!
2020-08-01,5,Group trip,Great house close to the beach
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great amenities! Close to the beach. Fun beach decor. A homey comfortable cottage. Sparkling clean.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great spot and place was exactly how it was described.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at this cute beach house was awesome! We loved all of the details they had thought of. The beach towels, chairs and umbrella made our beach days even better! Sitting outside and relaxing at sunset was our favorite. Definitely stay here if you need a weekend away! It was truly a cozy and quiet gem."
2020-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Perfect location, the house was great for our little one‚Äôs, and the game room was a bonus! The public beach there is currently closed so plan on driving if the beach is on your itinerary."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice cozy little spot! Right where you want to be in Michigan city
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,perfect beach cottage
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had an excellent time at this little gem! I absolutely loved all of the extra amenities that were offered including the grill, extra tables and chairs, toaster, toaster oven, cooking utensils etc. The hose outside was so great to use to get all of the extra sand off after a long day at the beach, and the ‚Äúsecret path‚Äù shaved so much time off our trips down to the beach! I also loved having a washer and dryer available. We came home with clean clothes!! We had a fabulous Fourth of July and would highly recommend :-)"
2020-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Check in was easy, walk to the beach is short (though a tiny bit rugged), and the house is very cute and clean!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay. It was so nice to not have to worry about packing towels & chairs. It was also a nice bonus to find paper towels, toilet paper, garbage bags, coffee, other kitchen essentials, hand soap, dish soap, laundry soap, & even shampoo at the house. Those little touches make such a difference and are not found everywhere. Would love to see a few more hooks to hang things especially in the 2nd bedroom. The path to the beach was great and super quick. Its a narrow trail in the woods down a hill so would not be good for strollers or those unsteady on their feet, however it would be easy to drive to beach as well. The path over the dune on the beach has a blue pathway to make it more accessible. That was so nice to make it easier to go over the big sand dune. Any questions were answered almost immediately. This is a great place and a great location. I recommend it."
2020-06-01,5,Group trip,"Sweet little cottage with a path to the lake! Clean and comfortable, with a fun game room for the kids. Quiet neighborhood."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was extremely clean. It was nicely decorated and very close to the beach. We loved the game room in the garage. Bob and Antoinette were great with communication. Thumbs up!
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was so clean and had everything we needed! The neighborhood felt safe, beds were comfortable and the short walk to beach was totally worth it. Due to a small maintenance issue we had the pleasure of meeting our host, Bob is such a nice guy and took care of the issue quickly and was very attentive to make sure we had everything we needed. I would definitely recommend the property and any other property they host."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had perfect weekend in Michigan City. The ability to go to the beach by walk is priceless. House is spacious and offers a lot of extras, like gaming room and a nice outdoor area."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,This cottage is conveniently located near the beach. There is also an elementary school with two playgrounds and a soccer field that were fun to visit with our son. The neighborhood is great for walking around. The cottage itself is very clean and comfortable. Everything was great!
2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location in Michigan City. The cottage was clean, well-organized and easy to check into. The neighborhood is nice with a variety of architectural styles and friendly people."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We booked Bob and Antoinette's place last minute having decided to visit Indiana Dunes for the first time. Communication was quick and efficient yet chatty and check in was very easy. We loved to be able to walk to the beach and the home was colorful and clean with everything we needed. The recommendation for a local brunchy cafe, Dune Billies, was great. Plenty of parks for the kids and the rock collecting was so much fun. Thank you!"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My daughter (age 9) and I stayed here before a Notre Dame football game. It was our first Airbnb experience, and we really enjoyed it as the was nice and very clean. My daughter also loved the game room and the beach. Bob and Antoinette‚Äôs tips were very helpful and easy to follow."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very nice, clean house that was perfect for our family of 5. The game room was great for the kids, and the house had everything that we needed. Location was near the beach, and we could easily walk to our other family member's rental houses."
2019-08-01,5,Group trip,They had awesome tips about the town and the location can‚Äôt be beat.
2019-08-01,5,Group trip,this home and location were perfect for us the trail was conveniently located right outside the front yard the kids loved it fun going up and down the trail to the beach the game room was a great idea the home is laid out very well was very clean and comfortable we really enjoyed The Pavilion and chairs and fire pit we had a great time I would recommend this home to everyone thank you for thinking of everything
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The home is very clean, and the hosts are responsive and accommodating."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay at the cottage and it really catered to all our needs for a little get away by the beach. The garage was a bonus and the kids really enjoyed having the game room in there. We also appreciated the High Chair. Our family of five fit comfortably and there was plenty to do around Michigan City. The beach was a short walk and there were other trips in foot we were able to take including the zoo, brewery, parks and coffee shop."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Adorable,sparkling clean cottage. Perfect for quick getaway for our family. The location was awesome...so close to the beach!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great little house. Beach is close enough to walk to but trail is very narrow. Better to drive short distance. Very clean. We enjoyed the game room.
2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,A comfortable place to stay with your family and friends with kids for a long relaxing weekend!!
2019-07-01,3,Group trip,"The cottage is in a great location. My family used the trail and enjoyed the lovely beach nearby. The sleeping arrangements had to be changed due to the shaky bunk beds. My girls did not feel safe sleeping there. The kitchen had coffee and everything needed. Though upon check in, there was old food found in the microwave which drew an army of ants. Ants continued to visit the kitchen unless all food was removed from the trash and counters. These things were manageable and everyone was still able to enjoy activities on the lake and area restaurants. I let Bob and Antoinette know about the problems so things are improved for future visitors."
2019-06-01,5,Group trip,"Super clean and cozy space and the location was great! The house is walking distance to everything you need, also off to the end of the road to have some privacy. Definitely enjoyed our stay. The host were quick to respond to any questions I had during the stay. I definitely recommend this place!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I stayed at Bob and Antoinette's house for a four day getaway, it was easy to find, with off street parking. It was updated, and inside nicely done with a beachy atmosphere, they went the extra mile to provide plenty of dishes, cookware, towels, extra blankets, kids beach toys, just about everything to make you feel like you were at home. Even a grill! The outside shower wasn't working which we informed them of towards the end of our stay but it didn't bother us a bit, we just used towels to wipe off sand outside and it worked out just fine.. if you get the chance to stay here I wouldn't hesitate, we all felt at home here and it more than met our expectations!"
2019-05-01,5,Group trip,"The house is clean and conveniently stocked with just about everything you'd need for a weekend at the beach-- lots of pots, pans, and kitchen utensils, beach towels, games, etc. The beach is about a five minute walk away, so there's no need to worry about finding parking. The street is quiet and we didn't notice any traffic or outside noise. Everything was as promised!"
2018-09-01,5,Group trip,"Lovely well-maintained home a quick walk from beach!
Very Well equipped for children!
We ll be back for sure :-)"
2018-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family had a nice stay at this house very close to the beach. My children (3 & 7) loved the beach toys and the grown ups appreciated the chairs (though really, who were we kidding? We barely sat! :) ). Bob and Antoinette gave great check-in instructions and tips on how to get the beach, where to turn on the outdoor shower, etc. As many others have said, the house was spotless and cozy! I‚Äôd definitely recommend it for other families looking for a getaway!"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house is even cuter in person than in the pictures. No complaints. Very clean, offered all the items you would need to be comfortable away from home. Left us plenty of soap, toilet paper, paper towels, bath towels, beach towels, laundry pods, and dish soap. Plenty of extra blankets and pillows. Kids loved the garage thats been converted to a game room. Very short drive to Washington park zoo and beach. Can walk to beach, but trail isn‚Äôt the easiest if you have kids in a stroller. Grocery store about a 5-10 minutes drive away. School just around the corner with a playground for the kids. We would recommend this place to anyone, glad we stayed!"
2018-08-01,5,Group trip,This home was simply lovely! A great place and so close to the beach and some great restaurants. We loved our stay here!
2018-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Bob & Antoinette have a great place here! It is a cool little beach themed ranch that is very well kept. Cleanliness is clearly a top priority. This place is an easy couple minute drive from so much! The Indiana Dunes, marina, zoo, beach, supermarket, restaurants, large lake shore park, lighthouse, blueberry picking, and much more are all so close. Also has an easy walkable path to the beach!"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Location, location, location! Bob & Antoinette's cottage gem is nestled on a corner lot in a quiet, older neighborhood that's less than 10 minutes walk to Sheridan Beach. Most homes in the area are well kept. There was little to no traffic.
The cottage was just as the photos promised and we had no trouble with self check in. Bob & Antoinette provided all the beach amenities we may have needed (towels, chairs, umbrella, toys for playing in waves and sand) and I can only imagine the washer / dryer would have value to families who may stay longer. Our family of 4 slept comfortably (2 adults, 2 teens) and we could have made room for 1 more on the futon.
Washington Park Beach, the pier, the Lighthouse Museum and the outlet mall were all short drives from the cottage. We especially enjoyed the dining at two neighborhood eateries, Dune Billie's Cafe and Cool Runnings Jamaican bar & restaurant.
We wish we'd stayed longer so that we could have more time at the beach. It was so convenient to get to and not crowded. This is a home I'd recommend to friends."
2018-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Clean, cozy & kid friendly. My kids (6 & 3) thought it was the best vacation ever. Really is a short walk to the beach & a quick drive to the zoo & splash pad."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Love this place!! Cute and cozy and super clean!! Great location that is definitely walking distance to beach. Good for families! Loved the outdoor shower to get all the sand off before coming into the home. Thanks for a great stay!
2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Bob and Antoinette were great hosts and very responsive to questions. Glad we found this little house in a cool little beach town! My family and I had a great time here.
2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cute and clean! Nice safe place close to the beach.
2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family (my husband, 4 year old and 1 year old) had a wonderful time and enjoyed the house. The location is great for a quick walk to the beach. The amenities provided by the host such as the high chair, pack n play, beach toys and games made for lighter packing for me and unexpected surprises for the boys. (The table shuffleboard was a hit!) The decor is spot on with the cottage gem description. We had everything we needed AND MORE! Already planning our next stay to this location!"
2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family of six really enjoyed our stay here. It fit our needs well and was just a short walk to the beach, which we visited often. The beach umbrella, fire pit, and other helpful items were a great touch. Thanks for hosting us!"
2018-07-01,5,Group trip,It was a nice place to stay. The only thing that could have made it better was having cable TV available!
2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This little house worked well for our family. The house was clean and offered everything we needed to walk to the lake and play with our 3 small kids for a couple of days. The extra space in the garage area was also a nice bonus for the kids.
2018-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Property was wonderful. The hosts have thought of everything needed for comfort and ease. Loved our stay at the beach!
2018-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very nice place to stay, very clean ! I recommend"

2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place to stay I will recommend this to my friends
2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in Michigan city. Wonderful clean home that is decorated in cute beach theme. Short walk to Lake Michigan with a nice beach for walking or relaxing. Close to restaurants and shopping too.
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great house next to the beach, good-sized yard to play games in or just sit around the fire pit. They were very helpful in communicating and fixing things quickly."
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was perfect to have a quiet relaxing few days away from the city. The cottage was very clean and it had such a cute vibe! The porch was such a peaceful place to sit and it was nice that the beach was so close. All in all I would definitely go back!
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home. Close enough to the beach and restaurants.
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay! A nice surprise was that it was a short (10-15 minute) walk from a great breakfast spot and a Jamaican restaurant. We went to both, great food! The house was clean, there were plenty of towels and dishes for our use, and we enjoyed that it was relatively close to the beach (the trail to the beach was a little difficult to find at first but once we spotted it, it was easy to follow). Overall, a great stay!"
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and cute home! More spacious than I expected and the beach is just a quick walk away!
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay with family!
Short walk to a great beach!"
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was super nice and very clean. Very nice open layout of the house. It is in a great spot and close to the beach. We walked everyday to the beach. The house is so close to shopping and restaurants. Bob and Antoinette were so helpful and very quick to answer questions.
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our family had a great time on our trip to Michigan City and enjoyed the Lake very much. The Cottage was very nice, clean and had all the things we needed to make a fun trip. The beach items, as well as, the assortment of games available were a plus which my family enjoyed. Our families first time using airbnb and we will plan on using for more vacations in the future."
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a nice, clean cottage located a short distance from Lake Michigan. A short, well marked path leads to the lake. It had everything we needed-- coffee maker, hot pot for tea, wonderful thick beach towels and comfy beds. There's even a table top shuffle board game and a washer and dryer. :)"
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time - Bob and Antoinettes place has all the amenitys that you may need for your stay (kitchen utensils, extra towels, board games). Easy to find the house and is a quick walk to the beach!"
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Bob & Antoinette went beyond and above to provide a clean and comfortable place for guest to stay. Probably the cleanest place we have ever stayed. They also provide all the necessary household items and beach supplies needed. The house is updated and decorated with a beach cottage theme that is very tastefully done. My family had a wonderful time and enjoyed our stay very much. Thank you for helping us make family memories!
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The location was the perfect distance to a quiet beach. The photos were accurate and everything was very clean. Thanks for the stay!
2017-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay at Bob & Antoinette's house. The description is straight on. We walked to the beach and to Washington Park Zoo with our three small children. Everything you need to have a great vacation was already at the house. We even had a night of making s'mores around the fire pit. It was a wonderful vacation and we hope to do it again next year.
2017-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"House was exactly as shown, clean, and convenient to the beach. We stayed for 4 nights, and my kids want to move there now. Many amenities made a comfortable stay, including an abundance of towels, lots of common space and seating inside and out, dishes, beach toys, large umbrella, and even marshmallow roasting sticks. Hosts responded quickly. A note to those of you from Florida like us -- you have to walk over the dune at Sheridan Beach, no boardwalk. But the lake is worth it."
2017-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved Bob & Antoinette's cottage. It was very spacious and had a nice outdoor area that we were able to utilize due to the nice weather. The walk to the beach was very manageable and Bob & Antoinette provided everything we could need from chairs to blankets. I would definitely recommend this cottage for families and friends alike!
2016-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fun and relaxing weekend! The cottage was extremely clean and very cozy. The walk to the beach was short and our boys, ages 6 and 2.5, enjoyed both the short hike and the beach itself. Bob and Antoinette provided all the beach gear that we would need...chairs, blanket, sand toys and football. They had a pac n' play available for our little one and our older son really enjoyed the bunk beds. Although we didn't make it to Washington Park and the Zoo as it was raining on our second day, the cottage was the perfect place for our family to spend a few days relaxing and connecting. We checked out Sophia's House of Pancakes as our boys love pancakes and Fiddlehead, a downtown restaurant serving locally sourced food."
2016-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Bob and Antoinette were super helpful and accommodating. The house was spotlessly clean and beautifully decorated and organized. They have every thing you would need for a beach vacation at the house. The house has a great location: A super short walk to the beach and walking distance to the zoo. We had a great time! A note about the design of the house: the second bedroom doesn't have a wall that goes all the way to the ceiling. This created some challenges for us with small children who nap and go to bed early. We were not able to use the tv in the living room or lights when kids were sleeping due to the lack of sound or light barrier in that room. This probably wouldn't be a problem for families with older kids or for kids not bothered by light and noise when trying to sleep.
2016-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Hosts very prompt and clear with communication. Simple check in. House was very clean, decorated nicely. Nice amenities. Small walk to beach but my husband and 2 year old had no problem. Bonus garage/game room was nice touch!"
2016-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our family had a fantastic time during our stay. Bob & Antoinette were extremely helpful and friendly insuring that we had everything possible to make our stay better. With such a great location to the beach we would highly recommend the house to anyone!
2016-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a terrific place for a weekend get-a-way for the family. The house was very clean and comfortable. The owners were very responsive to our needs. They even said they would come over to help find something we needed, but through their email correspondence, we figured it out. We walked to the beach each day, which was only a .2 mile walk. I would definitely recommend this house for anyone who wants to relax and enjoy a family excursion."
2016-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bob and Antoinette have a lovely home. Once you step inside, you forget you're in Indiana and feel like you've fully escaped to the beach. The cottage is close to all of Michigan City's attractions. The place is spotless and they've thought of everything you might need. We had an excellent weekend and would definitely recommend staying here."
2016-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Particularly pleasant house in a great location right by the sea. Most friendly hosts who have everything you need to make the stay enjoyable.
Recommended"
2016-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay, and will likely return!"
2016-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our family had a fabulous time at Bob and Antoinette's adorable cottage. They were super to work with and showed us around the house, how to get to the lake, and places to check out. The path to get to the beach is super quick, just a couple minute walk. Everything we could have needed was there for our use (fold up chairs for the beach, sandand water toys, beach umbrella, games, washer/dryer, gas grill, etc). The kitchen was fully equipped. We truly loved our our experience and hope to go back soon."
2016-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed staying at Bob and Antoinette's cute house. Bob and Antoinette went out of their way to make us welcome and make sure we had everything we needed---even running out to Menard's to get floaty toys for the kids to use at the lake! We would absolutely recommend them!
2016-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy Quiet Gem are the perfect words to describe this Indiana cottage. Bob and Antoinette met us at the house upon our arrival and were the most gracious hosts. We could tell that their goal was for our family of four to have a stress free getaway, and that's exactly what we got. In this newly renovated cottage the owners have thought of everything to make your stay comfortable, and the description of the place is spot on. You are close to everything...beaches, restaurants, hiking, shopping, and of course, comfortable couches for relaxing with a book.
We loved the hosts' attention to detail, including beach chairs, towels, well supplied kitchen, and even Apple tv in the main bedroom.
We can't say enough about how much we enjoyed our stay and would come back in a heartbeat.
Thank you, Bob and Antoinette!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful home!!!! Owners couldn‚Äôt have been more accommodating of our last minute booking. Can‚Äôt wait to stay again.
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"We absolutely loved our stay at Spacious Superior: The perfect relaxation getaway! From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with warmth and hospitality. The house itself was even more beautiful than the pictures portrayed, with stylish d√©cor and all the amenities we could ask for.
The hosts thought of every detail to make our stay comfortable and convenient. The kitchen was well-equipped for cooking meals, the beds were cozy with fresh linens, and the living spaces were inviting for relaxing after a day of exploring.
The location was perfect for us, offering both tranquility and convenience. We enjoyed morning walks in the neighborhood and easy access to nearby attractions and restaurants.
Communication with the hosts was seamless throughout our stay, and they were quick to respond to any questions we had. Their local recommendations were spot-on, enhancing our overall experience.
Overall, we couldn't have asked for a better Airbnb experience."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Really loved this house. We felt so at home we wanted to buy the house. The hosts are very respectful and communicative. They are also very accommodating. I have a service dog that I needed to bring and the first reservation was not able to accommodate animals due to shared HVAC system. The hosts quickly and respectfully switched out reservation to a better accommodation. 10/10 would definitely stay here again! And the cute bottle of wine was a nice touch!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great hosts and property. Enjoyed my stay very much
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The vintage cottage was scrubbed clean and very beach-chic aesthetic on the inside. It is located in a safe residential neighborhood about a 10-minute drive to Washington Beach (one of the best beaches in the area). The kitchen cabinets were well-stocked with cooking and dining supplies. The front door self-entry was extremely easy to use. In back is a nice fenced-in yard with a firepit. There are two full bathrooms. The owners were friendly and responsive, and provided their best advice on what to do locally. The manual was also very helpful. The internet worked without any hitches. Overall, we had a truly lovely, relaxing weekend at this house in Michigan City. Highly recommend."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,House and host were excellent!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautifully remodeled interior of an older home with an open concept. It was perfect for our family gathering of 12. With 6 kids, the space worked well with a second back stairwell the kids could use along with the two separate sitting/tv areas. The huge dining table off the kitchen sold the place for us with big family meals and the fire pit for s‚Äômores was just right. Our hosts seemed to have thought of everything! Great experience!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family of ten had a great vacation and stay in Michigan city. The house is as described and in a quiet neighborhood. Lots of amenities, room and bedrooms for everyone- teens and adults- to spread out and have both group and alone time. The place was clean and they also provided all the necessities for the beach. The house is close to the national park, beach, grocery stores and great restaurants. Will try to reserve again if we travel to Indiana dunes again.
The hosts were responsive and prompt."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed at Kirby & Taryn‚Äôs place after needing to find a new place late night due to a complete failure at another AirBnB. They were very prompt to response and open their house for us to stay last minute. The house is ample and very clean. Very comfortable with all the amenities in very good conditions. Location was great and felt very safe. We spent all day at the Indiana Dunes and came back to relax at the apartment doing some grilling in the backyard. Highly recommend this place and will book again in the future.
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Great hosts - very clean, comfortable, and updated place. The description and pics are absolutely accurate. Easy check in and out."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is just as advertised. The hosts have gone above and beyond and thought of everything you need for your stay.

Everything was clean and we felt right at home. Location is a quiet neighborhood that was a quick drive to everything we needed."

2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"This house has lots of space!
With 4 bedrooms and multiple common areas our group of 7 people had plenty of room. The long rectangle table made it easy to play games and eat meals together! We appreciated how close the Washington Park Zoo, Friendship Botanic gardens, lighthouse and beach were."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The home was a gem! Just as the description listed the home was beautiful. All supplies were available all the way to laundry detergent, extra sheets were a plus! The home was very clean my husband and I did a walk-through to make sure there were no issues. We spent a lot of time on the deck in the late evenings and the neighbors were very friendly, with no bugs hardly! My grandchildren enjoyed the stay just as much as we did. The lighted stairway front and back were nice also. I wouldn't hesitate to book this home again if back in the area."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lots of room, clean place and very responsive host."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We're a group of 9 cousins/family who wanted to celebrate our cousin's graduation ceremony. Although we were at this house for a short while, we certainly enjoyed our stay and had a super fun time with our cousins/family. The house is very clean, pretty, and comfortable for all of us. Personally, I really liked the room with 4 beds as we used it for some recreational activities with kids and adults and all of us enjoyed spending time here.
Kirby & Taryn (Host); and Amy (Co-Host) have been very kind in answering our questions about the house and the check-in/out guidelines. They were swift in responding to our messages which were very helpful."

2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"The house was amazing ü§©. The kitchen was very spacious and beautiful. Jessica, Kirby and Taryn were very helpful and responsive to messages. I flew in from Texas to host a women‚Äôs retreat. Usually we‚Äôre at hotels or a family member house. This year we we‚Äôre looking for a home away from home and that was definitely provided. The house was overall amazing. We all enjoyed our time catching up with one another and complementing our achievements. Everyone loved the home, it was warm and definitely welcoming. I will definitely recommend this home. It was definitely worth everything."
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"The host was extremely nice. I had to reschedule bc we had an ice storm and they allowed me to do so. She even checked on me to see how I was doing during the storm. During my stay I THOUGHT the kitchen sink water wasn‚Äôt working. They send someone over in less than 10 minutes. I was so embarrassed to find out all I had to do was wave to turn it onüòÇ. They texted to make sure everything else was ok doing my stay and that I didn‚Äôt need anything. They had plenty plenty of towels, toilet tissue, paper towels and etc. you can tell a woman owes the place bc they consider everything they think you might need and it was there. The home is very beautiful. Definitely will stay there again. Thanks for allowing us to rent your home."
2023-02-01,4,Group trip,We definitely would recommend the house to everyone

2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"We had a lovely stay! Large kitchen and living space to bring everyone together for meals and board games. Close to a lot of stores, not far from the hiking trails, and a great spot for a weekend getaway."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay! The house was perfect for our family holiday. It was very well set up as well as being cosy, clean, and it was a great location. Communication was excellent and we would highly recommend staying here. Thank you Jennifer, Kirby & Taryn üòä"
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,We had a wonderful stay the only issue was an incident at the corner the last night with serval cops on the block not sure what happened and out of the owner‚Äôs control but still disturbing.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A great home, spacious, clean, fully stocked toiletries, very clean rooms, beds, and sheets. Great communication from the host and always checking in to make sure everything is well. Highly recommend!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family and I enjoyed our stay in this beautiful home. The home was very clean and had enough towels and kitchen essentials for 7 guests. The hosts were very communicative with speedy responses. They checked on us regularly when our flights were delayed. The kids loved their bedroom with the four beds. My mom asked can we stay here again when we return‚Ä¶before we even checked out ha! This is the best home for your Michigan City vacation. Don‚Äôt miss out. Thanks again for hosting my family. ‚ù§Ô∏è
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a lovely place to stay in Michigan City. We stayed in the winter, but I'm sure it would be amazing in the summer. Close to shopping, food, and the beach. Hosts were great! Would definitely stay again!"
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"We loved our stay at Spacious Superior. We went in December with our women's group. We knew we'd be spending a lot of time indoors due to the weather, and the beautifully remodeled and decorated interior was so uplifting and fresh. The layout of the house and rooms was perfect for our needs. We had plenty of room, and there was always a bathroom or shower available when someone needed it. I love the new appliances and spacious kitchen where we cooked group meals. Communication with our hosts was easy. Thanks so much for being a cozy nest for us."
2022-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,The home was clean and comfortable. Our family had a great time together there. I would recommend this space to others.
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"Great place to stay for a large group or family. Stairs going upstairs are steep as described, but entrance has standard steps and there is a first floor bedroom for anyone who would have trouble navigating them. House is much bigger than anticipated with 2 living areas on first floor and very large kitchen."
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"What a lovely house! Very helpful for the logistics that we needed for this stay. We appreciate the owners being helpful. I recommend a visit to Michigan City, stay here if you‚Äôre visiting!"
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,What a charming home. Beautifully decorated and very welcoming. It is centrally located so was perfect for most attractions. We loved the open concept of the home and was very comfortable! Our favorite was the large dining room table to sit around and catch up with distant relatives. The beds were very comfortable and the neighborhood was quiet. The hostess was as sweet as can be and anything we needed she was quick to respond. Just wish our time visiting could have been longer.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is lovely and perfect for weekend stay. Very spacey!! Atmosphere is great! Perfect for family such as reunion to stay. We will come back‚Ä¶..
Thank you again!
Lori"
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,Everything was great! The house was very clean and tidy. Lots of sleeping areas and places to relax. I loved the communication and check ins to see if we needed anything.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jennifer, and Kirby and Taryn were great hosts! They were very accessible on Airbnb messaging and generous. We were gifted a red wine upon arrival and a personal note.
Communication about arrival and departure expectations were clear and easy to understand.
The simplicity and modern facilities/amenities of the entire home were refreshing to come home to.
One room with four twin beds was just what we needed for our boys and the upstairs queen bedroom was perfect for our daughter. We enjoyed having a first floor bedroom for grandparents and the upstairs king size bed was very comfortable.
Shower gel, shampoo and conditioner were provided, as well as laundry detergent. That was helpful!
Thanks guys. We will consider staying again!!"

2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"This place was great! Wonderful home away from home! The perfect place to stay for a girls trip! Very nice, clean and accurate description of the place online. They are very attentive in checking in to see how things are going and when we had questions, they answered very promptly! Highly recommend!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay. Thanks for a fun trip!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect place for 3 families and 7 kids combined to spend a weekend! Plenty of space for everyone and a great location! Less then 5 mins from anywhere you want to go. Any questions or issues we had they responded immediately. We will be back!
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"Our group had 8 people, a bunch of friends having a reunion after grad school, and we wanted a place by the dunes. This house was perfect! Enough bedrooms for the couples and single people, and a big kitchen and dinning room table for group meals. It was close to the beaches and national parks as well. We are already thinking about coming back next year!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was very organized and clean. We were missing a Beach umbrella; The host was contacted and the umbrella was delivered in less than 10 minutes! Very impressed!
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"This spot was awesome! Very clean, with plenty of space. The backyard / porch areas were nice. The host left really nice instructions that were quite helpful, especially at identifying local points of interest. I would highly recommend this house!"
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,Everything was as expected and the communication was great. We had a wonderful experience. Thank you Kirby & Taryn.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Thanks for a great stay! House was nicely decorated, modern and very clean. Kirby and Taryn really went out of their way to make sure that all our needs were met. A+!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lovely Roomy Family dwelling.
Super clean and all necessary items are there for your use.
Close to a variety of activities.
quiet neighborhood, easy parking for family. Just expect to rest, relax, and enjoy the comforts of a loved home.
our family x9..ages 4months to 66yrs all enjoyed this property.
Jennifer was attentive to our immediate needs and any ?'s.
Nothing to complain about except the end of weekend came too fast...Thank You for hosting us in Michigan City.
ps kids loved the beach toys and adults liked the wine from local winery."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed four nights at the Spacious Superior home. It was exactly as described. The home was spacious, so clean, well-stocked and welcoming all around. Beach towels, beach toys, laundry, fire pit, comfortable beds. The trundle beds were perfect for all of our kiddos! We would most definitely stay again. Close to beaches and the Dunes parks. While we initially communicated with Taryn, we also worked closely with Jennifer in coordinating our visit (and we coordinated another simultaneous rental unit from Kirby and Taryn). Jennifer was above and beyond in communicating with us, answering all questions. We asked if there was a hose hookup for a little sprinkler in the back yard. She responded yes, and then let us know they would also provide a hose. Just one little example! It was a wonderful experience all around."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This house was beautiful and spacious! We stayed with two families for a total of nine guest very comfortably. It really felt like a home away from home. We felt comfortable in the immediate neighborhood. The homes between this neighborhood and local beach area seemed more run down but you couldn‚Äôt beat how close we were to the beach and lighthouse. Jennifer communicated within minutes when we had questions and was a delight to work with. We plan on visiting again soon!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved the house! There were 3 families with 11 total people, and we had plenty of space for everyone. The huge kitchen table was perfect for gathering around meals and playing games. Location was great for us since we wanted to go to the zoo, municipal beach, blueberry picking, and outlet mall, but also the Indiana Dunes National Park in the opposite direction. We were just a quick car ride away from everywhere we wanted to go. The neighborhood has nice houses with character and large old growth trees with free parking on the street right in front of the house (no one else was ever parked there!). When we stayed in July, 2022, the house had been recently remodeled and was so tastefully done. They maintained the charm of an old house while modernizing the kitchens and bathrooms. It was a bit hot for us to use the deck, but we did use the grill in the backyard. We really didn‚Äôt watch much TV but there are two of them that we used to log in to our streaming accounts for the kids. Speaking of kids, they also provided some beach toys! The owners provided top notch communication from check-in through check-out. All in all, you won‚Äôt be disappointed if you stay here, and we‚Äôll definitely come back!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a beautiful house to stay in. We had 9 adults (3 couples and 3 singles) and 2 children (under 4). We had LOTS of room for playing, sleeping, and relaxing!! The downstairs bedroom and the king bedroom upstairs had plenty of room for playpens to be set up. The upstairs bath has a tub/shower combo for littles. There are train tracks close by but we never heard the trains at night. There is a speaker provided that light sleepers could use as a sound machine. The house is a quick 10 minute drive to several beaches. (Just FYI, all beaches require parking fees.) There we‚Äôre many ‚Äúextras‚Äù included that made the stay awesome: sand toys, beach towels and blanket, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, laundry and laundry soap, etc. The kitchen and the table are huge and we spent many evenings there playing games and just hanging out. Was a fantastic vacation made even better by our hosts!! Thanks so much!!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Love this home! Very relaxing, clean and accurate like as pictured. Communication was great they replied to me within a few hours. We had 12 guests for 3 families and this house was perfect enough beds for everyone! Close to everything and I like that they have beach toys for kids. Will be back next time again!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Kirby & Taryn‚Äôs place was a perfect fit for our group (4 adults, 2 kids). The house was centrally located and just a couple minutes drive to the beach, outlets, casino, and tons of restaurants. We liked being able to walk to some nearby places too! They were quick to respond to our questions and we had a wonderful stay. Would definitely stay with them again!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had an amazing time here. Super clean and modern location minutes from restaurants and the beach. The only issue was that we couldn‚Äôt stay longer! :) Would definitely come back!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The stay was fantastic! The house was comfortable, spacious, and tastefully updated. We had plenty of room for all 3 families and the large dining table and kitchen were greatly appreciated! We also made use of the deck one evening. Plenty of seats for everyone! The backyard is small but had a good flat area for tossing a ball around and playing tag.
The bedrooms were clean with comfortable beds. The bathroom upstairs had a tub that we used for the littles and both showers had fantastic pressure. There is a train that came through nightly so be prepared with your white noise. The house came with a smart speaker which we made use of and it kept all the kids asleep.
The two small living room areas were also nicely decorated. Each had a t.v. but more importantly they allowed us to visit with family in one while the littles played in the other.
This was a fantastic experience and we highly recommend staying here!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,A well-decorated and thought-out lovely home with an attention to details. We all had a great experience staying here.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful house. We had plenty of room. There is huge dining table we were able to play games on. The kitchen is well stocked. If I ever had the need again, I would book this house."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Kirby and Taryn‚Äôs team did an amazing job preparing and keeping the property clean. The place had an open concept, which was great for providing a place for a bigger family to interact. The place was in a great location and it was very close to many amenities of the city. The team communicated the relevant information well and checked up on us periodically without burdening us too much. I highly recommend their property for others looking to stay in the heart of Michigan City."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place and amazing hosts! Can highly recommend
Very helpful, communication was instant and informative.
The location is nice as well"
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"Great stay, very responsive host, and the house was beautiful!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about our stay was phenomenal! The house was even better than described and was impeccably clean and so cozy. Plenty of space, inside and out! The hosts were so friendly and responded quickly to all of my questions.
Having the beach towels and beach toys provided made it so easy to go straight to explore the beach on our first day in town. The location is great - quick and easy to get to everything we needed! It was easy and convenient to get DoorDash for food/supplies. The washer/dryer were so convenient too. My kids loved the back deck and the grassy backyard - we don‚Äôt have grass like that in Arizona!
I came here with my kids, a middle of a trip break being my only expectation. We made such amazing memories together and were able to totally relax and just enjoy being together. They‚Äôve already asked if it can be a Mother‚Äôs Day tradition to come back every year. We‚Äôve stayed in a lot of Air BnB‚Äôs and this one definitely makes our Top 5 list. Literally the worst part was having to leave!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Overall everything was very good and hosts were attentive to everything
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,Pictures do no justice the space & the hosts are simply amazingüíï

2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great property for a group to stay in Michigan City! Our hosts Kirby & Taryn were lovely and helpful. The newly renovated house was clean and thoughtfully prepared. I loved the Michigan City memorabilia around the house and my daughter loved the beach toys! Thank you!
