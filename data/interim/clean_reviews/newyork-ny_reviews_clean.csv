2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,awesome stay!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location close to the Empire State Building. Clean and compact apartment, with comfortable beds. We were out most of the time, so needed somewhere comfortable to sleep, so no complaints there. We were able to leave our luggage in Henri’s office on day of checkout, which was very useful for us as we didn’t fly home until late evening. Henri was very helpful with advice on taxis to/from the airport as well. Having great accommodation helped make our stay in NYC that bit more enjoyable. Very happy to recommend"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent apartment. Location level can hardly do better. We had a great time.
(To be reviewed, difficulty heating one of the bedrooms, clean towel but had a slight smell of humidity) otherwise RAS"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,The staffs are friendly and the location is perfect
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,We were lucky enough to have Henri as our host. Easy to communicate and responsive to all of our queries.. The place was excellent! It’s highly recommended and will surely do. Thanks Henri! Till next time😊
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time in New York - and that was also due to Henri's apartment. It is in a great location and was a good starting point for all our activities for us. We really wanted an apartment and not a hotel, because we always treat the children to a break and do not want to eat in the restaurant all the time. Although a large table is missing - the apartment is too small for that - but we got along wonderfully and had breakfast there every now and then or ate typical German dinner."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Henri was so helpful and accommodating!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place ,close to everything you’re going to want to see in Manhattan!! 5star host*****"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A fantastic place to stay if you’re heading to New York ! So central , everything is walkable. Times Square approximately 15 minutes of a walk , Macys is less than 5 ! Really safe neighborhood with plenty of restaurant options. The rooms were spotless and spacious, there was 4 of us and we had more than enough room. Henri was a fantastic host and was so quick to respond to any queries. The luggage storage service is a fantastic service also. If you’re heading to New York you will not find many better places than this"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! Definitely when I come back will be staying here again! Highly recommend
2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Lovely central NYC apartment. Perfect base to explore the city. Clean, comfortable and fresh. Agree with other reviewers who said it was perfect for 5 people max."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent accommodation, perfect location close to subway and 34th street shopping. Henri was an excellent host, very clear and quick communication."
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The location is great, the apartment is good, but it needs to improve in several ways:
1) dimly lit. You need to put at least one central light in the room, it gets very dark and this gets in the way.
2) the bathroom curtain STINKS a lot, it's old, needs to be changed.
3) the bathroom towels are small and don't smell good. It did not appear to be 100% clean.
4) ideal up to 5 guests, does not hold the 7 guests comfortably."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,OK
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Henri's place was nice and cozy. Located inside a hotel in the top floor penthouse. Walkable distance for the subway system and everything else.

2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"It was amazing! Location was great. The room was so clean and good organized. I had a great conversation with Henri. He always replied as soon as possible. The explanation was so kind!
The room was a little small, but perfect for 6 people for one night in the middle of Manhattan!"
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"Great place, near time square, clean et comfortable!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Super nice host. Great spot right where we needed to be.
2023-12-01,4,Stayed about a week,Great location- you are right amongst it. A bit of street noise is to be expected in an apartment in NYC.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,The apartment was exactly as advertised. We used it as a home base while we walked around. Beds were comfy and clean. I would stay again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place to stay! Henri was very kind!
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,We had a great stay. Henri was very helpful and accommodating. Would definitely recommend!!
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"Henri’s listing was perfect for our stay. The unit was clean and everything was just like in the pictures. We had everything we needed. I loved that it was walking distance to so many places and that it was very close to subway access including the Penn Station which is where we arrived by train and we were able to walk to the unit which was very convenient. I also liked that the reception is just downstairs so if we needed anything, we could just go to the reception. Henri was also very responsive since day one. We truly enjoyed our stay. Thank you Henry!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent place to stay. Great location with lots to do around and Henri was a great communicator through the whole process. 10/10 recommend.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay at Henri's place. The apartment made great use of the small space and it met our needs for our few days in NY. Great location and very convenient access to multiple subway lines. Would definitely recommend.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a very nice 2 night stay at this property in mid-town Manhattan. Great location to explore the city for the first time. The living space is a little small but very functional for our group of four. The bedrooms served us perfectly. Most notably was how simply and clean the property was…very nice. It was nice to have free and secure bag storage at reception when we were checking out. The host Henri was always responsive and a very good communicator. We can highly recommend this property for your stay in NYC!
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Had a wonderful stay at Henri’s! Everything went as planned and we even got to check in early!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great stay. We had a ton of kids and it worked out well. There is very little common areas in the unit, but we were planning on being about the town and not in the unit."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Henri's place was perfect for my 3 friends and I to stay for a quick bachelorette party over night in the city. It was clean and had everything we needed. Thanks, Henri."
2023-09-01,4,Group trip,Great place in great location. Elevator situation was a little annoying but not anything that was a problem. Would definitely stay again.
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Great spot, host was responsive and helpful."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The flexibility shown by Henri and his team was very helpful. Our schedule had us arrive a little earlier than check in. Henri provided free luggage storage as we needed to attend to our events. We actually got the opportunity to check in earlier as the room was ready for us. Sam, the attendant in reception room one was kind. He offered ideas of places to eat in K-Town, he provided us space to store our luggage after checkout as our train was not till the late afternoon. Overall for our schedule, the location, space, the ease of getting in and out was seamless. First time using Airbnb, and this was a very positive experience."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Wonderful place to stay and perfect host!
Would stay again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"it was wonderful in heris apartment. it is in the heart of manhattan and the city that never sleeps is best explored on foot from here. we are always happy to return to our penthouse after the strenuous days on NY's street to have our rest and relax
thank you henri and greetings from Switzerland"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Henri's place is perfect for the tourist visiting midtown/theater district. It is small, but extremely well appointed, very clean, nice bathroom. Few kitchen amenities but lots of coffee and food close by! I would absolutely come back with my kids. AC nice and cool excellent experience for those that truly need a nice comfortable place to crash without all the extra space. You won't have to be here except to sleep there is too much to do. Quiet as well! Loved it here."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a fantastic stay. Easy access to the trains and a very walkable area as well. Host is super responsive. Great experience, would love to stay again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fab apartment and location. Accommodated 6 people no problem, 10/15mins walk to Times Square. Would definitely stay again."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Super helpful
2023-06-01,3,Group trip,"Although Henri was great, to get up to the rental was not. You had to wait for a bit to get to the rental and only the left elevator would allow you direct access to the 12th floor. My main complaint is they have no paper towels at all. They also do not give you a wash rag to shower with. I had to use the hand towel in the shower. When asked if that has been a problem in the past, I was told no because people bring their own. So bring your own wash rag and your own paper towels. The beds were comfortable but the place is probably 300 square feet. Feel like the photos are a bit deceiving."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Easy check in, great host! He was very friendly and quick to respond whenever we needed anything! He really made us feel welcomed. Very happy with the location. Will definitely stay here again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Henri was a great host. Responsive. He let us drop our luggage for free. Sam was the one who helped keeping our bags. Thanks a lot
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Only drawback was elevator service. Have no other criticism.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great apartment, excellent area"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"My family and I took a day trip to NYC to celebrate my birthday. The location was great, 5 minute walk to get to Time Square. While staying at this location, there was one small concern. After alerting Henri to the concern, he responded immediately, remained in contact, and was very kind/professional. Henri also followed up with me after check-out to say goodbye. The apartment was very quiet and had an awesome view. Great stay, Great host!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fabulous time as a group of five, partially sharing double beds. The apartment is located unbeatably central and Henri was a great and very attentive host"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,The accommodation at Henri was perfect. Great location. Nice appartment. Possibility of luggage storage at the reception. Thank you.
2023-04-01,4,Group trip,Great location! Can see the Empire State Building out of one of the bedroom windows. Small space but walkable to penn station and other fun locations.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place in the heart of it all.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed the small penthouse in the heart of New York very much, we would come again anytime!"
2023-04-01,4,Stayed one night,Place was in a great location in mid town. The place itself is really more like a hotel not an apartment. Very very small but worked out fine. Really clean and amazing surroundings!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Overall, was wonderful! Clean, simple, easy!"
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,The cutest Airbnb in the heart of NYC. Close to everything and wonderful views of the city. Really comfortable beds and super clean and beautifully decorated ❤️
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place in convenient location. Especially because we could store our luggage during the last day in a locker room when exploring the city. Thanks again!
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"place was super clean, just what we were looking for. very easy check in and very responsive host who let us check out an hour later. highly recommend!"
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Place was clean and beds were comfortable to sleep in.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect for a short trip
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great!
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great host. Great location. Small view of Empire State Building out of one window. We enjoyed bagels and coffee sitting in front of the large window every morning. Nordstrom Rack down the street in case you forget anything.
Kitchen was missing coffee maker, kettle and toaster. No paper towels, which would have been good to have on hand. No dish towels either. The shower needs non-slip stickers, because it is very slippery. Great photos to make the place look amazingly large, but it is smaller than you expect.
Close to R line, one block N of room on 32 and Broadway. NE corner, and gets you in to Times Square in one stop, and pretty much anywhere else you want to go. Easy access for Uber, too."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely amazing location for accessing all the NYC sights and shows!
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"Thank you for an awesome stay, great service, great location, great place. Will see you again.
Traveled from South Africa to NY."
2023-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Feel like this is a hidden jem. We stayed on the 12th floor which was really nice, our bedroom had a view of the Empire State Building. We walked everywhere and Metro was close.
The lobby is lacking and one night the people next door were super loud in the middle of the night until I asked them to be quiet. Noise comes through the front door.
Needs just a couple more amenities to make it perfect but overall a very good experience. Henri was super responsive. Would give 4.5 stars and stay again. Great value for your $.
Newly remodeled space."
2022-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,Henri’s place gave us everything we needed for a quick overnight trip to the NYC. Great location with easy access to the subway.
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice and well placed accommodation. You can find the subway really nearby, and there are many places to eat, have a drink or a few groceries.
I understood that we would have a small kitchen area, but it's really just a fridge and some dishes. No sink, and unfortunately the coffee maker was malfunctioning.
Jenni, on the other hand, was very accommodating for check-in, and the place was spotless. I would recommend this property to visit New York."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a very pleasant stay. The prior communication was good and clear. It met our expectations exactly. It is clean, spacious and fresh. It is a nice base to avoid the hustle and bustle of Manhattan, yet close to everything. There are many nice restaurants, shops and public transport nearby. It's a quiet neighborhood. We would definitely recommend this place!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Would def recommend this spot. Host, Space, and Location were great. Plus, the water was nice and hot when showering.
Only gripe is to add more hooks in the bathroom and a side shelf to the right of the sink. (For a hanging toiletry bag or to keep a toothbrush out of the way)."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The studio is a charming space, cozy and comfortable for two adults. The compact coffee bar provides all you need for a caffeine boost and the mini fridge was handy for any leftovers and for items purchased from Dumbo market.
It is located in a terrific area with a variety of restaurants, bars, and cafes, all outside the front door. Absolutely amazing neighborhood! There is no shortage of activity on the commercial streets, but the noise was not outrageous, and we slept well. (If you’re sensitive to ambient city sounds, we recommend earplugs or use the white noise machine.) Subways stations are within in walking distance, 20 minutes or so, you’re in Manhattan. We would definitely stay here again, lovely Airbnb.
Jenni is a great host, prompt communication ensured easy check in/out process."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Self check in was great, the room was spacious and very beautiful, with great light during the day. I loved the little details! The bed is very comfortable and everything was clean."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I booked this place for my parents as I live in the neighborhood.they were very happy with their stay. The place was very comfortable, clean and great location."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay in a nice neighborhood!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect spot in Brooklyn. Really spacious, best neighborhood in Brooklyn and nicely sized bed and perfect bathroom! Highly recommended!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Small peaceful haven with all the necessary amenities. Great neighborhood, we enjoyed our stay."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was great when to visit New York. We stayed for 4 nights, everything was there, a great neighborhood and flexible host. Would recommend!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Extremely clear instructions on how to get in, great location, easy to access etc! Plus the place is perfect for 1 to 2 people. Super clean also!!! Would definitely be back."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Jenni's stay is fantastic! Cozy, good bed, nice shower, quiet neighborhood, with the metro half an hour from Manhattan. Jenni was easily accessible, attentive and made sure everything was in order. We had a great holiday!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are Scandinavian you will love this place. It is perfectly located in Cobbel Hill, the space is lovely decorated with a true eye for both design and comfort. The space is huge and comfortable, and the bed is perfect=great sleep. The place was easy to find and the instructions clear about everything regarding the stay. The area provides you with easy and fast access to Manhattan with the F-train. The area in it self has great restaurants and cute bars and cafés. You can go for beautiful walks with the Manhattan skyline as backdrop, or look at the arcitecture of the area. All in all; just perfect. We stayed in a 4 star Soho hotel the first part of our trip, which came highly recommended. But this Airbnb was far better in every way."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place
Everything is clean and what you would expect
Communication with Jenni was fast and efficient
The accommodation is very well located
We enjoyed our stay"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jenni's place was a perfect homebase for exploring Brooklyn. The quiet street is perfectly located between two bustling areas full of restaurants, shops, and bars and a quick walk to the nearest subway station. Jenni gave helpful guidance around street parking which we found on our block after a couple circles around the area (not bad for NYC!). The apartment had any amenities we needed including a small fridge, snacks, big closet space, desk, and couch. It was clean, well-appointed, and comfortable. We would absolutely stay next time we're in the area!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved staying at Jenni’s place! The room is clean and quiet, perfect location near the subway and lots of restaurants. Jenni gave really clear instructions and was helpful and friendly. Would absolutely stay here again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It’s a lovely and yes, serene gem. Everything I needed and hoped for. Also the neighborhood is great, I could have spent most of my trip sticking close to home exploring the area if I didn’t have obligations elsewhere in the city. I hope to stay here again soon :)"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Super convenient for us and so few places in the neighborhood—and affordable! Jenni was very responsive and kind.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This airbnb was amazing!!!!! It was a great price considering where we were. The location was amazing. Everything was walkable. There are 2 subway stations nearby (walkable). When we did call Ubers it only took 2 minutes for them to pick us up!!!! I felt very safe in this neighborhood and in the airbnb. The front door locks are secure. The airbnb looked just as it did in the pictures and was very comfy cozy.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jenni’s place is a peaceful retreat in the heart of charming Cobble Hill. It was absolutely pristinely cleaned, the bed is firm and comfortable, there were extra towels and it is designed beautifully: minimalist and natural materials with personal touches. We would absolutely stay here again. Very quiet street, white noise machine was not really needed but it was a nice touch. Great restaurants and coffee shops around every corner. Thank you Jenni for being such a kind and helpful host!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jenni’s place has everything you could possibly need to experience Brooklyn like a local. The unit itself is thoughtfully designed and located on a quiet street. We found so many cute bars and restaurants nearby and even walked to the Brooklyn bridge on a perfect Fall day. The subway is a few blocks away and efficiently transported us to everything we had scheduled in Manhattan.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jenni’s place is the ideal place from which to explore New York! The location is close to metro stations to the city. The room itself was good and wel kept.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Staying at Jenni’s place was great. It’s the perfect location to explore brooklyn. The neighbourhood is very quiet but also very close to not only rest of brooklyn but also manhattan and all it has to offer. I highly recommend staying here for more quiet and local way to see new york.
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The place is beautiful. From the photo it seems to be bigger but it’s fine.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jenni's space was exactly like pictured and it was so clean and comfortable. The bathroom was spacious and modern.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jenni's space is a quiet and pristine gem in Brooklyn. We had a long weekend for our wedding anniversary, and we couldn't have picked a better location! The neighborhood is close to the metro, amazing restaurants, and is sooo peaceful to be so close to the rest of the city. Jenni was quick to response and so flexible with check-in, and that helped us tremendously. Her place is so clean and simple, and the A/C was arguably the best feature. With the New York August heat, I slept better here than at my own home. Do not hesitate, book Jenni's place for your NYC trip!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jenni’s place was perfect! The space was gorgeous, very comfortable bed, and lovely furniture and design. Great neighborhood with amazing restaurants and coffee shops right around the corner, and just a few min walk to the subway!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute spot in a great location!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a serene space as advertised; clean and tastefully decorated. The neighbourhood was centrally located which made it very easy to access subway, restaurants, Brooklyn Heights Promenade and DUMBO. Wonderful stay!
The only suggestion I have is to consider providing 2 sets of basic cutlery."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great, from the location to the studio itself.
The neighborhood is very calm but also full of great restaurants.

It's a great base for a NYC stay."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jenni’s place is ideal for anyone looking to explore the neighbourhood or NYC in general. The place was very clean, matched the description and the bed was fantastic. The kitchenette is tiny but the fridge and nespresso machine + pods makes a breakfast possible.
The only caveat is that the room is on the frontside so there is some noise, but that’s obviously not Jenni’s fault, just a part of staying at a place in a bustling neighbourhood."

The place is comfortable and well decorated. The neighborhood was quiet and it was easy to get around. I would definitely stay there again on my next trip to NYC!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"There is so much to love about this place. Firstly, the location. If you enjoy films, there is a cute cinema down on the corner. The Subway is also a short walk away. So many great eateries around the corner. We’re runners, and loved running along the piers and over the Brooklyn Bridge before the crowds each day. The studio itself is on the parlour floor of a lovely brownstone, and was very comfortable. No kitchen, but there are so many great food options around the corner. (Mia’s Bakery now know us by name...) We were also glad there was no TV, as there is so much else to do nearby. The decor had a bit of a Scandi feel. Lovely and clean white linen, and a comfy bed. There’s a Nespresso machine, iron, hairdryer and white noise machine, but even though there are neighbours above and below, noise was not a problem. Jenni’s a great host, with east-to follow instructions for check-in, check-out and during your stay. Hope you’ll enjoy this part of New York as much as we did!"

The location and the pictures really made me excited for my trip. Jenni's space did not disappoint. It feels simple yet has everything! Comfortable, laid out beautifully and included everything that I needed. When you step outside, the block is lovely and you can go either direction for a plethora of restaurants, stores and transportation. You can quickly get to many different train lines, if you feel the need to leave this wonderful area! Enjoy and thank you Jenni!!!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment in Cobble Hills is just the perfect place for some time in NYC. The location in Brooklyn is just 20 minutes by feet away from Brooklyn Bridge Park and Brooklyn Heights but gives you a calm and good night sleep after a long day in the City. Located in a side street you can relaxe after busy hours in NYC but still have shops, restaurants and the subway just a few minutes away. We loved the comfy bed, the little kitchen station for a coffee and tea in the morning and the spacious bathroom with a great shower. Communication with Jenni was on point and easy just like checking in. We cannot recommend this experience enough."
2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The location was fine for our purposes and the modest list of amenities did not affect our satisfaction with this lodging. For the price it was definatly cleaner and more pleasant than any hotel room in the area

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great spot!!! Enjoy the best of cobble hill / Brooklyn staying here. It’s also a quick walk to the subway so it’s easy to access Manhattan. We took the F train (5 min walk from the house) pretty much every where we needed to go. It’s clean, quiet, and perfect for a weekend getaway."

Jenni provided fool proof step-by-step photos on how to access keys to the unit. Would stay again if in the area."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jenni’s place is amazing! The studio is so lovely and clean, and the location can’t be beat!! Jenni is also a wonderful host, and made the entire process and stay seamless. Highly recommend!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great spot! Even more beautiful than the pictures and the location is excellent - we especially loved Frankie's 457 and Caputo's Bakery. I'm usually a bad sleeper but I was surprised by how quiet it was - we didn't even have to break out the white noise machine they made available. The bed was also super comfortable. I would love to stay here again the next time I'm in town.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jenni is a fantastic host with great communication and a lovely spot in the heart of Brooklyn. We enjoyed our stay in the one bedroom apartment, as it was the perfect place to lay our heads following days of exploring NYC. Thanks Jenni, you have been awesome!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The location of this Airbnb is perfect. It was right where we wanted to be for the wedding we were attending in Brooklyn. The vicinity to multiple subway stations and so many different restaurants/bars/stores was great. The listing was just as described and was better than a hotel. I've always wanted to stay in a Brownstone in Brooklyn! Would highly recommend. It was ideal for the two of us.

2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jenni's place was so wonderful. The interiors were clean, minimal, and stylishly designed. The location was great with good walkability with lots of restaurants and a subway station nearby. It's much roomier than most hotels I've stayed in in New York so felt comfortable and good to wind down after being out in the city most days."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay at Jennys. Exactly as described in the listing!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jenni's place is perfect. Super quiet and warm, right in between Smith & Court, couple blocks to Bergen stop. Can't be beat. If you're mainly going to bopping around town, this is a super sweet space to crash. The shower is very nice too!"

2021-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Conveniently located, immaculately clean, excellent wi-fi and acceptable shower water pressure.
No TV, but our iPads filled the gap nicely. There’s an interesting climate control remote system that I found a bit puzzling at first, but the host graciously responded quickly when I texted her with operational queries — several times. I should learn to be more tech savvy.
Bottom line, the neighborhood, the room’s cleanliness and extremely close proximity to our son’s brownstone would definitely make us repeat guests. Nice
experience."

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jenni's studio seems too good to be true but this one really is everything it seems! We chose the location because it was close for a friend's wedding but had no clue we would be in the most fun part of Brooklyn! The restaurants, shops, proximity to the subway and Brooklyn Bridge park are all fantastic. Plus the space itself is spacious and gorgeous. Jenni was a fantastic host and we cannot wait to make it back!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot on a quiet residential street with very easy subway or driving access to everywhere, and perfect for a home base in NYC. Minimal kitchen with coffee, tea and fridge - but you really don’t need more as everything (from groceries to restaurants of all types and styles) is within just a couple of blocks. This place is just as pictured and described, has an incredibly comfy bed and a great shower with what appears to be instant hot water. Two of us stayed five nights and everything was perfect! Hope to be repeat users here before long."

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jenni has a great, comfy little studio that made for a great crash pad while staying in NY. Located in a super cute, bustling-yet-not-overwhelming Brooklyn neighborhood, the unit is literally right around the corner from just about anything you'd need-- tons of bars and restaurants, coffee shops, multiple grocery stores and bodegas, etc.--yet still manages to stay relatively quiet (you'll hear the occasional car horn or sidewalk conversation if someone is talking loudly and walking by the studio, but for NY it's reasonable). Definitely recommend Jenni's place."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jenni’s place was perfect for our 5 day stay. The location was great! Restaurants, shops, and subway close by. The room was relaxing to return to at the end of a busy day in the city. 10/10 would recommend!"

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jenni's air bnb was located in an ideal location to allow for easy exploration of Brooklyn, as well as transportation into Manhattan. It was very clean and the atmosphere was inviting and relaxing. Myself and my traveling companion wanted to take the shower home with us (perfect water pressure). It was a great escape from the summer heat with AC. I would absolutely stay again."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely room with a beautiful bath. A very convenient location in Brooklyn, near coffee shops, restaurants and groceries. There is a new restaurant called Brooklyn Sociale at Court Street and Sackett. We really liked it."

2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place,quiet street, perfect little hotel room vibe in the middle of cobble hill. Had a great stay."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved it! Nice and bright. We kept the shades all the way open, letting all the sunlight in, waking up to sun beaming through, it was amazing. Perfect for relaxing sunny mornings with coffee. Such a charming place with lots of space that one wouldn’t get in a hotel room. We loved that it wasn’t on the ground floor like lots of Airbnb places in Brooklyn. The shower pressure was fantastic, the bedding was nice and soft, and the neighborhood was just perfect, with lots of restaurants and shops just around the corner."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jenni’s Cobble Hill apartment is comfortable, clean, stylish, and near the best that this neighborhood has to offer in terms of shops, coffee, bagels, good food, and quick access to the subway station. We felt very safe here. The devil is in the details and she had very high quality towels and bedding. The space is very chic. We loved it and plan to let our fellow travelers know that it is a great option for trips to NY. Thanks Jenni."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I booked Jenni's studio for my son and daughter who were visiting from Colorado, and the space is as lovely as it looks in the photos. It was light, airy, immaculately clean, and beautifully decorated. And the Nespresso machine was an nice touch! I highly recommend!!!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed at Jenni’s place a handful of times. It’s the perfect size and location for us. The place is stylish, clean, and quiet. Jenni is very responsive to questions we have. We would definitely stay at this apartment again"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really great place! Short walk to subway. There is an express train to midtown. The place was really clean. We had a great stay here. Really recommend this place! Milton was very friendly and helpful
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We're so glad we found Milton's apartment! The apartment fully met our expectations for a week long stay in NYC. A well-connected location that allows you to get to many places in a short time (also the accelerated metro stops at the 125th stop, which is located near the apartment). The apartment has all the necessary things like a dryer, an iron, a kettle, and additional kitchen equipment. Very clean and smelling inside! And Milton himself was extremely helpful and flexible in terms of check-in, and very welcoming. We'd love to come back 🤩"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great, we loved our stay. Milton was amazing, the area was awesome. Quick walk to subway and lots of things to do. Will be back for sure!!"

good luck!
DL"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place is spacious, 650m from 125th train station and very convenient to get into central Manhattan or take the bus to get to Central Park. Quiet area. Friendly and welcoming host."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Our first flight was canceled, and our next flight didn't get in til a ridiculous time in the next morning. Milton arranged for a way for us to easily get in at 4 am with very specific instructions and signs that made everything clear. The apartment was extremely clean and just as described. It worked perfectly for our group of 3. The location works well if you are a walking group- we walked back from the subway every evening between 10-midnight. Although there were colorful characters around as expected, it felt safe for someone who wasn't walking alone. Milton also offered to let us keep our luggage at the apartment as our flight didn't leave until 6 pm. We would definitely stay here again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We had a great stay at Milton's place. Apartment was clean and tidy with fully equipped kitchen.
It is about 7 minutes walk to the metro station - I recommend 125 st. station which can be entered from 127 st.
There is a fair-priced grocery shop nearby, and of course a number of deli's where you can get US type phone charger or some beer or water at night."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time at Milton’s Place. Nice and quiet neighbourhood and a short walk to the trains. The apparent was clean and very comfortable!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Milton is a wonderful host and we immediately felt at home. His place is well located and cosy and with a great price-quality ratio. Everything was spotless and the apartment had everything we needed. Metro station is few blocks away and there are shops and restaurants nearby.
Milton is the best host I have ever met and I highly recommend his place for a great and safe experience of New York."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,When arriving NYC we didn't have clear introductions how to check in so we were a little worried. But our taxi driver call to Milton and he arrived at the apartment. When meeting Milton he was wonderfull and pleasant man. Apartment was beautiful and really clean and give us true New York experience. Metro and food markets were close. Next time we will just contact Milton view days earlier before traveling to New York and I know everything will go smoother. Thank you Milton!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Milton was very friendly, inspiring trust. The apartment was spotless. I had everything you need for a good stay. It's an apartment for 2, maximum 3. I would come back without a doubt. One detail to note is that the flight was delayed 24hs and it gave me back one night. Very attentive."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Milton was at his best with us, very welcoming, always smiling. Very good tips for getting around New York and where to shop close to the place.
He was very accommodating on the departure and arrival time, always a quick note, knowing how it went when we met him and always a little time to chat.
I recommend living this place with its fantastic host, it is about ten minutes from a subway mouth that leads to the central points of New York City in less than 30 minutes.
It will be suitable for anyone who wants to rest in the evening, it is very quiet, you can hear very little of the surrounding streets."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice apartment, very clean, well located 10 min from a subway station serving all of New York. Milton is very welcoming and caring.
The neighborhood is a little noisy at night but no worries to get home even late at night.
I will come back without worries for an upcoming trip to New York"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,100% recommended
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"He is a really good host. The apartment is great and located about 9min away from a good subway and like 2min away from a bus stop. The apartment is perfect for two people, four would work as well. Milton was always there for help. He is very flexible to help almost anytime."
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Milton is kind, friendly, helpful. The room was clean and tidy. Transportation is excellent. Bus, metro is a short walk away. However, it's not a very clean neighborhood, it didn't seem safe in the evening."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Milton was so kind and friendly! He walked us into the apartment/studio himself and showed us around giving us a few recommendations around the area as well!
The place was exactly as pictured—perfect size for a couple! He had all the basics there ready to go as well.
Overall highly recommend!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The very first host we've encountered who waited for us outside their home, greeted us, walked us in, showed us their home, & most of all, chatted with us the moment we arrived! I was shocked because most hosts do not do this, so it was meant a lot & it definitely made both my husband & I feel at home. Milton was super kind & friendly. His home looked exactly the photos & was very clean. It's a very big space (especially for 2 people) compared to the hotels I've stayed at in NYC. Very comfy bed & the duvet was amazing! The brownstone home is just a 5 min walk from the subway which was a plus! There's also a deli & grocery store down the block if you want to grab some chopped cheese late at night. We'd love to stay here every time we visit NYC! It was such a pleasant stay & it's all because of that very first greet the moment we got out of our Uber. It makes such a big difference in the world to be greeted by your host! See you soon Milton!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"It was great staying at Milton's, the apartment was really beautiful, cozy, just like the photos.
It's possible to be more beautiful, our anticipated.
We almost didn't want to leave the apartment in the morning as we felt at home.
Milton was a very kind gentleman, helpful, always smiling.
The place is very good, from the metro it was 8-10 minutes about, around there are small shops, entertainment all what anyone needs :-)
We felt safe , we walked the house in the evening after dark, and everything was in order.
It's about 15 minutes by subway to the center, so you're quick.
Nas pobyl jsme si velmi velmi nazi a week plans to inspire NY sweat, and rozhodne by jsme si sweat without vahani booked ubytovani in Milton:-)
Milton moc decoupage."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Milton is a different person and extremely polite. Very helpful and friendly.
The house is exactly as the listing displays. It's very nice, the space is perfect for two.
The area is very quiet. I recommend walking around clubs in the evening, it's very lively!
Perfect location. Although not central you can reach everything with only one metro line."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Milton’s place was as described and a great place for a few days in New York. It’s a close walk to two subway stations and buses. On two of the three nights, there was music played outside one of the surrounding buildings but it stopped after about 15 minutes.
Milton was a great host and was very accommodating. He met us early to take our bags before the room was ready, and allowed us to drop keys off as we had to leave a day early. Milton was great chatting with and was always very responsive when we chatted.
We would happily stay with Milton again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The host, Milton, made us feel at home and was even kind enough to accommodate our need to drop off luggage a bit early. We had the 2nd floor street-facing room which was very clean, spacious, and well arranged. Towels were clean, plenty of hangers, comfortable L-sofa, full sized fridge/freeze and microwave, and other kitchen essentials we would need. The drip coffee machine was essential for our morning routine so it was well appreciated. We always looked forward to returning to the comfortable and relaxing room after a long day of exploring NYC to wind down. If I were to return to the area I would definitely put Milton's place at the top of my list again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Everything was great, great host. Always happy to stay again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful stay, the location is great, with a 10-minute walk you can walk to the subway and from there you go anywhere in Manhattan. The price is affordable compared to the city average, given that it is a real apartment equipped with a kitchen (complete with all comforts) and private bathroom. If I have to find an aspect to improve, it is the availability of bathroom cleaning products and an extra set of towels, especially if the stay is longer than three days. I absolutely recommend it. Milton is very good and available"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The stay was PERFECT
Location: Connected to Columbus Circle in 2 stops (downtown)
Ambient: Residential neighborhood, no problem. Surrounded by supermarkets.
Apartment: same as in the photos, comfortable bed, very clean bathroom and impeccable kitchen.
Despite the delay in our arrival, Milton put all the facilities to get to the apartment even waited for us on the door to welcome us.
A very attentive host.
We would definitely repeat our stay at your accommodation. THANK YOU."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Impeccable apartment, with everything you need, Milton, an excellent person, gave us flexible hours for check-in and check-out in addition to very good recommendations and was always on the lookout"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Miltons place was amazing! Firstly he was the most incredible host, so friendly and kind, waited up late to let us in past midnight due to delayed flights, and the apartment was incredible. Great location, close to subway and walking distance to Central Park with amazing local food. Made the trip the best I have ever been on!! Would stay again in a heart beat!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Cozy apartment as seen in the listing. Very clean and the kitchen has everything you need to prepare breakfasts.
Milton is 10: he greeted us kindly even though we were a little late, he explained everything to us, gave us recommendations and allowed us to delay the departure until our flight time.
The location of the apartment is perfect because it has very close to the 125st station that allows you to get to the center in 15 minutes (lines A and D especially).
Despite being in Harlem, it's a safe neighborhood (we moved around the night and first thing in the morning and we never had a problem). It is true that there are certain groups that are formed at night but they never told us anything, although perhaps the worst thing is the noise they generate, that if you have light sleep you do not rest well.
It is a recommended accommodation to spend a few days in New York at a price and with a reasonable quality."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very great location that you can reach so many different line bus, subway to NY downtown, uptown, Brooklyn. Super Convenience you can park your own car at his space and get a 7 days bus pass. Then you good to go anywhere and save a lot of parking fee in DT. Our family has good experience at Milton’s home."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you Milton for your hospitality and responsiveness. Staying at your cozy place, I felt like I was reliving memories of my Harlem days in the city in real time."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Milton was a delightful host, and the place was exactly what you see in the photos.

Would definitely recommend his place to everyone!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Milton was super flexible and welcomed us in person late at night. We felt right at home and we were also allowed to stay longer in the apartment and shower again to be fresh before departure. Milton came by again and said goodbye to us in person. We were rarely welcomed so warmly
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Milton is a delicious person attentive and very attentive. Thank you for this very warm welcome.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Milton is a wonderful person and we couldn’t have asked for any better host for our first stop on our USA trip. Milton is so nice, responsive and helpful with check-in, check-out and any other questions that might come up. The apartment is clean, well furnished and very comfortable. The kitchen has everything that is needed to make breakfast or to cook basic meals. Harlem in general is a little further away from the typical sights, but we really enjoyed walking through the Central Park and there is a subway station relatively close by to go to downtown. The neighborhood itself also offers plenty of food and fun places to visit.
We had a wonderful stay and would recommend Milton’s place 100%. We would love to come back!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Everything went perfectly. Milton is very nice, responsive, and has good advice. We arrived at 10pm which was not a problem

The apartment is decorated with a lot of love, very clean and stocked with everything you might need.
Milton is always available and can give valuable tips.
Metro stop within walking distance, you can quickly get to all the sights. Several supermarkets around the corner.
If we come back to New York, Milton will be our number one port of call."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Milton is a very kind and helpful person, he gave us the opportunity to stay more in the apartment at the time of check out, until our departure (really appreciated)! We found a very clean house, super fragrant and comfortable.
It is located in downtown Harlem, a 5-minute walk from the subway which is connected to all of New York. There are supermarkets and restaurants underneath the house.
We immersed ourselves in the typical culture of the area, different from the city center.
If I had to go back to New York, I'd stay at Milton's without thinking about it!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Milton was easily the best Airbnb host I have encountered. Clean room and above and beyond service. I would recommend anyone planning to visit New York to consider this place if it's available. Big fan.

Since Milton didn’t have any guest after us, he let us stay a little bit longer so we could wait for our flight peacefully in the appartement.
Perfect service!"

He was very responsive via phone and quickly came to our aid when the lock got jammed on our door, and had the issue repaired immediately.

Nice fresh towels, very comfortable bedding, toiletries and cleaning products, a hairdryer, and a well equipped kitchen. The studio has lots of natural light and a bright airy feel with lovely high ceilings and some characterful furniture. We loved the location as it was very conveniently near Columbia, but also near the express subway lines for exploring the rest of manhattan. We felt safe and secure in the area and it was near a couple of different grocery stores and some cultural landmarks like the Apollo. Milton was welcoming, friendly and very responsive to any questions and was kindly flexible with our checkout time. I would definitely recommend staying here."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Milton's place was a lovely home base for exploring Manhattan! I appreciated the toasty heating and cozy bed during an end-of-March cold snap, and enjoyed using the kitchen to fortify myself with coffee in the morning and to heat up leftovers from the many excellent restaurants nearby. Convenient location near the 125th St. subway stop. Milton was also gracious and easy to reach and get assistance from. Highly recommended!"

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Milton’s place was a pleasure! The place it self, was so cute and very comforting. The location was great as well. I felt very safe the entire time I stayed there. There was a subway entry just a couple blocks away which was very convenient. As well as a couple of grocery stores close by to get essentials. Milton was a great host! Responded to text messages very quickly and was willing to help with any questions we had. Check in and check out was incredibly easy. Overall it was a great experience and would highly recommend Milton’s place to other, and would stay there again."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Milton is a gentle and helpful host.
His place is excellent, super clean, comfortable, beautiful, has everything we need to prepare simple meals, near the subway and there are supermarkets, restaurants, pharmacy around the neighborhood.
I strongly recommend it."

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"LOVED IT!
The apartment looks exactly as it does in the pictures. Super clean with brand new appliances. It's a great location within walking distance to the Apollo Theater and other landmarks, two fitness clubs, a grocery store, and the A, C, E trainis. Milton was a great host. He met me at the apartment and even helped me with my luggage. I highly recommend the location and the host!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place for a great price! Convenient location to get anywhere in the city. Close to public transit stations.
Neighborhood felt safe, even late at night.
Just don’t bank on a hot shower at the end of the day - warm if you’re lucky."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A quiet apartment in a huge city. Great place to escape to after spending time downtown. Amazing location and the host will make your stay memorable. Parking is not tough at all, Subway is just a couple blocks away, and plenty of good eats nearby in case you get back late from the city. Definitely the place to stay in NYC and will be coming back."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed my stay at Milton's place. Check in was easy, Milton met me at the apartment and was very flexible on time as i had several delays in artiving. The apartment was a great value,
was exactly as it appears in the photos and very clean. It had everything i needed for my weeks stay in NYC. It was a bit further out from most of the sights i planned to see in central Manhattan however it was very well connected with express trains so i had no difficulty getting where i wanted to go."

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Milton was honestly such an amazing host. He was so flexible with us and made sure that we had everything we needed (recommendations, transportation help, etc) considering it was our first time in NYC. The location was very nice - my boyfriend and I came back home late a couple nights and we had no problem walking out late at night. The place itself had all the accommodations that one could need as well - we very much enjoyed our stay there and will definitely be back! Thank you again, Milton!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Milton's place is a great price for the size and location and is very well kept. You can tell he takes a lot of pride in being a host. Friendly and very helpful. Everything about the stay was good. If you are parking a car be mindful of the limited parking because of the location. Of course this is no reflection on the residence or the host, just something to note. And it is very convenient to the subway!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay! First impression was Milton going out of his way to help us up the stairs upon our arrival! He is so kind and inviting!

It allowed us to feel like we were getting a true New York City experience. Kids (4 & 7) liked it too. Milton was friendly and getting the key was an easy process (though it did take me a min to figure out the locks- easy once i got it). Would definitely book again if we return & it's available."

Apartment was spotless with everything we needed and Milton was the perfect host . As I said of your happy to stay in Harlem I would well recommend."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very nice host and convenient facilities.
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute and cozy place for 2 people. The apartment was nice and clean when we came. I had a wonderful time in NY and it's easy to get anywhere in NY since the subways are close.

2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place for 2 or 3 people. The area is nice because it is quiet and many restaurants, bars and supermarket just a 10 or 15-minute walk away. The proximity to metro station 125, makes it very easy to get around everywhere in manhattan.
In addition, Milton is a very friendly host who responds quickly to messages."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great apartment in Harlem. Close to the Subway and to markets, delis and other local shops. Located in an old building, but very spacious and well furnished. Excelent cost-benefit and very kind host."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Milton’s apartment is lovely! Perfectly furnished & stocked, modern and incredibly clean! We had a small problem with one of the windows and Milton was there to help the second he was available-he’s so attentive! Milton has great city tips and is really fun to chat with, as well. He’ll make you feel completely welcome. 🙂
The flat is just a few blocks from the A & D express lines, so getting to Midtown (42nd Street) only takes 2 stops. There’s also a large grocery store literally just around the corner. I stay in Harlem every time I visit New York, but Milton’s place is my new favorite."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I highly recommend Milton's apartment! The location is ideal, the neighborhood is really very nice and safe despite the a priori on Harlem.
Milton is a friendly, thoughtful and very accommodating host. We had a great stay!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is small but very cozy. It has everything you need for a new york stay, since we spend more time strolling at home.
Everything in the house is very nice and the energy is positive. The neighborhood at first made me doubt the safety of the place, which was overcome at the beginning, attending markets and because it is, the region, very familiar and quiet.
The value was excellent. I would definitely come back. Everything is close by, from fast food chains to party-city."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,The Apartment was great. 5 minutes to the Subway station and 15 minutes to the center of Manhattan. Milton was the best host ever. He was so kind all the time and explained us what New York has to offer. I will definitely chose this place again!
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very Nice appartment, clean and Well furnished. Milton was always available when necessary, nice and helpful."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"milton's place is very well-appointed, it has all the amenities. Its owner is a very attentive gentleman who was always attentive to answer our questions. With the subway in 10 minutes they arrive at the main streets of New York.l"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I met Milton’s assistant, Yuneiva. She was very kind and she’s available if you have any question. The apartment is very well located (near the 125th station- line A) and one last point... it’s clean !!!"
2019-08-01,4,Stayed about a week,"The apartment is located close to the subway station, to food stores, fast-food and restaurants. It is very easy and fast to reach the most important museums and monuments of NYC; we haven't had any problem and we recommend it."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Milton's place is clean and has everything you need for a short stay. Comfy bed, clean kitchen and clean bathroom.
Little warning: hot and cold water are switched in the shower. Once you know it, there's nothing in this place to worry about.
Milton made the place cool in preparation of our trip so we didn't have to worry about the heatwave.
It's not in the center of Manhattan but the use of citybikes and close metro stations take you there in no time.
A good place to stay for a good price!
We enjoyed our stay and definitly recommand it!"
2019-07-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Near the metro but it's walking a little
2019-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Milton is AMAZING! He was very nice and helpful, we were insured to have no problems walking around the neighborhood and did not run into any even while taking the train home late night. He was quick to respond to any questions we had and when I asked him if he had an iron he came knocking on the door and brought one for me. His hospitality is outstanding. The apartment is stocked with things you might not even think you need, but do!
Definitely would come back to Milton’s place for my next visit to New York City! :)
p.s—
If you’re looking for a great breakfast spot near by you will not be disappointed with “The Edge Harlem”."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Milton’s place was absolutely way better than we initially expected. Although we had our doubts about the distance from the place to downtown Manhattan, this proved to be no problem at all due to the subway located just a few blocks away.
Milton’s attention to detail really amazed us, as everything we could need was readily available. Pots & pans, a coffee machine, hairdryers.. you name it.
If you’re planning on staying in New York and want to experience some other parts of the city (Harlem) and don’t want to spend a month’s salary, this is the perfect place to stay!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful two night stay, I would recommend Alaric’s home to anyone looking for a place to rest between adventures in Brooklyn. He even gave us insight into the house and neighborhood!"
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Alaric and Anne were nice hosts.
You have some subway stations nearby and they give helpful recommendations for restaurants etc.
The place is clean and special as it is a very old renovated building with a lot of dark wood."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Alaric's home was like staying in a museum Brownstone, in that, it was such a historical and beautifully kept home that we felt we were stepping back in time. Both hosts were gracious and happy to tell more about the home and neighborhood's history...Alaric is practically a history professor in terms of his knowledge and experience. The space: the room is small, as described, but is very comfortable. The bathroom and bedroom are quite private and there is the added plus of a gorgeous backyard garden complete with birds to greet us each morning and comfortable seating in which to start and end our day. The neighborhood is full of wonderful restaurants (don't miss Olde Brooklyn Bagel Shoppe nearby) and walking distance to the Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn Central Library, Brooklyn Botanical Gardens. It's an easy subway ride into Manhattan; getting cross Brooklyn is a little more complicated, but doable. We look forward to staying here again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay at this historic Airbnb. Although we didn’t spend much time inside, the host were very nice and even greeted us outside to make our life easier finding the place. This was the first time we ever met our host for an Airbnb stay and I only hope there’s more like them in the future! Nevertheless, very fast & communicative, plus give you plenty of privacy. The only issue which is pretty much out of their hands would be parking if you’re driving a car, it will take some time but eventually you’ll find a place close (hopefully). My wife and I would definitely stay again and recommend this place to others if you’re having a quick stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a hidden gem in a nice neighborhood. The owners live in the house, but the guest space is private and separate from the owners space. There is a lovely private back garden- a true oasis in the city. Alaric and Annie were really terrific hosts who clearly love their antique brownstone."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Aleric and Anne were gracious and great hosts. I spent a week in their garden room and felt very comfortable there. Particularly convenient was the small walk-in closet, in which all my belongings were well accommodated. I slept wonderfully, the birds chirping in the morning, which was always a good start to the day. Subway, etc., everything was right around the corner. Good restaurants on Vanderbilt Ave. as well. A beautiful lively neighborhood, I love to stroll through the streets there. And of course - Aleric and Anne's house is a landmark in itself!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great time staying at the Airbnb. It is a great location in Brooklyn, walking distance to restaurants and coffee shops. The place felt private and was very quiet. The host was friendly and responsive. Highly recommend!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Very nice room, in a house of character, away from the urban hustle and bustle while being very well located (two metro stations nearby, Brooklyn Botanical Garden a stone's throw away...). Very welcoming hosts."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Alaric and his wife are wonderful hosts and they have put an enormous amount of work into restoring their home. They’re hard work pays off in the authenticity and beauty of their home. I would most definitely return if I need to go back to Brooklyn.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"great stay, thank you Alaric!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Alarics was great. The room and the house is beautifully equipped with antique furnitures and we felt at home. Alaric gave a lot of insides about the area and the local history. He and his wife were very helpful and kind.
There are tons of restaurants and grocery stores in walking distance and there are two subway stations close by to bring you to Manhattan and the Bronx fast. When I come back I'll will definitely stay again at Alarics."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We felt extremely comfortable, the location and amenities are perfect for a city trip. The hosts are very friendly and accommodating!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were warmly welcomed in this beautiful house. The room and bathroom were small but comfortable and very quiet. Ann and Alaric know a lot about the history of their home, the district and the city. They give good tips about restaurants nearby, beautiful streets to walk through, etc. It is a good base to explore Brooklyn and Manhattan. There are several metro lines nearby."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very convenient location, good communication, friendly host"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We stayed for a week and it was super nice! Really good spot for people who want to be accessible to the city but don’t want to stay in Manhattan. There’s multiple subways near the house and it takes only 15 minutes ish to get across the water. Alaric and his wife were super nice, gave lots of recommendations and very friendly, and their cats are very nice! We had a really good time, definitely a good choice for couples or single travelers. Despite it being in someone else’s home, you really forgot until you hear someone in the kitchen. Very separated and easy to keep to yourself but they’re also right there if you need them. Thanks for everything, Alaric and Anne!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Alaric was an exceptional host: hospitable, friendly, knowledgeable and very accommodating. This stay was unparalleled and will blow your mind if you like a restored turn of the century setting that is pristine, peaceful and out of the ordinary. The room was comfortable and very private."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay in Brooklyn. It’s a good spot if you mostly need a place to sleep. The garden area would be nice in less rainy weather. Alaric and Ann were very friendly and gave us a tour of their first floor and his restoration.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Alaric and Anne were super accommodating and very friendly! They were so kind to share such a unique space with us.

Thanks again for such an awesome experience !
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean and comfy. Hosts are very nice and the cat is super cute :3

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is a gem. The value is great considering the character of the space. It's refreshing to stay somewhere where the care for the space and appointed furniture and interiors are so evident. We appreciated Alaric's hospitality and would definitely stay there again.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was a pleasure to stay with Alaric. He was always able to give us great recommendations on where we could eat and what activities were local. The Olde Brooklyn Bagel Shoppe was amazing. They had delicious bagels. Cousin John's Cafe and Bakery was excellent too.
Alaric knew the history of the area and shared it with us.
This was my first Airbnb stay. I was impressed and will try other Airrbnbs. If I need a place to stay in the same area I will definitely stay with Alaric again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, great location, great hosts. Alaric and Anne were friendly and great at communicating. The room is comfortable and has a lovely view of the beautiful garden and I hope to stay here again the next time I’m in Brooklyn."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alaric and Ann are excellent hosts.

Their home is beautiful and the garden apartment is cozy and comfortable. We really enjoyed our stay!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved our stay! Quiet neighborhood, comfortable space and bed and friendly and hospitable hosts.

We felt right at home. Will be back to stay on our next visit!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Alaric and his wife were very accommodating and welcoming despite our later than anticipated arrival. The check in process was easy and their home had all of the amenities we had hoped for. Would love to see them again during a future stay in NYC!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Friendly hosts, quiet comfortable room."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"As others have said, Alaric and Ann are absolutely wonderful hosts and their home is beautifully restored and appointed. If you are a fan of ‘Gilded Age’, you will love staying here and hearing about the history of the house and neighborhood. I had wonderful conversations with both Alaric and Ann—they are warm, welcoming and very down to earth. Great location for access to the park and surrounding neighborhoods. Cannot recommend more highly!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,This stay was phenomenal. Alaric has placed tremendous amount of work in the home and has restored it to it’s original state. This is a timeless treasure. The detailing and architecture truly speaks volumes to the work that has gone into the home. Alaric is a caretaker and really illustrates this is in how well the home is maintained.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,We stayed for 1 night. Everything as discribed. Alaric is a friendly person and answered every question we had. Metro is not far away.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I stayed one night but wish it was more. Next time we stay in Brooklyn this is the place we want to be. It is located within walking distance to many restaurants, cafe, Brooklyn Library, Brooklyn Botanical Gardens and Brooklyn Museum. We lived in BK for many years and since moving away last year we miss the culture, arts, and food. This was a perfect location for us. The space itself is very special. Alaric has restored this home to museum level. We slept in a solid wooden bed made by his ancestors in the 1700’s! The bedroom and bathroom are off the kitchen that Alaric and his wife use, but our privacy was never compromised. The bedroom is extremely quiet as it is adjacent to the garden patio and not the street. Our sleep was peaceful. The bathroom is tiny but efficiently spaced, full of charm, clean, and the water heats up quickly. Alaric is a lovely host who has a wealth of information about Brooklyn. If you are interested in history then chatting with him is bonus."

2023-12-01,4,Stayed one night,"This was a very last minute booking, so I was really only looking for a place to sleep while visiting family in Brooklyn and NYC. Alaric is delighted to share a lot of information about his home, the neighborhood and NYC and Brooklyn history. This home would be a great match for someone wanting to immerse themselves in the rich history of the area and the beauty of a lovingly restored Victorian home. The room was comfortable and the location excellent for my needs. Be aware that you will need to be checked in and out by the host-this is not a lock box home. Not an issue if you are able to make those arrangements easily. Alaric is a gracious, engaged host."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing stay! This gorgeously-restored Victorian brownstone is like stepping back 125 years to the NY of the Vanderbilts and Astors, and our lovely hosts couldn't have been kinder. Conveniently located with lots of walkable activities, I only wish we could have stayed longer! Don't pass this up if you're in the area."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Alaric and Anne were super hospitable and accommodating. Me and my Wife would totally come back. Also there is so much history in this house.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Alaric, is a super cool person with a wealth of knowledge and experience. He gave me a very interesting history of the neighborhood and he film industry and some of its pioneers. I was in town for the Book of How and it was literally the perfect location. I was also able to grab some good eats and walked past the Brooklyn museum although it was closed. I hope to be back soon, for the Spike Lee exhibit and would definitely stay with Alaric and his wife. I will say, I can wait to see the garden in full bloom but it was perfect for someone who likes the gloomy look, like myself. Also, there is a cat that hangs out, and is a cute little fluff ball. The bed was comfortable and I found myself not wanting to get up and head to D.C. you will enjoy your stay. Thanks again !!!"

I'm willing to stay again if I come to New York again! Thank you Alaric!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Alaric is a great host, and a very interesting person. He has spent years lovingly and skillfully renovating his impressive Park Slope Brownstone. He has restored many of the original interior features of the original building, and it is a true work of art. As for the accommodations, the bed was very comfy, the temperature cosy, the space decoration authentic, and the bathroom, though obviously not original to a traditional brownstone, has a lovely shower with ample warm water. The location is a prime one, mere steps from coffee shop and restaurant filled Vanderbilt and a very short distance from Grand Army Plaza, the Main Brooklyn Branch of the NY Library, the Brooklyn Museum, and entrances to Prospect Park. We even found it easy to park!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Alaric and Anne are top-notch hosts and terrific people! We felt at home with them instantly. Really enjoyed our conversations with them and learned so much.

It was really nice to have coffee in the morning and to have a chat about anything from the neighborhood to the history of the NY subway system to science fiction. The house is easy to reach by public transit and is in a safe neighborhood with lots of little restaurants, cafés and stores. Highly recommended, especially if you're into historical buildings."

Alaric goes out of his way to be available to check-in, check-out, show you his wonderfully restored historic home, spend time telling you about the neighborhood and pointing me in the right direction for where I was going. He even walked me down the street to show me where the subway station was located.
I loved my private room and bath that was right off the outside garden and the lovingly restored brownstone. It was comfortable, clean and efficiently functional. So interesting inside with late 19th century and early 20th century details throughout. Great outdoor garden in the back too.
Alaric made tea for me each morning and he's so interesting and personable to spend time chatting with. Love his two large Maine Coon cats too. I parked for free on the same block all weekend. I would definitely stay here again. Great experience."

2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Alaric and his wife were very warm and welcoming hosts. They have done significant renovations to this house, including the creation of this very compact space as an Airbnb. I felt very safe walking around there at night by myself, or at any time. The entrance, to my relief, was at ground level. It opened onto an incredible garden in the back, entirely surrounded by walls. I had driven, and had expected that parking would be a major challenge. The first day I found a legal spot just a couple of buildings down from the Airbnb, and just left it there a few days until I needed to use it. When I returned, I found another legal spot right on the street. Although Alaric had warned me to read the signs, I forgot what day it was and got a ticket."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A stay at Alaric's is an invitation to cross into a realm of artistry, to give opening to the quiet whispers of a home which is its own wonderful story.
From the moment I walked down the quiet, tree-lined street, and opened the spired iron gate, with its ever so slight announcement of my arrival, I was taken with this home.
From the moment Alaric made sure I knew the layout of this warm, enchanting accomadation, and then spent time engaging me, I knew I had found that most elusive of treasures: a host whose deepest instincts are based in the host-guest relationship we all read about in classic literature. The guest matters.
This stay was, simply, essential and wonderful."

I think it's a very special place
It preserves the traditional feel of 100 years ago, but it's convenient to use the bathroom or remodeling.
It was well remodeled, so there was no inconvenience at all.
The location is right next to Prospect Park, so it's really nice to take a quick walk, bike, or jog in the early morning.
Thanks to Alaric and Anne's hospitality and service, I was able to stay comfortably!
In particular, Alaric's house tour on the last day was a great impression of this house and Brooklyn in particular!
I'm leaving with such a good memory!!! From Justin From Korea!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing host. Very friendly, accommodating, and extremely knowledgeable about the area and in a very beautiful house. Would definitely recommend and stay here again. Thanks again guys!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Alaric and Ann were very friendly and their home was beautiful! We enjoyed our stay.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"A great stay in a beautifully restored Victorian brownstone in the Prospect Heights area, not far from Grand Army Plaza, Brooklyn Museum, etc, so a lovely place to stay and very well located. In particular, the bed is super-comfortable, which counts for a lot in my book. Aleric and his wife are very friendly and approachable and excellent hosts. Would definitely stay there again if I'm visiting Brooklyn."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay - especially loved having coffee with Alaric and Anne and learning more about their beautiful Victorian home. The area is also great for restaurants & easy access to subway station.
2022-12-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and Alaric was a very helpful and friendly host. Alaric's home gives you the feeling of staying in a museum since most of the original features of this Brooklyn brownstone are preserved. Staying in a private room is always a little tricky and I found this one not entirely comfortable, partly due to the awkwardness of having access to my bedroom via the kitchen, which was off limits to guests. The bedroom itself was at the back of the house, so it was quiet and comfortable, although the furnishings were a bit run-down. The private bathroom adjoining the bedroom was functional but cramped."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had a truly lovely stay. Alaric is a wonderful host - he went above and beyond with flexible checkin, morning bagels, and a tour of the incredible house. Thanks so much again!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place and location!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"So glad we choose Alaric's Airbnb! Communication with Alaric was great. We arrived to Brooklyn early and Alaric was very accommodating in greeting us and letting us drop our bags while we went out and enjoyed our day and evening. Great guy as well as his partner Anne. We let them know we would be up early for a run in Prospect Park and coffee set-up was waiting when we woke up.
Loved the house tour and yes, we will be back for a longer stay in the Spring."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had a wonderful time! Absolutely reccomend booking this room, beautiful house and walkable location, host is very friendly."

Very comfortable place to stay with welcoming host. Perfect spot to enjoy Brooklyn. We would love to return."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful stay at Alaric's beautiful brownstone home. The location was fantastic and easy to get to by subway. Many amenities within walking distance and he also offered us coffee and bagels! Alaric gave us a tour of his impressively restored Victorian home so if you're a history buff and/or design nerd you'll love it. Would stay here again!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our host was incredibly helpful when it came to checking in. When we arrived he made sure to give us a brief yet detailed description of the neighborhood as well as some local recommendations. The house was beautifully kept with the original Victorian-era decor and was very neat and clean when we arrived. If you need a place to stay in Brooklyn, you should definitely check this out!"

Nice powerful shower. Alaric very forthcoming with local tips and history, as well as his restoration history of the authentically restored old house. There are a couple of friendly cats. I'd definitely book there again."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a lovely place to stay. Alaric and Anne were very kind hosts and the house itself was beautiful. The room was comfortable, clean, and cozy. We will return!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a truly wonderful stay at Alaric's home in one of the best parts of Brooklyn. When you walk through the front door, you are transported to the dawn of the twentieth century in a beautifully restored brownstone (despite also having all of the modern amenities). Alaric is incredibly knowledgeable about the history of the area and has some great stories about the home and its restoration. we came during the wrong season, but I'm sure the back yard blooms nicely to create a little sanctuary over the spring and summer. The cats were calm and friendly, and Alaric's partner was also very welcoming - all in all, this is a charming place to stay and I would highly recommend it to a friend planning a visit to NYC."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fantastic location for food, Brooklyn Museum, Botanic Gardens, Prospect Park. Chatty host with encyclopedic knowledge of the area and lots of helpful recommendations. Very flexible and communicative. Winter visitors will love the heated bedroom floor!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Be sure to check it out! The water goes down well, the shower is good, the garden is nice and the house is great!
If you want to feel the quiet Brlyn life in Brooklyn, you must come.
It looks like a great set that can be seen in a movie in the house!
It looked like an old building, so I was worried at first, but there was an ondol in the room, and it was warm.
Above all, the cats in this house are so cute and beautiful!
One of the best airbnbs ever I'd experienced. book it right now!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I can highly recommend renting this place for several reason; it lies in Prospect Heights, which is a cool neighbourhood with nice bars and restaurants, close to Prospect Parc, the Brooklyn Museum a.o. Grand Army Plaza, which is the nearest Subway station, is only a 3 minutes' walk away, and has trains that take you to Manhattan and even connects you to the LIRR train which is the most affordable way on your way back and forth, to and from JFK. Last, but certainly not least, Alaric is a great host, and makes you feel welcome and knows a lot about Brooklyn and NY in general and is more than happy to share it with you - if you have time for it!"

I normally stay in a totally private apartment/condo/house when using Airbnb, but decided to try a room within a house since I was staying in NYC for only one night. I was pleased with the privacy in Alaric’s beautifully restored home, and enjoyed exploring all the neighborhood has to offer (park, museum, restaurants, shops) within walking distance. And Alaric is a generous and welcoming host who clearly enjoys regaling guests with info and anecdotes about the city’s history!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hard to express how thrilled we were being guests of Alaric and Anne in their wonderful historic house.

Both geniuses in their own way, we had the most inspired conversations and it was really hard for us to say goodbye. Looking forward to come back, we can recommend this address to anyone looking for a seriously unique experience in the style of de golden days of brownstone time Brooklyn. We say: Five Stars!"

It is a very comfortable house for 2 people, it has the fundamental elements for a stay, and it is also in an unbeatable location. Literally minutes away on foot from Grand Central Station and Central Park. It's also close to major subway networks. Comfortable bed, silence in the building to rest, hot shower, adequate air conditioning, good internet speed, new dishes, and more, a luxury!

The area is a quiet and peaceful neighbourhood but with bars and restaurants a couple of minute's walk away. The subway was less than 5 minutes walk away and the train took us to the heart of Manhattan with no changes. We also walked around Brooklyn as far as the Brooklyn bridge - which was around a 30 -40 minute walk.
Anyone wanting to stay in New York away from the centre and in a quiet and relaxed area - Mark's apartment is ideal"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mark's place was fantastic. Beautiful neighborhood, very peaceful, a nice oasis from the busy city but still close to everything.

It was an easy 40 minute subway ride from the Amtrak/Penn Station on the F train. Loved exploring the Red Hook area - fascinating history and home to Steve’s Authentic Key Lime Pie. Highly recommend Sunny’s Bar in Red Hook especially on a night when they have musicians playing. We got to hear a great jazz band. Also Cobble Hill Coffee Shop for an old-school breakfast diner experience located within a 5 minute walk from Mark’s place."

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Great location. Hosts went out of their way to help with internet issues that were not their fault. Easy access to trains and the neighborhood has lots to do when you don't want to be in Manhattan.

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful, clean, and comfortable Airbnb with a wonderful host. Carroll Gardens is a lovely neighborhood, and it was easy for us to get to other areas of the city. Quiet, private, and a perfect place to relax after a busy day exploring. Our stay was everything we hoped it would be!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mark's place is not only convenient with regards to the location, but also very clean and exactly as described in the photos and other guests. LOTS of neighbourhood restaurants and cafes nearby (Baby Luc's was *chef's kiss*), and a short walk to the station which serves the F and G trains -- and that F train can take you almost everywhere it seems like. I would definitely recommend Mark's space to anyone who is thinking of visiting Brooklyn/New York City!"

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space was perfect for us. We spent a TON of time running around manhattan and having a comfy space where we could easily come back to with little commute was a game changer.
Carroll Gardens is one of those neighborhood that shows the charm of brooklyn and the people that make the community. We truly felt apart of walking through court street.
We also got great sleep. The bed was so comfy!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mark’s place was so comfortable and cozy. It’s conveniently located a few minutes walk away from an MTA stop, which I thought would be loud. Not at all! The couch and bed are comfy- much needed after a day of exploring the city! The bathroom looks very small in the photos, and being 5’11” that concerned me at first, but it was perfect and very functional. They’ve made a great use of the space. Their neighborhood is so cute and feels so safe, and has some great food places. We highly recommend Via Roma for pizza, and Le Petit Cafe for any meal!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mark was a great host! He helped us with everything we needed. The apartment was really cute, comfortable and clean. Loved our stay!
Also Mark was really thoughtful with checking in and out :)"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and wonderful space. We loved staying here! Definitely recommend staying here if you want to experience Brooklyn and have easy access to Manhattan.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Both Mark and his place were wonderful. The space is very private and so spacious for New York. We loved that there was a door to separate the spaces so one of us could sleep while the other worked. The place was spotless, comfortable, and had everything we needed. Mark was very kind to introduce himself when we checked in, but then gave us our space throughout our stay. He also responded immediately when we had questions. The neighborhood is lovely and parking wasn't too hard- even on a weekday. We loved the proximity to restaurants, shops, and the subway and, besides some evening track work, it was easy to get into Manhattan. Would definitely recommend and would love to stay again."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The room, location and hosts were amazing. The house is beautiful and I loved the gardens, actually they made me very jealous. So beautiful. I will make every effort to stay at this house during future trips to Brooklyn."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"10/10 would recommend! We had a great time staying here and have absolutely nothing to complain about.

Mark and Deanna are lovely hosts and very kind and accommodating. Thank you so much for a wonderful stay and for your hospitality! :)"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"All the accolades from other reviews are spot on so I dont need to repeat them. I will just add that, beginning at the front gate, it is one of those Airbnb’s that fantastically exceed expectations and make me pretend I live there permanently. Also, I marvel how it can be that clean and sparkly, I thought it was a brand renovation. Mark really helped me with parking, which is a mystery only true New Yorkers can understand. No doubt you will love staying here if you’re lucky enough to get it. I also did an Airbnb experience food tour in the Carroll gardens/cobble hill area with urban adventures and it made my trip all the more unique and special."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is the best place to stay in Carol Gardens. Clean, beautifully decorated and immaculate.Quiet and cool AC in the heat of this summer.
I highly recommend this place for the beautiful apartment and the garden."

The apartment was exceptionally clean and bright with comfortable, quality furniture. The large gardens in the yard are beautiful and very well maintained. It's a perfect spot for your morning coffee or evening drink. Smith Street has great restaurants and bars within easy walking distance. I highly recommend!"

Also the location is perfect, there are lots of cafes and bars around and its close to the subway.

Thank you very much, Dan!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From the moment I arrived I felt comfortable, safe and as if at home.
The room and the apartment are spacious & welcoming, and sharing the space with Dan felt natural from beginning to end.
While some windows of the room open to a bigger street, it wasn’t too noisy for me. I’m a pretty light sleeper and regular earplugs where enough to tune the nyc street sounds out pretty much completely.
Definitely the best co-living airbnb experience I‘ve had. Thanks a lot, Dan!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Easy check in, Dan was very communicative. He was out for the weekend, so had place to ourselves. Very spacious for New York apartment, good light, comfortable. Fully equipped bathroom, kitchen. Slightly noisy at night since right by Houston street but to be expected on the LES. Had a great stay."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent value accommodation on Manhattan. The main advantage is the attentive and friendly host. The location is superb, making it very convenient to explore the city. The accommodation matched the description; the room was quite large and had everything needed. Some downsides were the noise at night due to a busy road right outside the window and the room temperature being noticeably lower than the rest of the apartment (which is no problem in April tho). However, these issues did not detract from my overall very positive impression of the accommodation and its host."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dan's place was great! Clean, in the heart of the city, and had good internet. I'd definitely stay again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious room next to wonderful cafés, restaurants and shops. Dan could not be present in the apartment during my stay, but he communication was as if he was there. Everything went smoothly."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay for my daughter and her friend to explore NYC.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I loved the flat of Dan - it is so cosy and so American :)) it was super warm and welcoming and had everything I needed there. Dan was also replying super fast if I had questions or so. A pity we did not meet. But I’ll book his room/house again as soon as I decide when I return to NYC.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dan's place is awesome - it's located in the Lower East Side with many options for restaurants, bars ans coffee shops walking distance. Bus and subway stops are also easy to reach. Upon arrival, the apartment was tidy and well equipped. Dan was there to greet me, show me around and even give some local recommendations. He is a host easy to communicate with. 100% recommend Dan's for your NYC stays!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed staying at Dan‘s place. The room/apartment is very clean and cozy. When we arrived, cozy lights were on, it was warm and towels were ready for us. You just felt very comfortable the whole time :)
The bed is also super soft and you sleep very well in it. We got to meet Dan and he is a very, very great guy and host. He also gave us a few tips for the city. He was also always available via the Airbnb chat.
We can definitely recommend the Airbnb with Dan. We will be back if we ever come to New York again!!! :) Thanks for everything, Dan! :)"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dan's place was exactly like the screen! It was spotless, clean, and it was a nice place to stay. I asked for an early check in because my itinerary was turned on during my trip and they responded quickly and kindly! I couldn't have had a lot of conversations with him due to my lack of English skills, but it felt good to understand the clumsy English and treated me kindly! The ‘Soul‘ I watched with Dan is an experience that I will never forget! 고마워요 댄😊😊
Dan's accommodation was just like the screen! It was a clean and wonderful accommodation without any flaws. I asked for an early check-in because my schedule was twisted during my trip, but they answered quickly and kindly! I couldn't have much conversation with him because of my poor English skills, but I felt good because he understood my poor English well and was kind to me! The ""soul"" I watched with Dan is an unforgettable experience for the rest of my life! Thank you, Dan."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"During the check-in, Dan was very kind in opening up the door. His apartment is located in a good and safe area with plenty of bars and restaurants around, which makes the area a bit busy even during the night. The apartment is also within walking distance to a subway station.
Dan also presented us with some tips for restaurants, bars and things to do in NYC. We were lucky to have Dan around during our stay, which was nice to have a talk and get to know him!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Dan's place was perfect for exploring Manhattan because it was ~15 min walk to two subway stations and close to a Trader Joe's for cheap groceries. Super easy and convenient. Location is perfect for heading into Brooklyn as well, but I just didn't have the time. The room is spacious and neat. Dan is helpful, friendly, and chill. 👍"

The flat was lovely and clean and the room was just as described, with lot of space. The location was great too with lots of restaurants, bars and coffee shops around and just a quick walk from the subway.
And Dan was incredibly nice and helpful - all the places he recommended were definitely worth it! - , super friendly and accommodating with checking in/out."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at Dan’s apartment. It was like staying at a friend’s home. Dan is so welcoming and made great suggestions for the neighbourhood and NYC in general. We definitely would come back here when visiting NYC again.
Lower East Side is a great area when you want to have some of the best restaurants and bars nearby. Also the subway connection was awesome. We got around the whole city really well.
Keep in mind: NYC is a loud city no matter where you are (at least that was what we felt like) so we brought ear plugs with us for sleeping. However, Dan also provided ear plugs in the room."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My girlfriend and I spent a week at Dan's place and appreciated her kindness, hospitality and feeling at home with access to common areas. The apartment is very good, perfectly equipped and met our expectations. Neighborhood is not the most peaceful but very close to neighborhoods like Soho, Nolita or places like Washington Square Park. You have to walk to NYC!! Thanks to Dan!!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dan is a great host! I came there with a very recent knee surgery and he did all the accommodations to help me feel at home. The place is beautiful, all wooden floors (which I love but can be noisy). Only thing is that be aware that the apartment is on a second floor, no elevator, but even with my faulty need it was still manageable. The neighborhood is a bit dark at night and it can be spooky, but honestly nothing happened to me even as a woman that was walking alone.
Forgot to mention! Dan is always available to answer everything, he gives great recommendations for restaurants, bars, everything! 100% recommended"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Dan’s place was well located and he was very friendly and an excellent resource on recommendations. It was a pleasure staying with Dan and I hope to be back.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Air conditioned bedroom to come back to at the end of long, hot days around walking around the city. The overall lack of functional AC in New York is baffling to this New Orleanian. Dan's room has a room window unit & a small fan to keep air circulating so I was able to sleep soundly. He also offers ""just in case"" earplugs on the dresser for unexpected NYC sounds, which is a very nice touch. It really did feel like staying at a friend's place. I felt right at home the whole time. Excellent location, amenities, and host! Would recommend!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dan was a super nice host, and went out of his way.

Though it's on a busy street, the noise didn't bother me much at night, plus Dan provides a sound machine to block the outside noise. The apartment was quite spacious, especially in New York standards, and very clean. As for Dan, he was really responsive to my messages and very friendly. Overall I really enjoyed my stay there and highly recommend it."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Dan’s was a great host.
Accommodations were super: spacious room, cleanliness and great location."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We had a lovely stay at Dan's place for our first experience in NEW YORK CITY. Dan responds very quickly and is kind. Dan's room is perfect, it's one of the few rooms in New York City to be so big and the value for money is really great. the bed was very comfortable, (having back pain for a very long time, I spent 10 days without any back pain, a pleasure!) Dan's apartment is very well decorated, spacious, and impeccably clean.
it is conveniently located in southeast Manhattan, a 5-minute walk from Manhattan Metro Station. On the other hand it is quite noisy at night and especially on weekends, but it is part of the surrounding life of New York and the magic of this city! Dan provided the necessities to be able to clog your ears during the night if needed, despite the noise we usually slept well since we had busy days. Overall it was a very nice stay at Dan's and we absolutely recommend this apartment and host! Once again, for everything Dan 😊👍"
2022-08-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Very friendly and chill host, great location and spacious room."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This room and apartment is one of the best of the best when it comes to staying in NYC. We travel to the city every year or so, and this was by far the largest and most comfortable bedroom we've encountered with everything a weary traveler might need handy -- even a desk that's big enough for us both to have our laptops side by side on while catching up on things, a very comfortable bed, and lots of drawer and closet space. Dan is also generous in sharing the living room, kitchen, and bathroom, which were all tasteful, calming, and immaculate, including gorgeous hardwood flooring in the living room and a comfortable couch and lovely dining area. The kitchen is well-stocked with coffee, tea, and refreshing ice water in the fridge, and the bathroom is perfect (even has a bidet). Dan is a gracious and personable host, and he has great suggestions on where to go and what to explore in the area. The apartment has high ceilings and great views too. We like walking, so the trek to the train station (about 4 blocks away) was fine, and from the Lower East Side, there's the wonderful East Village to the north and lots of great shops, restaurants, and things to do to the south and west. Seriously, after years of staying in rooms where the bed barely fit in via other Airbnbs or inexpensive lodging, this was heaven."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dan is a very good host. The apartment is conveniently located in Manhattan and is ideally suited for a city trip. Booking, checking in and out was hassle-free.
The apartment is very clean and well furnished.
You come with a little walk to a subway, buses are quick to reach.
How air bnb is fun"

2022-06-01,4,Stayed about a week,It was a pleasure staying at Dan's place! It's ideally located for exploring NYC - both for visiting all the sights and seeing the numerous hip neighborhoods in the West and Lower Manhattan. The bright room offers a big bed and lots of space. Would recommend!

Walking distance to major subway stations and bus stops. The place is clean and spacious and completely true to how it is advertised!

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"10/10 across the board. I’ve stayed in over 20+ Airbnb’s across the world and Dan was definitely the best host. Communication was always super easy and quick, he was extremely accommodating when I had a family emergency (to change a date) and was just the nicest person ever. The location of his apartment is just unbeatable and the room and apartment are super nice - large, clean, comfortable and thoughtfully done up. The room has a desk and chair (new essential) and the bathroom has a bidet!!!! This is a HUGE plus. Dan is a wonderful human to interact with just generally - super nice, laidback and fun to talk to. Would 100% recommend this place and can’t wait to stay here again!"

The private bedroom is spacious with a comfortable queen bed, large desk, closet space and dresser. The wifi is reliable and fast if you need to work from home during your stay. The shared spaces are well maintained and there is plenty of room for two people to live comfortably. Dan is also a great roommate. He is clean, easy going, and fun to be around. Don’t hesitate to book his place! Especially if you are looking for an affordable extended stay, you likely won’t find a better option in Lower Manhattan."

2020-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Had an excellent stay with Dan. The space is cozy and spotless, the bed is phenomenal, which is priority number 1. Everything as described and then some. Street noise isn’t bad at all in my opinion.
But what sets the place apart is the man himself. Dan’s a super welcoming and chill guy to share a space with. Would stay again in a heartbeat. And would recommend the apartment and Dan to anybody."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"GREAT location and area. Near many food spots and close to trains! Dan is a great friendly and courteous host! Bathroom has a bidet option which is REALLY AWESOME and appreciated! The bed is SUPER comfy and it was a great experience, highly recommend :) !"

LES location has great subway access and is a stone’s throw from some of NY’s best walking neighborhoods. Would definitely stay again if I got the chance! Thanks Dan!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Truly a lovely litttle LES oasis! You're right between the 2nd Ave F and Essex/Delancey so you're well placed to get around. The apartment is spotless and really cute. The biggest downside is probably the street-noise (from Houston below) but it's quite manageable. Dan himself is simply lovely and I couldn't recommend his hospitality enough.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing location and apartment, fantastic host - Dan is so welcoming and makes everything super easy!"

2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We couldn't have chosen a better location-- and what luck to have a kind, flexible, knowledgeable host. Bedroom was spacious, and entirely ours. Some places we have stayed in suffer from being a ""sterile box"", but Dan's place is the opposite, mostly due to his hospitality and excellent communication. Will stay here again in the future, if we have the chance!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The flat was well presented and a pleasant atmosphere. Our host was welcoming and easy going which made us feel super at home when we got there, which was especially nice after a long flight. We did have a few problems with the bathroom whilst we were there but these were sorted out pretty fast. We had an amazing time whilst there and especially enjoyed the comfy bed which is an incredibly thick memory foam mattress. I would definitely recommend staying here."

2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dan is an amazing and friendly host (he was staying there at the time). Dan gave me great recommendations on things to do in the area that I never would have found on my own. The apartment is a great value with a lot of open space, comfortable bed and clean private room. The only negative was the shower wasn't draining very fast so a bit of water pools up at the end of the tub. I would definitely stay here again, especially if Dan is there."
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great space conveniently located in LES, and Dan was really flexible and communicative about check in and my stay in general!"

2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I could not ask for a better location and host. close to all the eats. highly recommend
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dan's place was much more than I had expected and for being my first time trying out airbnb, the experience was great! Dan was a great host to my mother and I - he made sure to make both of us feel comfortable and he also made sure we had everything we needed and would check on us once in a while. Now let's talk about the bedroom. The guest bedroom was very spacious, neat, and beautifully decorated. Though, the room seems to be facing a busy street, the noise was not much of a problem as it only got loud on the weekends (at least from my experience). But after exploring the city for most of the day and arriving tired the noise almost goes unnoticed (Dan does offer earplugs). I do have to say my favorite part of my stay was the bed...it is the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on. It was like sleeping on a cloud!. The location felt pretty safe and was perfect for nearby delis and breakfast spots. Although, Dan was very kind to let us borrow his cooking ware to cook our own breakfast in the mornings. As far as transportation and getting to places from Dan's place, we chose to take Uber and cabs once in a while. I do not know how far the train stations were or how much it is to travel around the city in train, but we found Uber pool was easier, a bit cheaper, and somewhat faster than the train. I did a lot research and talking to different hosts before making a final decision; all of it was planned according to the places I had planned to visit and how to travel around. Overall I was satisfied with my stay. Thank you once again!"
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great and friendly host! The bed is so comfortable and the flat is in a great location in LES. Would recommend
2018-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Dan's place was everything that my fiancé and I need during our 12 days in NY. Excellent location and all the comfort we needed. The good bed, large room, great and very important bathroom.. air-conditioned to account for the heat it has made in the city in recent days. Dan and Susan are very pleasant and considerate people.
The East Village region has won our heart. Bars, restaurant and a very interesting nightlife. Coladinha with the Williamsburg bridge, it is worth facing the crossing on foot or by bike. Preferably on Saturday where a wonderful food market takes place in Williamsburg.
We were very happy during the days we stayed at Dan's place.
See you next time!"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I absolutly recommend this apartment. It's located in a lively neibourhood and near subway station, so you can be in the center of Manhattan in 20 min also near other spots of NY. About the room and the apartment, it was perfect. The bedroom is big, so there's plenty of space for your bags. The bed is also big and comfortable. The other rooms of the apartment were very clean (kitchen and wc) It's a good place if you're thinking to go to NY!"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I stayed with Dan and his girlfriend Susan for just around a month as I had an internship in NYC. All I can say is that my stay with them exceeded all of my expectations. The location is great in that it is in a great part of Manhattan and it is also very easy to get to the subway lines. The place is also very, very spacious for a place in Manhattan and looks even bigger than the pictures. There is air conditioning for the hotter months as well. I also did not have a problem with street noise, but they do have ear plugs just in case.
Dan and Susan are also great people to be hosts. They have lived in the city for years and know so many things to do. They are also just great people. I loved my stay, and will definitely be contacting them whenever I am back in the city."
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Dan’s place was amazing! I’m planning on staying here whenever I come to NYC moving forward if possible. I highly recommend booking here! A+
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great stay at Dan’s. He and his GF are very welcoming and always have useful tips whenever you need them. The apartment is big and in a nice location. The guestroom is really big and the bed so comfortable :)
I definitely recommend it !"
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed at Dan's for a business trip for a week and had a great experience. Location was at the perfect walkable location to both the NYU area where I was working and Williamsburg where I was going out every night.
My flight was delayed, but Dan stayed up late to make sure that I could get in, which I appreciated. The apartment is a really nice size and the bed he's got set up for guests is AMAZING. I'm considering investing in a similar pillow-top style mattress now after getting such great sleeps on that thing."
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great space in a lovely location. Dan is an incredibly helpful host and a friendly person to chat with too!
2018-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The apartment is very good.
The room is more spacious than it looks, it's a luxury in New York City. And there's plenty of storage available.
The apartment is at the end of a rather dynamic neighborhood, to go out in the evening, it is convenient.
Dan is very friendly, and very discreet. The cohabitation went very well.
There's just the key to the building entrance which is a little complicated to make it work, but we'll get a quick help.
We are very satisfied"

The studio is much wider and beautiful live and live, very comfortable to come back after a day of touring the city.

Milton was so lovely and extremely helpful with where to get the trains from, local food & helping us with a taxi on the way back to the airport. Equipped with a comfy bed & sofa which is just what you need after a whole day of walking! It’s also super close to the trains which was really easy to use after the first day! Everywhere you want to go is accessible and in general felt very at home in the cute apartment. It’s also very quiet around there too so nothing was waking us up in the night. When we’re next back in New York we will for sure be booking again. Felt relatively safe at night out and about just keep yourself to yourself."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A 5-day stay. This quiet street of brownstones in Harlem provides a great base location for an NYC trip, with full privacy at a reasonable rate (comparatively). Neighborhood is not wealthy, but as long as you don't dress in a show-off way, and can mind your business while walking, you'll be fine. Lots of local non-brand businesses, with interesting restaurants. Try King Barka chicken for cheap. Go find Sylvia's for fancy and historic. Parking was the easiest in the city. Apartment was very nice, with a double bed, and full kitchen. Bathroom clean as well. Milton was flexible to allow an earlier check-in as I was moving from one AirBnB to another. Excellent communication. He greeted me at the door and gave me the keys after a brief and friendly chat. I'll hope to stay there again if I can book the space for my next trip. If this is available for your dates, you should grab it."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Both this apartment and even moreso Milton are gems. My wife and I planned an NYC vacation on a budget and Milton’s space was a fantastic spot for us. Milton was incredibly kind, gracious, and we were able to have several great conversations with him. He met us both when we arrived and left and we were appreciative of the free parking and close by street parking. I highly recommend Milton’s apartment and am thankful that we were able to connect with him."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Milton is a really charming and helpful host, and was great at giving advice on where to go and where to shop in Harlem. The apartment is comfortable and cosy - feels like home. The bed is a little bit snug for two big vikings but for a happy couple I am sure it is great. The neighborhood is safe - same amount of homeless people as in any other neighborhood - and you get a familiar service in the stores."

White Space hosted by Milton was perfect for location (safe, close to shops, subway) and the unit had all the features and services as advertised. 
When communicating with Milton prior to our arrival, he gave us excellent instructions on getting to his place from the airport which was really helpful the following days finding our way to and from the subway.
Milton also gave great advice on the local area, and helped planning our daily trips around NY. 
We really felt at home and would highly recommend it to anyone who visits NY.

Also many shops and shopping places nearby"

Really appreciated the assistance :-) apartment was clean & warm, and the kitchen had everything needed to cook. Can’t fault the host or apartment at all! The location was further away from everything than we had realised, so a lot of walking was needed, there is a subway relatively close by (125th st). Would recommend the local Red Rooster for live jazz/food (suggested by Milton). Had a great night there."

We had a pretty close Deli and a CVS for what we needed."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Milton was easily one of the nicest & most hospitable hosts we’ve met on AirBnb. We flew into NYC early in the morning from a long overseas flight & Milton agreed to let us move into the rental unit way before the check-in time. He gave us directions to the property & was waiting for us when we arrived. He helped us with our luggage & as soon as we got inside the unit talking with Milton was like conversing with an old friend. He made us feel at home. The unit itself was as described & more than met our expectations. The unit is extremely close to a variety of subway lines & other public transportation, & for walkers/hikers like we are, it’s also close to Central Park.

Short walk to the subway and with the express trails very quickly to Downtown and back in the evening. The apartment is small but nice, very well appointed.

The neighborhood is endearing with its small shops and supermarkets (don't miss the fish specialties to take away at Lighthouse!). It's perfect for immersing yourself in African American mixed culture, just a stone's throw from the Apollo theater and the gospel churches!
The studio is impeccable in terms of cleanliness, bright, well-equipped especially in terms of cooking. The decoration is very nice, and with views of the gardens and interior courtyards. The bedding is very soft and comfortable.
We'll be back in New York for sure, and we already know we'll be back at Milton's!"

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came as a couple to discover New York, I mean I’ve selected this airbnb because of the reviews and the pictures, and I was right to follow my instinct.
Milton has been so nice and helpful, he waited for us outside the apartment while we arrived from our late night flight
He made sure we had everything, he bought us some groceries too, how nice
The flat itself is really clean and way enough for two people
The mattress is really comfy, it feels clean too, everything is good !
About the area, we did everything by subway, I’ve read reviews about 10min walk but it is really 5min to the station
The area is safe and interesting, we still booked Lyft or taxi to come back home from Manhattan when it was dark because of laziness and comfort but I’m sure it is fine !
I can only thank again Milton for his welcoming personality, that made our week really special
Also he printed for us our boarding passes for our flight home, which is really nice
I recommend it by 100 !
Merci encore !"

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Milton is a great host and the property is exactly as advertised. Milton has a warm personality and made us feel at home and very welcome.

2021-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Milton's apartment was perfect for us on our stay!
It's very true to the images and everything was very clean and tidy.
It is located in the heart of Harlem, we never had any problem to walk from the subway, regardless of the time of day or night. Also noteworthy is the proximity of the subway, just a 5-7 minute walk from the apartment.
As for Milton, we only have words of appreciation. We are waiting until late in the morning on our arrival, he answered at all times with doubts that we were coming up and, in addition, he had the deference of leaving us another room to quietly make a ""late check-out"".
Definitely a 100% recommended place!
Thank you so much Milton, Milton!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Milton’s place is just like the photos!! A very clean and nice studio. The location is good, a 10min walk from the subway station with trains going down to Lower Manhattan in 20-30mins.
Because it’s an old building, during the night you may hear some noise from the drains and gas, etc. Nothing too bad really.
Milton is such a nice person! Communicating with him for checking in and out and other matters was very easy.
Looking forward to staying there again! We loved it."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mr. Milton is very attentive and a superb host. We arrived on a very late flight and he was very kind to meet us at that time. The place is nice and is a great location for a trip to NY, is close to the subway station and is a short trip to downtown from there. Overall a very pleasant experience"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely recommend, great service"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host!!!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent
2021-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Milton's place is just what we expected - clean and comfortable. Check in was easy; flying in from the west coast, Milton met us when we arrived late at night. He's pleasant and was responsive for the couple of questions we had during our stay. The place is small and it isn't fancy but the bed is comfortable and, as a place to rest up after a long day of family visits, it was just what we needed."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!!Milton was a great host (attentive/responsive) and his home was clean, comfortable, and exactly as advertised. We highly recommend his property anyone interested in staying in a very nice studio space that is hosted by someone who works to insure a positive guest experience. We would definitely return."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"great place, safe neighborhood, a lot of stores nearby, it's only 5 blocks away from the neirest subway station"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Milton is a perfect host. Great communication, responsive, room was clean and welcoming. The room looked exactly as posted. We really appreciate his hospitality. I even rented a car and had to park it on the street for two nights and I was able to find parking within a reasonable distance from the house. I’m not saying it was easy but it was easier than I anticipated. It is a very walkable area, close to shopping, restaurants and transportation options, with a short walk. If there was any criticism I would say it’s pretty loud outside and busy even overnight. It is NY so that’s to be somewhat expected."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Milton's place has everything you need for a long or short stay! Comfortable bed, AC, and fast internet for those remote work zoom calls. Plus, walkable to grocery stores and the train. Milton goes above and beyond to make his guests comfortable-- I can't recommend his hospitality enough. Thanks again Milton for the great stay!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Studio space exactly as described. Short train ride into mid-town Manhattan. Close to supermarket, walking distance to Apollo theater and shopping. Free street parking. Friendly welcoming host."

2021-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Milton is THE HOST! As soon as I did my check in he came to introduce himself and show me everything on the apartment. Not only that, when I told him that I would need a blender for cooking he told me “I’ll get you one” and 10 minutes later he knocked my door with A BRAND NEW BLENDER!! Definitely wasn’t expecting that. The place was clean, safe for a woman traveling alone. The closest metro will take you a 5 minute walk and the area is SAFE, I remember walking back to the Airbnb at 2am in the morning and nothing ever happened to me. Milton once approached me and asked me if everything was fine of course I said yes and asked him if I could do a late check out… guess what? He gave me a room that was next to my apartment and let me stayed there as long as I needed. He definitely gave me back my faith on Airbnb, he is the BEST OF THE BESTS host. Thank you so much, Milton! Will definitely book at your place again when back in NY"

2021-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This place is excellent, located near many stores, a few blocks away from the subway station, in a safe and calm area. At night you can barely hear the street and can always have a good nights sleep. The pictures describe exactly what you’ll get. But what stands out is the host, Milton. He’s simply put the best host I’ve ever met so far. Quick to reply, very friendly and very helpful. It was my birthday during my stay and he even got me a delicious cheesecake. He’s very often around wiling to provide anything that might be missing and even have a good laugh. Would definitely come back in a future trip."

2020-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Staying at Milton's was the best New York experience we could ask for. We (my wife and me) were traveling with our baby daughter. Milton took care of us as if we were his personal guests and provided us with extra comfort. We can totally recommend his hospitality, his Apartment and the Neighborhood. I hope we have the chance to come back one day."
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay in our ""little home"" in Harlem. The attention and communication with Milton was great and he was very responsive.
The place was warm, nice and cosy, 7 minute walk from an important subway station, with a express stop which made it really handy to get to the downtown quickly.
We really recommend it and would love to repeat :)"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very good. Milton was very accommodating on check-in and check-out times, the apartment is very clean.
A little far from downtown Manhattan (minimum 35 minutes).
The neighborhood is quiet at night.
You can hear a lot from the neighbors above but as in all the apartments in New York for rent at this price.
I recommend for small budgets that do not demotivate as soon as there is a little distance.
In addition, the bed is very very comfortable.
Thanks Milton"

The house also has a second single room, with private bathroom, where other guests stay, who will probably meet during the stay (we met two).
The apartment perfectly matches the listing photos: cozy house, clean and decorated with the art of little Claire!
Conveniently located, in a quiet and quiet residential area, which is one block from Metro 1 that connects to the rest of Manhattan (about 20 minutes from the Times team stop).

There were two highlights to the visit: (1) the bed is very comfortable and (2) the bedroom is extremely quiet. It faces the rear of the building, so there was absolutely no street noise, no sirens, none of the sounds that you may otherwise associate with a busy New York City street."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Monica personally greeted me up on checking and made sure that I was able to get in and out of the apartment without issue. The apartment was in a great neighborhood within easy walking distance from a subway station.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at this fantastic Airbnb in Manhattan, and I can't recommend it highly enough. The apartment is incredibly spacious, offering plenty of room to relax after a busy day in the city. The price is very reasonable, especially considering the prime location.
Situated close to Times Square, Central Park, and the metro, this Airbnb is perfect for anyone looking to explore the heart of New York City. The convenience of having these iconic destinations just a short walk or subway ride away made our stay even more enjoyable.
Additionally, the place was spotless. The cleanliness of the apartment was impressive, adding to the overall comfort and experience. If you're looking for a great place to stay in Manhattan that offers both space and an unbeatable location, this is it!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great time staying at Edgar’s place. The apartment feels homely and authentic in a way that few Airbnbs I am now staying at do and Edgar has been a relaxed and genuine host.
The location is great for exploring Brooklyn with great delis, diners and bagel shops close by but it’s also fairly quick to get into the city.
Will definitely consider staying here again when I’m next in New York."

Edgar's super friendly and helpful and before my arrival he provided me with very thorough instructions on how to get from the airport to his place and how to get all the way to his flat which was super helpful and made my arrival so much easier and stress free. Always happy to give me advice and tips and even been so kind to give me some small change for the local bus when I was heading out the first night (didn't need it in the end but how awfully kind!)
The flat itself was lovely and exactly as described and was very easy to get around the city from. I would definitely recommend staying at Edgar's on your next trip to the Big Apple.
PS.: And if you like cats Digi is just the cherry on top. We hit it off immediately and he would always be there to demand cuddles as soon as got back from town! 🐱"

Perfect stay, 10/10 would recommend time and time again 💫"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was safe,cozy and neat! The host, Edgar is kind and replies fast.
At first, there was a bit of problem entering since the keys weren’t left by previous guests but Edgar showed up in 5 mins and helped us out. I couldn’t find the hair dryer and you might need to bring an indoor shoe if you are used to walking barefoot indoors.
The building is securely locked. The neighborhood was safe, close to a lot of tourist spots in Brooklyn. The kitchen was fully equipped. Heating worked so well and is equipped with clean towels and blankets. Digi is lovely, cried for attention :)
Overall, it was good experience and I would want to stay again if I come to Brooklyn."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"For the price you pay, and the kind of hospitality that’s provided - nothing really beats it in the area. I hope to stay here again in the future if I ever need to stay in Brooklyn. Edgar is such a fun and wonderful human being, so even meeting him is worth the trip."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"The room was nice, clean, and quiet. Bathroom was also clean and had shampoo conditioner and body wash readily available. Edgar was hella communicative and even helped me check in at a super late hour. There’s windows for my morning people and blinds for my privacy people.
He had his DJ equipment in the living room which really gave it that artsy Brooklyn charm. He’s a cool dude. If you stay here, you’ll be fine!"

It was very easy to feel at home with Edgar and his cat Digi, who will cuddle and hang with you immediately. I’d definitely stay with them again."
2024-01-01,4,Stayed one night,"Everything went smoothly & Edgar is a responsive host! There was another guest room next to ours & we could hear him making noise as well as the neighbours upstairs. Just mentioning that the walls are thin if you’re a light sleeper.
I also want to mention it was New Years Eve so i’m sure it’s typically more quiet.
Other then that, the house cat is quite sweet & everything else was as described!."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great clean stay. I’d recommend! My favorite part of the stay was his adorable, super soft cat 😊"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Co-host Edgar and Diji are super friendly. Edgar knew a lot of restaurants, so he gave me a lot of recommendations. Dizzy is curious and likes people, so she waited for me to come out at the door every day.
The house is generally the same as the photo. Due to the nature of foreign countries, it was a house that kept clean given that all houses are old. The host also cleans the cleaning.
I have to open the key several times to get into the house, which also felt safe because it seemed like good security.
It's a 10-minute walk from the house to the subway station, and 30-40 minutes from the nearby subway station to the main tourist attractions in the center of Manhattan. In many ways, it was a satisfactory accommodation."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Edgar's was great. A comfortable bed, all functional and available. Digi cat as a welcoming companion was always happy to greet us and caressed and enjoyed playing with us. The position of the house was on foot 13 min to the subway. Beautiful, tastefully furnished, comfortable and welcoming. We felt right at home there. We were also greeted by a nice smell of aromatic oils. We were there for more nights, more people were changing in the next room, but they were all friendly and cool."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Execellent stay. The cat is adorable. Love digi.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful stay here with Edgar and Digi (the cutest cat)!

Edgar is super knowledgeable about the area so if you are interested in the Brooklyn history like I was, just ask :) Thanks so much Edgar, will definitely be booking here next time I plan a trip to Brooklyn/NYC.

Edgar wrote to me hours before my check in to give me extra facilities upon arrival.
The place is accessible no matter the means of transportation (there are bus stops nearby and a few blocks from the subway). The room is exactly as in the post; the service/communication and interest was always good and it is appreciated that, if there are other guests, we all respect the rules and spaces."

The area is safe but not the most beautiful part of Brooklyn. Grocery stores etc are within a 10 min walk.
Overall a good place to stay, I would recommend it."

Inside, everything was clean and amenities are present as described in the listing.
My room was spacious with all the space I need for my stuff.
The only downside I would mention was the noise of the street that can be heard and that may be surprising when sleeping/waking but this is not Edgar's fault at all.
Also, the Digi is an adorable cat, it was a real pleasure to have spent part of my stay with him.
Finally, if needed, Edgar gives some great recommendations about the city and Brooklyn in particular.
I would definitely come back, thanks again!"

Quiet neighborhood, nearby subway
Looking forward to coming back
I recommend it!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Stayed for one week, working remotely from the room and exploring Brooklyn and adjacent areas.
* Desk was spacious, more than enough for a laptop, mug, notepad. Chair was not adjustable, but the setup worked OK overall. Wall outlet is a bit far from the desk, but the power strip in the room mitigates that.
* Area is relatively quiet, but still a lot of traffic noise. Shutting the windows blocks a lot out. The noise didn't bother my sleep.
* Whole place was clean. Common area is spacious and nice place to take a break from the bedroom.
* G-line subway station is 10-15 min walk and I could reach downtown Brooklyn, Manhattan and Williamsburg from there. Bus station also very close.
* Edgar was very friendly and responsive. He checked that his activities at the place were not disturbing me, and gave food recommendations.
* Pleasant, social cat."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve stayed in many air bnbs over the years and this one hands down has been my favourite experience. Edgar has the type of place that when you walk in you think ‘I want to live here’. Cosy, clean, cool and very well located for getting about Brooklyn and easy access to the city. Edgar himself is the perfect host, creating a relaxed, friendly and welcoming atmosphere and offering the most incredible recommendations. I can’t recommend this place highly enough
Thanks for the stay Edgar and hope to return soon!"

Furthermore we definitely recommend Edgar's apartment!"

Edgar was a lovely host, leaving us clear and simple instructions for both check-in and check-out, as well as how to use the key parts of the apartment.
If you like to keep yourself to yourself, Edgar’s respectful of your space and leaves you to it.
If you fancy a chat and wanna pick his brain for recommendations, he’s incredibly warm to talk to and a fountain of knowledge for truly great restaurants and nightlife spots.
Add in the chillest/cutest cat in the city and you have a real winner!
P.S. It’s rare to find anotherJungle/DnB super fan to nerd out with. Thanks so much for the dance music geek chat Edgar! Hit me up for a boogie and a beer in London anytime 💗"

The area is calm, but very interesting, has all sorts of restaurants and shops around. I most liked that I could even see a bit of skyline from the bed. The famous e-flux art space is just around the corner and also the blick art supply store! I also liked the cat. So a very nice stay I would totally recommend!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Edgar's place was the best decision I could have made. The apartment is exactly like what we see in the photos (the vibe is even better in person), it's a quiet place to stay with the bonus of having the wonderful Mr. Digi as a company all the time, lots of natural light, the room is spacious and with one of the best mattresses I've ever slept on. Plus, it's close to transportation (bus just outside the house and metro 10 minutes walk away). Quality/cost ratio is 10 out of 10."
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Good spot in a safe neighborhood. Perfect for NYC on a budget. Edgar is responsive and also has a lovely cat! Only down side I would say is its on a main road so it can be noisy.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice and peaceful experience!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great place to stay, especially if you’re using the bedroom only to spend the night. The apartment was clean and quiet, and the cat that lives there was very friendly! I would recommend this place to anyone!"

AirBnB was affordable & worth the stay !"

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place has been the best stay I've ever stayed ! Edgar is such a good host and I love the cat Digi ! Digi and I got so close during the stay so it was so hard to say good bye to him. And I love the atmosphere of the place as well ! The place is so clean, calm, and aestethic as well. I'll definitely come back to see the sweetest cat Digi !!"
2022-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"It's secluded in Brooklyn. The train station nearby only makes sense if you want to go to Lower Manhattan. Unfortunately, you usually have to take bus. The space is easy to find, but the door is a bit cumbersome. The room is very simply furnished and the furniture is partly heavily worn. The cat that lives in the accommodation is very sweet, but also strong on the hair, which is why many animal hairs fly around. In general, the accommodation was unfortunately not very clean - the bathroom is shared with up to 6 people, so unfortunately it also looks like & accordingly it can also lead to longer waiting times.
In the 4 days we were there, we didn't even get to know the hosts. He doesn't seem to be interested & just trying to earn extra money by the way.
This was our first time in New York - homes seem to be very expensive in general, but we were hoping for a little more for the money!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved the bed it’s the type of bed you don’t want to get out of. Loved how clean the bathroom is. And the cat is very cute and friendly. Thanks Edgar
2022-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Edgar was always very responsive even before my trip. I had a long term stay at is place and I had a good, tranquil time making it my temporary home. Edgar is very friendly and always ready to offer local recommendations or good conversations. You won’t regret staying at his place :)
(Ps. I’m not a cat person but the cat is very chill and easygoing 😴😺🐈)"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,The room is as advertised. It’s very clean and Edgar is really really nice and very easy to contact! Would definitely recommend for you to stay here! :)
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was fine! Nice room in a very nice Apartment near the Metro, near cafes and a supermarket. Edgar always answered every question!
I like Brooklyn!
Thank you gor everything!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had a great stay at Edgar’s. He is very quick to respond, the self check in is very easy, the room is nice and very easy to get to and from the area"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful stay. Edgar was great.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Edgar is discreet, kind, a great host and always with a smile !!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I felt very comfortable with Edgar. Communication with him was excellent, he was very helpful and the apt was clean and stocked with everything you might need. In addition, I had a beautiful view of the skyline from my room and the cat was immediately very trusting and affectionate. I would book with Edgar again anytime!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,As advertised. Comfortable place for a short stay. Edgar is friendly and communication was excellent for self check in.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Edgar’s place is in such an ideal location with street parking and the cutest cat. Apartment was very clean and he was very responsive with everything we needed. 10/10, would most definitely come back."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a beautiful large bedroom which was ery spacious and calm. Edgar was was lovely and very informative in respect of the area.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, adorable cat"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Great stay in Brooklyn. We felt very comfortable with Edgar and our expectations were met. The apartment is equipped with everything you might need. The bus and subway or a 10 minute walk to the subway in about 40 minutes.
It's quite noisy at night, but this is something you should expect when staying in New York. The room has its own air conditioning, which is also quite noisy, but in summer it is not possible without it.
Hangover digi is very friendly and likes to be petted, but hairs very strong.
Edgar is helpful with all requests, and there should be a problem. Since our flight only went in the evening, we could also leave our luggage in the apartment, which was very pleasant. Parking is plentiful in the area, but you should observe the parking regulations (some restrictions due to street cleaning).
We can recommend staying with Edgar."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"It was a pleasure to stay with Edgar. For me it was well located, the room was immaculate when I arrived, great price, and Digi the cat was super chill. Check in was really easy and Edgar gave me a couple extra hours to check out, which made my day so much less stressful. I'd definitely recommend staying here."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect!
2022-07-01,3,Stayed one night,"Edgar's apartment is very clean and it looks exactly like the pictures. The room is spacious and he is very kind in his communication. There was an error that happened with the keys when we checked in. Based on his other reviews it truly seems this was a one-time thing. When we got to the airbnb there were no keys in the lockbox, however, luckily there was another guest staying at the apartment in the other room who was able to let us in within 15 minutes of when we messaged the host know about the keys not being there while we waiting outside. Other than that I would recommend this apartment and the rest of the trip was fine."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at Edgar’s place. We felt at home and it was convenient to visit Brooklyn for a few days. The cat is very sweet too.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location and great host. I’d stay there again!
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The room Edgar offered me was really nice and big. The A/C made the hot temperatures during my stay definitely more bearable. If you have a lot of heavy suitcases it might be difficult for you to carry them upstairs because the staircase is tiny. It also took me a hot second to figure out all the keys and locks and in what direction I had to turn them (that might sound silly, but I was actually very confused lol). Overall this place is definitely worth its price"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"My stay was brief but good. Edgar was very thorough in his communication. I didn't get to see anyone else in the apartment, but I did spoil Digi with head scratches and belly rubs. Super chill cat.
Location is very close to the city. However, be prepared for the walk to the 3rd floor."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was perfect 👍 and extra points for the friendly cat 😊
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Edgar was a perfect host, his place was very nice, comfy and clean! And Digi, his cat, is just too adorable!!"

Thank you Edgar for being such a wonderful host and providing a beautiful space for my studies while in Brooklyn. Also, being greeted by Digi made my experience all the better."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice apartment. Clean & cozy plus the location is very convenient. Would definitely stay again & Digi is an extra cherry on top!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! Awesome apartment in a homey neighborhood, would come back again. bonus points for the cute cat!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Edgar was a great host and was very helpful when I arrived to help me with my heavy luggage. He has a friendly and easy-going cat, Digi, that is happy to meet you and is also respectful of your luggage / room / space. You can give Digi your attention and make him work for some treats 🐱. It is a nice, quiet environment and easy to work out of. You have a lot of space in your room and a desk as well as an air conditioner, large closet space, and a large comfortable bed with a lot of light coming through the windows. Towels were also provided by the host as well. I would recommend this stay to anyone and would visit again!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The only thing I have to note is that the climb up is a little tough if you have a lot of cases other wise the place is perfect, it’s a big space, loads of storage and the shared areas are clean and tidy. Digi (the cat) is the sweetest ever, check in and out was the smoothest ever. The location is great, you can walk in any direction and get to see something cool, there’s a couple subway stops nearby that are easy enough to navigate once you’re used to it. Edgar was a great host too, always happy to answer questions or give suggestions and advice, highly recommend!"
2022-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Good value spot. I booked last minute on the day and Edgar was very fast to respond to my booking and query. Check in was straightforward. We didn’t get to speak when I arrived and I had the place mostly to myself over my two night stay. The room is a decent size with a desk to work from. The area is chill and walkable, though it’s over ten mins to the metro. The entrance and stairwell of the building are a bit grimy but the apartment itself was pretty clean."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Edgar’s home was the perfect place to stay for the night – the room was cozy and clean, and Edgar was fantastic in communicating check-in instructions and providing all the necessary amenities. It couldn’t have been better!"
