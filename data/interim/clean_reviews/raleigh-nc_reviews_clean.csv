2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Heather‚Äôs Hut was one of the most thoughtfully designed and curated places we have ever stayed. She was proactive in her communication and always responsive. Thank you , Heather!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Heathers place was PERFECT. Best experience we have had with Airbnb. We will definitely be back. From her wonderful recommendations to the privacy in best space we could have hoped for- this stay was amazing. 10:10 if you are considering staying here just do it! It‚Äôs worth it and even better than the pictures!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I can't say enough wonderful things about Heather's Hut. This is easily the most beautiful place that I've rented - every single room has a floor-to-ceiling glass door that can be opened or closed at your pleasure and preference. The pool and deck are simply stunning. The amenities are top notch - if I weren't so busy during the stay, I would have loved to have put the gorgeous gas stove to use! The bed, couch, chairs are all comfortable. Heather is a generous, responsive, and kind host who goes above and beyond - thank you, Heather. I just moved to the area and now I know where to send all my out-of-town guests so that I can return to that beautiful space again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Heathers home is absolutely stunning - the photos don't even do it justice! Truly a hidden gem. She is helpful, friendly, and responsive. The home had everything you could need. I wished I could move in! I had my two dogs with me and they loved it as well. I will be back, maybe sometime in the summer! Especially once the rest of the landscaping is done. Thanks for a wonderful getaway!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot for a solo retreat!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful home that has everything you need. A spacious and perfect outside because we had our pup with us (this would be great to rent in the summer with the pool). Heather is also very responsive before, during and after our stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful place in the woods! It‚Äôs stunningly beautiful, and so peaceful. But we also love the fact that we were in such close proximity to downtown Raleigh. I can‚Äôt recommend it highly enough."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful!!! We enjoyed the architecture!! The place is exactly as described- among the trees! We also appreciated the nespresso machine- a nice added touch. Thanks and we will be back!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This was my second stay here in the span of a month. I love this place! Thank you again for hosting me!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The pictures were just as good as the real thing! The owners were easy to work with and accommodating. A beautiful and relaxing place to stay!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spectacular home nestled on a hillside among 100 foot trees. Worth a stay just to experience a unique, architectural masterpiece."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Incredible views and architecture. Its immersive full glass forest facing wall is hard to explain without experiencing. If nature and modern amenities are your thing, then this is your place. We saw hawks take flight at eye level and watched owls hunt at night from this ‚Äútreehouse‚Äù. House has everything you need for a small family or 2 couples. With its very open concept, it‚Äôs more of an adventure together than a private getaway, which we loved! We would love to book it again with just us as a couple. We used the large gas grill and fire pit on the front porch to do s‚Äômores. It‚Äôs a quiet residential neighborhood that was very peaceful at night. We will definitely be booking again! Jessica and Alli were very responsive and thoughtful. Thanks for everything!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If I could live here I would. However, I will settle for the fact that this beautiful place is a short 25 mins from my own home because I am, without a doubt, coming back. It‚Äôs serene, quiet, and remarkably private even with neighbors around. I was in love!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just fantastic!! As good or better than the pictures. Thanks for letting us stay in this design lovers paradise :)
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This treehouse was one of the nicest Airbnb's I've stayed at. The house is exactly as pictured and absolutely peaceful and serene. The full wall of glass overlooking the trees was amazing - you really felt like you were in nature, yet in the comforts of air conditioning. The kitchen was great and had everything we needed to make a simple italian dinner at home. The location was perfect to nearby restaurants (and the local colleges we were visiting). My son loved the large (queen) bed in the primary bedroom and my husband and I appreciated the king bed on the main level. Smart TV and comfortable seating made for a relaxing trip. Thank you for sharing your home with us."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ali‚Äôs home was absolutely beautiful. My wife and I really enjoyed our stay. The photos simply did not so this place justice- stunning. Everything was clean, easy to find and the place was conveniently located."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,The Modernist Treehouse was a gem. Had a lovely time during my stay with family. Hosts were responsive and accommodating. Highly recommend. Would definitely stay again.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home and views. Enjoyed our stay and look forward to returning!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The glass treehouse was beautiful!
The entire group loved the glass wall of nature to observe morning to night.
This home made the trip really memorable!
The neighborhood felt very safe as well!
We would definitely stay again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay. We met with Jessica, the host. She was very nice and gave us a lovely walk through when we arrived. The structure, furniture, kitchen, everything was beautiful. The kitchen was well equipped for proper cooking."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful home with amazing hosts. If your coming to the Raleigh area this is a must stay!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The home and architecture are so beautiful. You feel like you are living and sleeping in the trees. It‚Äôs an incredibly central Raleigh location but you feel like you are in the mountains and surrounded by nature. We loved our stay here, and would love to stay again in the future."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alli's place is beyond what you would expect. I am easily a returning guest!!! Very quiet, clean, and beautiful!!! The sunsets were my favorite from the amazing views provided by floor to ceilings windows.
Response: Alli and Jessica were always available during my stay.
Location: It has everything you need in the area, so close to great restaurant's as well."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We can‚Äôt say enough about our stay in Alli‚Äôs home! It is so peaceful and the view is breathtaking! Waking up at night and nature is literally right there beautifully lit! The house is extremely beautiful but you fill right at home. The steps inside the home are wide and goes at an angle that does not leave you feeling exhausted if you are not use to steps in your home. I highly recommend and plan to visit again some day. They are very responsive if you message them and they offered to meet us there to show us around. But the instructions they send before your arrival is very detailed and it lays everything out. Thank you Alli for your hospitality!!!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A very cool and unique 2 bedroom, 2 bath house. We hosted a bridal shower for 25 people there and it was spectacular - such a grand open space! The elderly ladies were definitely nervous on the stairs and parking wasn‚Äôt easy, but overall it was amazing! The amenities were top notch, the beds were comfortable, and the hosts were generous with supplies. They didn‚Äôt require a long list of chores to do prior to checkout, so that was also nice. I would definitely recommend staying here, it was so far beyond just a nice place to lay your head üòÄ"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alli and Jessica were fantastic hosts! Very communicative and friendly! Their place is absolutely amazing. Pristine, unique, and beautiful views! They were kind enough to leave very effective eye masks to help block out the morning light. I would definitely stay with them again! Just a beautiful place in a great part of town. Feels like you‚Äôre miles away off in a treehouse, but so close to all the things Raleigh has to offer."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This magnificent mid-century gem perched overlooking a wooded ravine with 3 stories of glass was spectacular. The home is a joy to be in, private in the neighborhood, but incredible in its connection to nature, bird-watching, rain storms, and the light that fills the space and changes throughout the day and night.
Alli and Jessica were terrific hosts, and the home was the perfect spot for my wife and I to enjoy all that the Raleigh area has to offer with it's very convenient location. You're minutes from NC Museum, RDU Airport, and the PNC Arena for the NHL, and a mere 15 minutes to downtown Raleigh restaurants or not much farther to Durham for a whole different scene.
A wonderful stay, and we hope to come again. A treehouse for the modernist. What could be better?"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely stunning property and amazing host! We were greeted at check in and given a tour. The house had the most amazing views we had ever seen, so unbelievably peaceful. Very modern but still very homey"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"No other words to describe this house other than STUNNING! We felts right at home from the moment we walked in. Everything was clean and pristine. The kitchen had everything that you needed to cook. The bed was comfortable, shower and bathroom were relaxing and clean. The views were peaceful and relaxing. Couldn‚Äôt say enough great things. 10/10 recommend!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Scenic, Secluded Serine and Seductive.
If you are looking for a romantic getaway or just a place to restore your soul‚Ä¶look no further. This modern and well decorated home boasts with it‚Äôs open and well equipped kitchen, breath taking views and peaceful yet exhilarating ambiance. Conveniently located near shopping and restaurants with the feeling of being in a modern oasis deep into the woods. The tranquility was intoxicating. The relaxation addictive. We wanted to go out to eat one of the nights but decided to order in. We did not want to leave! We wanted to bask in all the glory of this beautiful home!! We would love to come back! Thank you for the experience."
2023-12-01,3,Stayed a few nights,The driveway is very small and a downward curve. we found it very difficult to park and they are adamant that you don't park on the street. They hit us with a list of items missing and damages that I'm not convinced we are responsible for.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved our stay at this charming retreat! The architecture perfectly frames the serene forest views. Ideal getaway for my family.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and exactly what we wanted. The hosts were lovely and very responsive - let us check in early since we were making great time with traffic. The home was absolutely fabulous. The location was perfect, close to local hiking trails. Quick drive to everything, but the building and views made you feel like you were completely private and secluded."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying here - didn‚Äôt want to leave. I pinned a picture of this place on my Pinterest board years ago and it‚Äôs a dream I found it and got to stay here! Jessica was so kind and responsive. She even let us know when the cleaning was done so we could check in early. I wish we could live in this home - truly an adult treehouse and a great place to unwind üôÇ
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a great spot! Fav place to stay in Raleigh
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"First time user of AirB&B. Just wanted to say - Wow and I mean WOW. Alli is a wonderful host. The home is beautiful with floor to ceiling windows looking out to a forest. So quiet and peaceful. At night many of the trees are lit with soft ground lights which adds to the ambiance. The interior is wonderfully appointed with nicely arranged furnishing and art. Everything is new and state of the art including the appliances, cabinets, and fixtures. Really enjoyed having a family dinner at the house. We even made use of the outdoor grill. Can‚Äôt wait to see my nephews again and stay here at Alli‚Äôs fabulous home. Thx again Alli."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alli's place was beyond all our expectations! My husband and I came here for a quick weekend getaway & it turned out to be a place that we now plan to come back yearly for. Check in was extremely easy, you can park directly in front of the main entrance, so it was easy to get all of our stuff in and out of. Besides the house being 100% clean, they had everything you could think of. Our host even left us a bottle of wine and a thank you card that we enjoyed. The living room is so open + tall, yet so inviting, cozy + comfortable. From the huge bathtub that can easily fit 2, to the forest surrounding you at all times, we honestly couldn't have asked for more. Also, as private and secluded as this house looks, you're actually only 5 minutes from a large mall and shopping, so it was extremely convenient for us. & only about 20-25 minutes from the Raleigh airport. Everything seemed to be no more than a 15-20 min drive but still had tons of things to do around us. Thanks Alli!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our recent stay at this Airbnb was nothing short of magical. Five stars all around! From the breathtaking beauty of the house to the warm hospitality of the host, every aspect of our visit exceeded our expectations. The moment we arrived, we were awestruck by the sheer beauty of the property. The house is a true gem, meticulously designed and tastefully decorated. It's evident that the host has put a lot of thought and effort into creating a space that is not only comfortable but also aesthetically pleasing. The attention to detail is astounding, from the elegant furnishings to the exquisite artwork adorning the walls. From the moment we booked our stay, communication with them was seamless. They were incredibly responsive and provided all the information we needed to make our arrival and stay as smooth as possible. Upon arrival, we were greeted with a warm welcome and a tour of the property, which made us feel right at home."

From the moment you walk in, the nature views from the ceiling to floor windows makes you feel like you‚Äôre in a rainforest. The open concept to this home is beautiful. This home is truly unique!
An added plus to this amazing home was Alli and Jessica. They were kind, responsive, and accommodating! They both made this mini getaway so memorable for me and I will definitely be renting again in the near future.
Kindly,

Beds were comfortable, plenty of towels, toiletries also included, and we found what we needed in the kitchen. Our girls loved laying on the large comfy couches. We loved the open concept with all the windows‚Ä¶it was beautiful morning and night. They also had seasonings, olive oil, and nespresso/tea. We will definitely return!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was life-changing for me. That sounds like hyperbole, but it‚Äôs really not! I‚Äôve been struggling with some severe mental health issues & haven‚Äôt been able to get out of a rut. But there‚Äôs something so healing and life-affirming about this home. It has helped me re-center my life by unplugging and being engrossed by nature & beauty.
The architecture and design is out of this world. It‚Äôs one of the most beautiful places I‚Äôve seen, and certainly ever stayed. It‚Äôs so spacious and clean.
The location is private, quiet, and feels remote. But it‚Äôs very close to everything. I have loved opening the windows or sitting on the patio listening to the birds and wildlife.
The hosts were so gracious! They were so generous with some accommodation requests and were always so kind, prompt, and helpful. Best hosts I‚Äôve had on Airbnb!
We plan on booking a trip to NC just to stay at this house again in the future. It‚Äôs an amazing getaway. Cannot recommend the home, area, or hosts enough!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect little place for me and my husband to celebrate our anniversary. It rained all weekend which just made the house feel cozier and really illuminated the lush forest outside. The hosts reached out before during and after the stay to make sure everything was going well. I highly recommend staying in this beautiful house in Raleigh.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alli is a super host!! The home is unlike any we have ever stayed in. I was looking for inspiration for a build for our own modern home on Lake Gaston and found exactly this in this home. Amazing nature, wonderful fire-pit outside. One feels like they are in a forest paradise but in the middle of The city. Just wonderful in every way. In fact I want to buy this house!!! If Alli ever sells I want I be in the mix!!!
Five stars is not enough!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay in Raleigh. House is even better than the photos, so peaceful and super clean! We loved having a campfire on the porch in the evening, and waking up to sunshine & trees in the morning!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Modern Treehouse was absolutely gorgeous and in a wonderful location close to downtown and North Raleigh. It was so peaceful. The home has so many special details including the windows, tub, patio and even the art"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home was stunning! The photos don‚Äôt even begin to do it justice. An amazing stay in a perfect part of town. I live in Raleigh, and stayed here for a local ‚Äústaycation‚Äù and couldn‚Äôt have been happier. The downstairs bedroom is private, comfortable, and much bigger than it looked in the photos. The upstairs bedroom is spacious, open, and complete with a massive bathroom. Highly recommend."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful house!! Very peaceful and very close to eateries and the mall. Highly recommend to anyone wanting a tranquil get away but close to the hustle and bustle of a large city.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We recently had the pleasure of staying at this modern house set in a quiet and beautiful location, and couldn't have been more impressed with the experience. The house was beautifully designed and decorated, with a sleek and modern aesthetic that felt both stylish and comfortable.
But what really made this stay so special was the location. Tucked away in a peaceful and picturesque forest setting, the house offered stunning views of the surrounding natural beauty, and provided the perfect escape.
The amenities were top-notch, with everything needed to feel right at home. The kitchen was well-equipped for cooking, and the living spaces were cozy, making it easy to relax. (Note that with it‚Äôs modern design, open plan, and stairs/bridge to enter, it might not be a great fit for young children)
The host was incredibly friendly and helpful, providing a quick tour of the house for a comfortable stay."
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This house is exquisite. The glass walls that face the woods behind the property make you feel secluded and at peace. Everything was squeaky clean and the aesthetic is open, airy, and relaxing. Tons of things to do and places to go outside of the neighborhood. Property manager was friendly and helpful upon arrival. The kitchen is fully equipped and able to host many guests. The TV's have great sound and pictures as well! It's a lovely space to unwind and enjoy the nature around you."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Incredible house in a quiet community and perfect setting. Couldn't ask for a better week in this place.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I stayed at the Modernist Treehouse for our anniversary.
There were so many things to say about this amazing home. But to sum it up quickly;
This is a beautiful home that will give you the feeling of luxury. You will feel like you are thousands of miles off grid, when you are actually 5 minutes from civilization. The natural lighting from the beautiful windows add such a wonderful scenery and give such a peaceful feeling. The house was well equipped with everything you need to bunker down for a weekend.
The only thing I think the house needed was more cookware and appliances. I personally cook a lot and I felt like I was messing some things.
Other then that it was perfect.
Finally the hosts were seriously the best. They were quick to respond and made us so welcomed!
5/5 stay!"
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Located in the heart of Greater Raleigh and what a spectacular home! Greenway/trails very close by and nature is all around you. Yep, you do feel like you in a glass tree house made of glass, steel and wood."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This home was out of this world. Not only did the host made me feel comfortable but added little things to make my stay relaxed as possible.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome stay! Me and my wife really enjoyed ourselves. We went about 15 minutes down the road to the Angus Barn and had dinner. If you stay in Raleigh with your significant other, take them to this place, and then take them to the Angus Barn. You won‚Äôt regret it. Wonderful hosts, and a beautiful place. Would stay again no doubt. 100/10!!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was amazing, loved the modern style and art. Nature wakes you up. Moonlight puts you to sleep. It was my honeymoon and 50th birthday. They gifted us a bottle of wine. My only regret is I should have stayed another day. This is a safe and welcoming community. Thank you for the gift and sharing your home with us, we enjoyed our stay."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and property! Pictures didn't do the physical location justice. Home has everything you need. I look forward to returning.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"**LEGIT** this home blew us away! Its stunning! It‚Äôs the little things that make a big difference, like leaving little notes around the house and offering to have coffee on her! So thoughtful! Cleanliness was the biggest thing for me! So so clean! Didn‚Äôt see any hair on the ground.. nothing! She had step-by-step instructions to make everything seamless! And she includes a personal touch with local spots to hit up! There‚Äôs nothing better than being able to hit up a local spot to eat! The neighborhood is family friendly and there‚Äôs a nice park just up the street. It‚Äôs nice and quiet and doesn‚Äôt get loud at night. Laura was so communicative. She checked in with me during the stay and was there in case I needed anything! Never had an encounter with such an invested and inclusive host! I can‚Äôt wait to stay at one of her other properties when visiting town again! Thank you, Laura for everything!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place to stay. The whole house was exceptional. I have no complains.

Very pleased and happy we chose this home for our family to stay in while there for a wedding! Thanks, Laura for sharing your beautiful home!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Laura and her home are absolutely lovely! We loved the comfortable beds, great recommendations, and peaceful neighborhood. We also loved how clean her place was.

We really enjoyed the decor of Laura's home and the extra special touches that truly made us feel welcome. We would not hesitate to stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Loved this place! I would definitely stay here again
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Laura‚Äôs place was absolutely perfect for my bachelorette trip! My group kept telling me how amazing her place was and I think it was a great amount of space for a group of 6 women! This has been my favorite AirBnB I‚Äôve stayed in so far! Please put Laura‚Äôs place at the top of your to visit list!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the house! Comfortable beds, all the amenities you can think of, and a really cool vibe - my kids wanted to move in! Laura was a great host with crystal clear instructions for arrival and departure, and was always responsive. We‚Äôll be back!"

A good choice of spices are also available in one of the kitchen drawers. The house is great!
One thing that we all mentioned is that it would be nice if the sofa in the living room would fold out to a bed. That would be an added plus but not a necessity.
Thanks!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely loved staying at Laura's Air bnb ! It was everything I had hoped and more. My roommate and I stayed there because we were apartment hunting over our spring break in Raleigh. Not only did we find the perfect apartment down town but it was only a 7 minute drive from the Airbnb so after a long day of apartment hunting it was quick and easy to get home. Laura is an amazing host, and response quickly to messages. The airbnb itself is beautiful and stunning. It felt like home, (even though it wasn't) ya know what I mean? I have so many nice things to say about this place and Laura, but only 1,000 words to use. So I'll leave it at this....100% worth it and it is perfect in every way shape and form."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I've stayed in a lot of airbnb's, and this airbnb is the best experience I've had to date. The house is just beautiful. Clean, spotless, the decor! The main bedroom bathroom is absolutely stunning. The kitchen was wonderful. The beds/mattresses/pillows/towels were spa-like. I am surprised this was not an airbnb Plus or luxe. The location (while not DT) is really 10-15mins from everything and there is a little complex you can walk to that has a super cute brewery. Also close to a park. I wish the weather had been a little nicer so we could've enjoyed the porch/back yard a little more, but next time! Thank you for a wonderful stay."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lovely house, extremely well thought out space, amazingly decorated and appointed - one of our BEST air bnb‚Äôs yet!!

We would love to stay again the next time we‚Äôre in Raleigh."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"BEAUTIFUL PLACE , if you‚Äôre coming to Raleigh for the weekend or even just need a getaway from home Laura‚Äôs place was everything I expected and more! Will definitely be booking again"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Interior is really well done and a notch above most other airbnb listings. I'm familiar with the Raleigh area but this is also a great place if you have family visiting for holidays/weekends etc. or colleagues for work and want a decent sized spot for them to stay.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our short but pleasant stay. The house was ample size for a party of 8, 4 kids and 4 adults.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This. This is the kind of house that you hope is as nice as the pictures. And, it was!
First of all, quality furniture and mattresses‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt feel like I was living in a Wayfair ad where everything was broken down and/or overly cheap.
It was spotless, thoughtful and well appointed.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Laura was an AMAZING host! She was very quick to respond, even in the middle of the night. And very accommodating, to almost everything we asked for. She made sure our visit was absolutely comfortable and amazing. She constantly reaches out to make sure we settled in alright, and if there's anything that she can help us with. Her place was absolutely stunning, jaw dropping I would say. The beds were extremely comfortable, we felt like we're sleeping on clouds - one of the best sleep we've had in a while. To the point that I've reached out and asked what brand all the beddings was and bought myself some! HAHA. The master bedroom and its bathroom was extremely spacious. The entire house was designed with comfort in mind. It's very modern, it's very pretty. Everything is planned to the detail. We loved it, and we love the host! Would definitely visit again."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Laura‚Äôs home was the perfect stay for our family‚Äôs stay in Raleigh. We all left wishing it was our home.

2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"I can‚Äôt say enough great things about our stay. The house is beautiful. It was right out of a magazine. Spacious, clean, modern, warm, and inviting. Everyone raved about the comfort of the beds, and the fact we had 3 bathrooms for 5 women was key! And I can‚Äôt not mention the kitchen! It‚Äôs what dreams are made of if you love to cook and also appreciate clutter free counters (which I do!)
We didn‚Äôt get to utilize the deck, porch, or yard bc of the weather, but it was all so lovely.
The location cannot be beat. We were there to wedding dress shop for my sister as well as explore Raleigh. Anywhere we needed to go was no more than a 10 minute drive. And the neighborhood is quiet and safe.
We were there during Hurricane Ian and the neighbor let us know we could use their generator if need be! That was so appreciated.
Lastly, Laura is the ideal host! She has a whole page of recommendations of places to go in the area as well as the cutest little coffee bar. All the little touches made us feel so welcome and at home.
The power went out bc of the storm on our first day, and she was in communication with me throughout. She even had lanterns and flashlights for us.
We would 100% be thrilled to stay here again if ever in the area!"
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"This AirBnb is perfect. It's open, it's clean, it's centrally located. Our out of town team stayed here for a few days for a meeting in Raleigh and it was PERFECT. The home was beautifully decorated, spacious and the layout is excellent. The hosts were easy to communicate with, flexible for a couple requests we had (thank you Laura!), and everything ran smoothly. We will definitely be returning!"
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,The pictures don‚Äôt do this beautiful and quiet home any justice! Neighborhood was sweet and serene. Loved the privacy of backyard. Amazing deck to soak up sun! And the home is stunning. Every detail has been covered. Would definitely stay here again and again! Be sure to check out Union coffee just up the block. Yum!
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"Laura‚Äôs Airbnb is absolutely gorgeous and feels like it jumped out of an interior design magazine. Lots of thoughtful touches, and the master bath is sublime. Great location. For having four bedrooms, I do wish that the couch was a little bigger to accommodate the amount of people in the house. The outdoor patio area was stunning, but there were a few girthy spiders (and this is coming from a Texan) that kept us inside. Lastly, the living room shades were definitely see through from the street at night when the lights were on which we didn‚Äôt love. All in all, I would book again."
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,Amazing home that‚Äôs fits the description perfectly. First time ever trying out air bnb and this home kicked it off to a great start for me. They were quick to answer any questions I had. Very amazing experience!

Laura was very communicative and I appreciated all of your help!"
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"This was the perfect house for myself, husband, and a few other couples to stay while in town for a wedding.

Not to mention the place was awesome, I would‚Äôve been happy staying in both nights just to hang out in such a cool house!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house was amazing. Clean, spacious and unbelievably comfy. And, our host was gracious and accommodating. We will be back."
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"Laura‚Äôs house was amazing. Very clean and great location. The neighborhood was nice and less than a 10 min drive downtown. She had the house stocked with all of the essentials. A cute coffee station, laundry detergent, etc. Very clean. She was extremely easy to communicate with. I would 100% stay here again. The only thing to be careful of is pulling a smaller car into the driveway, it will definitely bottom out. There is plenty of space to park on the road."
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"Perfect home for our family to stay in while in Raleigh for vacation. The home had plenty of room, so everyone had space to themselves. The whole house was clean and stocked with all the necessary items. The primary bedroom and bathroom were just beautiful. While we didn't use the kitchen, it was very clean and spacious.
Our hosts, Laura and family, were very accommodating to our needs and very quick to respond to questions. We loved our stay and would be happy to stay here again."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you are searching for a place in the Raleigh area , look no further. Spacious home with FOUR bedrooms and THREE full baths lovingly decorated so you feel like you are staying in a modern oasis. The main bathroom with amazing shower and soaking tub is a treat in itself giving major spa vibes. The highlight though was the luxurious king size bed - you literally won‚Äôt find a more comfortable bed from mattress to pillows to linens. Huge TV in main bedroom as well. Comfy sofa and seating are u in main living space. Plenty of room for two adults and two teens - with a bedroom to spare! Washer and dryer clean and available. Excellently appointed coffee station with ample coffee/tea selection and sugar/ creamers. Very nice quiet neighborhood and very close to town. We enjoyed Pooles diner, hummingbirds, the Raleigh flea market, the farmers market and the natural history museum - all within a short distance to the home."
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"wonderful, clean, cozy home! would recommend to anyone considering."
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"This house was the perfect stay for our weekend getaway! We had 8 in our party and this home was perfect.
The house has an open floor plan which is great for groups. We all hung out together in the living/kitchen area, which was beautifully decorated and has everything you need or want. The coffee station was great and the fridge was spacious and had a water filter built inside.
The bedrooms were all perfect for our group. Everyone was raving about how comfortable the beds and comforters were! There was a washer/dryer in one of the bedrooms, which we didn‚Äôt need but was nice to have. The bathrooms were also great - 2 bathrooms attached to bedrooms, and one shared bathroom in the hallway for the remaining two bedrooms. Even with 8 adults, we never had a problem with timing our showers! It was the perfect size and layout for our group.
There‚Äôs plenty of space to park here. The driveway fits 3-4 cars and there‚Äôs room for 2 more on the street in front of the house. The deck and backyard were also super cute. We decided to go on a walk on the greenway path nearby which was beautiful - we saw 2 deer, a turtle, and a blue heron!
The location of this home is great. It took ten minutes or less for us to drive or Uber anywhere downtown. There‚Äôs also many spots nearby that were walkable - we only didn‚Äôt walk to those because the heat index was pretty high during our visit!
Laura went above and beyond to make this home great. There were storms passing through during our stay, and she communicated everything to me extremely quickly. The power went out for a tiny bit, and we only knew because Laura told us - luckily, none of us were at the home when the power went out, so it didn‚Äôt impact us at all. Even for things out of her control, Laura checked in with us to ensure we were aware!
Laura cares about her guests having a great stay, which is easy to tell through her communication and the care she has put into this home. She‚Äôs thought of every detail that her guests could want or need. There are thoughtful notes around the home for any questions that may arise, and great recommendations for things to do in the area. She also responded to my messages right away. We all gushed over how amazing this place was and that we want to come back! I would definitely recommend this house to anyone considering it!!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The photos don't do Laura's place justice. Although my coworkers and I were on a work trip her home made us feel like we were on a. getaway Laura is super responsive and accommodating. Would love to come back and stay for an actual vacation.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home! My friends and I had a great time here, the decor was great, the beds were extremely comfortable and we were a short drive to downtown. Great place to stay if you‚Äôre in town."
2022-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,Need a quiet rest after a busy day in Raleigh? This is the house for you. Nice neighborhood with a park. A 20-30 min drive to many activities and local attractions.
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"Wonderful house, easy rules, and beautiful neighborhood."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! It was spotless when we arrived. Nice quiet neighborhood and just a short drive to downtown. I loved how thoughtful the host was about every little detail in the house. And my favorite part was the really comfortable bed, and nice quality pillows, sheets, duvet, and towels‚Ä¶felt like we were staying in a 5 star hotel. The host was very friendly and responsive (we never needed anything because the house had everything, but we did ask her where she bought the bedding! She gave us all the details!) Highly recommend!"
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,Laura‚Äôs home was amazing. We stayed there for my daughters graduation and everything was just perfect. So much attention to detail and so many extras included. We will definitely stay here again and recommended to anyone looking for a great home close to Raleigh.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,I‚Äôve stayed in 100s of Airbnb and this was truly a 5 star experience. The host is incredibly thoughtful. Everything is available to you. The house was spotless. Everything was newly washed. The home is beautiful. We could not ask for a better stay. Thank you!
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"We loved our stay and would definitely return again in the future. The house looks very newly renovated and upgraded - from bathroom features to the kitchen and layout and beyond. Location is very ideal - just a 5-10 minute drive from everything downtown. Laura was great at answering any questions leading up to and of course throughout our trip plus gave about 15 awesome food recommendations that were spot on! If you‚Äôre in the area, go to Hummingbird for brunch!
Thank you for everything!!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home exceeds the expectations of the pictures. It is immaculately clean, which is the most important thing for me when traveling with my family. There was plenty of space for our family of four, with room to spare. Every detail has been thought of ahead of time and is provided for. It is conveniently located in a quiet neighborhood, within walking distance of a public park with a playground, which we appreciated having easy access to with small children. It is also a quick drive to everything you want to explore downtown. We will happily stay here again next time we visit Raleigh!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place, convenient location, stylish and practical in a quiet neighborhood."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful space and super convenient for everything in Raleigh. It was perfect for our wedding dress shopping weekend with my mom and sister. ü•∞

2022-03-01,5,Group trip,"The pictures give this home no justice. It‚Äôs even better than I expected. Very clean, comfortable and roomy. The beds are amazing. I slept so well.The house has a great feel to it. The back yard has a nice sitting area and so does the deck. The living space has a really comfortable couch and big screen TV. The master bedroom was a huge plus with the walk out deck and huge bathroom was a free standing shower/bath combo. The kitchen has the necessities to cook your own meal. Just bring your food and favorite seasonings and condiments. Plenty of dishes, cups, silverware and cooking utensils. Also pots and pans. Laura was a great host. Always was in contact and ready if I would have needed anything. The neighborhood is nice and quiet. Lots of friendly people out walking their dogs or taking a stroll. My family am I rated this home our favorite üíï. We defiantly will make this the home we stay at when visiting our families in North Carolina."
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,We really enjoyed our stay at Laura‚Äôs home! It is the perfect house for a larger group with all the bedrooms in addition to a great outdoor space. The master bedroom and bath are also such a treat! Our whole group was very impressed by our accommodations.

2022-03-01,5,Group trip,Amazing house! Very clean and it was just amazing over all!!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I want to come back to Raleigh just to stay at this house!! We travel a lot for my son's golf tournaments and stay at a lot of different houses. This was one of the best experiences that we have had from start to finish. The house has been updated and no detail was left off. Laura was extremely thoughtful with a hand written note wishing my son good luck and cookies in the fridge. We were very close to downtown and NC State. Looking forward to stay again!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect! Quick responses from Laura during the booking process as well as leading up to our stay. We really enjoyed our stay at Laura‚Äôs house and will definitely check availability for future visits!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home, very clean and spacious! The pictures do not do it justice. The location of this home is perfect - calm, quiet location yet just a short Uber trip to downtown Raleigh. Laura was a great host - very accommodating and responsive. I would absolutely stay here again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennie‚Äôs place was modern, beautiful and so clean! We would definetly stay again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is my second time staying at Jennie‚Äôs and it‚Äôs great every time. Very responsive host, we made good time and were able to check early. Neighborhood has beautiful houses- great for an early morning or evening stroll. The extra toiletries in the bathroom are always helpful. The room and bathroom are spotless and there are enough towels. Would recommend. I just wish there was a microwave to re-heat leftovers"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a great place to stay for a quick trip to Raleigh! Very comfortable, clean, and in a great location. Would definitely stay again if we were making another trip to the area."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a short stay-only one night, but we thoroughly enjoyed Jennie‚Äôs place. Extremely clean and tidy, immaculate shower, and peaceful and quiet area! Jennie was quick to respond to any questions that we had."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Listing was exactly as described and host was very accommodating and responsive. She went above and beyond fulfilling a request we had made and it was very appreciated!! The room was clean and felt spacious with the tall ceilings. The door lock is a little tricky but host sent instructions ahead of time which worked perfect. You are in control of the heat/cool temp but our only recommendation would be adding a fan to just move air around and keep it from getting stuffy when it heats up outside. Street parking felt safe and we had no issues. Smart TV was great for streaming our shows and even had some things you could watch without needing to sign in to your own app. Bed and pillows were comfy! Would definitely stay here again if we were in Raleigh!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennie‚Äôs place was a great stay! Very clean and easy to get in and out of, quiet neighborhood with multiple things to do in walking distance. She had a lot of great recommendations too!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay! My favorite parts were the bathroom items she has, great shower, and the cleanliness. I also was so happy to not have to log in to accounts like Hulu, Prime Video,Netflix. That is always one amenity that will attract me back to the spot! Very safe and peaceful neighborhood with amazing restaurants and coffee shops. I just moved from the Triangle area to Charlotte, so I know this neighborhood well. I appreciate her proactive communication. I love new or renovated spaces like this.
One thing I didn't realize (that's on me) was that there was no microwave or utensils, making it hard to heat up my delicious leftovers from Croquette (in North Hills and is a 10/10 French cuisine restaurant). The mini fridge was great and stored all my waters, yogurts (but no spoons) and snacks. I would definitely recommend Jennie's place for a great night's sleep and lovely neighborhood!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was perfect! Listing was exactly how it was described. Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better place for a nice weekend getaway. Thanks Jennie!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"My second time to stay with Jennie, again it was fantastic and I would rate this as one of the best Airbnb‚Äôs I‚Äôve stayed in to date. Her space is absolutely perfect for a quick stay, this time I was able to bring my wife because I knew she would love everything about it. Bathroom and bed is great, so cozy and everything exceeded expectations. I stayed here again for an annual conference and hope to come back again next year! Highly recommended."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Excellent place! We really noticed the little touches that made this place stand out from other bare bones places we've stayed. Plenty of towels, pillows, an extra blanket; amenities in the bathroom; bedside lamps! Jennie was so flexible and helpful with me as my planning got more complicated. Loved the neighborhood."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jennie did such a lovely job making everything convenient for our stay in Raleigh. The room was clean and comfortable and avoided any artificial fragrances which was a bonus. We appreciated the easy and secure private access to the space.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jennie‚Äôs place is my favorite! Have stayed here multiple times now when I come to Raleigh to see show‚Äôs at the Ritz. Great location, so clean, and has everything you need."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were just in town for a night to see a show in the city, and Jennie‚Äôs place was absolutely perfect for what we needed! The shower was heavenly, and the bathroom and entire space was immaculate. The bed was super comfortable and we were able to watch our favorite shows on Hulu at night. We felt right at home, and will certainly return next time we visit the area!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We stayed at this Air BnB over the Christmas holiday so we could be close to family but have our own space. The unit was located in a super nice neighborhood, easy to access with a private entrance. Everything was brand new. The bathroom shower was awesome and the bed was very comfy. The host was very responsive both before our stay and during when we had a questions. We would definitely recommend and hope to stay there again next time we are in Raleigh to visit family."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennie's place in Raleigh is one of the nicest stays we have ever had! I do not give this ""best"" review to just any location.

From the exquisite bathroom to the cute work area to the INSANELY comfortable bed, I was in heaven in Jennie's studio. She is quick to respond and provided everything I needed for a stay in Raleigh.
Also, this area is so cute and walkable - I took two walks around the neighborhood just to look at the houses and admire the halloween decorations! All in all, I highly recommend Jennie as a host and her studio as an escape."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Spotless, modern, and convenient. Jennie avoided over-communicating and I had no need to speak with her. Be aware that Raleigh's old 5 points neighborhood, which I like, is undergoing gentrification, including construction across the street. This century old neighborhood has the best of the old and the new."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow! Great location close to downtown, but in a quiet and beautiful neighborhood. Easy to find and plenty of parking. The space was fabulous! Clean doesn‚Äôt begin to describe it. It was pristine. Jennie thought of everything, and the little details really make you feel at home. It was 95¬∞F during my stay, but the room stayed cool thanks to the Nest thermostat. The bed was so comfortable, I wish I slept this well at home. I‚Äôll gladly stay here again when visiting Raleigh. Thanks Jennie for being a wonderful host, and for being so accommodating."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jennie‚Äôs place was great! We were in town for a concert and needed a place to stay for the night. It was clean and easy to check in. A few months ago my husband and I had a bad experience with a different Airbnb host, where we ended up having to get a hotel room last minute due to no communication from the host. Jennie was always very responsive with any questions i had, which help put me at ease about everything. I highly recommend staying here if you‚Äôre in town! On an extra note, the water pressure was great in the shower! I have really thick hair so that was a big plus! Will definitely use her in the future if we‚Äôre back in town!"

Spotless, cozy, clean, with a comfortable bed and probably the best water pressure in an AirBnB shower I've ever had! It was close to a bunch of things and while I didn't have time for most of Jennie's recommendations, they all looked really good. The neighborhood was safe and easy to navigate. Will definitely look to stay at Jennie's again if I'm ever back in Raleigh!"

Spotless bathroom and room, mini fridge was helpful. Plenty of extra towels, comfy bed. She added nice touches like extra body wash and shampoo in case we ran out of our travel sized ones and is a super responsive host.
A microwave would‚Äôve been helpful to heat up leftovers. Otherwise, highly recommend this place! I plan on coming back :)"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"(1/2) This is the nicest Airbnb I‚Äôve ever stayed in, and I have stayed in a lot over the years. Better than a Hilton hotel. First let‚Äôs start with the bed. Super comfortable mattress., fantastic sheets and blankets, my wife would absolutely love this. Lots of pillow choices, I slept wonderfully each night.
So many little touches. Jeannie has created a small magazine of not only her AirBnB house rules and expectations, but also every bit of information you might need or want about the area and her place.
I love how she set the door code to be the last four digits of my cell phone number. So easy to remember, so simple.
The mini fridge with water (which I drank) and cold brew (which I did not drink) was also a lovely touch. Some wonderful coffee table books about the American south, history, golf, and other topics. Magazines about local restaurants and bars in Raleigh. Thoughtful, wonderful touches.
The bathroom is incredible. In fact, I might bring my wife here to stay a few"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I booked Jeannie‚Äôs place for an overnight getaway for my parents, and they had nothing but stellar things to say about it!

Thank you, Jennie!"

Jennie went above and beyond with the cleanliness of her place and the little touches went a long way! Like a few water bottles in the fridge and q-tips and flossers in the bathroom.

It was quiet, but there were plenty of people walking in the neighborhood and great restaurants nearby. It's just a few blocks from a bus stop that will get you downtown, which I took multiple times without issue. We managed our entire trip without a car and never felt inconvenienced.
There was an issue with the AC on our second night and she handled it so well! She quickly had a repairman out, and in the meantime gave us a fan and refunded us for one night. She also provided space for my partner to work in while the AC was being fixed."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennie‚Äôs home is a hidden jewel and we are so glad we found it. We needed accommodations for three nights while visiting our son and this private room with private entrance was perfect. Everything was luxuriously simple and sparkling clean with neutral relaxing colors throughout. We enjoyed walks thru the charming tree lined neighborhood with falling leaves and picket fences and young families with strollers as well as retirees with dogs - America at its finest! The room had everything we needed including quality toiletries. I did, however, panic a little when I realized there was no coffee pot, but that was quickly solved with a short 2/10 mi walk down the street to the Bright Spot coffee shop which I highly recommend!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this charming and confortable appartment very clean and neat. We enjoyed our time, having an amazing stay. Thks also for the cold drinks upon our arrival. I recommend Jennie's appartment for any short stay."

Christina Reid"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had a lovely stay at Jennie‚Äôs place! It was one of the best air bnb‚Äôs I‚Äôve stayed at in a long time! It was extremely clean and felt more like a luxury hotel. The shower seemed newly renovated and had great water pressure. All necessities were stocked up perfectly and several soap/shampoo options were provided. The bed/pillows were very comfortable. The location was perfect in a beautiful upscale neighborhood plus close to downtown. There was plenty of privacy and the room felt separate from the main house which was nice. The only negative was that the mini fridge was a little noisy throughout the night. Also the driveway is very short and slanted, so parking on the street in front of the house would be a better option. I would definitely stay here again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"A tremendous experience all around! Jennie was exceedingly communicative and timely with responses to any inquiries I had prior to my stay, as well as ensured a speedy check-in process upon my arrival. The space itself couldn‚Äôt have been more ideal - located in a great neighborhood not far from downtown, incredibly clean and comfortable, and free from any outside noise or disturbances. Without a doubt recommend staying here if you‚Äôre visiting Raleigh and know I‚Äôll be booking again if I‚Äôm back in the area!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennie‚Äôs place was exactly as described. The space is cozy, comfortable, beautiful, peaceful, and extremely convenient.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jade was amazing as always. This was our second time staying here and even with four people staying instead of three it was still plenty of space for everyone. The kitchen was well stocked and both the bed and the couch were incredibly comfortable. The black out curtains were a great plus as well when sleeping. Will definitely be coming back again next year!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I highly recommend this apartment! It is beautiful inside and Jade has included all the small touches to make your visit feel special!

We highly recommend this lovely apartment!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If given the opportunity, I would definitely book with Jade again! She was very responsive and flexible. I needed to adjust my dates for the stay and she was receptive. She cared about my well-being and strived to accommodate me to enhance my stay. Parking was flexible in the area. The place is walking distance from Dorthea Dix as well as the downtown area. Everything I possibly needed was easy to find in the place so I did not see the need to reach out not once to Jade during my stay! I visited for Dreamville Festival so my friend and I enjoyed resting our sore feet and enjoying Netflix from her couch until we got tired. The couch was comfortable to relax in for a good night‚Äôs rest! There is also a full-size kitchen so my friend and I appreciated being able to purchase groceries from one of the many nearby grocery stores. It‚Äôs hard to find food in the area late at night after the festival. Thank you Jade for the amazing stay!"

The kitchen is well equipped, the living room comfortable for sitting and chatting, and there's a table with chairs for eating. The bed and sofabed were both quite comfortable. We enjoyed the little porch. The convention center was a 10-12 minute walk away. And Jade pointed out the fabulous Boulted Bakery two houses down. Looking forward to staying again on our next trip to Raleigh."

2024-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,"For the proximity to the downtown area it‚Äôs reasonably priced, however there wasn‚Äôt a mention of how close the apt is to the train tracks and how often the train runs in the middle of the night. Something worth noting with younger children in tow. Glad we had a sound machine.
The apt it self is extremely cozy and well equipped. The open kitchen concept was my favorite and the thoughtfully decorated accents. My children especially loved the toys they discovered."

Jade was really easy to communicate with and more than accommodating to us. Would highly recommend this home away from home. Thank you , cheers Jade !! You rock !"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jade was super friendly, and the instructions were easy/clear to follow for the self-check-in. The Airbnb is in a peaceful/quiet and cute neighborhood (near a bakery/coffee shop, for the coffee lovers out there) that is within a 10-15 minute walking distance from downtown and the nightlife.

Kitchen was a good size and easy to work in, and was well stocked with tools. Both the bed and couch were comfortable and no one had any issues with sleeping comfortably. The bathroom was also great, well stocked and off in a private corner. Good water pressure and the water gets pretty hot, for those that love a hot shower.

We will be looking forward to coming back again next year."

You can tell they spend a lot of time making sure everything you need is available including High quality linens, comfortable bed and fluffy towels.

Richard, San Francisco"

The space itself was very clean, comfortable, and homey. It's within walking distance of so many great restaurants, and there's lots of bus stops nearby if you're going any farther. The train does go by nearby and this can be loud, but there is a background noise machine if you need it."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic place for a long weekend! The location was perfect with the Warehouse District/Downtown a 10-20 minute walk so checking out the local spots to eat and drink was easy.
The house was exactly as described and had a perfect amount of space. Everything was very clean and we felt comfortable the entire time. Jade was great at communicating ahead of time so check-in was easy and made sure we had everything we needed.
If ever back in Raleigh I would stay here again and would highly recommend it to anyone traveling and needing accommodations in the city."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of my favorite airbnbs! I was in town for J. Cole's Dreamville festival. Dorothea Dix Park was a 13 walk to the park.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed here the night of our wedding and it was amazing! The hosts were so thoughtful and left a bottle of champagne in the fridge waiting for us. The location was perfect, close to downtown but still had a private feel. Would definitely recommend!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely apartment in walking distance to downtown Raleigh and the best bars, caf√©s and restaurants in the Warehouse District. One of the best caf√©s is actually right next door. The place looks like on the pictures, is very clean, well equipped and felt comfortable from the start. The hosts were very responsive, friendly and proactive. Check-in was easy and super flexible (we checked in late on a Sunday).
The only thing you have to be aware of is sounds from trains passing nearby. However, this is a general thing for EVERY place in the west of Raleigh Downtown that you just have to get used to.
I booked it for my parents and would book it again any minute."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I've stayed in many Airbnbs over the years. Jade's place ranks as one of the overall best. It is thoughtfully appointed--decorated uniquely, like a place where someone would actually want to live, as opposed to the Airbnbs that are akin to a hotel room. The place is filled with natural light entering through what appear to be the original windows from the early 1900s. All of the windows have room darkening curtains, allowing for sleep at any hour. The high ceilings offer a spacious feel. There is a cozy porch, with views of the peaceful yard, and downtown's tall buildings, which are only a 15-20min walk from the place. The place is super clean, and Jade provides a white noise machine for the bedroom. Thank you Jade, for being such a thoughtful host!"

Easy parking, easy to get places. Very comfortable. Train tracks are close, but sound machine covered all noise at night and we slept well every night (and I am usually a uneasy sleeper in different places.) Jade was very responsive to our questions."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved staying here! Great/cozy comforter & towels, really nice bathroom and kitchen. Enjoyed working on my laptop in the living room & dining area which sometimes would be all day. Also great porch for outside breaks & coffee. Will definitely be back!"

The views from the apartment were so pretty, and the location was convenient for downtown trips. I only express caution to light sleepers because the railroad is right next to you, and those train conductors love the sound of their horns."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about this property was perfect. We stayed for three days and the place is spotless, beautifully furnished, and had everything we could have needed. There is certainly enough space to stay for an extended period of time. The walk-in closet certainly helps to keep things tidy. I saw another review that some one mentioned the train and although there is one somewhat nearby, it did not bother us at all. We were able to walk to many bars and restaurants downtown. If we find ourselves in Raleigh again, this will be our first pick! thanks, Jade!!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a fantastic stay at Jade's beautiful place in Raleigh. The place was clean, much bigger than anticipated, well-thought out, the bed comfy, and close to downtown. There was some noise from the nearby train tracks (freight trains), but it didn't really bother me and I'm a light sleeper.
I'd happily stay here again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent little get away place!!!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came to Raleigh to visit our daughter who moved there several months ago. Right away we knew we found our home away from home. The location is perfect. The apartment is clean, super comfortable, very spacious, and Jade is nearly instantaneous in her reply to any inquiry! There is so much to do within walking distance, but if you have a car there is plenty of free street parking and so much to do across the city. My husband rented a bike nearby and enjoyed exploring Raleigh by bike and I had a great time on the running paths that wind through the North Carolina Art Museum‚Äôs sculpture park! No matter how long you stay, you won‚Äôt have time to enjoy all the great restaurants and bars, many of which are in close walking distance. We‚Äôre already looking forward to our next stay!"

2019-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We booked Jade's place so that family could stay nearby during the holidays. It didn't disappoint. It was clean, stylish, and convenient--and Jade was responsive throughout, even on Christmas when my brother couldn't figure out how to work the sofa bed. We'll definitely be using this spot again for out-of-town visitors--and even as a local respite for ourselves."

I‚Äôll stay here again."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Check in was a breeze -- it felt just like coming home to your own place you haven't visited in a while. And assuming you had left it spotlessly clean the last time you visited!
Location is a real plus for this apartment, you will be in easy walking distance to fantastic restaurants (like Fiction Kitchen and The Pit BBQ) and all the events in downtown Raleigh's historic center. A quick Uber to NCSU's main campus or the funky shops and restaurants at Cameron Village. Or an easy ride to Carter-Finlay stadium where we watched the Wolfpack handily defeat Ball State.
Jade's been very thoughtful in providing little touches throughout -- nice fluffy towels, up-market bath products, extra bedding/pillows/blankets and such. Great ceiling fans and responsive A/C so you can create a comfortable oasis to escape that muggy, hot late-summer NC afternoon. There's a Smart TV that will let you access all the streaming services, or you can mirror your own device and laugh over family pictures, as we did one evening. Finally, although we ate dinners out (so many Raleigh eateries to choose from!), the kitchen is sufficiently appointed to prepare a meal and eat in if that's your choice. And in fact, we had lazy breakfasts at the kitchen bar every morning.
All in all, a wonderful, well-appointed, well-located apartment perfect for a small family in-and-out visit to Raleigh. We will most definitely be back, if Jade is willing to have us!"

It‚Äôs in walking distance to downtown, restaurants, museums, but in a pretty, quiet residential neighborhood. I loved having a washer/dryer so I can go home with clean clothes. The kitchen had trail mix, coffee, half and half, kombucha, and more. Jade was responsive and when I expressed my concern that my flight out might be canceled due to Hurricane Dorian, she said the apt. was booked and offered her extra room upstairs in case I got stranded!"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great location to explore downtown Raleigh! You'll be close enough to walk to multiple restaurants, and a 10-15 min drive to other Raleigh attractions. Jade had snacks, coffee, and toiletries for us to use! I would recommendthis place to anyone!"

2019-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The apartment is a great spot for walk downtown to take part in one of the many festivals. There is always something going on in rocking Raleigh. On the other hand you are super easy on one of the highways e.g. to the beach for a weekend trip. Jade provided loooots of great suggestions, tips and ideas what to do and where. Her restaurant ideas were fantastic! The apartment itself has a great layout and the big kitchen invites to cook something. Especially during the warmer period the veranda is great all day and night! Having one of the fancy local beers in the evening is just relaxing. The apartment is super stylish but still you feel immediately homey and comfortable. The shower is greeeeat! üòÉAll in all we can highly recommend this apartment!Even excellent when traveling with a small child! üòÉ"

We were able to walk and bike to various locations in the city which was really cool, and our children were able to easily keep up and go with. The neighborhood is very safe and the apartment itself is beautiful. Loved the white noise machine in the bedroom. I just ordered myself one on Amazon! My favorite part about our stay was that I could listen to the entire Barenaked Ladies concert happening at the Red Hat Ampitheater on the 4th of July, from the front porch of the apartment. How awesome is that?? Overall, great place to stay. City noises, including the train, were a bit startling to us suburbia folks, but we quickly got adjusted. Thanks for a great vacation!"
2018-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend Jade's place. The apartment is comfortable ,clean , private and tastefully decorated. It is in a lovely neighborhood full of mostly small historic homes. The center of downtown Raleigh and the Warehouse district are a short walk away."

As for the apartment, WOW! It was super clean and very comfortable. Checking in was a breeze and the on-street parking was convenient. I wished there wasn‚Äôt any pollen in the air because we would have loved to have taken advantage of the downtown view from the porch.
If you are lucky enough to book the apartment you won‚Äôt be disappointed. It would be on a rare occasion that you would have to make any requests because the apartment is set-up perfectly."
2018-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The space and location are amazing especially for the price. I stayed for a convention and all of the hotels my friends were able to find were more expensive and farther away from the convention center.

We would highly recommend to anyone who is visiting Raleigh to try and book Jade‚Äôs airbnb. We will definitely stay here next time we come to visit Raleigh.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful and relaxing place to stay. Cheryl was very accommodating with an adjustment to my schedule as well as a check in during the middle of the night. Very easy in an out, and very peaceful property with a great outdoor space for working remote on the computer or kicking back."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cheryl was an absolute pleasure, I locked myself out one night at midnight she woke up and unlocked the door for me with no problem. We got to talk for a few short minutes but she was so sweet . I look forward to renting her space again in the near future üíï"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was my first airbnb experience and Cheryl made sure it was absolutely perfect! The property is beautiful and the host is amazing, I don‚Äôt know if I could have asked for anything better. I will definitely be back to stay again!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My second stay in this beautiful Airbnb. It was perfect again! I checked in on Mother‚Äôs Day and was surprised with a bouquet of flowers that Cheryl helped my daughter coordinate. She purchased the bouquet and had it waiting when I arrived. I can‚Äôt express how special that made me (and my daughter) feel. This super host goes above and beyond for their guest and their guests family! The fishing was great once again! One of my favorite things about this place. The pond is just beautiful. The entire place is great! They put so much thought and love into their place to make you feel right at home. It‚Äôs very quiet, the grounds are well kept and it‚Äôs secure. I always feel safe. It‚Äôs great after a long day at work to come home, open the garage door in the kitchen pop something in the oven and sit on the deck with a glass of wine so relaxing! I will definitely stay here again and again!!! Ps Give Sadie a scratch for me!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cheryl and Dave have such a beautiful property. It was a pleasure staying there. I never ask for much when I travel, but they made it clear if I needed anything at all to contact them right away. Very genuine and nice people overall. I would definitely stay here again, and I plan on it in the future."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great host and a wonderful location. 100% recommend!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We reserved the Rustic Loft for a nice long relaxing weekend. The incredibly styled apartment is over the garage of the main house. It was very easy to find! Has a separate entrance and a private deck. Check in was a breeze. They even let us check in a little early so we wouldn't miss our show at Red Hat Amphitheater in town. We enjoyed coffee on the deck, listened to the birds and nature sounds, walked down by the lake to relax. It was a perfect little vacation spot! Very homey! Just a 25 minute drive to Raleigh downtown. It was an awesome place to stay! We definitely recommend!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second time staying with Ms. Cheryl in less than a month. Each visit has been hectic due to my work schedule, but she has always been so accommodating and she (and her husband) even offered to bring me medicine when I was battling a bad headache. I can't say enough about their hospitality, and the space speaks for itself. Truly beautiful, safe, quiet setting with great decor and close to everything! I only regret that I don't have any other plans for a trip to Raleigh in the near future to stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I would give Cheryl‚Äôs place 10/10!!!
I had a wonderful two-night stay at Cheryl's Airbnb. The place was incredibly clean and well-maintained, and Cheryl was an exceptionally accommodating host. I required an early check-in, and she was more than happy to oblige.
The property is perfect for anyone traveling with a pet. It features a spacious deck and a beautiful yard where my dog could run around and enjoy the outdoors. The interior of the place had a brand-new smell and was sparkling clean, which was very impressive to me, as I am quite particular about cleanliness and tend to be put off by any hint of dirtiness.
Everything in the Airbnb seemed brand new, and the overall cleanliness of the space was outstanding. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Cheryl's place and will definitely be booking it again when I return to the area."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place! Super clean, safe and peaceful! I can‚Äôt wait to return! If you are debating‚Ä¶JUST BOOK IT!!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If only I could give 6 stars! This place is amazing, Cheryl and her husband are really nice people! We stayed there for 3 days, but I could say that it was the best Airbnb EVER. Everything is so clean and beautiful. That is the place that has a soul. I recommend it to everybody!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing stay at Cheryl‚Äôs place! Clean, organized and so beautifully decorated! Deck was a nice touch and surroundings were beautiful! 100%would recommend to anyone traveling to NC!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I travel to the Durham area several times a year for work. Traveling by myself, feeling safe is first & foremost to me. I have never stayed in the same AIRBNB twice. UNTIL now! I have already booked my next visit. This place is beyond perfect for me! No more searching! I found my home away from home. It is beautiful, CLEAN, cozy, SAFE & private but still close to grocery stores and restaurants. Owners did not cut corners on building or decorating that is obvious! All high end furnishings. The bed is so cozy. I have never stayed anywhere that EVERYTHING was ""SO"" clean! Place had everything I needed and more. It was so nice having fresh flowers in every room upon my arrival. A simple but lovely touch ‚ô•. The owners goes above and beyond to make you feel at home. The garage door to the deck - GREAT! The stars at night from the deck WOW ‚ô• OH! & I caught so many fish!! Don't hesitate to book with these owner they are truly wonderful. Shoutout to Sadie (furbaby)! Love her kisses. 10+ stars!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Me and my best friend stayed at Mrs.Cheryl place for dreamville weekend. And we absolutely loved our stay. As soon as we arrived we were greeted at the door and she was super sweet. The airbnb its self is in a quiet residential neighborhood a few minutes from downtown. The airbnb had everything you would essentially need for a getaway. But the best thing I say about the airbnb all together is the amazing mattress she has when I tell you I got the best sleep I‚Äôve ever had this past weekend. I would 100% recommend this airbnb to someone who is looking for a quiet getaway her and her husband were awesome host. Thank you again for having us!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I stayed at Ms. Cheryl's place for a work trip with my two small dogs. She was incredibly accommodating and responsive from the start, and the loft could not have been more perfect. From the impeccable design to the beautiful surroundings, the loft is a great retreat if you don't want to stay in a hotel. It is only minutes from several restuarants, shops and the highway. While I had to check out early due to a family emergency, Ms. Cheryl and her family were so kind and I did not need a single thing while I was in town. Everything is quiet and I felt safe and right at home. I plan to use this location for any future trips I have in town, and would recommend for a single traveler/couple who would prefer a more upscale setting than a hotel anytime!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is an absolute treasure where we‚Äôll surely be staying again. You‚Äôre never sure what to expect when renting a home, which is what makes reviews so important. We have stayed in Vrbos in Europe, Maine, California, Canada, at least twenty places. Out of those dozens of places we‚Äôve stayed, this one easily makes our top 3.
Remarkably quiet and peaceful, Cheryl thought of everything! From the coffee service and bed linens to the black out shades and white noise machine. The outside deck doubles the square footage and the Adirondack chairs by the water are the image of relaxation. It has ample parking, has easy access to dining, shopping and Cheryl also has fantastic recommendations for local spots.
We very highly recommend this beautiful apartment."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Overall a great place to say, for sure coming back for another stay in the summer. Had everything we could have wanted."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"By far one of the best Airbnb I‚Äôve stayed in. The pictures doesn‚Äôt do the place justice. Cheryl was super accommodating to my needs as far as early check in as well as having treats and a water bowl full of water waiting for my dog to arrive. After the first night I didn‚Äôt want to get out the bed, it was so comfortable. I honestly wish I could‚Äôve stayed longer. Sitting outside down by the pond was so peaceful and serene. Cheryl you have a beautiful home and whenever I‚Äôm ever back in Raleigh I know exactly where I‚Äôm staying !"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful home! Great escape from the city but close to restaurants and shops. Great backyard with a lake with seats nearby. The host had great communication and was great to speak with. I would definitely come back!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cheryl and her husband were absolutely delightful! Not only did she come and introduce herself. They made us feel right at home. The place, the view, the peace all was too perfect! I will be saving this listing and booking again VERY soon!!!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I absolutely loved Cheryl‚Äôs place! Everything was better than expected. Cheryl welcomed us at check-in, made us feel right at home, and perfectly balanced being sociable while non-intrusive. We loved the decor and furnishings. The outside space is absolutely stunning: the covered deck was available to us, as well as seating by the trees and another spot by the pond.
We‚Äôre honored to be her first guests and hope to visit again soon!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is an absolute gem! My girlfriend and I booked our stay here while in town visiting her sister. We wanted something close to town where we could walk if we wanted. The neighborhood is so charming and the home is close to everything‚Äîhighly suggest walking to the brewery up the street for a drink with an incredible view of the city.
The apartment was so neat and tidy with all of the amenities you‚Äôd need during your stay.
From the time we booked til the time we departed for home, Laura was incredibly communicative and helpful. I really appreciated her thoroughness and attention to detail.
The next time we visit Raleigh, we‚Äôre booking here again for sure!"

The bed was 100X better than any hotel‚Ä¶ maybe even my own. Not to mention, the decor was adorable.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is in a gorgeous historic neighborhood that‚Äôs amazingly walkable! Boulted Bread is a 5min walk down the street, great for pastries and sourdough bread. Rebus Works is even closer, and it‚Äôs a local coffee/select grocer. The house itself is very clean, and we loved the 1920‚Äôs charm.

We were visiting Raleigh for a couple of days and I initially thought it wasn‚Äôt going to be so close we to the city enter‚Ä¶but when we got there it was actually just around the corner lol. Super super close to everything!!! You will love the view of the skyline from the backyard :) Even though it was so close to downtown, the area was still quiet and peaceful.
The apartment itself is so so cute. We were very impressed with the balance of modern touches and vintage feel. The bed was very comfy and the apartment was quite big! The decor was very thoughtful and tasteful.
Honestly we loved the apartment so much because it was unique and Laura being an amazing host was the cherry on top! She gave recommendations and wanted to make sure we were enjoying our stay.
Definitely definitely recommend for anyone staying in Raleigh. :) Thanks Laura!!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was extremely clean and perfectly located with dozens of restaurants within a 15 minute walk!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Laura is the best host I have had in the history of my time on AirBnB! Her home is beautiful (better even than pictures) and well appointed with beautiful decor and so many special touches: clear instructions, list of recommendations, elevated linens, stocked coffee bar, toiletries, the list goes on‚Ä¶ She clearly enjoys hosting and strives to do it well! She is also very kind and responds quickly to any requests and inquiries. I truly can‚Äôt say enough kind things and will most definitely be returning!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was in town for work and wanted to be in a walkable location near coffee shops/restaurants, but I didn't have to pay for parking like in a hotel downtown. Laura's place was perfect. The house is charming and stocked with essentials. I appreciated the touch of a sound machine (even though the area was quiet!)"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a clean, comfortable, well appointed apartment in Raleigh. The host was very kind and responsive. I highly recommend!!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a darling apartment! It was impeccably clean, easy to find, and located in a gorgeous historic neighborhood that‚Äôs close to lots of great eats/drinks. I was in town for a weekend, and wish I‚Äôd been able to stay a day or so longer.
The bed was super comfy, probably some of the cleanest sheets I‚Äôve ever crawled into. I‚Äôd definitely stay at Laura‚Äôs place again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of our favorite AirBnb‚Äôs of all time! Laura‚Äôs place is located in a charming historic neighborhood minutes away from downtown Raleigh. The apartment is spacious and well appointed with upscale furnishings, lovely bathroom, comfortable bed and a full kitchen. We especially enjoyed the proximity to multiple scenic bike trails including Lake Johnson, Walnut Creek, Cranberry Creek and the Neuse River Trail. We will definitely be returning!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great stay! Felt like a home & not just a rental, the decor was very cozy and had some great amenities. The white noise machine and first aid kit were two amenities I didn‚Äôt know about and came in handy!! Everything we needed and very helpful hosts. Beautiful old house too."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Would stay here again if visiting Raleigh!

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I really enjoyed our stay! Laura and Zach‚Äôs place was spotless and made us feel right at home. It had everything you would need and was in an incredible location! Totally recommend to anyone visiting Raleigh and needs a cute place to stay :)
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I had a wonderful time at Laura‚Äôs beautiful home. It was super close to downtown and we felt right at home!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our place. It was close to places and my daughter. It was quaint and had a lot of character!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We highly recommend this place! It‚Äôs right at the middle of downtown. It was so easy to find, close to everywhere in downtown. The place is cozy! I love everything in the house. The host is very responsive and friendly! It‚Äôs easy to get in and out. We felt safe in the area."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second time staying at this location, I felt right at home. Laura is extremely responsive, the location is walkable distance to all restaurants and activities in safe neighborhood. This is definitely a place that I plan to utilize every time I come to the area."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"LOVED the location--in a quiet neighborhood but easily walkable to downtown with its restaurants, cafes, and shops. Boylan Heights is leafy and gorgeous. The space was clean and had everything we needed. Great value."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at Laura‚Äôs property. The home was cozy and meticulously clean, very comfortable bed and easy to control the temperature of the space. Decorated beautifully and you definitely felt the charm of the old home in the historic neighborhood. It was perfect for our trip and we‚Äôd definitely recommend to friends! Thanks again"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a a great place in a beautiful neighborhood! Laura went the extra mile and checked in a few times to make sure we had everything we needed!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved Laura's decorating style-fun and welcoming. We would have liked to stay longer if travel plans allowed.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place was well located, even though the home is old but the decoration, the comfort was very good it made it seem really homely.
For the price and ease of accessibility that is walkable to any downtown‚Äôs establishments this place is extremely good.
Laura made everything easy for me that I felt right at home."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy apartment close to downtown Raleigh. We loved Laura's apartment inside of a 100 year old historic house near downtown Raleigh. All of the basic amenities were met. Shower supplies, cookware, etc. The cooling is window units, and the heating is old style baseboard heaters, but we appreciated the old charm and found they both worked very well. The apartment is close enough to downtown. You can walk to pretty much anything you can think of within 15-20 mins. But also private enough to where you weren't directly in the hustle and bustle. Would definitely recommend to a friend!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The days at oasis were amazing pretty cute and peaceful we love it.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Central to where we needed to be for a concert, was beautiful surroundings, super cute too"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Always love staying at Michael's place.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfectly modern simplicity and peace. Exactly what I was looking for.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! Blown away. This place truly felt like an oasis. It looks exactly how it‚Äôs shown in pictures. The neighborhood is a quiet, beautiful community. We had easy access to whatever we needed, ranging from grocery stores to our event. Everything was about 10-15 minutes away (max). We definitely could tell that they take care of their home and it showed. Such a beautiful place. Felt like an apartment. Great space to just getaway. I would recommend 1000x more. Definitely would stay again if I were in the Raleigh area."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,I stayed for two nights while visiting my son at NC State and would be happy to return for our next visit. It was very convenient to the college and things to do in the area. The house was very clean and had all that we needed for our short stay. The hosts were very responsive and even mailed my son‚Äôs glasses that we left behind. It was a perfect visit to Raleigh for us!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Michael and Aura were fantastic hosts. I needed a stay last minute and luckily they had availability for the very next day for 2 days. Their place was in a perfect location and close to shopping and restaurants. It was a hidden gym tucked away in the woods. They have a pool you can rent privately but it is winter so didn't use. üôÇ I would certainly stay again when in the Raleigh area.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Michaels place was exactly as pictured. Very clean and we felt at home. There is construction behind the house but you cannot hear it at all. Michael was very friendly and responsive. We would stay here again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a wonderful stay. Host was responsive and accommodating, it was a very pleasant stay."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay! Michael greeted us upon our arrival and was responsive to all my messages and questions beforehand.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything perfect
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Everything as described - friendly and responsive host. Construction was not an issue for us. We stayed Saturday afternoon through Monday at noon and had zero noise. Not sure if that‚Äôll be the case for every day but the construction discount was much appreciated. Great location set back off the road in a quiet neighborhood bit quick easy access to all the museums/shops/restaurants.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Oasis was a great stay. Great location in a very wonderful neighborhood. Amenities were great and instructions were very clear and easy. We enjoyed our stay very much! Definitely recommend!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michaels place was perfect for our weekend in Raleigh. Very clean, private, and had everything that we needed. Highly recommend for anyone visiting the area!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,The Oasis was the perfect place to stay while attending a concert at PNC arena just 3 miles away. Everything was perfect!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a good place with superb location. You are near everything you could need (literally within a mile) and the house was clean and comfortable. Full kitchen if you wanted to cook and enough space to feel you had separate areas. It wasn't warm enough to swim, but you have access to a huge pool. There is construction going on but it didn't impact my stay as I was gone for the day and they were done by the time I got back. Overall, you can't beat the location and size for what you are renting! Check out Groovy Duck Bakery and Bronco Tacos, within walking distance. They provide superb check in instructions (by far the best I've seen yet) which makes it super easy without any questions and are quick to respond to any questions/concerns. I would book again üëçüèª"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful time. We needed a place to stay while we were in town for a friend‚Äôs wedding. Michael was very attentive and the guest suite was private, clean and in a great location."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Really cute place. Clean and comfortable. Friendly and professional host.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had a great time! The place was clean and tidy, and just as described. Michael and Aura even helpfully gave me some restaurant suggestions when I was looking for a place to meet a cousin for dinner! I will definitely keep this in mind the next time I'm in Raleigh!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great little spot to getaway near restaurants and events. While close to the owners home you would never know it as it is very private and cozy. Great place and experience!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super clean and homey place! Beautiful residential neighborhood with plenty to do close by. Would 100% stay again!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is our second stay at Michael‚Äôs Airbnb and we are very satisfied. It‚Äôs comfortable and clean and assessable. We will try to rent it every time we go to Raleigh to see our daughter.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place that is cozy and private. Well within a short drive to everywhere. Very clean. Michael even met us outside when we got there! Very friendly hosts. The neighborhood and area is very nice and upscale and we were never bothered once. I would def stay here again and will look for it to be available next time!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely beautiful stay!! Immaculate, bright, comfortable, and even had a warm, familiar fragrance. Set back in the woods a bit, and the gorgeous landscaping treats you to the sound of running water whenever you‚Äôre outside. Within 15 minutes of pretty much everything you could need, including the Crabtree Mall and the Gregg Museum of Art and Design, which we thoroughly enjoyed, even with all the rain! Highly recommend this cozy little stay, especially for the price."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"If extreme clean is your hot-button, this is the place! Beautiful safe, neighborhood and so convenient to everything in Raleigh. The Hosts are excellent and responsive we enjoyed our night there."
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Good accommodation perfect for our needs.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Michael and Aura were terrific hosts. Very comfy and clean. Private. Very nice. Hosts were very helpful and considerate.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,very easy check in. super clean
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We were comfortable and warm during a chilly Thanksgiving week. We appreciated the icemaker! Everything was spotless, and the hosts were very responsive. We will definitely stay again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really accurately described as an Oasis. Seeing the broad leaves fall in the extensive forest nearby was truly beautiful, my girlfriend and I both regretted leaving as soon as we did.
The unit was well maintained, and was thoughtfully put together, including little touches like USB chargers of all types at each bedside.
We would absolutely stay again if coming to Raleigh."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a fabulous stay! Would book again.

We were amazed with how clean and spacious the space was and the decor was cozy. Entry was easy and checkin was flexible. The location was perfect for the places we planned to visit. When we return to this area, this AirBnB would be at the top of our list."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location and peaceful area. Wish we could have stayed longer!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I came to Michaels guest suite while I was in town and let it just say it was an absolute joy to be there. I am not from North Carolina and I absolute love coming out here because of the scenery and Michaels place had lots of it. Beautiful trees, long beautiful driveway, small creek to the side with beautiful fish. Definitely a great place!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michael was very easy to work with. Instructions were very plain to understand for both check in and check out. The weather in NC when we visited was warmer than expected and the AC had been shut off due to that timeframe (understandable). However, once we reached out to Michael, he immediately tuned the AC on for us to make sure we were comfortable. This was our first stay at an Air BNB and Michael set the bar pretty high for the rest of the Air BNB‚Äôers out there for us! Well done Michael!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Michael‚Äôs place is nice and quiet. The neighborhood is beautiful. This place has everything you need for a peaceful stay.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"My sister & I stayed here for one night while we were in town for a concert and would definitely come back!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Michael‚Äôs listing was in a great location and was loaded with all essentials! His communication was excellent and I‚Äôd love to come back for a refreshing stay! Ps. Its also close to the NC state fair and airport!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Outstanding place, honestly! My fianc√©e and I needed a last minute place to stay for the night because we were headed to the NC state fair, and this was the perfect spot! It was very close to our destination and overall the stay was great. Very clean and host was very friendly and responsive. If we ever needed to stay in that area again, we would definitely go to Michael‚Äôs! (Also great price)"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Very quiet and convenient area. Loved the place!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, private, roomy; would stay again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Michael went above and beyond to improve my stay
2023-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Cute apartment, doesn‚Äôt feel small for being over a garage. Very clean. Nice neighborhood and close drive to everything. The construction is huge though and right in the back yard. Wasn‚Äôt noisy in the apartment however. Neat property. 15 minutes drive from downtown. Host is very responsive."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place for our quick trip, easy to get into and nicely kept."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean, nicely furnished and the first place I e been to that had a bidet so that's a plus in my book!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and clean place!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Michael's little oasis was just perfect for what we needed for the weekend. The space was cute and clean and cozy. I only wish it hadn't rained most of the weekend so we could have taken advantage of the very enticing pool. Will definitely try to book again next time I'm in Raleigh.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Couldn't ask for an easier check in and knowing we traveled a long way, Michael accommodated our weary selves earlier than the usual check-in. The private unit was so clean, as was the pool for a relaxing dip. You cannot beat the price for what you are getting here. I will definitely be back"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Peaceful, secluded, and beautiful. I was pleasantly surprised by the koi fish pond haha"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was an amazing place to relax and chill at the pool. I didn't think about work once. LOL Thanks Michael!!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was great!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a nice place! Stayed for one night and everything was great. Very responsive host and the garage apartment was clean and cozy. The pool was such a wonderful addition! Would definitely recommend.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you're not going to be spending a lot of time there, it's perfect. The pool was very nice and the rental was very clean. The only downside is that we rented due to the photos showing that the property was surrounded by trees. The view from the pool and balcony no longer have trees, instead there is construction. The construction hours began at 7am, and went to nearly 7pm. Sometimes, while on vacation, it is nice to sleep in. Again, this was obviously, completely outside of the the hosts control, however, if the photos were updated to reflect the construction and removal of the trees, we would not have booked this place. The rental itself was beautiful and Michael was amazing and very accommodating when it came to a last minute change in plans."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay at Michael's place. Even though our stay was short, the location was perfect & the stay was in a quiet woodsy setting with the perfect pool to cool off in the evening! I consider his place a hidden gem & the area was well kept & we loved the Koi fish along the path, we'd gladly stay here again.‚ô°"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed Michael‚Äôs place. Having the option to take a swim was awesome. The place was clean and just as described.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay, pool was very clean and well-maintained, and in a great neighborhood. Our only complaint is that a number of the trees behind the property have been cut down since the pictures were taken so the ‚Äúseclusion‚Äù aspect was missing, and there is noisy construction behind the property."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An amazing place that‚Äôs kept very clean. We loved the pool and that the kitchen had everything we needed.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful ‚ÄòOasis‚Äô to stay at for the duration of our time in Raleigh. We especially enjoyed the pool.
Coffee machine and pool towels were appreciated and a nice touch.
We liked watching the hawks hang out on the wood pile from the balcony view."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Would still here 100 times out of 100 anytime I was in Raleigh. Amazing stay
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a beautiful location and the perfect place for a PNW gal to cool off with the Raleigh summer humidity! Thank you so much for a great stay and opportunity to catch up with family.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,We absolutely loved Michael‚Äôs place. It was close to everything but still very private. The guesthouse and pool was well kept. We stayed for a week and will definitely be back when we come to visit our son again. We had some issues with the TV & WiFi and Michael was very accommodating and worked to get it fixed as quick as possible. He responded quickly to any questions we had. We loved the koi pond too. I would definitely recommend his place to anyone who wants to relax.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was great, there‚Äôs nothing I would change or add to it. We felt right at home and even had koi fish to welcome us there. The bathroom was well stocked in case we had forgotten anything. The bed was so comfortable and perfect for a good nights rest. The pool was great and we had such a fun time swimming in it. Perfect little getaway"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"A brief but delightful stay. Arrived just before midnight after a flight delay. Spent a quiet, comfortable, restful night on a comfortable bed in a tastefully appointed FROG (Finished Room Over Garage).
My only regret was that I didn‚Äôt have time to enjoy all the attractive amenities."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place. Michael is a great host. There‚Äôs nothing bad I can say about my visit except that I only didn‚Äôt get to stay longer.

I would recommended this stay to anyone!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I‚Äôve probably stayed in over 50 airbnbs and this definitely ranks up there in my top 5! Michael‚Äôs place is adorable, clean, and comfy! My only regret is that I wish I could have stayed longer to enjoy the pool! Michael and his family were also kind and responsive. Hopefully I‚Äôll get a chance to stay in their bnb next time I‚Äôm in the Raleigh area!"
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Michael's place was extreamly comfortable and convenient. It was super helpful because it was right in between Chapel Hill and Holly Springs where my kids were located. There were several restaurants close by and the pool was lovely!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"‚ÄòOasis‚Äô is the perfect description for this getaway. Quiet, relaxing environment.
The host is responsive and accommodating.
I highly recommend!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Michael did a great job providing my husband and I with a relaxing and comfortable stay. He was easy to contact and prepared a clean and cozy space for us. We also loved having access to the pool!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We will definitely be returning during our next stay in Raleigh! We immediately felt safe and at home. The oasis apartment is cute, quiet, and clean. We loved the Koi pond and enjoyed swimming one day during our stay. The location is super convenient and close to needed restaurants/grocery stores/walgreens/etc and only a short drive to/from the airport. I particularly enjoyed the wooded property and the quietness of the neighborhood. Thank you Michael!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Michael‚Äôs place is cozy and comfortable in a beautiful area. The amenities and attention to detail were top notch.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"LOVED THIS PLACE!!!!! We have stayed in A LOT of Airbnbs and this one really stood out for both me and my husband. Most importantly, the bed was comfortable.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,very nice stay! clean snd quiet.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved it here! A super cute and quaint little place. Even when the owners were home we never felt like they were and we felt like we had plenty of privacy! I could tell the pool was kept up super well. There was a storm the first night and the next morning the pool was perfectly cleaned. It‚Äôs a super beautiful area very private but we also as two younger women felt very safe. Micheal was very responsive,Kind and answered all of my questions without any problems or hesitation! I also appreciate the amount of detail on how to get to the location, where to park, and how to work everything like the TV, the Bluetooth speakers by the pool, ect. I also appreciate the list of restaurants in the binder! All in all we LOVED our stay here and we will definitely be back! üòÅ"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful location, beautiful surroundings, great neighborhood and very friendly host."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michael was super responsive!
The treehouse apartment really did feel like you were in a little treehouse, perfect for 2 people. We saw chipmunks and squirrels. The birds sung in the morning, it was so beautiful and serene, peaceful and super quiet. We even said hi to the koi fish in the koi pond on your way down to your car.

When I heard woods in the description, I thought it would be remote, but it's actually in a really convenient location with plenty of restaurants nearby so it's the best of both worlds. The house is surrounded by forest and feels remote and is rather quiet, but is in a really convenient location."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is truly an oasis. It was super easy to access great restaurants and the PNC arena for an event we were attending. We plan on coming back to stay here for future concerts and events due to the great location and comfortable, lovely environment!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for our first vacation together. The apartment is a perfect size for a couple and so cute with it's own intimate vibe. Upon arrival, it was spotless with great ammenities and a beautiful woodlands view. We loved it from the get-go. Some highlights included: The location was 10 minutes from everything we did! You can leave the majority of the windows uncovered and still have complete privacy from the main house. The L-shaped couch allows for ample cuddles---plus, there are cozy blankets! The queen bed provided good back support and was very comfortable. Also, we particurally appreciated the k-cups provided with the Keurig; suitcase holder; and kitchen appliances. PLUS you can take a unique rubber ducky home as a souvenir from your stay üê• What a great experience! Thank you so much to Michael for an amazing stay!"

Thank you Michael, I recommend this place 10x and beyond!"

Waking up in the morning, having my coffee on the balcony with a great view, was a wonderful experience. The house has all the things you will need when you travel. Of course, everyone is different, and I suggest checking the amenities and house rules before your trip to make sure your needs are met. It is close to many restaurants and markets, receiving in less than 30 minutes any delivery of food or groceries. We felt like we were home. Communication with the Hoster was perfect. Congratulations guys!!!! You're doing an excellent job. Thanks to the fact that he allowed us to stay in your house. We are wishing you the best!!! We hope to visit you again......"

Very quiet and peaceful location, in spite of being in the middle of Raleigh. Well maintained and clean. I stayed 4 nights and was even able use the pool on a couple of occasions. Like the apartment, it was very clean and well maintained. Nothing but good things to say about my stay. Michael was an excellent host - courteous, personable and readily available when needed."
2022-08-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Starting with the good, they have a nicely maintained, large pool on the property though the large trees block a fair amount of the sun for a large portion of the day. The property is set back from the street in a nice neighborhood. They have automatic lighting, though it doesn't always seem to work. Now the weird/bad, some people just shouldn't be airbnb hosts - the set of rules, the tone, the amount of cameras around the property was very off putting. I was honestly shocked when I settled in and saw specific notes like no frying food, no body glitter etc. It really created a vibe of ""don't get comfortable here"" which is the last thing you want on vacation."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay at Ryan‚Äôs place. Walkable location to restaurants & coffee shops (highly recommend Transfer Co Food Hall and Little Native for coffee). Some of the best beds we‚Äôve had in an AirBnB. House is well stocked with everything you need in kitchen and bathrooms. Ryan is so friendly, quick communicator, and very accommodating. Very safe neighborhood with a great walk path nearby. Easy to get Uber/Lyft from place. We will definitely stay here next time we come back to Raleigh."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing host and place. Situated close to everything, especially great restaurants. Ryan was extremely communicative, accommodating, responsive and flexible. The home has everything you need and more! My husband‚Äôs toothbrush broke, but no worries, there was a new one available in the bathroom drawer. This will definitely be our place to stay when we next visit Raleigh!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ryan‚Äôs place is fantastic. So many wonderful little extra touches. Very comfortable and homey. Easy walk to many great places. Will definitely be staying here again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A great find in downtown Raleigh for accommodations! This place had everything we needed to feel right at home. Our host was very attentive! Highly recommend this home and hope to stay here again on our next visit to Raleigh! Thanks again, Ryan!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved Ryan's house. We were 2 UK couples doing a mini USA roadtrip and had an overnight stay in Raleigh. We didn't really have much preconception of the city, but loved it and a good part of this was Ryan's great (and long!) list of suggestions. It was a flying visit, but we were able to quickly walk into the centre of town and hit some great bars, followed by a great breakfast in the morning.
Coming back to the actual Airbnb, it was fantastic. Super spacious, everything you'd need for a short stay, very clean. A great spot for 2 couples. We didn't need to cook, but the kitchen felt spacious and had a lot of equipment.
Ryan's instructions prior and on the day of check-in were super clear and, as mentioned above, contained loads of great advice for places to go and good eating and drinking choices.
Really highly recommend this place!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place, all guests were pleased with the stay and raved about how intuitive the experience was. Definitely recommend. Comfortable beds, had everything we could think of when we needed it and the park next door was a great place to walk and relax. Great communication and clear instructions made the process of checking in and checking out a true breeze. Thanks Ryan!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved this modern town home so much, and we will definitely stay there again the next time we come to town!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay! The location is fantastic and walkable to most of downtown. The house had everything we needed and we were very comfortable during our stay. Ryan was an excellent host, easy to contact and very helpful! I highly recommend!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here! Easy to get in (love that it's keyless), house was as described - simple and clean, making the most of the smaller living space. Walkable to downtown, we were able to get coffee, meals, drinks without hassle, both near our place or even on the 'other side of town'. Beds were comfortable with lots of good pillows! Ryan was responsive and we appreciate the local suggestions.
The living room size does not make it conducive to comfortably hanging for a long time if you have more than 2 people, but the couch for 2 is really comfy for catching up!
Saturday morning the construction noise from a building right outside the far window did start at 7a which was unfortunate, but there was warning in the listing so it wasn't a surprise. Also, there's a provided white noise machine which helped.
Overall a cute and comfortable space to land between exploring Raleigh."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place is amazing. Comfortable, clean, well furnished and location couldn‚Äôt be better.
I would definitely recommend to anyone going to Raleigh."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Ryan‚Äôs place was perfect. We were visiting my Dad who lived about 15 minutes from where we stayed. Even with the construction next door the noise didn‚Äôt wake us in the morning which we were happy about. We would definitely stay there again whenever we come back to Raleigh.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ryan is an outstanding host! He responded quickly, gave great recommendations, and even left us a gift as it was our wedding weekend! It is a great property in a great location. I highly recommend!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Ryan‚Äôs place was clean and welcoming. It was a short walk from a lot of great restaurants and things to do in raleigh

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic stay! Wonderful property! Walkable to great restaurants and bars! Would definitely stay again!

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed a long weekend in this cute home. Ryan provided great recommendations for restaurants and bars. He was very friendly and responsive. The home had everything we needed and was very clean. We would stay again.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Second time staying at Ryan's place and it was just as great and welcoming as the first. The location is great for walking and exploring all that downtown Raleigh has to offer and then coming back to relax. Everything is exactly as described and Ryan is a wonderful host, very responsive and accommodating."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect stay. Will definitely rent here again when I come back for future trips!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"the speaker in the bathroom and mirror are a game changer! beautiful and cozy, comfortable beds, felt like home! highly recommend"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay if you are visiting downtown Raleigh as it is very walkable to most spots. Clean space and comfortable beds.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful townhome!! Super clean and cozy. Comfortable beds and quality sheets. Ryan responded quickly and gave lots of great recommendations for what I asked for! You can feel his hospitality through his email!! I would stay again for sure!!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful host that went above and beyond.
The home was immaculately clean with lots of extras.
It is located in a quite, safe neighborhood that is walking distance to great restaurants, breweries, museums, etc..
We had an amazing time and would highly recommend this home to friends and family.
Cannot say enough
Thank you!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Ryan‚Äôs place did the trick for us. Quick two-night trip from Wilmington with our 2 year old and 5 year old to check out Marbles and the dinos at the Science Museum. Location was close enough to walk to both places (although we actually didn‚Äôt because of rain). The house had everything we needed and would definitely consider staying there again next time we make a trek to Raleigh. Ryan was responsive when we showed up and someone was in the designated parking space saying he would text the neighbors to get it sorted out (luckily we only had to wait like 2 minutes and the people came out of neighbors place and left). Note - only issue we had with construction was due to the rain with some standing mud/water in the parking spot since it‚Äôs a corner spot. Really only an issue with having the little ones but also nothing anyone can do about the weather.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ryan exceeded expectations for a host with a welcoming holiday gift and a library list of places to go and things to do. He was transparent about the construction in the complex, however, that was not an issue.
The interior and home amenities were perfectly accommodating! We had to unfortunately shorten our stay and certainly look forward to a redo in the near future!!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great host and great place to stay. Definitely recommend if you‚Äôre planning a stay in Raleigh.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ryan was the very best!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was staying in Raleigh for a conference and was a little worried about staying downtown and it being noisy. Even with construction projects nearby, the townhouse was very peaceful. I hardly ever heard anyone else. It was the perfect place to come back to after a long day. The bed was super comfortable! I would definitely come back."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place as described! Ryan was great and communicative!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Ryan was a very gracious host! We were traveling here on business and enjoyed our short stay in this beautiful home. Highly recommend! Thank you so much for having us!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our one night stay at Ryan‚Äôs place was great! The home was clean and the check-in/out process was quick and easy! The beds were very comfy and we really enjoyed being able to walk to Burial Beer Co for drinks and dinner/breakfast at Transfer Co. Food Hall.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It takes a lot for me to feel comfortable in an AirBnb or hotel, and I felt comfortable right away here. We had an apprehensive toddler with us who also acclimated quite quickly in the space. Ryan has an obvious attention to detail, and provided clear and simple instructions. We drove in and out of the city a lot visiting family and it was never more than a 20 minute drive for anywhere we needed to go. Ryan provides great recommends for meals close by if you do want to walk! Ps. For those with a little one, there is a pack and play in the closet and the desk chair works well for night time book reading before laying them down : )"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great townhouse with walking distance to a lot of places. Construction in the parking lot was happening, but the workmen were polite and more than happy to move trucks the one time we needed them to."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely loved staying at this place during my Raleigh visit! The neighborhood is not only gorgeous but also feels very safe. Its proximity to uptown Raleigh is a huge plus, and we had no trouble at all finding the place or getting Ubers.
The townhouse itself is fantastic ‚Äì from the high-quality towels to the comfy beds and pillows, and the stylish furniture. It's clear that a lot of thought has gone into making it comfortable and welcoming. I'll definitely stay here again on my next trip and will be recommending it to my friends."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Gorgeous home! Ryan was a great host. Ryan was extremely responsive and helpful.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful space! It was cozy, clean, and chic, perfect for coming into town to visit family. The speedy WiFi and small office area were so helpful as well. The owner was very communicative. Thank you for a great stay!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot for a weekend stay! Clean house. Comfortable beds. Thanks Ryan
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was great! Worked out perfectly for us and definitely recommend. Stayed here 3 nights with my husband and 4 year old son for a wedding in the area. House had everything we needed and was comfortable, spacious, and clean. It was walking distance to downtown and most things we were doing. There is construction the host is clear about, but it did not hinder our experience."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved this spot! Would definitely stay again, it was very homey and clean. Ryan was very friendly and helpful as well."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ryan was so helpful with local recommendations and ideas for anything we could have wanted to do. The house was cozy and clean and had everything we needed
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Don't sleep on this! This Airbnb was the best one we have stayed at! I say that due to the fact that the owner really made sure you felt right at home and had everything we needed. I have never stayed at a place that had everything I have at my own home until this one. We joked and said, ""This place has everything but chip clips!""...and then we found the chip clips lol. I was highly impressed and would say here again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We felt at ease and comfortable as soon as we walked in. Everything looked and smelled clean. The eat in kitchen is decent sized and you can cook a full meal if you want more than just microwaved leftovers.
The 2 bedrooms are spacious and the closets have more than enough area to unpack with lots of clothes hangers. The beds are comfortable (one was hard, one was soft) the sheets clean and soft. Upstairs bath is small but adequate, the towels (and there were plenty) are thick. The downstairs bath is also small but has what you need in a half bath.
There were 2 of us (single women) staying here and it was comfortable in the LR, but I think it would be cramped for 2 couples. There is a couch and one chair for seating.
There are a lot of new, nice apartment buildings in this neighborhood just outside of downtown and you are close to bars, restaurants and the City Market but we didn't walk to any of these at night, however we did see couples out walking in the evening."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ryan was an excellent host! This was a perfect weekend. We let Ryan know about wanting to move to the area and he went out of his way to give personalized suggestions which made our stay so productive. Thank you Ryan!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ryan was such a great host. He was very responsive and helped answer a few questions I had leading up to my stay. I could not have asked for a better place, in a better location for the needs I had. I will definitely be staying there again for future Raleigh visits."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and great host!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ryan was an amazing host! The place was great and this Airbnb went above and beyond. Not only was everything clean, tidy and cute; they also had everything well organized and labelled. The amenities were well thought out - from having well stocked coffee pods, travel toothbrushes and great recommendations of activities in the area.
Location great with a good hall and breweries within a 5 min walking radius.
10/10"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and great space. Ryan provided a ton of great recommendations too!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Ryan's place. There was construction going on across the street which made getting to our parking spot a little difficult to get in one day. However, Ryan was upfront about the construction. I had to reach out to him a couple times, his response time was so quick and he was extremely helpful. The location is great! We were able to walk downtown very easily. The condo was wonderful. Super clean and had everything we needed. We would definitely stay at Ryan's place in the future."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic place in excellent location relative to downtown Raleigh.

The place is right by a beautiful park and scenic neighborhood. Would highly recommend!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Ryan was very responsive and accommodating. His home was well appointed, very clean, roomy and quiet. The beds were super comfy and the shower had a luxurious rain-like shower head.
Ryan obviously put a lot of effort into making this home as comfortable as it is beautifully decorated.
We easily walked to downtown and enjoyed Ryan‚Äôs many suggestions. Thanks Ryan!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From the start, Ryan was easy to communicate with and more than happy to accommodate me in my request for early check-in. The townhouse was clean and comfortable, and in the perfect location for the convention we visited he gave us many recommendations for food, and while we did not get to try all of them, the ones we did try were delicious, all in all when we return next year for the convention, I hope to stay in Ryan‚Äôs place again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here with a friend on a trip to Raleigh and couldn‚Äôt be happier! It‚Äôs modern, clean, and comfortable. Ryan‚Äôs instructions were easy to follow and check out obligations were simple."

2023-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Ryan's Airbnb was clean and the beds were comfortable. It's convenient to downtown and check in was seamless. On the June weekend we stayed, there was a lot of construction directly across from the townhome. It's not the host's fault, but it makes the location less welcoming."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ryan‚Äôs place is like brand new in every respect. Completely and thoroughly made over, beautifully decorated, it felt brand new. And they thought of everything we would need. Kitchen well equipped with really nice dishes and cookware. Both bathrooms (1.5) were really nice. Even though there was some construction nearby, we were not disturbed at all. We loved that it was adjacent to a small park. We enjoyed sitting on the little decks in the morning and evening. If we ever need a place in downtown Raleigh again, this will be it!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was one of the best Airbnbs I‚Äôve been too. The space was so cute. It was very clean, comfortable beds, and had everything you could need.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is as cute as the photos. It's also very cozy and the beds comfortable. It is walking distance to just about everything. It's so quiet here you can hear a pin drop and a bird that loves to sing in the park next door from 3am - 5am. If you don't want to hear it, just close the window. This is a chill, relaxing place sharing a wall with a nice neighbor. As for the mentioned construction, they are mostly done and we really didn't notice anything. Stay here!"

Scrambling to find a new place, we stumbled upon Ryan‚Äôs and requested to book immediately. Ryan answered back within minutes and provided us with instructions on how to get in the house, where it was located and a list of local food spots for each meal(all within walking distance).

2022-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Super cute place, exactly as listed! Very convenient to downtown, and amazing amenities. The only little things were that the ceiling fan in the bedroom was noisy to the point that we didn't like using it, and since there was construction right across the street the street lights weren't totally lit yet, so it was a little sketchy at night. Also very near the fire station, but we only heard sirens a few times. Overall a great stay!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great proximity to downtown! We walked everywhere, and even though we had a car with us we did not need it. The bedding is very plush and feels like a real treat. I enjoyed the little extras, like having bathrobes and cozy throws, it made the place feel comfortable! There was construction across the street, which wasn‚Äôt beautiful to look at but it definitely was not a noise issue so it didn‚Äôt both us a great deal. I would stay again."

We were able to walk to a bunch of restaurants and coffee shops which was ideal.

2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Awesome stay

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely would recommend this home for anyone traveling to Raleigh who wants to be close to downtown. The location was perfect for us. A short walk to downtown and tons of restaurants, but also far enough away that it wasn‚Äôt super busy or loud. It‚Äôs right next to a little park too with a walking trail!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb is amazing and the pictures don't do it justice! The apartment has a cozy decor and fabulous layout. The proximity to downtown is mystifying as it is unbelievably close yet feels distant. Ryan's place sits at the end of a building overlooking a small park, which gives space and stillness, with the sky line in the backdrop. I wouldn't stay anywhere else downtown.
Yes there was construction nearby. It did not hinder our parking/driveway nor did the noise intrude the inside of the apartment. My family and I did sit outside for an afternoon during the construction and were able to enjoy our conversation. The worker's played classical Spanish music (which was oddly lovely). If you are worried about noise volume for your stay, don't be."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at this townhouse in downtown Raleigh. The instructions and recommendations provided by the host made for a smooth check in and cool places to check out around the city. Accommodations were clean, comfy, and an all around good vibe.

2022-05-01,4,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay at Ryan's downtown condo. It is within easy waking distance to many activities, bars and restaurants. Ryan was very responsive to any questions we had. The unit was very clean and we felt very welcomed with some nice gifts upon arrival. There is construction going on in close proximity (which we were notified of prior to arrival) but the noise wasn't bad just a lot of supplies and construction vehicles to get in the way, none to the fault of Ryan. We would definitely stay again."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first stay in Raleigh and this property was perfect. Location was fantastic for visiting the city, fun places to visit and great food within walking distance. Nice not to have to worry about parking.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and the decor is very on-trend! It definitely speaks to the young traveler, who likes to spend time downtown.

If you like being close to it all, this is the place."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Alexis and Tim were helpful and friendly and the unit was very comfortable. An extra touch was a friendly welcome note. Alexis provided detailed and clear directions on how to find the unit and how to get in. It was the best lock system I've experienced at an airbnb. Super easy. The ramp into the unit made it so easy to wheel in my suitcases. I would definitely stay at this site if I'm again in Raleigh.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful hosts! Tranquil neighborhood and a very nice home. Communication was spectacular and when we arrived we were greeted with a nice little note and a bottle of wine which was very sweet of them. If I'm ever coming back to the same area of North Carolina I would not hesitate to book a stay with them again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great stay! We visited for 3 weeks and this was the perfect spot. Beautiful neighborhood with friendly neighbors and lots of trees - great for walks!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This get away is a tiny lake paradise nestled in the heart of the city. It acted as a little piece of home in the midst of the hustle and bustle of inner Raleigh. The hosts are quickly responsive, welcoming and thorough. I never once had to ask a question because it was already well documented for me. The space is clean and warm. I couldn‚Äôt have asked for better accommodations. Thank you guys!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The nicest AirBNB I've stayed in. Well equipped, had everything down to scissors when I randomly needed some!

Alexis and Tim are great hosts and were very clear on check-in, directions to the place and check-out. The place was very clean and welcoming and we felt right at home! My favorite spot was the screened-in porch- we very much enjoyed sitting out there together with our coffee in the mornings! Downtown Raleigh was also only about a 15-20 minute drive. 10/10 recommend this lovely, little guest suite and would stay here again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for allowing our stay and the wonderful bottle of wine. It was great stay, very peaceful and the hosts were very pleasant."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was just as described! Beautiful and peaceful. All linens smelled fresh and clean. Everything was spotless!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"*Perfection*
Everything about the space was absolutely perfect. The bathroom was enormous and spa-like. The closet was massive and the host provided many hangers. The bedroom had everything we could possibly need, including many different types of pillows in case you prefer a specific feel. The living/dining area is larger than it looks in the photos and included stylish decor as well as books & puzzles. The kitchen had everything we needed and more.
But the show stopper for us: the yard and neighborhood. The private screened in porch was lovely. The back yard chickens stole our hearts and if you message the hosts they can provide you with instructions on how to safely interact with them. The yard had huge trees with 2 swings for little kids, the hosts generously share this space with you if you choose to use it. It‚Äôs so dreamy we were looking for homes for sale nearby. We had no problem getting downtown and to all of the areas we visited- very convenient location. 6/5 stars."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a wonderful, quiet spot, close to a lot but hidden away in a peaceful neighborhood! The suite was very comfortable, stylish and had what we needed for our stay. Great communication from our hosts! We would stay there again!"

The kitchen was fully equipped, there was coffee and tea readily available, a TV, games, and books for guests to utilize. The room was stocked with plenty of extra pillows, blankets, and towels for guests to use as needed. The neighborhood was very quiet and allowed for some much needed relaxation, yet it was easy to navigate to/from while we were touring the area. Alexis and Tim even provided a guestbook filled with suggestions for things to do and places to eat. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would absolutely come back! We‚Äôd highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone!!"

Alexis and Tim are great host and have a great place and I'll certainly be checking availability when I'm heading back to Raleigh!"

Felt very welcomed with a hand written note/wine.... the host were very very very helpful- originally the app would not let me book the same day as check in but I reached out to the host, they were able to accommodate me last minute and I am very appreciative! I‚Äôm obsessed with the size of the closet and set up with the bathroom lol. But anywho, it was a pleasant stay. Thank you again!"

2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a gem! The location is quiet and beautiful. The unit is sparkling and spacious. I enjoyed the sanctuary feeling after long days at a conference. Convenient too!
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alexis‚Äô place was wonderful. It was quiet and relaxing while still being very close to downtown. Could not have found a better place, especially for the money. The little screened in porch was lovely, there was a kitchen stocked with essentials, a roomy bedroom with a walk-in closet, and a master bathroom with a walk-in shower. I would definitely recommend staying here. It‚Äôs probably the best Airbnb experience that I‚Äôve had so far."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay and would choose to stay here again for future trips!
2019-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A beautiful getaway located close to the downtown area. We had a short two day stay with our two year old son and thought the place was wonderful. Quiet, cozy, and clean. Our son loved playing in their huge outdoor space that includes a chicken coop and a swing. While we visited with our young child and had more than enough room, the space is perfect for a single person or couple visiting the Raleigh area. Would absolutely stay there again!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Came here with my husband and 6 month old. This place far exceeded my expectations. Alexis is an outstanding host and so kind with attention to detail. The place is spotless, cozy, and private. The neighborhood is a short drive from downtown, but so peaceful and quiet. Highly recommend!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I recommend this suite to a group of 2 especially a couple. The suite is really cozy and has that home feel. Soon as we Arrived they left us a bottle of pinot and welcoming note. Their Customer service is superb. The place is sparkling clean and Tim & Alexis werr very accommodating. I forgot some pasta at the store so they gave me a box. The detail information they provide in the booklet and throughout the suite is more informative than a hotel clerk. We really enjoyed the cozy suite and the backyard is spacious and serene. The enclosed porch is excellent for late night relaxing. I recommend this suite
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place for beauty, peace and quiet just minutes from downtown Raleigh. We will want to return!"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful home in a neighborhood full of unique architecture. Alex's home is beautiful, spacious, immaculately clean and offers wonderful amenities.

2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The best customer service experience I have received from anywhere I have ever visited. Alex and Tim will do everything they can to ensure you have a great stay. There is clear cut instructions on how to check out properly in their guest manual. Additionally, there is a plethora of suggestions for dining, and take out menus.
The place itself is beautiful. I would live in their Airbnb if I could. The neighborhood is such a quiet place but actually 5 minutes from downtown Raleigh. A great location. The space is perfect and ready for any and everyone to visit.
I lack the vocabulary necessary to properly recommend this place or Alex and Tim. If you get the chance to stay here, take it!"

A lovely spot has been made with a closed in porch to enjoy, loved watching the chickens run around the yard. Thank you for a great stay!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"When living in Alexis‚Äô guest house you can expect a clean and well designed house, cute little welcoming notes and a friendly atmosphere.

2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"At Alexis‚Äôs beautiful suite in Raleigh you will undoubtedly have a wonderful experience. I stayed here a few nights with my sister and could not believe just how well-thought out Alexis‚Äôs place was. There were cute little notes throughout the place welcoming us and pampering us. We did not use the refrigerator and stove too much during our stay, but Alexis made sure we were fully stocked with dishes, plates, silverware, and the cutest cups/mugs/glasses that I have ever seen. Every aspect of Alexis‚Äôs place was inviting and enjoyable. This is will definitely be a stay you want to never leave. Thanks Alexis!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a terrific place to stay--very close to everything but secluded. The apartment is spacious and very comfortable. The decor is terrific. There's a zen feel to the space, and the oversized walk-in closet makes a lovely place for yoga and meditation. The shower provides a spa-like experience. I highly recommend this Airbnb!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a WONDERFUL, secluded, accessible to interstate, location. Very clean, modern and perfect for a small group. Owners are very helpful. All amenities available. Definitely planning on next visit since it was so convenient."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The space was even better than we expected. Everything we needed and close to downtown, however still in a quiet and lovely neighborhood. If we are ever in Raleigh again, we will defiantly be looking at Alexis's place again."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alexis and Tim have done a fantastic job creating a welcoming guest house with personal touches. The details such as a welcoming bottle of wine, clear instructions and coffee added helped make ya feel at home. The proximity, about a 15min drive to downtown, was perfect for what we were looking for while visiting Raleigh. The enclosed porch was a nice addition as was the large and luxurious shower! It was 95 degrees during most of our stay, but our guests house was always cool when we arrived at the end of the day. If you are visiting Raleigh/Durham we highly recommend!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alexis and Tim‚Äôs place is a perfect paradise. It is conveniently located and in a very nice neighborhood. The guest suite is so clean, well-designed and beautifully furnished. Beautiful flooring. It has ample space, especially the bathroom and walk-in closet. The screened porch with a view of a chicken coop is a lovely addition.
This AirBnB is a new favorite of ours!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alexis and Tim are wonderful hosts!
We really enjoyed our stay in their adorable guest house. We were greeted by the most thoughtful note and a bottle of wine upon arrival! Alexis and Tim were very communicative and helpful anytime we needed anything.The bed was extremely comfy and we slept like babies. The shower is also really lovely, with dual shower heads in a large walk in tiled area. Our favorite way to relax and restore at their place was to brew a cup of coffee in the morning and enjoy the screened in porch that looks over the backyard. We enjoyed hearing the chickens roaming around in Alexis and Tim's backyard. The house is stocked so well with all you'd need to cook meals, brew coffee, make tea and so on. It's also only about a 12 minute drive to downtown Raleigh. It was perfect! Can't recommend this spot enough!
Thanks Alexis and Tim!
Caroline"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely LOVED this place. The screened in porch with rocking chair made a great place for morning coffee with the view of chickens & tree swing in the spacious backyard. Entry was a breeze & felt very private while still having the luxury of the owners near by. We came to Raleigh for a concert & left our lawn chairs at home & they offered to let us borrow some of theirs. Great hospitality. The space is pristine & all new. Everything was labeled so we were never left guessing. They even had a bottle of wine waiting on us. We would absolutely love to stay here again.
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend booking this suite! My family stayed here during a visit to Raleigh ‚Äì the location was close to everything and the space was beautiful! It was very clean and comfortable, with everything you might need. Alexis and Tim were great hosts and responsive to all of our needs. We would highly recommend staying here!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A clean, comfortable, and quiet spot minutes from downtown (by car) yet nestled in nature: a nearby lake, some rustic forest, a dirt road or two. Much recommended. ;)"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great experience. Wonderful suite and fantastic neighborhood! Very kind and friendly hosts. Zero complaints.
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The description of this peaceful retreat is so spot on, but I have to add my own two cents. I felt like moving right in and making it my own little home.
Everything one might need is there: a private screened-in porch with a view to a hen house filled with fat, happy, clucking fowl, a tree swing, and inside, shiny bamboo floors, a comfy bed, fast Internet, a space to work if you must, spa-style shower, sedate, calming colors and a nicely outfitted kitchen.
Our hosts were a text away, responsive, and once we met them, all smiles and kindness.
If I find myself in Raleigh again, I‚Äôll most definitely be returning to my little home away from home."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great place to stay with private entry. Location was perfect, close to downtown, malls, & great restaurants in a quiet neighborhood. It was very comfortable, clean, I felt safe and Alexis was most gracious and accommodating. Help or instructions were just a call or text away. Towels and sheets were provided. Kitchen was well stocked and included stove, refrigerator and microwave. Beautiful fireplace in den area. The bedroom, closet and bathroom were very spacious with excellent water pressure and a rainhead shower in addition to a hand held. I am very appreciative of the responsiveness and eagerness from Alexis to make my stay enjoyable. Would definitely recommend staying here. Handicapped accessible."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is the first and coolest ""tiny home"" that I've ever stayed at and ANY DESIGNER or any body with an interest in design would 100% nerd out about this place. All black everything, clean lines, and vaulted ceilings encased in floor to ceiling walls made for such a unique look. (You can hit the automatic blinds to go into blackout mode for privacy.) I nearly made us late for dinner reservations due to the amount of time I spent soaking in the waterfall shower.
Zack was very responsive and helpful during the stay as well as leading up to it.
You may hear a little bit of traffic in the wee hours of the morning but it also affords you a short 10/15 minute drive to the city for restaurants.
I would totally invest one of these deep in the mountains!"

Because the windows were so big and clear, it felt like I was living the coolest treehouse surrounded by all the trees! Especially when the GIGANTIC back doors were open and the space seemed to double because of the access I had to the huge deck. I loved that I thoroughly got to enjoy the beautiful weather during my stay.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures don't do this place justice! The room is enormous and so peaceful and airy, and the balcony is just gorgeous. We loved sipping our morning coffee and relaxing in the rocking chairs. The neighborhood is beautiful and we loved strolling around and looking at all the homes. There are so many cool restaurants, a coffee shop, and a dispensary only a short 15 minute walk from the house! Lillian had coffee, creamer, and a gallon of water for us in the mini fridge, which was such a nice perk. We didn't use the microwave, but it was there if we needed it. My only recommendation to other guests would be to bring an eye mask because the room does get very bright in the mornings. We are early birds, but it might be difficult for people who like to sleep-in."

The selling feature for me was the balcony where I spent evenings & mornings, relaxing & enjoying local birdsong.
Lillian was so kind, she happened to be outside when I pulled up & helped me into the house. Also enjoyed her artwork & suggestions. Not to mention the cat, who I met outside.
Grateful to her for sharing her home."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lillian's suite is quite spacious. It has both a large sitting room and bedroom, connected to one another via the vanity area of the bathroom. The bathroom has a wonderful walk-in shower! The best part of the suite, is the large veranda, accessed via a door from the bedroom. If I stay again, I'll make sure to set aside time to enjoy it more. It was lovely to get to chat with Lillian before I checked out!
While check-in instructions are clear, I arrived in the dark, and could not clearly identify the house number from the street. I drove by the house twice before I saw the lit star on the front porch--Lillian mentioned this in her directions, but it was somewhat obscured by her beautiful landscaping. Other than that, my stay was perfect. Loved the neighborhood!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Awesome place. Will definitely book again if we are in the area. It's a safe neighborhood. I booked Lillian's place for my husband and son who were the guests from New York, they forgot an expensive item behind at check out....Lillian contacted us immediately to make arrangements to return it. She even offer to send it by mail. Thank you Lillian for your kindness and hospitality."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a wonderful experience staying at Lillian's place during a conference. I hope to stay there again next year!
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I loved my stay here, and my only 2 mentions which isn't a complaint because the host was very transparent was once you pass the steps to get inside door there is additional steps. Can be more cumbersome for a single traveler if you have heavy luggage. Also the lock took me over 15 minutes. But my host did warn me. Definitely suggest not going on first night stay at night to get that lock open. I'd stay here again. It was peaceful."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,we enjoyed our stay.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"In a word, charming. This was exactly the experience we wanted on our first trip to North Carolina from the Pacific Northwest. The suite and surrounding neighborhood is simply delightful."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,I‚Äôd definitely recommend this to anyone passing through Raleigh. The house is gorgeous and in a very nice location. Lillian was very helpful in answering questions.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We came to Lillian‚Äôs for a break‚Ä¶to recharge our batteries and enjoy a little quiet time. Her beautifully decorated, spotlessly clean home was the perfect respite. We enjoyed the local fare and people. Our favorite part was sitting on the veranda. In the late evening, the breeze was light, sounds of the night were peaceful and the rocking chairs were welcoming. In the morning, the sun shone through leaves, the rustling of the wind was serene and the birds were singing. I cannot love this more. Thank you, Lillian!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The suite was spacious, quiet, and easy to locate in a mature, safe residential neighborhood. It matched the online description well, especially as it related to parking, building access, and 2nd story steps.
Lillian graciously stayed in touch routinely from reservation to check in to on-site questions. She made herself available at all times, and ensured we could check in as early as possible.
Room was a great value for the size and amenities- especially appreciated the local fresh ground coffee for the coffee maker to enjoy on the large front porch every morning. Would definitely stay here at Lillian‚Äôs place again!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lillian's place is spacious, beautifully appointed, and spotlessly clean. It's located on a gorgeous street not far from some restaurants, which was great for us as we got in a little later than we hoped and did not have to go far to find food. It was very comfortable and made me wish we had more than one night to spend there! Don't hesitate to stay in this lovely apartment."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved the space. Very spacious and clean. Bed was great. We loved sitting on the veranda with coffee.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous space--spacious, open, no bad smells or noises, felt comfortable from minute one; loved the verandas especially and the beautiful yet still functional antiques, and there was a dressing room I didn't expect, as well as a small coffee/tea kitchen station with a fridge and microwave, which was so helpful to have. Friendly coffeeshop/cafe that's a 10-minute walk away, through a lovely suburban neighborhood; also saw a couple of restaurants in the same vicinity, including a pizza place with ample outdoor seating. Lillian answered my questions quickly, clearly, and nicely. Highly recommend."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Make this your first choice - a wonderful space in a gorgeous location
2023-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"Very nice place in a quiet neighborhood and a great location. Very peaceful except the birds early morning :). The proach could have used a power washing as there was pollen everywhere, but to be fair it is hard to keep up with in the spring. Easy check in, never did see Lilian or anyone, but the direction where clear and easy. Would definitely stay here again"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful space was clean and comfortable. I'll stay there next time I am in town.

The neighborhood, house, and rooms were all beautiful and exceeded expectations. If we return to Raleigh we will surely return to this location if it's available!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our second stay at Lillian's and it more than fits our needs. Nice sized rooms, bath nice. As mentioned in description, there is no TV, but we brought our 24-inch Roku TV and it worked well with Internet service. Close to the places we needed to go. Lillian's place is definitely on our list to check availability when we are in the Raleigh area."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lillian's place is beautiful, peaceful, and located just minutes away from great restaurants (e.g., Mellow Mushroom). It's also only ~20 mins away from Durham. My wife and I would definitely stay here again. It was nicer, cleaner, and more affordable than any hotel."

Thank you, Lillian!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, quiet neighborhood. Very spacious suite. Amazing porch with rocking chairs!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful stay, with vintage furniture and a lovely porch. I would definitely return. Lillian was helpful and responsive. She even let me stay an hour later to check out. The porch was my favorite part, though there were a lot of bumblebees flying around. I enjoyed watching them fly, but if you have a bee allergy keep it in mind. The walls are also quite thin, so I was able to hear the other occupants and I assume they could hear me. It didn‚Äôt bother me and they weren‚Äôt making noise late at night, but keep that in mind as well. It felt slightly less private just because I was aware of any noises I made. The wifi connection was average, perhaps not ideal if you are planning to work from home and have remote meetings, but workable."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,I‚Äôve stayed here several times and had a great visit every single trip.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved it, a very private comfortable stay."
2023-02-01,3,Stayed one night,"The place was clean, and easy to find.
But I went on Valentine‚Äôs Day with my girlfriend to get away from my roommates and have some private time.
(The host told me the room would be private and they wouldn‚Äôt be there)
When we walked in her husband acted startled, loudly trying to communicate through the bedroom door upstairs, telling me he had an early appointment in the morning.
That‚Äôs the opposite of what I would consider hospitable, or private.
Terrible situation that I‚Äôll never make the mistake of putting myself in again."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lillian‚Äôs place was beautiful, spacious, and quiet. The description matched the experience and I would definitely stay here again."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"The neighbor seems like she has seen happier days‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ very uptight lol.

Fresh linens, towels, toiletries, etc, already set up for us and ready to go.
Nice little booklet with food, beverage, and sightseeing recommendations.
When I did need to contact Lillian for a question, very quick to answer and ask if we needed anything else.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is gorgeous and check-in was super easy and seamless. The space looks even better in-person and everything was spotless.

It truly is a beautiful place.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was in town for a couple of nights for a class and this place was perfect. It is very private - we never even heard or saw the owners, but Lillian is quick to respond if you need anything. It‚Äôs located in a cute, quiet neighborhood. It‚Äôs is clean, affordable, decorated nicely, and within walking distance and short Uber rides from pretty much anything you may need. This place is great I would stay here again, and would 10/10 recommend!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great value, beautiful place and helpful host!"
2022-09-01,3,Stayed one night,"The host was great. Very helpful and available. The amenities were bare minimum. Narrow steep stairwell. House number was difficult to find in the dark. This wouldn‚Äôt be a permanent problem, but I was awakened at 7:00 by construction machinery across the street where they are remodeling a house. Until that remodel is finished that would be an issue. The date of my day was September 28."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful airbnb in historic area of Raleigh. Perfect for solo travelers like me.
2022-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"A beautiful upstairs living space of the house. Comfortable bedroom and shower. Enjoyed the veranda view of the greenery, but watch out for the spiderwebs. There is no kitchen items including glasses, bottle of water, or coffee. You must get all of that when you are in town."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, great location, loved the veranda. Rooms were spacious and clean. Would definitely stay again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful stay with historical decor which I appreciated. The veranda was charming and I enjoyed a morning tea while rocking on the porch. It was easy to find and so close to so many locations. The entry stairs are just a tad steep to lug up suitcases.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lillian's place is gorgeous! The room is so beautiful and easy to access. She provides clear and thorough directions. The area surrounding her home is so beautiful.

2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Over all good value for a traveling couple. Beautiful neighborhood and very close to everything. The host allowed us to park two cars on the street. Thank you so much, would stay again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a beautiful setting. The house was more exquisite than the pictures advertized from the Airbnb site,, both inside and out. It was spacious and at the same time cozy snd comfortable. My only regret was that the reservation was only for one night. I could have stayed indefinitely! The hostess was outside working in the yard when i arrived. She immediately approached and helped me to my suite. I hope I'll be able to come again in the near future. It had all the amenities and much more. The bathroom had two sinks with gracious space between them, a large bedroom, and a smaller room off from the room for your luggage and hanging clothes. A lovely terrace, accessible from the bedroom provided shade and privacy. I look forward to staying there again in the near future.
Thank you so much for a memorable experience.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"What an amazing place! Just a beautiful and perfect location for being able to enjoy our time in Raleigh. It was an easy 10 minutes to the Art Park, and the nearby downtown area had some wonderful dining options as well. Breakfast on the veranda was divine! Thanks to the host for all the lovely details, we‚Äôre so grateful for our time here!"
