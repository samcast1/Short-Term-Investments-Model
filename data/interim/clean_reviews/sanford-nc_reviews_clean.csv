2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, charming old house in a nice, quiet neighborhood."
2023-12-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Initially the first few days were a challenge because of the heating. However, once that issue was addressed, due to the owners response our stay was amazing. My family and I had a wonderful stay at this home. Made our Christmas very memorable and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It was a really cute space. Hosts were friendly and communicated very well.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was clean and very unique. It was a nice stay overall.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We felt right at home here! The house was well kept and had everything we needed to feel right at home during our stay. As the listing described- the house was drafty and cold downstairs, but upstairs was very comfortable even on cold nights. The host was accommodating for our corgi that tagged along for the trip."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,All was good!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great hosts and home. Highly recommend.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very interesting house, English Tudor style. We really enjoyed it, very cozy, everything we needed was at hand. Peaceful, quiet area. Highly recommended -"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Super charming home! All the historic features are super cool, and very well renovated. Very clean and had everything we needed. Loved our stay!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Throughly enjoyed our second stay. Location is convenient to everything we needed. Property is beautiful and house is very comfortable.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"First I would like thank you both.
The house was everything we expected. The property somewhat secluded or feels that way due to the beautiful landscaping. With that said if you arrive at night it feels a little uneasy as it’s dark and not a lot of surrounding light. In the morning you will enjoy the location and the surroundings as birds chirp and you hear the wind in the tall trees. We stayed due to attending DREAMVILLE. It’s 30/40 minutes from event location. My two kids 16&20 and myself had a blast.
Thank you"
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"OK, so I had a special circumstance. First of all, and most importantly, the home is absolutely beautiful. They really went out of their way to make it a gorgeous space!
I went out there on my own to get away and have some rest and relaxation.
Unfortunately, I had to deal with a gas leak three days in a row. I am sure that this will be resolved now that I am gone, BUT I was told that the issue was known prior to my visit, by a maintenance man.
They were kind enough to give me $50 toward a meal one evening, but now our entire vacation budget is gone and there was a little to no relaxation.
It really was the extreme of good and bad. The home is perfect and I loved it. However, it was extremely expensive and I was unable to relax the entire time. If it was my home, I would not have charged the occupant based on the fact that The trip was completely affected by some thing that was my responsibility.
Once that is fixed, the home is perfect"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The home is beautifully appointed in a quiet, private location, and is a classic Tudor style home with many original stones, cast iron windows, and other antique finishes - yet has been completely modernized with new kitchen and bathrooms. There was a problem with the dishwasher, but Kevin & Tina were open and communicated with us to alleviate the issue, and we were satisfied with their response. Otherwise we had a fabulous stay there, and highly recommend this home if you are in the vicinity - Tobacco Road is right down the street! We will be back when we visit again."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Private and peaceful! Perfect for a quick weekend getaway - this home is charming and unique, updated in all the ways that matter without taking away from the historic vibe. A great mix between modern comforts and the coziness of a Tudor home in the woods! Very clean and comfortable."
2023-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful and peaceful location. The entry and house look exactly like the photos. The house is old and charming in all the right ways. It was very cold when we were there and despite the traditional windows we were still comfortable in the home. The location was ideal as it’s very close to the downtown Sanford restaurants. We were there for a memorial service and many of my family members had houses so far away that they chose not to come into town. We were able to get an Uber back to this house even.
There are a few quirks,ie bathroom doors that might not fully lock, tiny powder room downstairs, creaky floors but all of this adds to the charm and the modern amenities in the kitchen, and the spacious main bathroom with an amazing shower where more than adequate for us and our teenage daughters. We would definitely stay here again."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Rustic, charming and beautiful! I will definitely return!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Thank you Kevin and Tina for allowing us to stay in your home. It was amazing, beautiful and had everything we needed during our stay. It was clean, the beds were comfortable, and the location was so peaceful. My family and I really enjoyed our stay and just wished we were able to stay longer if we could. This home was also pet friendly and it just felt like home. Everything was near by as well especially the park where we enjoyed our hike. We will definitely be back again soon."
2022-11-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed here for over two weeks while we were waiting to close on our new home. Although the downstairs was quite chilly on the colder days, the decor and functionality of the home far outweighed the heat issue. We felt very comfortable staying here for an extended period of time. We were traveling with our small dog so the fenced in back yard was a plus!
Overall, great property!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,highly recommend for a quiet weekend amongst some beautiful trees. we really enjoyed our stay and wouldn’t change a thing about it.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place to stay with decor that was thoughtfully designed. Enjoyed the small wildlife and property that is full of trees and flowers. Loved the front 4-season porch. The water pressure was great, making the rainfall shower an experience of awesomeness. Had everything I needed plus more! Thank you! Would stay here again for sure."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great house. Hosts are such nice people and so easy to deal with. Highly recommend this house. Great location and easy to get to downtown and good restaurants.

2022-05-01,5,Group trip,We have stayed at this tutor several times. This is a true gem. We do not build homes like this one anymore. Great house and hosts!

2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place! Comfortable beds.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a classic Tudor that has been fully remodeled in an authentic way. It is a really cool house surrounded by big pines. The kitchen is high end and the bathroom has a great shower.
2021-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay! The house was beautiful and the surrounding area was fun to explore. There is a train nearby so expect to hear some train noises throughout your stay.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time at this beautiful and unique home. Beautiful furnishings and very comfortable beds.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was up to par and I really loved everything but it was only one tv which was in the living room. You also had to pay for the main channels so if you want to watch anything bring a fire stick.
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The house was so adorable with well-appointed design, quiet and peaceful. An unfortunate incident, before we arrived, left the kitchen with a few items wanting (we sent owners notes about baking sheets, mixing bowls, items to bake in oven, hopefully replaced), the owners weren’t able to address the dishwasher not working issue while we were there for 2 weekend days (it wouldn’t latch in order to start). They did make amends for the inconveniences. We loved the location, overall the house and peaceful atmosphere."
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"Very clean house everything we expected from the page, and great host!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot in Sanford. Clean, bright, good-sized apartment, and lived up to the pictures perfectly."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location of the apartment is great. Downtown Sanford is beautiful, loved walking around the town meeting the different shop owners. Restaurants are within a 2-3 minute walk with a great selection. Apartment was just as the pictures showed, spotless. Would definitely stay there again if we are back up that way."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As before, great time and love the Pub/Restauant downstairs!! Looking forward to our next visit!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jeff,
We want to reserve for the same event at Deep River for next year. I hope by then you will have more units for our co workers. We could use , including us, three units.

Would stay there anytime we were in Sanford"
2024-02-01,3,Stayed with a pet,The apartment is spacious and beautiful. Unfortunately it is directly over a bar which had a band playing on Friday night. The floors were shaking so definitely no sleeping. When I messaged Jeff regarding the issue I never received a response. Too bad because the apartment itself is very nice.
2024-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"Beautiful industrial apartment, great views of the downtown area. In walking distance of several restaurants and local shopping. Great if you are looking for some time away. My only heads up would be if you are a light sleeper as there can be road noise and the beautiful train runs all night. The bedroom is located in the back to help filter out and prevent as much noise as possible. The host is wonderful and did check to make sure everything went well and gave local recommendations."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had an awesome time seeing some family. Enjoyed the downtown area. Really nice. Jeff is a good host. Will definitely stay again when we can plan another trip back.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The rental apartment was larger than the photos appeared. It was amazingly spacious.
Booked this for my mom who was visiting us to have a belated holiday get together. The location is great with restaurants, coffee shop, and a brewery in walking distance."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved my staycation at Jeff’s place! The bed and sheets were super soft and comfortable! It was the perfect place to just get away from the everyday hustle and bustle of life. I loved the downtown feel of eating in and sitting at the huge windows to watch the downtown life! Would def stay here again ❤️
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"It’s exactly as described nice very easy check in, street parking is limited hours but free parking available right behind building we spent New Years weekend here very quiet.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very cool and big apartment in the heart of downtown. Walkable to breweries and a coffee shop. Easy parking and check in experience. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend to others.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was our second stay at this place. It’s located right down town with tons of cool shops. The place has a cool urban feel and the bedroom is in a cave with no windows which is perfect for sleeping in. The place is clean with no clutter and we hope to stay a third time. Some outside noise while in the living area but nothing out of the ordinary in a downtown loft. Cool place and a great overnight place to stay with your pup.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was a comfortable stay at a centrally located apartment. I loved the location--upstairs in a renovated, downtown building. Parking and getting to and into the apartment is easy. It was pleasant to walk to coffee shops in the morning and eat at the downstairs restaurant in the evening. Driving from downtown Sanford to attractions including in Pinehurst and Southern Pines was convenient. Thank you for a pleasant stay!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Jeff was a great host. Responded in a timely fashion and was flexible with check in. I would stay here again if in the area another time.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We were in the area visiting our first grandchild and everything about our stay was fantastic. This was the perfect place for us to stay for the the week. The location is central to downtown with shops/restaurants but also peaceful and quiet. Some may be concerned about being above a restaurant/bar would be a problem for late night noise, but we didn't hear a thing. It was nice to have a kitchen, central air, and a washer and dryer, as well. Jeff was a wonderful host, answering our questions during the week in a prompt manner. We can't say enough about our stay-- we highly recommend it!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Everything about this place was amazing! We loved it here and will be back every few weeks for school! Cute little downtown apartment!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Only stayed for one night, but had a stress-free check-in and check out. The apartment was exactly as photographed and described. If you want to turn in very early the restaurant and bar downstairs might be the only drawback. Not an issue for me and was expected since the bar was listed in the description. Would absolutely stay again if I am back in the area for another golf trip."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Location was perfect and apartment was super cool. Light and bright

I highly recommend this Airbnb."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was one of our fav places we have stayed. The place was perfect for us and our dog on an overnight stay over. Very roomy space and located right downtown, walkable to lots of shops and restaurants. Even though it was a small town, with the windows and feel of the place, it felt like an urban loft. We came over a holiday weekend, and so it was quiet because no one else was in the other apartments and the restaurant downstairs was closed…so it was very quiet during our stay. Very spacious and we loved the bedroom with no one windows, so we slept well. Hope to stay here again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Right in town, plenty of walkable places to eat, shopping, coffee, super great location to everything in and around town. Everything was as described, very clean, older charm but up modern updates and amenities. I was in town on business and would stay again if available for future visits."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"jeff’s place was just as advertised, and we had a great stay. The smoke and barrel restaurant down below has great food, live music, and a staff that hustles. There’s lots to do right on the same street and on Thursdays, they have a concert two blocks away. This is a great apartment in great location for a great price."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed staying here. Location is excellent. The apartment is very clean and uncluttered. My only caveat, is the live music from the restaurant below on Friday night it’s not easy to sleep before 11pm. Regardless, I would stay here again."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great apartment and location, enjoyed the layout. Such a better option than a hotel suite.
One caveat, restaurant below has music Friday and Saturday nights and you can actually hear the words well enough to sing along from bed.
If you go to bed before midnight, use your phone as a white noise machine or something to drown out the sound and you’ll be fine."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great places to stay in Sanford North Carolina.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Jeff was really kind and was helpful. The place was just like the pictures!

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent stay in a great location, very clean and comfortable!"

The rooms are extremely spacious and the space was immaculately clean with lots of natural light. The bedroom was cozy and comfortable and allowed sound, restorative sleep! I was concerned that the restaurant downstairs might be noisy but it was surprisingly quiet! Location was perfect, close to work and restaurants and parks and greenway. Hope to return on my next work trip!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place in the heart of Sanford with lots of space. Jeff was easy to communicate with and checking in was very easy.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location, great host and communication, will try to come here again for sure"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really great all around! The pictures didn’t do the home justice. The light coming in from the windows really made it look much more beautiful. Very clean when we came and Jeff was very quick to answer when I had questions. If you choose to stay here be aware it’s in a bit of a city so I saw maybe a critter or two but nothing that would warrant caution about cleanliness. There’s a bar downstairs so it makes sense. Such a great spot! Only minor downside is how thin the walls were so you could very clearly hear the people in the apartment next door. All in all I was very happy with the place!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were able to snag this cute apartment for a festival in downtown Sanford. We loved that we were within walking distance to shops, food and bars. We had late night beverages and got food to go at Smoke and Barrel, the restaurant/bar below the apartment. The view looking over the downtown area was fantastic and worked in our favor for the firework display that night. We were very please and excited to book again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jeff is a great host! The apartment was just like pictured, the bed was comfy and the location is perfect for my work trips to Sanford. I will definitely stay again."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,A wonderful stay and loved the convenient location! The bar was loud underneath us but that was to be expected and we didn’t mind at all! It was a very large and spacious place and we loved the decor!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great spot! Jeff was a great communicative host and check in was a breeze!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a truly beautiful and comfortable apartment in the heart of downtown Sanford.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved this apartment. Very clean and easy to get around the area. Many walking places to go to. Would definitely rent again if I were in the area.

Regardless, I would definitely book again if in the area."

We didn’t realize there wasn’t an oven but that’s on us for not reading carefully. We would definitely stay here again!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another amazing stay. This is our 3rd time here. As always the place is extremely clean and communicating with the owners is very ease. we love the views and the place. So peaceful.
What takes this place over the top of every other place we have stayed is the owners. I'm not sure too many owners would have done what they did this weekend. We checked in at 4:30 and the A/C wasn't working. I messaged the owner and in 45 minutes both the owner and their A/C guy was there. They determined the unit needed replaced and they would have the unit replaced in the morning. We were comfortable staying there because the sun was going down and it was cooling off. By 1030am the next morning a brand new unit was installed and we weren't inconvenienced at all. our next 3 days were nice and cool. They were very accommodating and professional. I highly recommend staying here as I'm not sure all owners would have handled this issue this way."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The photos don’t do this place justice- it is wonderful and peaceful. We spent hours just looking at the lake and listening to the frogs. The owners are lovely and have thought of everything you would need for a fantastic stay.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ive stayed in alot of Airbnb places and this by far was the the most thought out. It was perfect in every way. The accommodations, the cleanliness, the location, the view and the amenities. This place is a must stay if you want a quite location with a great view"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Was the place clean, safe, and secure?.... YES
Would I stay there again?.... probably YES
Some things you should know:
- It is rather secluded. You enter through a long private drive which can be a little eerie if coming in late at night.
- It was recently remodeled/decorated and they didn't skimp, it looks nice.
- The living area was a little small, but the walk out porch made up for it.
- Ample parking and very few neighbors
- Its definitely quiet but you do have some noisy neighbors (frogs)"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"STAY HERE! You owe it to yourself! So cozy and comforting. Don’t stay at a hotel- STAY HERE! The photos are absolutely accurate but they don’t do it justice! One reviewer says it was “jaw dropping” and I absolutely agree. My family are Sanford locals and they were impressed. Their first words upon entry: “mmmm smells like the beach!”. Heidi definitely cut no corners in this apartment and we had everything we needed and more! Water and sodas in the fridge, snacks on the table, coffee pods ready to go! Plenty of clean linens and towels. Comfy couch and BIG TV! We brought our golden doodle and she got a warm welcome too AND she loved it as well! I wish we were staying longer because it was hard to say goodbye to this amazing space! We definitely are coming back to stay with Heidi ❤️ THANK YOU HEIDI!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"""Honestly, this stay was a bit jaw-dropping -- most things were way better than we expected. The place itself is clean and spacious, has lots of snacks and cokes, the beds are big, and it even has a flexible showerhead. Moreover, the location is great -- it's green and blossoming, quiet, but just a few minutes from downtown Sanford. I'm sure Heidi does this from her heart."""

Does not have a full kitchen but with microwave, toaster oven and electric skillet I was able to prepare all my meals. Very clean and the outside yard is relaxing. Loved getting to know her fur baby Asher and his buddy Max. Heidi allowed me to have my dog come for visits as well. Great place!! Will stay here again if I get the same internship"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was great. Spacious bedrooms with comfortable beds. Everything you need is there. Heidi was great and Asher was a bonus. There were cookies left on the table for me. Very nice to sit outside and have coffee and a conversation with Heidi.

2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Heidi’s place is located in a quaint surrounding and nice ambience. The accommodations were very clean. She provided some snacks, coffee, and the mini fridge had several beverages. 😊 Although there was no stove, a griddle was more than sufficient. I was able to cook bacon, eggs, toast and pancakes for breakfast as well as some chicken for lunch/dinner. I worked remotely from the dining area and sometimes from the living room. My favorite thing were the window coverings. My least (even though it smelled good) was the automatic air freshener in the bathroom that startled me a couple of times and made weird sounds like if it talked. 😂 Other than that, my stay was most enjoyable and Heidi is a GREAT host!!! Very responsive and attentive. Oh, did I mention she also brought me some goodies two out of the five nights of my stay. Thank you!!!"

We had such a delightful time staying in your beautiful home and neighborhood. The lower level apartment offered us lots of light, many amenities such as comfortable beds, plenty of towels, comforts such as coffee and snacks, the mini fridge and toaster over even came in handy. We appreciated the sitting room with TV and especially loved the back yard where we could sit and watch the deer, squirrels and birds wake up with the day while we did the same. And the fireflies at night were magical as well.
Staying with you, so close to the family members we were visiting, took our vacation in Sanford to a whole other level of peace and tranquility. Our evening visit with you and Maddie on your back deck was possibly our favorite part! Getting to know you some was lovely. We wish you all the best in your life endeavors. You are a generous and kind person. We suggest that you not change a thing because it was perfect!
Your airbnb gets an A++++ from us! As it was our first airbnb experience, now all others in the future will have to measure up to you! That will no be easy. Again, we thank you sincerely.
-Kristin and Paul, Corvallis, OR"

2024-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"This spot was very clean, comfortable, and the inside looked just as advertised. Only downside is I was hoping for something more private. You can't tell from the photos but the host's main house is a couple hundred feet away and the airbnb is fairly close to the road so you will hear cars. I live in the woods and am used to a quiet, secluded environment, but if you don't mind those things, this is definitely worth booking! The farm was beautiful and clearly well cared for and the host also included a variety of snacks and things like cotton balls and q-tips in the bathroom."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"First time using Airbnb and booking a listing for my first trip in a long time. Had an absolute fantastic time away from life on my vacation. The house was beautiful both on the inside and out. Very easy to find (however the ""5"" from the ""54"" on the mail box was missing when I got down there but luckily I was able to see the outline of the house number. Not only was the place wonderful but later that day when I got back after grabbing some dinner with my friend I was visiting in the area we were greated by this very friendly neighborhood cat. She was the sweetest lil thing and I saw her multiple times up to the last night of my stay. Not sure if it was a neighborhood cat or one of the neighbors but boy do I wish I could've taken it home. Overall, if I happen to visit my friend in the area again in the future I will more than likely book this listing again. 5 stars all around. Thank you Lucy :)"

Overall, our stay was great and we would stay there again!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The home was lovely and just as beautiful as the pictures, if not more so. The only issue we had was the porch light being blown which made it a little difficult when coming in at night, a very minor issue. I would definitely recommend this home for a serene home on the outskirts of the main city."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our family had a great time staying here! Good location which was nice and peaceful. The home was clean and very comfortable.
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,This place was absolutely beautiful. We loved staying there and it was so convenient to have a grocery store nearby walking distance. We enjoyed everything about this place. Location was great for our family with the wedding we attended to. Thank Lucy and Chris. We would definitely recommend this to our friends and family.
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"Excellent location, very spacious and beautiful"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lucy’s place is very clean and convenient to grocery shopping. It’s also close to Anderson Creek Golf course. I really enjoyed the home decor, it makes us feel like a home away from home. Will stay here again for our next golf trip."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My buddy and I stayed here for a golf trip. Wonderful house. We enjoyed our stay.
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Place was great. Very clean, easy to access, everything was labeled so there was no confusion. Grocery store located very close so we were able to get anything we needed. It was great and would probably stay again if I find myself in the area in the future."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay and will book here again during our next visit. Highly recommend this home.
2024-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Overall the house is fine. Comfy furniture, great patio for entertaining and lots of room to spread out."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This listing is so charming! The location was excellent for our needs and extremely clean. Communication with host(s) is excellent and they were always very kind even when our issue was operator error. I had two elderly relatives with me who had never utilized air b and b before and I think this has changed their minds! They loved it! I have rented from Lucy before and if my daughter and future son in law return to Fayetteville after recent orders for another duty station, I will look for Lucy’s listings. It was a wonderful girl’s weekend celebrating my daughter for her bridal shower! You will not regret staying here."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,Nice place. I would suggest getting a faster internet service. It bogged down fairly regularly.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I thoroughly enjoyed my 5 day stay here. The location was great and very peaceful. The home was very cozy and welcoming. It looks exactly as pictured. The hosts are very informative and knowledgeable. I wouldn’t mind staying again.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very clean housing. A great back yard which is fenced with wood. There are bushes which cover the master bath windows. Tall bushes also lined the back yard on the south side. Great for those with dogs!.
Location is also a plus. Across the street from a grocery store (Food Lion), Dollar General, and a few others.
Lucy was available at all times, and super pleasant."
2023-12-01,4,Group trip,"The house was very pretty, in a quiet neighborhood, very peaceful, within walking distance of a grocery store and a dollar tree. It was quite possibly the perfect place to have Christmas away from home.
The only down falls were the internet and communication. The internet was awful, two people could not be on a lap top at the same time without delays or glitches. Not sure if that’s just how it is in that area, or there was a possible problem with the internet itself. Communication was also very minimal, I only had to reach out twice, once about a burned out light on the front porch, which was no big deal, we honestly thought we flipping the wrong switches. The other time was to ask about the garbage, specifically the recycling, we didn’t know what got recycled, or what the rules were, we did reach out in the morning on Christmas Eve, definitely had grace with waiting for a response, holidays and families are important, but alas, we never got an answer. We would stay there again."
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Home was very nice. Beds were very nice. Liked the fenced in backyard for my furbaby. It does need a way to turn on the front porch lights. I asked but they didn’t know for sure. And there was no garage access except going inside and opening it and at night that wasn’t good because I left my husband and dog in the car and he has dementia so he got a little confused. But overall it was a good place.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was a great place for our family to stay (3 kids and pup) amongst our home being repaired. Close proximity to grocery store and a great Mexican spot! Great location if you are heading to the military base too- easy commute and good, safe area.
Hosts were great and very responsive to contact. Amenities in home were exactly what was needed and we had zero issue.
Would absolutely recommend to those coming to the area!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful location, grocery store and restaurants nearby. Very cozy, loved the upstairs bedroom area. Looking forward to staying again in warmer weather to enjoy the patio!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a fabulous stay. The home is beautiful and was very clean. Location was perfect for myself and my family because it was very close to my nieces house and we were in town for her sons 2nd birthday! I will definitely rent here again!
Thank you for your hospitality!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was very nice, clean and in a nice neighborhood. Conveniently located within walking distance of a grocery store. Would stay here on our next visit."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was perfect for our family to stay in over Thanksgiving while visiting family. It was modern and nicely decorated and professionally cleaned. Everything was labeled and marked so we could know where things were. Overall we would recommend!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We LOVED this place!!! Lucy was so helpful along with her co host were great. We did have an incident that was completely our fault. My daughter attempted to make the microwaveable ramen but did add water. It didn’t go over well. We let them know what happened immediately and they were so kind. We did leave a day early but due again to our own family things. My youngest needed to get home to his doctor. My kids loved the back yard and we had a great time!!! We are very thankful for this place. We celebrated my husbands 22 year retirement from the Army and it was the perfect place for it!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved it

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying here and it was such a clean, comfortable place to stay while we waited to close on our new home. We'll definitley be recommending it to our family and friends who come to visit the area. The kitchen is very well equipped, the fenced yard is perfect if you're bringing your dog. The beds are comfortable and the back deck/patio is a lovely place to drink your coffee in the morning. Highly recommend!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lucy and Mark are great hosts - the house is beautiful and I loved how everything was labeled...no need to guess on light switches or where the spoons and coffee cups are. The deck is a relaxing place to start the day. We hope to stay here again on future family trips to Sanford.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,beautiful place. perfect the amount of people we had.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Place was as stated. there were 6 of us so an additional 1/2 bath would have made it perfect. but it worked. bedrooms are well laid out apart from each other which allowed for more privacy. would recommend. supermarket and 3 restaurants literally just a walk across the street. we went to Raven rock state park. i wouldn’t miss it if u go there
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thank you for allowing us to stay in home. We really enjoyed our time with our family and will highly recommend you to anyone who is staying in Sanford NC

My family and I enjoyed it!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great Airbnb experience! This home was a great place for us to stay while visiting with our military family. (My family lives in Carolina Lakes - and it was a very very short drive, maybe 5 mins). Grocery store and restaurants are very close. The home was so so clean, and had everything that we needed. Huge closets, great bathrooms, comfy beds. I had to zoom for my job while staying there and the surroundings were so professional and clean looking. It worked out wonderfully. When visiting with family next time, we will for sure stay at this home again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Extremely friendly and responsive. The house was perfect for our needs. It was a little further from the center of town that I expected, but no big deal.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This renovated older home has the beauty of it’s original design coupled with modern amenities in the kitchen and bathroom, along with good WiFi! Most Airbnb‘s have Internet TV which I find to be worthless, this one actually has a functional TV where I could watch local stations!
I would recommend this Airbnb in would definitely stay here again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Amazing place and hosts! Perfectly matches the description and I totally recommend! Quiet neighborhood, close from groceries stores and restaurants and very clean! If I come back to Sanford I will try to stay there for sure!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was as expected, this is a lovely home in a great neighborhood close to food and shopping. I stayed down stairs last time I was in town and this visit my daughter stayed at their other listening. All of their locations have been perfect every time! This location does have a claw foot tub so if you have balance issues I would recommend one of the other locations, stepping into and out of the tub could be risky, but if that is not a concern I highly recommend this rental!!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Emalee’s place is charming and perfect for a stay in Sanford. We were close to town but in a quiet residential area. It had everything we needed and was super clean. It is wonderfully decorated to match the older house. It is quite a gem and we will certainly stay again next time we are in Sanford.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This location was great for my daughter and me. The host was very helpful with everything we needed during our stay. We we very pleasantly surprised when we arrived to have some bottled water and very nice treats after a long day of traveling. The furnishings were clean and very comfortable. I hope we have the opportunity to stay there again when we come back in a year.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,Such a bright and cheery place. We had a great 3 week stay. Everything we needed to feel like home. Highly recommended.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay in Sanford! The location was close to nearby restaurants and bars. The apartment had a beautiful ‘older’ feel and beautiful scenery out every window. If we find ourselves back in Sanford we will definitely be booking again!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I really enjoyed staying here. The space was great.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,very clean n peaceful
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"They say the third time is a charm, but I’ve had just as wonderful stays and experiences during my first two visits to Emalee’s place. I stay here whenever I am in Sanford on business (when it’s not booked) and everything is always very clean, pristine, comfy, private, beautiful and serene, yet close to town and great restaurants and shopping. She is a very great host and super responsive!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Relaxing and peaceful stay in a lovely historic home. Recommended.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very responsive host. So much better than staying at a hotel. Very comfortable space.
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is a really cute apartment in historic house. Many things about it are charming. Be aware of a very steep staircase going up to the little apartment.
Bed is really tiny. It’s a double bed. Also there is no nightstand on one side of the bed, which is very frustrating, and non-functional for a guest. Nowhere to put a phone, medication’s or a glass of water.
Kitchen is well equipped and charming. Quaint little sitting area to have coffee by the window."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"My second time here. Same high recommendations for super clean linens, kitchen, bathroom, etc. and
very peaceful, but close to downtown food. Another great night’s sleep and stay! Worth it!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Stay was more than expected and exactly as described. Experience was even better in person.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Study Hall was lovely and exactly what I needed. Host was easy to contact and so kind. The unit is upstairs but no problem and worth the effort .
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great and easy process
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay at this place and its great. Quiet neighborhood, walking distance to bars and restaurants downtown Sanford, much better than a hotel!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great host and a very pleasant stay. Cleanliness was super and included all the kitchen ware needed for a great dinner and breakfast. The location was very comfortable and had great lighting indoors and pleasant layout / structure.
Very appreciated stay and thankful to a good quality host."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed my stay. Clean and very welcoming.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great spot for an overnight stay and we walked to dinner!!!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,So much better than a hotel. Simply love the care taken in this bnb. We enjoyed just sitting in the kitchen the most. Very comfortable and clean. I would stay again.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a fantastic Airbnb property! The Study Hall apartment is very nicely refurbished, decorated and furnished and is absolutely spotless. I didn't use the kitchen except to make some coffee and spend a little time on my laptop, but I noticed that it's fully equipped. I felt right at home.
Emalee and Laurie respond quickly to inquiries and are great hosts.
If you're so inclined, it's a short walk (a few blocks) to the Sanford downtown area, with locally-owned (and good) restaurants, brewpubs, coffee shops, bakeries, and stores. If you drive to the downtown area, there's plenty of free street parking.
Five stars and two thumbs up."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was beyond cozy and cute. It has the charm of an older house, yet very good privacy. All the amenities you'd need to stay for a while if you bring groceries. I loved cooking meals and being able to have all I needed plus some there. If you stay you won't regret it, just be mindful it is up a flight of stairs. Thanks so much to my host it was a stay i recommend others to try!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,I can't recommend this stay enough! Very cute and cozy loft with everything you need except groceries to be right at home!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect! Everything was exactly as described, and the cleanliness was beyond expectation. It was quaint, has old charm, quiet, everything I needed for my stay, and I look forward to returning when I come back through Sanford in the near future. I only stayed for one night, as I was in town for a work assignment, but I wish I could’ve stayed longer! I can’t say enough good things about my stay."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great place! great host!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had a great visit. In town for a week on business and this was a great place to eat my dinner and rest at night. Comfortable bed and convenient location.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,The home was better than I imagined for the location. The kitchen was beautiful and they provided refreshments. It was cozy and cute. I love a good clawfoot tub! The hosts were super helpful and communicative. The only thing I wished they had was more curtains and blinds for privacy
2022-12-01,4,Stayed about a week,"This was my second time staying at Emalees listing on Steele street. This one looks adorable and it is squeaky clean. But there were issues I wish I had known about.
There is no night stand on one side of the bed.
Trying to watch TV in the bedroom with a canopy pole in your line of vision is impossible.
My spouse and I wanted to sit and have coffee together. There is no place to sit except the kitchen table. One recliner is okay for a solo traveler. But this listing is for 2 people.
The only place we could sit together was in bed.
There are also no blinds in the kitchen or front door so anybody can look in.
Guest beware"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Emalee's place is in an historic home and is very comfortable and very clean. Decorated beautifully. I will stay there again!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This recent stay at the Study Hall was my second time in a year. The location is wonderful and there is so much charm that it begs you to stay longer. I wouldn’t stay anywhere else when I’m Sanford. Everything you would need is there and there are countless restaurants within 3-5 miles. If you visit, go to Valenti’s for dinner and Fairview Dairy for breakfast (it’s a steal!) and chat with the locals."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great host, great place"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean. Nice place
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This unit is a lovely place to stay. The interior is cheerfully and thoughtfully decorated. I had everything I needed. It is spotlessly clean. The host was fantastic. I would stay here again, and longer."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and comfortable place
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What another wonderful stay at Emalee and Laurie’s property on Steele Street. They are so gracious and accommodating for every one of our stays. So grateful to have such wonderful hosts!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As always we had another great stay with Emalee and Laurie. They are the best when it comes to hosting. The property is pristine and clean, location is perfect, and the little details they add (water, snacks, coffee) makes us feel at home. All helps to take the stress away from travel and we are able to relax and enjoy our trip."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was great! Emalee and Laurie always go out of their way to make our stay a wonderful experience. From the beverages and snacks to the cozy bed it makes for a wonderful visit. We highly recommend their properties.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful place to spend a week while working! it was a beautiful space. I enjoyed being able to come home each day and have lunch. Everything was immaculate upon arrival. I hope I was quiet enough being on the upper floor. I did worry about that.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved it and will plan to stay here again!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, no complaints."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Room was a great find!! Very clean and had a great kitchen space! Will be staying here next time we’re in town!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Very friendly host and great location in Sanford, NC."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Private, clean, spacious and quiet, 5/5"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,Excellent experience. Great hosts
2022-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Stayed here for a month and had a great stay! The place was extremely clean and the Hosts were very responsive and great to communicate with! The place is so open and brightly decorated it was such a happy environment. The private porch was nice to sit in on sunny days. The huge windows bring in a ton of light! The kitchen was very well equipped (minus a toaster) and everything worked great! Some things to note, the laundry is a little bit of a walk to get to since you have to go outside and around the house and the WiFi was a bit iffy for me, especially during storms, and it didn’t reach every part of the apartment. Other than that it’s a great place to stay and would stay again!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Overnight stay, everything was clean, comfortable and well furnished. There is not a living space, but a small really comfortable sitting area with recliner. We will definitely stay again."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place, wonderful stay!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,Everything was great. I highly recommend.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend. Very nice upstairs apartment in old house. Location is very close to down Sanford with lots of shops and restaurants. Had a wonderful time.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Emalee is so responsive and helpful! This is the second time my family has stayed with her and they were just as happy with the accommodations as they were the first time back in 2018!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely beautiful place! Seems like a great neighborhood which was comforting. Had everything needed or could want. Super clean!! Bed was comfy and TV available which was nice. Quiet place to stay at. Will definitely be back!!

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice, super clean, all the comforts of home in a charming older home. Will stay here again if i come back and its available."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent! Any successful trip to Sanford requires a stay in Study Hall. 10 min walk to breweries/downtown area, which comes in handy considering the total lack of rideshare/cabs in the area. We had a nice, peaceful stay here. The place is immaculately clean and well cared for. Hosts are friendly and responsive. This is THE place to stay to make the most of a trip to Sanford."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,the Study Hall was very clean well appointed and in a great location
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is absolutely perfect for a single person or couple to have a getaway. It's set off the main street so there is not a lot of noise, but you are super close to historic downtown Sanford. The whole apartment has vintage charm mixed with some modern upgrades. I highly recommend this location for anyone who wants somewhere with some history and character. There are so many good things I could say, but really you need to see it for yourself to appreciate it!"
2021-11-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Enjoyed our stay. Perfect apartment for two people. It is stocked with all you need. The location is close to shopping on Steele St. We found the best breakfast spot just up the street, Mrs. Wengers. They have the best biscuits."

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy and comfortable place to stay!

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable & quiet neighborhood.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This beautiful home was an unexpected, and last minute stay for my Fiance and I. We were ready to get off the road after driving a long while and find a safe, clean place. This home was just lovely. Emalee communicated promptly. Thank you!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This Airbnb is perfect for a couple and conveniently located in Sanford! Extremely clean and tidy. Emalee was the perfect host!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful house, simply decorated. Porch is great!"
2021-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"The pictures do not do this flat justice. Charming and spacious, this home is in a perfect spot. Emalee was very attentive to my needs especially in the middle of the night when a malfunctioning smoke detector (no fault to anyone) decided it wanted to go off. There attention to safety is key as they have numerous smoke detectors throughout which shows the level of care they have for their guests. The only downside is that I wish I had time to stay for two nights as this home begs for you to sit back, relax and explore the downtown at a leisurely pace."

2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I am a traveling nurse and Emalees house was perfect for me to stay in while working at the local hospital. Will stay here again for sure if there is availability during my schedule. It was quiet, clean, and easy to navigate. I am working days currently but used to work nights and do think it would be too bright during the day for a night shifter to sleep. But perfect otherwise."

2019-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This stay was exactly as pictured. I stayed one night on the last leg of an road trip between Georgia and New York.

2019-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Emalee's place is just as it is listed. It's our third time we have stayed in her home. It's a beautiful apartment, super clean and comfortable, Emalee and her Sister Laurie are super Hosts, they make you feel comfortable and easy to work with. Ron July 2019"
2019-07-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The owners did a great job of communicating, and the apartment was nicely decorated. The place had been cleaned, but the sheets had small stains on them and there was a large roach in the kitchen. We do not think the roach was a result of being unclean; we recognize roaches are common in the South no matter how clean a place is. We asked the owners if we could get a refund for the second night of our stay (we booked two nights) and we were told that it wasn’t possible due to Air BnB’s cancellation policy. We understand the charge on the credit card could not be reversed, but we felt they could have been more accommodating to our request, since there are other ways to reimburse someone or give a discount. Paying full price for a place that has the largest roach I have ever seen was not ideal. They did offer to spray if it would help us feel better."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful artfully decorated place with a lovely peaceful setting and everything needed for a at home feel stay.
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed five nights and would do it again. Location was close to downtown but very quiet. The place was very clean and the air conditioning kept us cool and comfortable. We were visiting family in the area and the location made travel in all directions quick and easy. Terrific value compared to the local hotels where we have stayed on past visits. This place had everything we needed. The check-in and check-out process could not have been easier. Thank you Emalee for providing this wonder asset to your community.
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is not your usual grim Study Hall but a lovely light-filled aerie where thoughtful touches abound. Location was great for our needs. Laurie and Emalee were thoughtful and on point👍🌸😀

2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was as desired and described online. The hosts we're prompt and thorough in communication, the apartment was very nicely decorated, with the right amenities for a single person, couple, or parent & child. I had my 2 year old goddaughter for part of my stay and she was comfortable as well. The fenced in backyard was also a nice touch for us to play and relax."
2019-03-01,5,Stayed one night,First time user and this was an excellent way to begin my Air BnB journey. Everything was made so easy :)
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovingly kept place. Very clean and minimal in all the best ways. Much nicer than I thought it might be. Nice weekend get away. Close to quaint downtown with decent places to eat. About 40 minutes or so to Raleigh. Our first night was very quiet but the second night there were others staying in the separated unit below and we could hear them. Some windows in the main areas don’t have window treatments...so a bathrobe is helpful! Over all very nice place and would recommend it to others.
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place!! Can't wait to stay again ;)
2019-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Emalee's Airbnb is tastefully furnished and immaculately clean. It comes with the kinds of thoughtful touches a guest would expect from a five-star hotel, and with a host who genuinely cares about the guest's experience. my stay here was fantastic and I would definitely come back."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Very nice rental apartment/home. It is essentially half (the left side) of a duplex home. Nicely furnished and clean, no issues with check-in at all. Very good working AC & wifi which is a plus.
We did wish a unit touted as a 'botanist bungalow' had some more thoughtful touches in the outdoor space, which seemed sparsely planted and not well kept.. maybe they'll get back there this summer and do some more landscaping because I think it would make the place look much more appealing.
All in all, it was still very convenient to stay in Carolina Trace where we were celebrating with our friends for the weekend, and the home was quite adequate for the price. Much appreciated!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay for our quick visit to watch our grandkids while our son was moving back. Thanks!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Catie was one of the best hosts I have had! Her quick response and flexibility to alter our reservation as requested, was absolutely wonderful! I will definitely stay here again next time I am around the area!"
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We had a nice stay. My only complaints were the bed frame in the back bedroom was really squeaky. The toilet in the first bedroom felt like it wasn’t attached to the wall.
Other than that, the house was great and very pet friendly."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We would definitely stay at Catie’s place again! We were here for a short weekend for a wedding and the home was very comfortable and the hosts were very accommodating. The home was squeaky clean which is always a big deal! We had a couple little hiccups with getting in the security gate but the hosts cleared that up right away! There were lots of like extras- board games, shower supplies, snacks! We’re grateful for the hospitality!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"miss Catie was great! She was responsive and very catering to my family's needs. The house was in excellent condition. She had great amenities including coffee, snacks, apps, and etc. I would definitely recommend this place to people. PS, my mom loved it."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was wonderful. This place checked all the boxes for us. For us the location worked well and the beds were comfortable!

We utilized the playground every day, we appreciated it!
Thanks for the attention to all details, we will look for your place when we return to the area."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay at Catie’s place, I just wish we had more than one night. Catie had a helpful welcome binder, everything was labeled in the house, and she was very responsive to our questions. The location is wonderful, it was very quiet and the beds were wonderful. The living room was our favorite spot with the big TV, games and old record player. I would stay again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Catie and her family responded to our request very quickly. they are taking care of a beautiful property.

The gated community is a wonderful place to explore and walk around. It was located perfectly to my travels. I would highly recommend the AIrB&B to anyone heading to this part of NC. Thank you for opening your doors to us,"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Catie and Ryan were great hosts. They were quick to answer any of our questions. It is quiet area. The beds were very comfortable. It was convenient to find. Their correspondence on checking-in and check-out was very clear. Everything that we needed for a comfortable stay was provided, including a few extras."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Catie made our vacation perfect, from the smallest of details such as having games and puzzles to do. We were able to cook, clean items with the laundry room, solve a puzzle and relax on the couches in the living room. The location was perfect for my husband and our pups to get away. The neighborhood is beautiful and wish we were visiting during the warmer months as there is so much to do outside. Highly recommend staying and booking with Catie!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"this is my 1st time renting an Airbnb. we were blessed to have found Catie. cute bungalow very comfortable for all 3 of us. love it had 2 king size beds. my 83 yr old mom said the place was so peaceful and i totally agree with her. bedding very comfortable and i am very picky with my bedding.
we felt secured and safe. Ms. Catie was very patient and willing to answer any and all of my questions no matter how silly they were, and she was willing to come over and help with whatever we needed. i basically felt like i was treated like a family member. oh, she also had the bungalow decorated with Christmas touches which made it even more special.
the only thing we struggled with was driving at night because there are no streetlights, but that has nothing to do with Ms. Catie, just giving you a heads up if you are not accustomed to driving in the dark
i will definitely plan to stay at this Airbnb in the future. thank you Catie for your hospitality."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,second time here! Great as usual :)

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a very comfortable place and the hosts were great! The bed and linens were so comfortable that I actually looked into ordering them. I have to say I didn’t feel I could completely close the curtains all the way. I was up with a baby at all hours and didn’t feel like I had complete privacy.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks Carie and Ryan. Hope to come back some time
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The bungalow was a great place for us to stay as we visited our grandchildren.
The area is beautiful with the surrounding lake and wildlife.
The house was very comfortable.
Catie & her husband were great hosts. I needed a mixer to make a dessert and they immediately went out and purchased a hand mixer for the rental.
Very responsive and helpful.
We would definitely come again."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We are military and visited NC to scope out some areas to live and we are SO thankful for Catie’s sweet bungalow! Our family of 4 (including two small kids and a dog) felt right at home and had everything we needed. It was such a cozy and friendly launching pad to explore the area, exactly what we needed ❤️"

We really enjoyed the area. Very pretty. We also were able to meet Carie outside one day and she was super friendly!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were pleasantly surprised by the place. Considering it’s a tad older in style and motif, it was clean and met our exact needs. It’s also in a very beautiful location right off of a golf course.
There was a slight issue with the smoke detector, but they’ll resolve that no problem. We were happy with the place over all, would definitely recommend.
We were impressed with their hospitality!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Catie was a fantastic host! She went above and beyond to make sure all of our needs were met. Her place is a hidden gem. Clean, comfortable, and filled with amenities. She even provided coffee, snacks, drinks, tons of games, puzzles, and even dog toys and dog bowls. I highly recommend you stay in the Botanist Bungalow if you are in the Sanford area. You will not be disappointed. Thank you, Catie for making our stay a memorable one. We hope to return one day."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Had a great time at the Botanist Bungalow. Catie and her husband were super responsive when I had questions, the place was actually bigger and nicer than we thought, and the kids spent all week at the community pool with some super fun neighbors. Great stay!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The community is peaceful and we enjoyed walking down to the lake and playground with our dogs and 1.5 year old. The pictures don’t really show it but there is plenty of space off to the side of the house to take a pup out.
This is probably one of the best thought through air BNBs we have stay at GLOBALLY. You can tell there was so much effort and intention put into items for us. Since we were coming from not too far away I brought coffee cream and cooking oil because air BNBs don’t usually have them. They were both provided already! There were cold drinks in the fridge and some snacks on the entry table. There were even dog poop bags and a few dog toys and bowls. Things that you sometimes don’t think to bring with you but are such a nice to have!
There wasn’t a lot of baby proofing needed either as there wasn’t any clutter and thoughtful furniture.
Catie checked on us after the first night to see if we needed anything. We would 10/10 stay here again!!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Cozy house in a private neighborhood! Close to Tobacco Road golf course and the city of Sanford. Very clean and affordable. Highly recommend

We can definitely recommend it the BEST place to stay in Sanford, NC. Very close to pretty much everything and super clean place to stay! Catie was very accommodating with our check-in and check-out schedule. I would definitely stay with them again. My wife adored the master bedroom and private bathroom. The small details like a welcoming binder, definitely take the time to read, it’s super helpful. It’s close to all major stores like Walmart, Ross, Marshalls and 45 min away from airport."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Communication with the host was great. The home had everything we needed and more, for example coffee, extension cords, kitchen ware and toiletries.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I really can't say enough about Catie's place. Communication was fantastic! The nicest people you will ever meet - ever! Yep - they live close-by but that is only a bonus. Ok, I know this is about to sound like a paid advertisement, but it's not. I just feel extremely motivated to tell it like it is. This place is absolutely private and fantastic. So clean. The little touches that make it home are incredible. Everything we needed to make a cup of awesome coffee in the morning - they have that covered. There were even snacks and waters and sodas! She set out a bottle of wine! So warming and thoughtful. The beds were like sleeping in a 5 star hotel. We sunk in and had the best most quiet sleep we have had in so long! We never sleep in past 6 am - and we didn't wake up until 8:30!!! The woods surrounding the property are so lovely and it was so quiet - the birds, crickets and frogs sung us to sleep. Whether you are sitting in the seating area of the front porch garden or on the backyard deck, it is just delightful. Whether you are going to Carolina Trace for some golf or just to get away to a quiet lovely place for a few days - this is your best bet - don't even think about it, just go. You will be at peace and happy."

The house was very nice, extremely CLEAN and VERY well stocked. They have everything you need even plenty of cleaning supplies and bathroom S/C and soaps. Catie and Ryan are super sweet and very helpful. And their dogs Chunk and Cocoa are so so cute and sweet. You can tell they put a lot of thought into making their guests comfortable including leaving a basket of treats, coffee, creamer and a bottle of wine! ❤️ They even have dog treats for the pups!! We were so happy here. Best Airbnb experience ever! You do have close neighbors but you could never tell. It’s super quiet and calm and private. The beds were super comfy and all the board games were so fun. Everything was perfect. Really can’t say enough good things. Will definitely stay here again!"

The deck looks out on a peaceful forest scene, a great place to enjoy your morning coffee. The beds are super comfortable, the towels are fluffy, and I love having a full washer and dryer available if needed.
We had fun playing board games and listening to albums last evening. The desk by the front window was perfect as I had work to finish up and I loved the peaceful view out the window while I worked.
The kitchen has everything you need to make meals, brew a great cup of coffee, or fill up your water bottle with ice and water from the fridge dispenser as you head out the door.
We will definitely stay here again as Carolina Trace is a great community and this lovely Airbnb is our new favorite home away from home!"

When we checked in, we were greeted with the surprise of snacks, the perfect treat after a long day on the road.
House was very clean, and in a super quiet, beautiful, tree-surrounded location.
Wish I had a reason to have stayed longer. My kids loved it too due to the numerous board games provided.
Thanks!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to stay.! The Botanist Bungalow had lots of windows providing light which allowed nature to surround us. We had board games, access to the pool, snacks, cozy beds, and Bob Marley on the record player. What a relaxing stay in a safe gated community. Super Hosts that thought of every detail and were quick to respond. I'll stay here again on my next visit."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cute little cottage in a quiet neighborhood. House is spacious, well-appointed kitchen, comfortable beds and plenty of seating. We met Catie in person and had a nice little chat. The back deck (with seating) is lovely to enjoy a glass of wine, looking out at the trees and hearing the birds, heaven! We walked our dogs around the area at night, nice green space areas in front of house and down the street. Short 10 min car ride to local restaurants and shopping. We are looking forward to staying here again in the future!!"

It was only 10 minutes away from almost everything; the Civic Center, Walmart, Biscuitville (my first time and loved it), you name it..! As for the home itself it was very spacious and accommodated my family very well.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a great space. Lots of room, well-equipped and comfortable. Beds were great, furniture is pretty new and it’s very clean. A charming older house in a neighborhood of other older charming houses. Very convenient to food and grocery stores, including Walmart and other big stores."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lots of space to stretch out. The rooms are of nice size and the living room is also spacious. The beds are so, so comfortable as well. The kitchen has most everything you would need. I am not from the area (my family is) but I wouldn’t feel comfortable walking around the neighborhood at night as some parts to one side seemed a bit..run down? for lack of better words. Although to the other side is much nicer. According to my family, that is how Sanford is. A small and older town. I would still stay again. Part of the charm. I used the Airbnb for a “home base” for my parents to watch my kiddo during day while I visited a family member in the hospital. He had so much space to play and they even left toys! The price was great and the Airbnb absolutely beats the local hotels in amenities and cleanliness. I would also just like to say again, the beds are amazing. Better than mine at home, lol!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,"My family stayed here for three months while we explored NC and we had a great stay! I loved all the little touches the hosts added like power strips in all the bedrooms, the kitchen was well stocked, the furniture was very comfy, the hosts live right next door so when we did have an issue they were able to help us super promptly. It’s an older house so the creaky floors and stairs took some time to get used to but we were very comfortable and would definitely stay again if we ever find ourselves in Sanford. Hosts were amazing, very responsive and easy to work with."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We love this house. I stayed here with my family and would do so again in a heartbeat. The house is clean and well laid out with comfortable furniture in the living room and a nice big table in the dining room. I found the beds to be comfortable in the sheets to be of good quality. I really appreciate that the windows in the bedrooms have blackout curtains so we could sleep in. The back porch was nice but we actually ended up spending more time on the front porch. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.

Thank you so much for allowing us to stay in your beautiful home! We will definitely be back!!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sherri, your host, will do everything in her ability to make your stay in Sanford as delightful as possible. Sherri helped find treatment for one of our friends with a knee injury, which allowed my friend to stay and enjoy her time in Sanford.
Sherri has prepared a very comfortable house with very comfortable beds and plenty of room to step away from others in the house and rest. The kitchen has plenty of cooking and dining elements so you’re able to prepare simple meals or bring in your takeout and enjoy your meal. The house is located in a quiet neighborhood just minutes from Sanford’s town center. Parking is easy with virtually no traffic to contend with. Everything was very clean, organized, and in great condition. A very lovely home!
This house is likely to be booked frequently, so if you’re wondering about whether to jump on this location as your refuge from a bustling day, don’t hesitate. You’ll be delighted you did.
And if you speak with Sherri, tell her ‘hello’ from me!"

I would have given this place 5 stars, if it had not been for an allergic reaction I had to some sort of freshener. I am better, but I did not enjoy the visit with my family as much because the allergy was quite challenging. If you have no allergies to fragrances, you will absolutely love it!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sheri’s house was fantastic. It was super clean and the beds were comfy. We forgot to bring soap, but there was some great soap in the bathroom (I bought some for Christmas gifts). We loved the snacks, there was plenty of seating in the living room (the couch was comfy), the front porch swing was nice, the towels were great (happy that there were also washcloths), the iron came in handy. This AirBnB was the best! No detail was missed."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was beautiful, clean, and beautifully decorated. It had more than enough space to commadate six adults, one child, a toddler, and an infant. The yard was a nice size for the kids to play. Loved sitting on the swing on the large front porch and enjoyed hanging on the back deck. I was in town for four days for my son's wedding and needed a house that was
convenient to my sons house & wedding venue. Everything was perfect.
Sherri was a pleasure to work with. Always quick to get back to me with questions I had. Easy access to get into the house. I will rent again when I come back to visit my son. I
recommend renting this house if you have high standards. You will not be disappointed.
Sherri, thank you for a wonderful stay.
