2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Barb and Jim,
My sisters and I can't thank you enough for the hospitality you showed us on our recent stay in your beautiful Century Farmhouse. You both made us feel so welcome and comfortable from the start with your kindness and warm way. The Farmhouse was a home away from home, very much like the home and surroundings where we all grew up. We cooked big dinners, and laughed until it hurt. We created memories that will last a lifetime, spending time with our Aunt, cousins and their children will be forever cherished.
We loved the comfort of your beautifully maintained and updated Century Farmhouse.
We already spoke of planning another stay next spring on our drive home to the eastern end of Long Island, NY.
My sisters and I are so grateful to you both for making our stay so special!
Thank you again,
Marian, Florence, Nancy and Gail"

Barb always makes a coffee cake and it is the best coffee cake we’ve ever had! We fully intend to stay here again in the future!
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Our weekend stay at Jim and Barb's Century Farmhouse was wonderful. It was a beautiful setting and perfect location for us to gather with extended family, to attend a family reunion nearby. We had 6 adults and 2 children, and had plenty of space and amenities for all of us to enjoy and be comfortable. Barb met us upon arrival, and was beyond friendly and helpful in showing us the house and explaining everything. She was very responsive with positive communication before, during, and after our visit. I've previously stayed in numerous Airbnbs, and this was the cleanest and most beautiful property that I've been at. The kitchen and bathroom were stocked with extra items (more than mentioned in the listing), so we had plenty of what was needed, and more. The Chandlers are very gracious hosts, and we were pleasantly surprised with a delicious treat of homemade coffee cake. Thank you so much for allowing us to enjoy your special retreat."

2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"5 stars! House was exactly as advertised. The only improvements I might suggest is adding fans in the bedrooms. The A/C doesn't quite cool things down enough upstairs. The home is well equipped and the woodwork is beautiful. The gazebo was the perfect gathering place outside. A great rural setting, but not far from civilization at all. We will book this home again for sure!"

But more importantly, Jim and Barb keep a lovely home and treat guests like family. This was by far the best airbnb experience I've ever had. We'll be back, for a lot of reasons... coffee cake among them :)"

2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Century House was exactly as described in the overview as well as all the wonderful reviews. Barb's communication is fantastic and we appreciated the personal greeting. The coffee cake was to die for! The house is very convenient to Ashland University if you're looking for a terrific place to come home to after events there.

Highly recommend!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! This place wasn’t only lovely but Jim and Barb definitely have the gift of hospitality. Their home is not only beautiful but clean. There is a sense of peace when you drive up to the property with its stately trees. The kitchen is fully equipped (even a crockpot) and ready to be used. We were in need of some night lights and they quickly came to our rescue. They also shared with us suggestions of restaurants close by. The beds were comfortable, there was plenty of lighting and the temperature in the house was evenly regulated. We had plenty of towels and each bed had an extra blanket. What’s not to like! Definitely an A+ In our book."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Barb is a wonderful host who responds promptly and goes above and beyond to make her guests feel at home. We were greeted with a nice touch, but I won't spoil the surprise. Let's just say it really hit the spot!
We had an unusual situation with a surprise cancellation at another host's property which required a sudden booking at the Century House. Barb helped us deal with the logistics issues inherent in people coming in from 3 different cities. She might not think she did much, but she really helped to put us at ease as we dealt with all of the challenges we had with our trip.
My wife and I noticed her other mid-century home listing and we're already talking about possibly staying there in the future for another little getaway from the big city."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough good things about Barb and The Century House. We had an unforgettable weekend there! The house and property are immaculate and the owner's attention to detail is simply outstanding! The house had all the amenities you could possibly need and she even gave us a quick tour to explain the history of the house and how much work they've put into it. Barb was very kind and hospitable and quick to respond to messages. She truly deserves the title of ""super host""! The house is also in a great location. It's only a few miles from a cute downtown area and other local attractions. We enjoyed our stay so much that we are already planning our trip back next year. I highly recommend anyone to stay with Barb and don't forget to say hi to the chickens and cattle!!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,We couldn't have had a better experience staying at Jim and Barb's farmhouse. They are just the best. The coffee cake is out of this world. Not to mention Jim let me help him feed his steers. The home is very warm and cozy. It's just a little piece of heaven in Ashland ohio. We were truly blessed to be able to stay at their home. You can't go wrong with them as your host. 🐄🧡
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"Barb & Jim did a wonderful job hosting us. The place was so cute, clean and cozy. Barb met me there and gave us a walk through of the house.

2021-09-01,5,Group trip,Century House is our go-to place to stay when visiting family in Ashland. We have stayed there three times now so it feels like coming home when we arrive.

She goes out of her way to be accommodating and her welcome coffee cake is to die for!!
2021-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Century House is beautiful & very comfortable. Barb graciously welcomed us & left an absolutely delicious coffee cake for us. We loved the history & charm of the house. Convenient location with a bit of traffic noise but not a big issue. Would definitely stay again.

Thanks for having us!"
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"What a perfect stay we had for our family celebration!! Barb and Jim provided a wonderfully refurbished farmhouse with the backdrop of Ashland countryside!

Thank you for the coffee cake, Barb, and for being such wonderful hosts, you and your husband!!❤️"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Just Book It! You will not regret it at all. From the beautiful home to the amazing host and everything in between. We felt at home as soon as we arrived. We had plenty of room for our family of 7 and never felt like we were walking or sitting on top of each other. If we could have stayed for another week, I don’t think any of us would have been upset. We will most definitely be back in the future to stay again."

The location to downtown activity and the golf courses couldn’t have been better.
The house itself was top notch and the only thing that could have been better was the weather but the cake that Barb made for our arrival helped, delicious...!
We will be coming back for our next All Sports Challenge meeting..."
2021-04-01,5,Group trip,"We stayed at Barb’s place for a weekend with family and friends, and to watch our son play baseball at Ashland University (which was just minutes away). Barb is an outstanding host! She was so nice, had great communication, and gave us all kinds of information about the town and restaurants...so informative! And she met us at the house with the most delicious coffee cake! It was so thoughtful of her! Barb’s house was absolutely beautiful and so clean!

If you are in the Ashland area you must stay here...I strongly recommend it!"

2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely amazing! Just perfect! Everything you could want for a get away and more! The house is beautiful! Barb made us a coffee cake that was delicious! Everything was clean and all the supplies you needed! If we had any questions Barb got back to us right away. The barn with cows and chickens was great! The kids loved seeing them. Jim gave us a tour and was so friendly! They are both great people! There is a lot of cool things in the area too! We went snow tubing at Snow Trails, went to Lehman’s store which we loved (they have everything there), the Smuckers Store was not far and very cute, Grandpa Cheese Barn is close and amazing, Sweeties Chocolates is right next door with delicious chocolates, Beyond Measure Market has great Fry Pies, and a couple of us went to see where the Shawshank Redemption was filmed at the Ohio State Reformatory Museum. I can not wait to come back in the summer or fall and sit on the front porch swing! And I will be back for sure! Best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at! Just loved it so much! Thank you Barb and Jim!"

2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Made a last minute decision to have a socially distanced Thanksgiving away from it all and stumbled across The Century House. We had a lovely time in a lovely setting, as self-contained as we wanted it to be. There are two great parks for walking/running a few minute drive away, we got a fascinating tour of Jim's small-scale cattle operation, and enjoyed the best coffee cake I've ever had as a welcome gift from Barb. This was one of my best AirBnB experiences ever."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Barb and Jim are true Super hosts!!! We were greeted with a warm coffee cake and smiling faces! The house is beyond beautiful and the renovations are gorgeous! There were plenty of towels, sheets and blankets and pillows! The sunrise was breathtaking and it was so much fun to see the cows and chickens! We will definitely be staying again!"
2020-10-01,5,Group trip,"The was the best airbnb experience I have ever had. Barb was very kind and welcoming and supplied extra goods for our stay. The place was beautiful and cozy. The pictures do not do the house justice. If you're considering this location, I highly recommend it. We had a very large group and everyone was shocked by how nice the place was and how well it suited a large group. Also, Barb responds fast which is fantastic for figuring out plans. The place has everything you will need and makes the stay that much easier. Have fun with your stay here!"
2020-10-01,5,Group trip,"This place is NICE. They had everything. It’s stylish, cozy, and the welcome was as warm as it gets. It truly felt like home for the few days we were there. 10/10 would stay there again."
2020-10-01,5,Group trip,"Barb and Jim's place was fantastic - private, country feeling, but 5 minutes from the grocery store. Barb was incredibly receptive to questions and requests, and added the sweet extra touch of baking for us before we arrived. The house was remodeled beautifully - keeping some of the touches of the old, with an overall new farmhouse feel. And the spaces were quite large and fit our families well - both inside and outside."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Barb & Jim's farmhouse is delightful. They have lovingly renovated it with love. It is pristine & clean, and accommodated all of our needs for our stay.

2020-09-01,5,Group trip,"Hands down, one of the best!! The place was sparkling clean, spacious, and absolutely beautiful... and Barb was so kind and flexible.

Five stars for sure!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,It really is as great as the pictures look. Wonderful property and hosts.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Century Home. It was the perfect spot to rest and relax in between our rounds of golf.

We will definitely be staying there again sometime.
2020-08-01,5,Group trip,"Our two families stayed for nearly two weeks at the Farmhouse and loved it! We unfortunately had to work (remotely) while there, but there was plenty of room and excellent WiFi to support us. We'll be back!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A great place to stay when in Ashland. Start the morning sipping your coffee and eating the delicious coffee cake on the front porch swing or in the gazebo in the back yard. Comfy couch in the living room and even more comfy beds make you feel right at home, and Barb’s communication ensures you will have a great stay! We’ll definitely be back and will recommend to family and friends!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t say enough great things about our stay at Barb and Jim’s place. They were so accommodating when our other Airbnb fell apart at the last minute. The house is even more beautiful than the pictures show and was sparkling clean. The kids loved seeing the cows and even getting to help on the farm. We felt like we were staying with family! All in all, one of the best Airbnb experiences we’ve had. We will be back to stay with Barb and Jim again!"

2020-06-01,5,Group trip,"My daughter was married at Mohican Gardens and we rented the house for my daughter and her bridesmaids to stay the night before and day of the wedding. It was perfect! This is a beautiful and well cared for home. Barb was an exceptional host. We had to postpone the wedding earlier in April due to Covid 19. I am so appreciate of how barb worked with us through the process of rescheduling the wedding. Barb was attentive, kind and thoughtful."
2020-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is our families second stay at the Century House and talks are in the works for the third. Anything you can imagine that you may need is there. They make me want a farmhouse!! Dont hesitate at all to book with them.

2019-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"You will not want for anything with this rental. I am so use to packing half of my house and this trip didnt touch the items at all. Highly recommended, we will be back for sure."
2019-09-01,5,Group trip,Perfect place for our bridal party to get ready.
2019-09-01,5,Group trip,This is our second time staying at Century House. We love this updated spacious house set in a charming rural area. We had everything we needed for a comfortable stay for our entire family. Barb is an excellent host who quickly responded to all of my inquiries. We will definitely be back!
2019-07-01,5,Group trip,"Century House was nestled in a country setting but still close enough to run to a store if you needed anything that you forgot. Jim and Barb are great host, and house and property were beautiful. We enjoyed the fresh vegetables that were left on the steps, and the warm coffee cake was great!"
2019-07-01,5,Group trip,Farmhouse is Amazing! No expense has been sparred to renovate this place. We absolutely loved the place and our stay. Very tranquil!

See you again Next Year!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful, relaxing location with hosts who pay attention to detail."
2018-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Barb and Jim are amazing hosts. They greeted us at the house, gave us a tour of the property, then let us enjoy our stay. We had 7 adults and one child to attend the Pro Football Hall of Fame ceremony and there was plenty of space for everyone. From the lit up gazebo, sitting out on the front porch, and space for the my son to run around out back. They provided more than enough for us in the home from kitchenware to towels to bedsheets. And yes, Barb did make us a coffee cake which was absolutely delicious! We will definitely come visit again!"
2018-07-01,5,Group trip,I would recommend staying in their home. This place has been redone and decorated beautifully. Barb even made us a coffee cake! I had my rehearsal dinner here and my bridal party stayed the weekend. We loved the gazebo as well.
2018-07-01,5,Group trip,"The house is very comfortable. Stocked with plenty of kitchenware, utensils, spices, dinnerware. Weather permitting, sitting in the gazebo or front porch is very relaxing.
Very close, are places to buy any supplies you might need.
Barb will greet you and go over everything. Then, leave you to enjoy the home.
Check the chicken pen for eggs. Say hello to the cows.
Places to visit and places to eat brocheurs are provided.
The Pine Tree Barn and Kingwood Garden center are close by and worth the trip."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Barb and Jim are some of the nicest people we have ever met. From the moment you meet Barb and Jim, you feel as though you are a part of their family. Their house is very clean and full of charm. There are plenty of towels and bed linens, as well as a fully stocked kitchen. We will definitely stay at their house every time we go to Ohio."
2018-07-01,5,Group trip,Owners of the property take pride of all aspects. They treat the property as if it was there own living space. We will book our next stay with Barb.
2018-06-01,5,Group trip,"If you are looking for a a peaceful and secluded space, nestled in a peaceful environment, to share with friends and family this is your place! The Century home is clean, well cared for and stocked with everything needed to make your stay comfortable. The homemade coffee cake is to die for!"
2018-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great home for a family reunion! Beautiful, serene, clean and cozy. Wonderful hospitality and country feeling with the cows, chickens, gardens, flowers, homemade coffee cake and gorgeous space to dine and share great conversations in. Much appreciation to Barb and Jim for the wonderful work they have put into restoring this house. It is a lovely country homestead!"
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Century House is a beautiful and well-appointed as the photos promise. There were seven of us, all adults, in the area for our son's graduation. The farm was a cool, green and shady respite from the all the on-campus activities. The house and grounds are comfortable and everything in the house is in splendid working order. And Barb's coffee cake is unbeatable! I fully recommend staying here."
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, comfortable, immaculate home. Gracious hostess and host. Great place for a family get together."
2017-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The perfect place for our holiday visit to Ashland! Very clean and thoughtful touches galore. The coffee cake waiting for our arrival was described as the ""best I've ever eaten""."
2017-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Barb and her husband Jim were so friendly and welcoming, it was almost like being greeted by family. The house was lovely, clean, comfortable and so cozy for us. We were so happy to come home to it everyday. I highly, highly recommend it if you are in the area!"
2017-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect location for our family Thanksgiving and celebration of my granddaughter's 5th birthday! It is comfortable and beautiful inside and out and the special touches Barb provided (wonderful coffee cake, stocked staples, supplies and cookware, a lovely note and gift for my granddaughter's birthday and fresh flowers) made our stay even better. The house (beautifully decorated!) and grounds are really lovely and we all enjoyed the peace and quiet of sitting on the enclosed porch looking for deer in the fields and walking just behind the house to see the chickens. Barb and Jim were so welcoming and gracious- the perfect hosts!"
2017-11-01,5,Stayed one night,This is one of the most beautiful and peaceful Air B&B locations I have ever visited. Secluded enough to relax but close enough to local food and shops if we needed to grab something. Everything about this home was a delight - including the hosts.
2017-10-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful home. You will instantly love it. I wasn't sure I could get my wife to leave. We had a group of 8. Plenty of space for all. Barb and Jim made this stay perfect. We arrived to a delicious cake and info on a local church we wanted to attend. They are the ideal hosts. We will be back!!
2017-10-01,5,Group trip,Barb and Jim are excellent hosts. Century House was a delight to find. Property is lovely this time of year (Fall) and the house is beautifully appointed and extremely clean. We loved sitting on the front porch in the morning and in the gazebo in the evening. Hope to stay here again if we find ourselves in the Ashland area in the future.
2017-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,A wonderful place. Still great in it's 101st year. See Marion's May 2016 review.
2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a lovely, restful, beautiful place to stay while in the Ashland area, Century House is your home away from home. The accommodation were clean, cheerful and very spacious. This historical home has been expertly renovated with up to date features while still preserving the original charm to the old home. The host, Barb and Jim , were extremely helpful in all of our communication and were very welcoming and helpful while checking in. I would highly recommend staying at this beautiful home. We certainly will be gong back.

2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at the Century House very much! It was a lovely renovated farmhouse, great for a weekend away for a group of people. Everything was extremely clean and just as it is in the photos."
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was an amazing place to stay! I thought it was even better in person. We stayed and went canoeing in Mohican which was only an easy 20 minute drive. The cabins in Mohican don't even compare to this farmhouse.
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, secluded but close to shopping as well!!! Quiet and cozy!!! Couldn't ask for more!!! Wonderful host!!! Will be back!!!"
2017-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Century House was beyond incredible. The hosts, Jim and Barb Chandler were so kind and accommodating. Barb even made her famous cinnamon coffee cake, which was to die for. My family and I spent a lovely weekend there while attending my sister's wedding. Everything was clean and beautifully kept. I would absolutely recommend this house to anyone interested in staying in the area."
2017-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our time in Ashland at the Century House exceeded all expectations in every way. The house is charming, spotless, spacious and beautifully decorated. The warm homemade coffee cake was an unexpected treat and everyone who tried it said it was the best they've ever had. The owners are the most lovely and gracious couple who could not have been more welcoming and accommodating. We are still talking about our stay and how fantastic it was. The gardens, chickens and steer were also fun and added to the wonderful experience. Thank you Barb and Jim - we will be back!!"
2017-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Century House was exactly what we wanted and what was described in its profile. It was so peaceful and thoughtfully designed. The hosts were attentive and they made sure we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. If we ever make it back to Ohio, this is where we will stay!"
2017-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You can't go wrong here. Our family had a great time relaxing and spending time together at the Farmhouse. Nice place to find some peace and quiet. There's a great little library of classic books if you happen to need something to read. Jim and Barb were great hosts, and if you're lucky like us -- you'll be welcomed with a pan of fresh homemade coffee cake on the kitchen counter!"
2017-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Century Farmhouse exceeded all expectations. The house was even nicer than the pictures (which were also very nice) and it met our large groups very picky requests. The communication was great from the time of booking all the way through check-out. We couldn't have asked for better hosts for our NYE getaway.
2016-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our experience at Century was amazing. We have stayed in many guest houses over the years and been hosts ourselves and this was the most professional experience we have had. Someone's been reading e-myth. We've stayed there twice in the last year and will be coming back for sure.
2016-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pre-stay: Barb was easy to work with, quick to reply, and accommodating in every way.

Stay: The Century House was so nice - cozy with character and charm. We could tell Jim was proud of the work he did to restore the home, and rightly so. It was lovely to stay in a home with history AND all the modern conveniences! It was private, but the hosts were accessible for anything we needed. We enjoyed talking to Jim about the farm while he was at the barn, but he was never intrusive.

Barb and Jim clearly put a lot of thought into making this a welcoming and comfortable place to stay, from the games in the living room to children's books in the bunk room. Barb left a delicious coffee cake, as well as items to get us started in the kitchen.

We were in town for a family wedding, and we took advantage of the setting for the kids to run around (our 15 mo old son loved the cows), as well as the grill for a family dinner after the wedding (13 people).

Jim was responsive to question while we were on site, and went above and beyond when my husband realized he left his suit pants at home within an hour before the wedding(!!!). Without hesitation, Jim offered to help, and luckily they were close in size!

We highly recommend the Century house!"
2016-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay!
We would highly recommend this place!
Nothing negative!"
2016-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Barb and Jim were absolutely fantastic. From the beginning of our communication they were so warm and kind and could not have been better hosts. We rented the house for our wedding party to stay in for our wedding weekend as a thank you to them from traveling from all over the US to be in our wedding. It was wonderful to have the century house as our home base for the weekend. Barb left us a delicious coffee cake that was perfect for us girls Saturday morning while getting ready for the wedding. We fell in love with house right away and honestly my husband and I wish we could buy it! The house does not disappoint and neither did our hosts. We loved every minute of our time there!
2016-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow , if I could rate this a six star I would. Barb and Jim were there to welcome us. Made us feel like we were home! The farmhouse is modernized, tastefully decorated. It was oWe had just ridden our bikes 75 miles for a fundraiser. Barb and Jim greeted us warmly. She had made us a snack and had stocked the fridge with energy drinks for the ride back our son-in laws birthday and we had cake out in the gazebo. The setting is peaceful and tranquil. We will be back!"
2016-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an absolutely lovely time! The hosts responded promptly to communication before hand and then Jim was incredibly friendly and helpful when we got there. The house was beautiful and surpassed the pictures! The coffee cake was a wonderful surprise. It was the perfect environment to catch up with friends! Such a blessing to all of us! I highly recommend the place and know we hope to go back!
2016-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Words can not express how wonderful this place is, and how it met our needs perfectly. Barb and Jim were fantastic hosts and made us feel so welcomed. The Farm House is exquisite, inside and out. The beautiful woodwork coupled with a modern kitchen, laundry room and bath made this a gorgeous home (it exceeds the nice pictures in the listing). I had family in from the west coast for a wedding and this was the perfect place to congregate as a family and relax. Some of the ""west coasters"" have never seen fireflies and were enchanted by the light show in the fields across from the house. The gazebo became the favorite place to hang out in the evening because of this. The house had everything we needed, just as if we were in our own home. As someone who uses AirBnB often, this was one of the best AirBnB experiences. We will be back when the next child gets married (soon, I hope!)."
2016-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this house - it was the right amount of historic charm with modern features and very spacious for a group or family. Barb made us a delicious coffee cake (still warm) upon our arrival and Jim took the time to teach us about the baby cows on the farm. We loved sitting in the Gazebo at night. Everything was supplied that we needed, tons of towels, fresh sheets if desired, blow up mattresses and even toothpaste for those in our group that forgot it. Beds were very comfortable and everyone slept well. It was close to grocery and amenities but also far enough out that you felt at peace in the country. Watching fields full of fireflies was magical here. Would really recommend this place - a lot of love and care was put into making it a wonderful retreat and the hosts are magnificent."
2016-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Century House is an absolutely amazing property. You get a feel for it from the photos but once you drive up is when you truly realize the effort and detail they put into the renovation and comfort of your stay. It was the perfect place for a wedding we were part of in Ashland. Barb was very responsive and gracious in every way. The location is secluded with a great view but only minutes from Ashland. We will certainly be back.
2016-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Definitely one our best AirB&B experiences!! Jim and Barb were warm and welcoming. Jim and a still warm coffee cake baked by Barb greeted us upon arrival. The farmhouse has a been tastefully refinished and is meticulously clean. A wonderful place to stay as we celebrated our son's graduation from The College of Wooster. Thanks so much!!
2016-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our family had a very pleasant three-night stay at Barb and Jim’s beautifully restored 100 year-old farmhouse when we returned to Ashland for a family celebration. The house is lovely and relaxing and it was spacious even for our party of six adults. We enjoyed using the large and attractive downstairs rooms—the kitchen, dining room, living room, and front porch. The views from the house are expansive across rolling farmlands and picturesque, such as the red barn in the early morning light. We watched a fox cross the road in front of our group as we sat on the covered porch one evening. We are fortunate to have stayed in this wonderful house and would highly recommend it. The property has very good access to Ashland and Mansfield. And Barb and Jim were perfect hosts."
2015-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jim and Barb were wonderful hosts who welcomed us in their beautifully renovated house at short notice. We needed a place for our Thanksgiving gathering and didn't know what to expect. This home did not disappoint! The home was above our expectations and provided everything we needed. Barb presented our family with a delicious coffee cake upon arrival. Jim and Barb went out of their way to ensure our stay would be relaxing and peaceful. Cooking Thanksgiving dinner was very easy in this home that included a fully loaded kitchen. It was clean and very spacious. This home was truly an amazing place to stay as it captured the essence of a Century home with its original architecture and charm. I especially enjoyed the morning views from the beautifully screened in porch. I enjoyed looking out into the pasture from the windows that surrounded this beautiful home. It was fun to be able to pet the cows adjacent to the property. Something I'm sure my family will remember for a very long time. The swing that hung inside the porch provided the ambiance of country life in this very exquisite home. To sum up our stay in only one word, it would be peaceful! I would highly recommend this home for your next getaway or romantic excursion."
2015-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"When we pulled into the driveway at the Century House, we knew it would be difficult to leave. Walking in the back door, we immediately felt at home. My husband loves to cook, and our girls and I enjoy baking. We were pleased to discover the kitchen at this rental house to be well-appointed. Our daughters were excited to find the bookshelves lined with classics, and the cabinets full of games. They couldn’t wait to sleep in the bunk bed room!

Mr. and Mrs. Chandler had written a list of “Things To Do” in and around Ashland during our stay. There was an incredibly delicious homemade coffee cake on the counter, and it was a blessing not to have to worry about breakfast for the first morning of our stay.

The front porch offers a peaceful setting to unwind and watch the sunset. It’s also the perfect place to watch the sun rise over the cornfields and gear up for the day. We could have spent hours watching the calves in the farmyard, a welcome escape from our busy life in a more urban area.

Thank you, Chandlers, for providing us a home away from home. We will return soon!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic stay! Great apartment with amazing hosts. Right next to all the downtown restaurants and boutiques. Will definitely stay again!

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful stay at this convenient downtown location. The apartment itself is unique with its sports theme, beautifully decorated, and well-stocked to anticipate your every need. Coffee, restaurants and shopping are just outside the building’s front door. On top of all of this, Joe and Brittany were phenomenal hosts - super responsive and welcoming. 5 stars and will absolutely stay here again during our next visit!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,love this place 2nd time staying. remember there are stairs but worth every step.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and quiet place. Lots to do in the area as well.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"THE most unique Air BNB we have ever stayed in. We came into town for a softball tournament, only for it to be cancelled due to bad weather. My daughter was super bummed, but that all changed when we walked into the Board Room! We had an absolutely fantastic time without even having to leave the apartment!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful property! We loved everything about it!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space is nothing short of AMAZING. It's a little bit of adventure to get up the steps to the doorway but once you open the door, your mouth will drop on how awesome this space feels, how it's decorated, and just feeling like you are truly in a hidden gem in Ashland. My daughter and I came for a college visit and we felt on cloud 9 coming back and forth downtown so close to campus. The downtown area is phenomenal and with the space having a unique rooftop view its one of the coolest experiences. Will make this our go to Air BnB if our daughter goes to school here."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Boardroom was clean and cozy. We were very comfortable and will stay here again when in town. Restaurants within walking distance.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb was an amazing experience and the highlighT of our trip! We were not expecting it to be such a large space considering it’s reasonable price but when we arrived we were blown away by how amazing it was! The welcome gifts were so great and the binder left for us to read was full of fun activities in the area, restaurants and even a list of their top recommendations. It also had great details on instructions of how to use all the cool things it came with and how to take good care of the Airbnb so it stayed in good shape once we were done with our stay. Even the response time from the owners was on point and they were so helpful and understanding! We will definitely be coming back to stay in this airbnb"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,it was alot of fun. great location.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We've had the good fortune of staying in fantastic Airbnbs at tourist hot spots around the world, but it was at Joe's place in Ashland, OH that we encountered the best combination of creativity and functionality. Everyone loved the sports bar theme, but it was the attention to detail that made the place great; they had every accessory we could think of, all the way down to clips for the potato chips."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place is an amazing gem in Ashland! you would never know it's there from the street. Great quality place (towels, bedding, details, etc.) Will be staying here again when we have to come to the college for things."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The house was in a great location, spacious and comfortable. Host was very responsive."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Talk about a host who has thought of EVERYTHING before you can even think of it yourself. The Cape Cod on Broad was stocked with toiletries, appliances, coffee, creamer, snacks, dog treats, extra blankets, toys for kids, even flossers for your teeth! Being able to have a nice weekend at a cute house that is dog friendly where the host has literally thought of everything you could need (and then some) was a total treat. We didn't know about Ashland, OH before and are very glad to have become acquainted. This was a great base for my husband's ultramarathon race in Mohican State Forest - especially since we could have our pooches with us and have room to spread out. Beds were comfortable, house is super cute, and Ashland was a very nice, pretty, and peaceful surprise."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great stay! Very nice and updated on the inside! So many extras! Nice quiet location! Close to everything. Excellent host! Highly recommend staying here!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very clean, cozy home . My family and I felt right at home"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay and the place was very well kept. Host left lots of little treats and the kids liked the treats a lot…
Nice touch!!
Tons of beds, enough for a small army!!
I would rent this place again, if we head back to Ashland
Thanks for the Great stay!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Loved it! What a wonderful pet-friendly cottage. It’s cozy, extremely clean, and Lauren has thought of everything. We stayed for just over a week to attend track meets and graduation at Ashland. This place is in the perfect location and was absolutely lovely. The bathroom is exceptional compared to many vacation rentals. The bed was very comfortable. The washer and dryer in the basement was a bonus. We commented often during our stay how much we enjoyed this home."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Very nice, appeared to be recently updated. Plenty of space for a large group."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"House was clean and very cozy. Location was great, easy to get everywhere we needed to go"

2024-03-01,5,Group trip,very good place
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Family stay to visit family. Quiet neighborhood. Nice to have fenced in back yard for our Griff. Plenty of beds and space for four of us. The kitchen was well stocked with extras and snacks. Nice touches in the bathroom. Will definitely return for future visits! Even walked to downtown to watch the St. Patrick’s parade.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great host great house close to everything host was extremely helpful and accommodating would highly recommend stay here we will be back thank you again Billy
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, great space, felt right at home."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lauren was incredibly communicative and helpful. The home was warm and comfortable. I appreciate the cleanliness and thoughtful considerations like the toys and popsicles for the children. We had a great time visiting family.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I booked this house for my mom, sister, my daughter and her friend. They were in town to see a play at Ashland University that my son was in. The house was perfect and had everything they needed. The location was fantastic, so close to everything they were doing while in town. Thanks for everything!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were a little reluctant because we had never rented an Airbnb before. Lauren’s place was very clean, comfortable and inviting. She had so many small conveniences like snacks, coffee, toys and games for the kids. that made you feel so at home. I would recommend her place to anyone. If I ever need a place to stay in Ashland again I would choose her Airbnb. Our children and grandchildren visited us there and they were all so impressed. Thank you so much for all the small detailed things, to many to mention. A 10 out of 10."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very beautiful place close to Ashland University! Has it’s own private driveway! Beautifully decorated and a great host! Will definitively stay again! Loved everything about it!
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Lauren thought of everything for this house. She was very responsive and it was easy to check in and check out. We had 8 adults in this house and it was more than enough space. I would definitely stay again and recommend to anyone in the area .
2023-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The Cape Cod definitely deserves five stars out of five stars. It is a charming place to stay. It is very clean, well decorated, and well supplied. It is the perfect place to be when visiting students at Ashland University, attending functions at Ashland University, or visiting family in Ashland. Lauren is a great host. She is caring and very willing to please. The extra touches supplied were fantastic."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved staying at the little white house. The location was perfect-close to Ashland University and 18 minutes to Mansfield. We most appreciated the size of the bedrooms and clear check in/out directions. HIGHLY reccomend!
2024-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"We found the main bed a bit difficult. I believe it was a temperpedic but we sunk into it and had some trouble getting out. We just weren't used to that kind of mattress. Thankfully, there were other beds more comfortable.
Price seems a bit high for the area."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean home! Several hours after checking out I had mentioned I may need the home one more night. Bryan was extremely helpful and communicated with me to see what I may need …above and beyond and appreciated!!
2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,Just a really minor hiccup with getting in -but owner showed up in minutes and fixed it. Extremely clean and well appointed great location good price looking forward to coming back in the near future.
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,House worked perfectly for us for our visit. I wish we had found you earlier in our daughter’s time at Ashland University - we would have been regulars!!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I came to Ashland to visit my brother and sister in law who are professors at the university, and my new twin nieces!! Bryan’s place was clean and comfortable and in walking distance of their house. It was perfect and I will hopefully be back soon!!"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,was just like the pictures and description would definitely book again sometime!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bryan and Jennifer’s beautifully decorated home was both cozy and surprisingly spacious. The kitchen was well stocked for making and serving meals, and the bathroom was spotless. A much better deal than renting two hotel rooms in Ashland. Thanks for the great stay! We have already booked another weekend here as it’s such a great home base for visiting local family."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a great stay-it was spacious and clean. Just what we needed!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Bryan was courteous and kind, and very responsive to our needs. We are in Ashland several times a year, so we will visit this home again. Thank you for a lovely stay! :)"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very clean and nice home! I didn’t see any dust at all and everything was spotless. Wonderful hosts who were clear on check in and out. Would definitely stay again!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"A great place to stay. The whole place was very clean. The kitchen was well supplied with utensils, drinking vessels etc and small appliances. There was even a piano in the living room!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Way better than staying in a hotel for graduation! If you’re coming to Ashland, stay here, you’ll be glad you did."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always a great place to stay when we are in Ashland.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable and pretty, you can immediately see that Abigail put a lot of effort in to creating a charming, welcoming home for you to enjoy. There was plenty of space, and clear instructions were easy to follow. I would recommend this site to anyone looking for easy comfort and quiet surroundings in a great location in Ashland."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place with comfortable beds and a great host.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a great place to stay at! We have two small children who are 6, and 4. Abigail made sure we had baby gates for our youngest. Everything was very clean and organized. We will definitely be staying again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The house is fantastic, very comfortable, felt right at home."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location in my childhood neighborhood! Very walkable to the University, Center St Historic district and downtown. Very tidy and clean too."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Charming and well maintained older home nestled in a convenient location. Very clean and host is super responsive! We will be back!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was the second time we stayed here and we will stay again. Great location and great house. Thanks again
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed being in the heart of Ashland. The house is easily accessible and has lovely, warm, and welcoming decor."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We felt immediately at home upon arrival at The Adeline. The place met our expectations set by the listing details and photos and the little thoughtful details through the house were beyond expectation. We were in town for a nearby family reunion and were sad that we didn’t have a lot of time to stay in and relax at the house. The coffee bar area was amazing with offerings of coffee, tea, and hot cocoa. The kitchen and dining area were spacious and welcoming if you want to cook and dine in home. The jetted tub was the cherry on top. We would love to stay here again when we are back in town and hopefully plan some extra down time to spend relaxing. We did not travel with children but I wanted to make sure to add that this place is perfect if you are traveling with a small child. Baby gates, the backyard, a child’s bedroom with adorable decor, child toilet seats installed within adult seats, etc. That was amazing to see."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Abigail was wonderful and very accommodating.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very cute, clean, and beautiful home! Perfect for a couple night stay!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay with no complaints
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I really enjoyed staying at Abilgail's place. The home was clean, well furnished, and very comfortable. We visited with a 1 year old, and we really appreciated having the baby gates and baby-related supplies in the home. The home really helped make our visit to Ashland great."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cute and cozy house in Ashland. Conveniently located. My daughter and I stayed for a month as we wrapped up construction on our new home. The only issue we had was the Nest thermostat defaulting the AC temp to 75 every night. This made for some warm mornings upstairs. Otherwise, an easy and great stay. Abby was a great host. Very clean and as described/expected."
2023-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,Abigail was very responsive to questions and answered promptly. The home had baby gates and a crib room which work great for us since we were there with our twin granddaughters. The lock on the door didn't open the first time but she did warn me so it was fine. The only inconvenience was the only shower is on the first floor and the bedrooms are upstairs. There is a nice bathroom on the second floor with a jacuzzi tub which I am sure is nice for some visitors although we did not use it. There is a swing set in the back which was also nice for us. Abigail did allow us to have an early check in which we appreciated. I would stay there again if I was in Ashland.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed at this house for 5 days and it was great. We loved walking around the neighborhood. It is close to downtown and restaurants and it is walking distance from the university. The house was very clean and had everything we needed. Abigail was very helpful and responded right away when we had questions. Would definitely stay here again
2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"My wife and I would like to thank the hosts for making us feel truly at home. The host spared no effort in keeping everything very clean and tidy. Very cozy house and cozy little details, such as having left the heater on when we arrived and a blanket on the couch. The inconvenient little details like a shower only downstairs or the lack of covered parking available were surpassed by the host's willingness to make us feel at home, always very solicitous, quick in responding to messages, and with clear and direct instructions. We will certainly be staying there at a future opportunity."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My wife and I stayed a week at the Adeline and felt right at home. The location of the house was close to downtown (~3 min drive) and right up the street from a CVS and a very short drive to a park. The location would be very walkable during the warmer months - we stayed here over Christmas.
What we liked most about the Adeline was that it felt like we were at home. A true home away from home. The house was fully equipped, well stocked, and nicely decorated. The house was very clean and has a mud room - which was very helpful for our winter stay.
The house was also very kid/toddler friendly. There was child proofing (locks on cabinets, toilet training seats, plug covers) throughout the house. We do not have a toddler, so these features weren’t particularly helpful for us, but the child proofing did not cause an inconvenience.
The host was very communicative. She answered questions in a timely manner and gave recommendations for local spots.
Looking forward to staying here again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was a fantastic place to stay. It's my first time booking an AirBnB, only my 2nd time staying in one, and it was as smooth and wonderful as it could be. We loved having the pool table. It also felt like you constantly had choices: which shower you preferred, which room to watch TV in, or place to sit outside. You never felt 'stuck' or like you were having to 'settle' for something.
Hosts were extremely helpful and responsive. The space was clean, and had everything you'd need to stay for the entire week. It felt more like a home than a rental for sure. I would highly recommend this space and if we return the area next year it's top of my list to book!
Thanks for a great memorable, retro-week!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Everything was perfect. We hope to stay again soon.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, fun place. Weve already booked our next stay at The Rambler!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was such a joy to stay in this place. Happy colors and fun art to look at everywhere. The place was very spacious and the woods behind the yard were beautiful. We stayed for the solar eclipse and it was such a magical experience, made even better by thoughtfully designed surroundings. Aubrey was responsive and even offered to send back a beloved stuffy that one of the kiddos in our party left behind. Highly recommend!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Rambler was a great place for our family of 7--plenty of space, and things to do while we were visiting. Directly in the backyard is a path to Freer Field, which contains both paved and unpaved walking paths, and a small creek to explore. Our time at the AirBNB was during a time when we were displaced from our home due to a basement with water, so we were already familiar with the area. The home was spotless, and felt like home to us during an otherwise chaotic time in our lives, especially with 5 young children. Aubrey was very responsive to messages, and was flexible with extending check-in/out times as well as extending our stay when the cleaning/restoration project was occurring in our home. We have already recommended Aubrey's place to others, and will be back again should we ever need it (or have out of town visitors needing a space).
Thank you so much, Aubrey!"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Aubrey's place was perfect for our group of 7. The great room was definitely a good place to gather and hang out. Aubrey was very responsive. Would love to be back.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best places we’ve stayed in a while. Better than the description and photos. Hosts were excellent. Place was so quiet with paths to the park right in the back yard. Robes, they had robes! Such a nice touch. Many nice touches. We’ll definitely be back."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Audrey was a wonderful host. We enjoyed our stay very much!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We hosted a small family Christmas get-together and the Rambler was the perfect spot for it - plenty of space, lots to do, and everything needed. This was our third visit to the Rambler and I can’t imagine that it will have been our last."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,What a wonderful home. My employees were very comfortable here. The hostess is so kind and responsive. We couldn’t have asked for anything more!!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay at the Rambler and we will soon enjoy a third. It is very comfortable and Aubrey is a great host!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A group of old friends stayed at The Rambler for a wedding and it couldn't have been more perfect. Everything was exactly as advertised and we just had a great time.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay at Aubrey’s place. It literally was like something out of a trendy Palm Springs retro home with the coolest furniture & decorations. Every detail of the home was well thought out and there was so much to do. The pool table was such a fun time for our family, as well as the game room. We loved the turquoise appliances in the kitchen and the orange leather couch. My 17 year old said he wants to live in a cool place like that when he’s older! The little downtown was only about a mile away with super cute restaurants and shops. And if you like to golf, there is a beautiful course right across the neighborhood. Cannot say enough wonderful things about the place!"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,The place was awesome. Nice area and very cool aesthetically. We will definitely keep in mind going forward!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in Ashland to attend a function for our daughter at Ashland University. We had family members coming to town to join us. This location offered us a beautiful home to stay and we enjoyed the fire pit outside in the backyard. There is beautiful walking trails behind the house, the backyard itself is gorgeous and the house is spectacular. It’s a beautiful ranch home very spread out large rooms and spacious. The kitchen is very well appointed and it allowed us to cook in the home. We had fun with family with the pool table could play music and we use the garage so we were able to store our bikes and use the provided bikes to Ride around the neighborhood. The neighborhood is incredibly peaceful with beautiful homes, so it was fun to just walk around and enjoy the area. We will definitely be staying the next time we come to Ashland! Absolutely a winner you will not be disappointed."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Aubrey’s place was amazing! We had a group of four and there was so much space. The living room and kitchen was such a vibe! Place was clean and the outdoor area was peaceful.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,A wonderful place for my family to relax during our week in Ashland. Plenty of space to spread out and play outside.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Not only did the photos match what we found when we arrived, the space was even bigger than I imagined!

2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Amazing home loved the house and the back yard was awesome as well.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family and I really enjoyed the property. It was so clean and everyone (4 kids/4 adults) had plenty of room to have our own sleeping areas and to spread out. This place was so beautiful! The backyard area was pristine and the family had plenty of room to run around back there. There was also plenty of seating outdoors as well as a fire pit to use. We really enjoyed the playlist for the Rambler. The board games in the house were a big hit as well as the pool table. The kitchen and dinning area were spacious and we enjoyed using the laundry areas as well as the many sitting areas. This is a great place and you won't regret staying here!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really nice house and good area.

2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"What an amazing place! The 3 bedrooms are in one wing of the house, and the great kitchen, dining room and family room are in another, so it's a great layout. We were in town for my mother's birthday, and it was the perfect place for family to gather over brunch and relax in the evenings playing pool and board games.
We will definitely be back!!"
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"Hidden gem! This house was perfect for our family stay in Ashland! It truly is a fun house with so many things to do (games, pool table, smart tv, hiking trails in the back yard and outdoor areas to enjoy)! The 60's vibe made offered a neat theme. It is in a quiet, beautiful neighborhood as well! Fun seeing all the Christmas decorations in the house, neighborhood and city of Ashland! Beds were very comfortable! Music room was my favorite room to relax in, but the game room is where my family hung out most of the time. Kitchen & dining area were perfect and clean! So many things provided! We could make meals or sit down with carry out. Loved the coffee station area! Radiant heated floors in several of the rooms was a nice bonus! You won't find a better host than Aubrey! She spoiled us with her quick responses, and true concern for us to enjoy our time at The Rambler. We will definitely be trying to stay here again!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very fun home on a beautiful, quiet, kid friendly street. The home was a lot of fun with neat decorations in each room.

The freezer is a little small. We brought an extra cooler to put our beer and drinks in. The music room was so nice. Our daughter was playing the grand piano. The decor is very fun and retro. The pool table and texas holdem was fun for all. We used the outdoor firepit the first night. It burns wood very efficiently. Our adult kids had a great time throwing the football and frisbee. The yard is a very big size. I would stay here again and we all truly enjoyed it."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The neighborhood is extremely quiet! There was a two day bike race the last weekend but it didn't affect our stay at all!

From inside to outside lots of space to relax or play after a day of hiking at the National Park, or at Nickle Plate Beach, or at Cedar Point...all under an hour drive. Perfect hub and spoke location for lots of activities. Aubrey was an outstanding host and has given lots of thought to the little touches that make your stay even better.

2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"The house was exceptionally clean, the beds were all made-up so nicely (crisp, super clean sheets!), lots of towels, and the house was nice and cool when we arrived. The kitchen had everything we needed. My family loved the decor and enjoyed their stay very much. Because we were in the area for a family members wedding, we weren't able to thoroughly enjoy everything the house offers - maybe next time! Oh and we had the added pleasure of a hot air balloon landing in the front yard - so exciting! Excellent home. Excellent host. Thank you, Aubrey!"

I hope to return in the future with my whole fam.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Rambler is amazing and even more so than the photos. The kitchen is fitted with everything and great quality throughout the home.
Beds were super comfy (we had them put the twins together in both bedrooms to make king beds for the two couples who stayed.)
And, lots of seating throughout the place made it cozy.
With cold snowy weather, the radiant heat under the floors felt wonderful!
We also enjoyed the views out back into the park. Would have love to walk through there if it were warmer.
Aubrey and cohosts were very accommodating and communication was perfect.
Our family traveled from afar to celebrate our mothers 95th birthday at a local assisted living facility, so this was the perfect spot.
The Rambler is a very special home."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Super fun house with amazing decor! Everyone has a great time playing pool, cards, and doing puzzles. We also saw deer and foxes in the back!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay at this pretty and unique home during January when it was snowing. Our boys had fun sledding in the park right behind the house and the big windows offered wonderful views of the snow falling. The heated floors were a wonderful surprise along with the coffee and snacks provided by the host.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is a house of love, connection, creativity and harmony. My extended family of cousins booked this home specifically to be able to enjoy its amenities (pool table, games, spaciousness, record player, artful retro decor) as a way to bond together while remembering a beloved family member. That's a big role for a house to fill, and this house filled it perfectly. We had the chance (by chance) to meet Aubrey in person, and she shared that they had created this home specifically to bring groups of people warmly together. It's so much so; everything about our stay was clear, clean, easeful, and reliable, with swift communication and attention. Aubrey, thank you for making a difference for our family at a very special time."

2021-11-01,5,Group trip,"The house is perfect and exactly as advertised. It was spacious enough to share time with my family and full of fun activities from the pool table, trails to walk, and card games. This place met our expectations and then some!!"
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,Great home we’ll kept
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"Wow, the Rambler was an incredible stay! Very spacious, and comfortable. It was used for a wedding weekend and fit our needs perfectly, both indoors and outdoors. The beautiful backyard had a trail that led to great walking trails in a county park right behind the house that was enjoyed for some peace and quiet. We loved this house and highly recommend it. No more weddings in our family but we will find another reason to come enjoy this house and surroundings again. Thank you, Aubrey!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We would highly recommend the Rambler. It was a place that we were able to re-connect. There were so many thoughtful touches indoor and out. I would 100% stay there again!

2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"I can see why Barb and Jim’s mid-century home has a perfect 5-star rating. This is absolutely one of the best Airbnb’s I’ve stayed in. Not many places turn out to be as clean, lovely, and spacious as the photos — this one did. I booked this a year in advance so my family could see the eclipse. It was the perfect homebase for our dinners, game nights, and restful sleep. We watched the eclipse right from the house! It was my parents’ first Airbnb stay, and I wanted it to be a positive experience for them. They were absolutely blown away by how beautiful the space is and how caring and responsive Barb and Jim are. (One thing for future guests to know is that the roads by the house are not very walkable because of the lack of shoulder, but there are many other places to walk in nature a short drive away, such as Byers Woods.) All in all, if our travels bring us back to this area, we would absolutely stay here again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Barb’s place was absolutely beautiful! Felt right at home, thank you so much!"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Very beautiful home. Barb was a WONDERFUL HOST. Highly recommend

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Barb and Jim are amazing hosts. We were greeted upon arrival and given a tour of the home, fresh baked coffee cake and the option to purchase farm-fresh eggs from their local farm. This mid-century modern has been recently renovated and the décor fit the style of the home so well. The house was impeccably clean, well stocked with every possible gadget, and incredibly comfortable. If I could give Jim and Barb a rating of 10, I would. They truly made us feel at home and I look forward to our next visit!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a fabulous stay at the Half-Century home....The Chandlers are amazing hosts, very responsive with a highly personal touch. You feel like you're right at home!"

2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"This is everything you would want in a vacation rental! It looks exactly like the photos and is such a well designed aesthetic. I feel like the hosts provided everything you need to cook and relax and imagine it to be your home for a few days. It was a breath of fresh air to be surrounded by nature and not in a hotel. The back deck looks out over a beautiful field and is great for watching the sunrise in the mornings and chilling in the evenings. Barb responds right away to texts, so if you need anything, I'm sure she'll be available. She is a warm and welcoming host -even baking us a delicious coffee cake upon arrival. 5-star stay!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This home is everything you could want. It’s well stocked, close to town yet overlooking corn fields.

Can't want to stay at their home next time we're spending any time in around Mid Ohio!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Hands down best AirBB experience. The owner is exceptional. We felt very welcome. The property is clean and well maintained. Modern but comfortable furnishings. Intriguing art. It is designed and organized anticipating the needs of the guests. We ranged in age from 3–90 years old. Everyone was accommodated. We slept well and got to everything on time with its great location. It was only a few miles to an EV charging station. Perfect.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From the location, to the look. The friendliness, the hospitality. Barb and this home were nothing short of a pleasure! Well designed, clean and spacious, stocked with needed essentials—not to mention a beautiful outside space that’s perfect to take in a quiet moment. It’s not far from most of what you’ll need, which is a plus.
Barb welcomed us with a warm smile, a hand full of stories, and made us feel right at home. Couldn’t have hoped for a better stay."

2020-12-01,5,Group trip,The perfect home to stay in!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,We spent a magical week during Thanksgiving 2020 at the Mid Century House. It was a welcome respite from the stresses of the year and life. The house is every bit as stunning as the photos and larger and more spacious than what the photos depict. The decor is impeccable and the artwork thought provoking. Barb’s welcome coffee cake is the stuff of legends. The history of the house is also really interesting. We have family in the area and everyone had stories to share about the house. We felt like we were staying in an Ashland historical landmark!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful space with all the amenities that was perfect for a family gathering. Gorgeous views with a farm next door that the children loved. We are already looking forward to our next trip!

2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is so wonderful! I highly recommend. I stayed with two girlfriends for a little Mom's weekend away, and we had a fabulous time. Barb and Jim have thought of everything. There were flowers and coffee cake waiting for us, which were thoughtful (and delicious) touches. The rooms were incredibly comfortable. We loved that each of us had our own space in 3 rooms, but there is also plenty of room in this house for three couples or even a couple families with kids. I have little ones, and I even thought the laundry room could double as a room for a pack n play if you have a baby with you! Our plan was to hang at the house for a few days, relax, cook our own food, and enjoy some outdoor time. We did all of that, and more. The grocery store down the street was great. The kitchen had everything to make delicious meals. We went on a short hike nearby one day and visited the brewery downtown. Otherwise, we spent the whole time at this fabulous house. It was beautifully decorated and incredibly comfortable. I just cannot say enough good things about our stay. Just a great house and great experience!"

The house itself is very unique and spacious and has recently been redesigned and beautifully decorated by Barb & Jim. It is impeccably clean and has all cleaning supplies and equipment to keep tidy during your stay. The kitchen is well stocked and Barb was so kind to have made us a coffee cake upon our arrival which was delicious. The beds are extremely comfortable with high quality linens. We had so much fun playing all of our favorite childhood board games with our seven year old daughter.
We could not have chosen a better house in the peaceful countryside of Ohio. Thanks to Barb and Jim to hosting us."

Her home is in a beautiful, safe setting with a lake across the road and a barn and fields the view when you stand at the kitchen sink. Woke up to birds singing and wished that I had had time to go walking in the neighborhood. I arrived later than I had planned, and Diana left lights on for me! When I walked in I was greeted by a very clean, lovely home with treats on the table and basics like sugar, coffee, tea and bottled and filtered water available. There were plenty of clean towels and washcloths in the bath, as well as toiletry items in case you forget something.

Also convenient, only 6 or 7 miles from the town of Ashland. And she thought of everything, from note on the frig.

It was perfect for us. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"I would call this kind of a 2 bedroom mother-in-laws suite with it locate close but not connected to the main home.
Great value for the price, clean and roomy with well stocked kitchen with a few snacks and water provided.
Main bedroom matteress was extremely soft, second bedroom mattress was very firm so we had option of which type of mattress we preferred (soft).
Plenty of room, ROKU on very nice digital web based TV. Watched Super Bowl and picture was very clear.
Only drawback is bathroom is small with very small shower. I'm 5 ft 8 inches about 175 lbs and I felt it was a little to tight.
I would and do plan on staying here again.
It is a few miles outside of Ashland with downtown and the college about 4 miles or so away.
Highly recommend Diana's place if you are looking for something near Ashland."

2023-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We lived in Ashland for years, and the location was great in terms of getting into town and anywhere we wanted to go. Our main complaint was a huge stain on the sofa bed when we opened it up. We immediately pushed it back in and my son slept on the bed with my mom and me. There also were a few small stains on the blanket on the bed, so we removed that. There were crumbs in the sink when we arrived, which I cleaned up, and at one point, somebody was jiggling the doorknob into the apartment as if trying to get in - possibly a kid. I've stayed in numerous Airbnb's and cleanliness is my top thing by far, so this was a little disappointing."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Monica was a superior host, place was amazing,even had a ceiling vent fan and heater in the bathroom awesome 👍. Very comfortable clean, very great communications. Would definitely use her services again. Highly recommend."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is not a glamorous location, but it's clean, comfortable and quiet. Its on the edge of town, you could walk through neighborhood into town, or out into farm land.
We want to be in this area to visit family without imposing on them. We also wanted to be able to invite a couple of relatives over for a meal. (Ended up just going to a nice restaurant in the area).
Its likely we will visit again, depending on family situation."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second year in a row staying here so that we can attend the Prairie Peddler festival. The place was wonderful, and it was such a delight to be here a second time. It is always a nice place to stay and hopefully we will be back again next year!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved it...we were in town for a friend's wedding and Monica's place was about 15 minutes from the venue, so it was perfect. Bed was very comfortable, and the suite was spotless. Monica was very responsive to any questions and very helpful. We had no complaints at all. Will definitely stay here again when visiting our friends. I especially loved that there was a coffee maker that had both a carafe and a single serve."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Monica was a wonderful host! We needed extra flexibility with check-in timing and she was very accommodating.

Super friendly and accommodating. Would 100% recommend."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Monica is always a responsive and fantastic host. We needed an iron during our stay, and she dropped everything to have one dropped off. In the middle of a weekday. I wished all hosts were her."

2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay in Ashland and appreciated having a nice place to come back to relax and rest. It was easy to check in and find based on instructions, and it was a restful stay. Some of the amenities were a little dated (e.g. shower) and we wish we had control of the temperature at nighttime but couldnt find a thermostat in our unit. We would recommend this airbnb for others in the Ashland area!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Would stay again if I am in the area.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Clean and comfy
2023-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"The apartment was lovely- exactly as described/pictured. Parking and entering was easy and the bed was very comfortable. As others noted, it is on a busy road, so there is noise from the cars, and the wall between the apartment and the host’s house isn’t super noise proof. Their tv could be heard clearly in the apartment kitchen and I woke up to a screaming child. Still well worth the price vs a hotel room and nothing some ear plugs or white noise on a phone couldn’t fix."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent rental for my in-laws when they visited Ashland. They appreciated available coffee maker, two beds and a quiet home that made for a peaceful visit. Will rent again in future."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Monica was right on top of things. We being the seniors we are had a slight issue with getting in the door with such one tall step but when I mentioned it to her she had it covered before we got back the first evening. We will stay again. We felt right at home! Thank you Monica!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Great quiet place to stay. We stayed for just about 10 days and never had any issues.
Host was responsive and very helpful. Provided an extra space heater when temps got into the single digits but didn’t end up needing it with the already great heating in the home.
Extra bed linens and towels were all ready provided and didn’t need to ask for more.
Cleaning supplies available to keep things tidy and organized."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"First off, Monica was super responsive from the get go and allowed me to check in early due to needing a place to get to as soon as possible. She even offered a quick suggestion for a local cafe I could stay at while the place was cleaned.
Even with the early check in, the space was spotless. I felt comfortable and at home right away.
The full kitchen with fridge, stove/oven, coffee machine and utensils was perfect to have on the road. It was too cold for me to go out, but there was a nice patio with a table and a couple of chairs looking out at the backyard.
The space was huge and had everything I needed. I especially appreciated the separate water filtration and the heater in the bathroom.
Check in and out was seamless and the designated parking space close by the entrance was helpful to bring stuff in and out.
There is a bit of street noise but it didn't bother me at all.
I highly recommend. This space is a great value - Thank you, Monica!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A peaceful location that's close to everything, especially love having my coffee and watching the many squirrels play in the backyard.

The suite was very attractive and had a comfortable feel. Loved the basket of fruit and dipping caramel. Made us feel right at home. Was very clean and I think the king sized bed was the most comfortable bed I’ve ever slept in. Bathroom was clean and had shampoo/conditioner/shower gel available. We’ll be back when we visit Pennsylvania again. Thank you, Monica."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Monica was an incredible host! I messed up our booking and had trouble finding the wall heaters, but she was patient and understanding. She always responded to my messages promptly and went above and beyond to help. On top of all that, the suite is lovely and extremely clean. I highly recommend this location and this host!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a great stay! The location was perfect and out of the way of downtown while being close enough. The House was clean and tidy.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great, cozy, comfortable place to stay. House was clean and bed was comfortable. Quiet and private area. We visited the Ohio state reformatory which was a simple drive from the home. Definitely would stay again if we are in the area."

2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The place is nice, but there were a few hiccups: there was no blanket on the bed the first night, and the door was more than finicky - the keypad was difficult and would stop working at random. Monica was responsive and offered solutions quickly, though.
Other than that, the place is comfortable and in a good location."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice little home away from home.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A nice and clean location and very nice to have the keyless entry. This is nice for a couple or a small family. My mom and I stayed there together --one of us slept in the king size bed, while the other one slept on the pull out sofa. A very spacious area bedroom/sitting area, where you could even bring an air mattress and would have enough room to set that up for more sleeping area. Thanks so much, Monica for a place to stay!"

2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice updated kitchen area. A/C is window unit in bedroom only. My only wish was that we could've opened the doors and windows for a cross breeze- no screen doors to keep the bugs out and no screens in the kitchen windows. The suite was enough space for two of us for two days, bedroom was large. Also a tower speaker to connect via Bluetooth for music- this was nice. Monica was very friendly during a brief phone conversation. Neighborhood was quiet, very nice."
2022-06-01,4,Stayed over a week,"A perfect place to

There are plenty of outlets if you have multiple devices that need to be charged. There are also nightlights placed in each room in case you get up in the night to get a drink, use the bathroom, etc. The location is just one mile south of the park/softball fields, so that was perfect for me. She’s also close to the university, restaurants, and a grocery store. I highly recommend Monica’s place, and will definitely stay here again!"

2020-07-01,2,Stayed a few nights,It was just not what we are used to as far as comfort
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Every single thing about the stay at the Westside Suite far exceeded my expectations. Communication, check in, response time, quality, and the amenities were amazing. This was my first stay in an Airbnb that I booked and it really set the bar high for future trips. Monica really has a fantastic place and I hope my boyfriend and I will be able to return and stay there every time we visit his family in Ashland. The bed, pillows, and linens were so comfy and I seriously checked the tags on everything so I could order it all for back home. The kitchen is stocked with everything we needed to prepare our meals and snacks. The bathroom was really nice and the shower head is high enough so I didn’t have to squat like I usually have to at hotels. Even though the suite is connected to the main house I never heard or saw anyone, so it felt very private. It’s perfect for a short or long stay!
Ashland is such a quaint town, I seriously felt like I was in a movie the whole time. Downtown had massive hanging flower baskets everywhere, at the grocery store they still help you out to your car with your groceries, and all the historic houses and beautifully landscaped yards left me in awe. If you plan on visiting Ashland anytime soon here are some of the things I enjoyed that I recommend you do:
- Get the fried chicken and jojo’s from the grocery store Miller's-Hawkins Market. (you will not regret it, I’m sad I didn’t bring a whole suitcase full of that chicken home)
- Ice cream at Yoder's Red Barn Ice Cream. Soooo cheap and delicious!
- Brookside park, the massive trees provide great shade from the sun. The creek and the pond are beautiful, and there’s lots of places to have a picnic. Perfect to take a stroll with your ice cream from the red barn!
- Ashland cemetery. There were so many momma deer with their fawns roaming among the old gravestones. I’ve literally never seen a more beautiful peaceful cemetery in my 31 years on this earth. The trees there are MAGICAL. We sure don’t have anything like them back home in Texas. There’s a huge mausoleum that looks like it’s solids marble inside. So much history in that cemetery, I could of spent HOURS there!
- Antiques on main has some excellent dealers with fantastic taste and really good prices on everything.
- Fig & Oak on Main Street is so dreamy! I purchased all of my gifts for my friends and family back home from this store. I will be ordering from their website to get all the things I wanted but didn’t have room for in my suitcase! The owner (I’m assuming that’s who I met) was so kind and has really created such a beautiful space.
- Grandpa’s cheese barn. Every single thing I ate at this place was to die for!
- Uniontown brewing on Main Street had EXCELLENT food, drinks, service, and prices.
- Wagon Wheel on orange st. Is a cute little bar with clean bathrooms, cheap drinks, good service, and a jukebox with a great selection!
- Bullshooters on E. Main is a bigger dive bar with great people watching, live music, cheap drinks, and live music."
