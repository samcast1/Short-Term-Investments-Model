2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Came here with a group of friends and did some touring around the area. Perfect location so easy to get to the CT wine trail, Litchfield distillery and hiking on Sunday after the hangover. The house was great for our large group- we even rented hibachi one night the host approved it for an extra fee! Awesome spot for events."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Wow what a property!!! The photos don’t even do it justice. Walking around the grounds is a magical experience. I really got the escape I needed staying here. Thank you Rachel for being an excellent host. Can’t wait to bring a group of girl friends back here!
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Staying at this farm stay was such a wonderful experience! It was the perfect place for our little family to get out of the city for a peaceful weekend away! The property itself is breathtaking. Our son loved watching the horses and we enjoyed a morning cup of coffee to the sounds of the creek! There is lots to do in the area, but honestly our time on the farm was the best part of our stay! Rachel was a lovely and accommodating host. We will definitely recommend this place to our friends and hope to go back again ourselves!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Property was beautiful. House was historic and felt like home. Provided easy access to Torrington, Waterbury, and Hartford. Rachel was a great host to us."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,I loved this house and all it's history. Stayed on the pull out couch in the tv room and it was incredibly comfortable. The host Rachel was easy to talk to and get in touch with. All the amenities were as described as well.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"jonathans place was wonderful for a two month stay while i waited to move into my home. it is very clean and jonathan is super responsive. as a single female traveling alone, i felt at ease and safe in the home and surrounding neighborhood"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Jonathan was very helpful during our stay!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Using my wife's words, the place is terrific. It has a unique upper floor apartment vibe. Very cool appliances, cool bathroom. The place feels very authentic --and it is perfect for one or two people. My wife and I will definitely use Jonathan's place again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"My son stayed at the 1-bedroom unit for 7 months during his internship in New Milford. From his account, the place was excellent. All necessary living amenities were available, the unit was clean and felt like home. Jonathan was friendly and responsive host. Highly recommend this place for a short or long term stay."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Jonathan was outstandingly kind and hospitable. The small unit is attractive and well designed and very comfortable for a short stay. I am from the UK and was impressed by the thoughtful information in an informative handbook. I can highly recommend this accommodation.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My friend and I loved our stay at Jonathan’s place! It was such a cute little cottage suit for us! We had the whole place to ourselves. Highly recommend!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was just right for me and my daughter (and her friend). I couldn’t believe how incredible the gardens were in the property. Absolutely gorgeous.
Short walk to an up and coming revitalization of downtown, with lots of interesting shops and restaurants. This was a perfect place to stay while visiting my daughter at boarding school.
Highly recommended..! :-)"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Comfortable home with a beautiful backyard/garden. Molly was very friendly and responsive. Will stay there again if I visit!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"For being on Main Street near the center of town, the apartment is at the rear of the house which made traffic noise practically unnoticeable. Having a designated private parking space off the street is a plus. The place is clean, quiet, and conveniently located. Entry instructions were clear and Molly was responsive to all communications. I'll add this location to my favorites list for future stays."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,I've stayed in this unit twice and I'd go back any time I'm in the area. It's spacious and has everything I need.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always a good place to stay.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I was born and raised in Torrington and remember when this property was a greenhouse. I was quite surprised to find it renovated so beautifully. The apartment we stayed in was perfect! Private setting, quiet, comfortable, clean and every amenity that you could need was available. Comfortable bed and lots of extra blankets. The kitchen was stocked with everything you’d need to cook meals. The bathroom has plenty of towels and toiletries available. All the little homey touches throughout was very appreciated. The backyard is gorgeous and shockingly large for the neighborhood and even has a pond,. I’d love to see it in the summer time. Every little detail has been thoughtfully thought out including signage for parking, lighting on walk paths and a bistro set on the balcony with a vase and fairy lights. I will definitely be recommending this property to everyone and plan to return on my next visit! Well done to the owners and thank you for such a wonderful stay!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was my second stay at Molly's. I bring my dog Sonic and the space is located in walking distance to many shops (as well as close to where my friends in town live). My stay each time was wonderful. Thank you!

Other end of room spacious sitting area with couch , chair and TV. Eat in full kitchen. Felt at home and we loved the light up Santa that greeted us upon entry! Easy check in. Instructions were very detailed with great recommendations for meals and things to do. We would definitely stay again. Thank you Molly and Victor, have a Happy New Year!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Molly and Victor were able to accommodate a late reservation so I could spend some time with my mom nearby. Communication was clear and responsive from the get-go. Instructions for check-in and where to park were sent the day before as promised. Everything fresh, clean, and neat as a pin. Appreciated the option to park in the garage. Wish I'd had more time to hang out on the porch or explore the backyard. Received apologies that the a/c had been taken out for the season (who expected temps in the 80s in October??), but there were two ceiling fans plus a floor fan and I was able to make it comfortable with those. Didn't do any cooking, but looked like most of the basics were there for putting together a meal. Coffee and tea were available, as were a shelf of assorted books and suggestions for things to do in the area. Walkways and hallways were well lit. A little bit of road noise but not intrusive. Would definitely stay here again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place is beautiful and impeccably clean. Coupled with the provision of all the essential amenities to ensure a warm and homely stay, we extend our heartfelt gratitude to Molly and Victor for their hospitality."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Central, cozy and convenient! Exactly what I needed during my visit home. Molly and victor were always responsive and flexible. This place was also great for my dog. She goes wherever I go so it’s nice to have a host who understands that."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The apartment was clean and comfortable with everything we needed and better. The large bedroom (the size of two bedrooms ) and porch have views onto the garden. Both beds - queen bed and pull out sofa - were very comfortable with a good a/c and television too. Large tiled kitchen was well equipped and the sliding door with screen door onto our own private porch was a really nice plus . We spent time checking out the garden including a large koi pond with fountains, stone benches, a lawn, plantings, mature trees. There is a good vegan restaurant nearby and we also liked the Nutmeg Grill for breakfast."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was honestly one of the best Airbnb experiences I've ever had. Molly and Victor treated me like an out of town cousin visiting, from their personalized responses to messages to warmly greeting me when we encountered each other in their gorgeous yard.
About the yard-it's a park. It's huge and peaceful and gorgeous and lush and words don't do it justice. But the apartment itself was just as fabulous. Clean, restful, comfortable with plenty of space. Anytime I am ever back in the area I will definitely book with them."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I felt at home, clean, good location, excellent service five out of five"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I live close to Molly and Victor’s place and decided to rent it for friends that were visiting us.

I plan to rent from them again for our family and friends visiting from out of town."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Victor and Molly's apartment is cute, clean, convenient and exactly as described. They were great hosts and were very clear in their communications. The backyard garden is a wonderful hidden gem in an urban environment having a creative combination of whimsy and zen vibes."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We booked this place at last minute because a different AirBNB never responded. Molly responded within minutes. Everything was spotless, and the apartment was well appointed with everything you could need, including a private balcony to eat breakfast. This place is a beautiful oasis that we did not expect to find on Main Street, Torrington. Also, a laundromat and Walgreens were a short walk away, and there’s even a Dairy Queen nearby. But the highlight of our stay was the garden."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed at Molly and Victor's for several days prior to picking my daughter up from summer camp. The property has a beautiful garden and the unit was exactly what we needed in terms of size and amenities. It is also a short walk/drive from Torrington's historic town center.

The backyard was beautiful, too bad it was rainy and we didn't get a chance to enjoy it. Communication was pretty much immediate, and I strongly recommend staying here if you're ever visiting the area. Thanks, Molly & Victor!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Though it was only for a short night that we stayed at Molly's place, we very much enjoyed it. The apartment is spacious and nicely furnished. Beautiful garden behind the house, wished we could have hung out there. Easy parking. Instructions for check-in were detailed so we got into the apartment easily. TV set allowed us to use our subscriptions to watch streaming content. We hope to come back."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Molly's place was the perfect ""home base"" for our weekend in Torrington! Clean, comfy, quiet place to sleep and super close to the Nutmeg Ballet where we spent most of our time. There are three units in the house, but other than crossing paths in the yard a few times, we never heard or saw anyone and felt like we had the place to ourselves. My 9 and 5yr old boys LOVED exploring in the spacious and beautiful backyard. They especially loved getting to glimpses of the koi fish in the pond. We travel to Torrington several times a year and look forward to staying at Molly's place in the future!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Molly’s place was just what I was looking for while visiting some family in the area! Molly is super responsive, has a great line of communication and super helpful! The backyard scenery is beautiful and peaceful. I would definitely recommend and return!"

We would stay again!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Molly’s apartment was just what we were looking for. A small place close to downtown that was easy to find and close to several hiking trails. The place was very clean, and had enough dishes to cook what we wanted for breakfast and dinner. The backyard was peaceful, and we enjoyed sitting by the pond and watching the fish. Things were just starting to bud so in a few weeks it’ll be full of color, and the bedroom/living room looks out on the backyard too, getting the morning sun. Molly was easy to communicate with and checking in and out was seamless. We would definitely recommend this place!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Molly was a great host! Clear communication and a very clean space. Perfect for our family this weekend.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Molly's place was a welcome find when I needed to find quick accommodations. She was fast to respond, offered clear and proactive communication and was incredibly helpful for my last minute request. Her place was well detailed, accurately described, and private, yet accessible to all sorts of amenities. Thank you Molly!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I had an amazing stay! We were there for a dance competition which can get quite overwhelming and being able to come back to a place that felt like home was amazing.
The apartment itself zero complaints and would highly recommend this stay.
Truly the best part about our stay was how amazing Mollys communication is!
It truly feels like you’re not just another person renting an apartment from her.
The attentiveness from her is something I’ve never experienced in an Airbnb before.
I would highly recommend renting from Molly and I am looking forward to my next stay."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay while in Torrington visiting family.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I really enjoyed staying at Molly's. There was enough room for two adults and two kids, one being a baby. We loved the kids museum close by, the huge garden behind the home, the actual home, and the amenities... and our son especially loved the games provided. The stay was like a mini-vacation for us - it was really great and we loved everything about it. I enjoyed waking up to the sun streaming through the windows into the kitchen, we barely had to bring anything extra except for food (meat, veggies, carbs, etc) because the kitchen was pretty much fully stocked with essentials, and we were so close to restaurants and grocery stores if there was anything else we needed. The bed was also super comfortable; even our 3-year-old was raving about how comfortable the bed was. He's already ready to return to ""the home with the green door."" We hope to be able to come back to stay again because it was a lovely vacation in what felt like a home away from home! :)"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We really loved staying at this place. The location was excellent, really close to the downtown area. The rooms were spacious and clean. The back yard was awesome, it was like we had our own little personal park. We brought our dog and had a great area to walk him in the back. We will certainly be staying here again when we come to Torrington."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just the perfect place for a short getaway with all the right amenities. Molly was an amazing host!

2022-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,Really charming cozy apartment. Quiet. Peaceful. The backyard is a little slice of heaven--it's more like a small park rather than a backyard.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place and very clean.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was lucky enough to book this cute unit last minute. Molly and Victor were both available to myself through the whole process and during my stay. They were very prompt on sending me all the information I needed. I was very much pleased with my accommodations here - it was so cozy and cute. Between the setup, the decor, the balcony and the backyard it was like being in a hidden oasis! You never would guess the way the homes are situated that it holds the backyard it does as big as it does! Everything was perfect. I had the chance to grab some coffee from Batchy Brew - one of Molly’s recommendations and again not disappointed - delicious! I would definitely stay here again and have this place saved for future visits!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved this place. The garage was welcome to get the car out of the street. The place was comfortable and roomy. All the amenities worked fine.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute place and beautiful yard! We had a perfect stay here and wanted for nothing!

2022-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Molly and Victor are quick to respond, easy to communicate with, and their property is absolutely gorgeous. The koi pond and gardens are such a calming and quiet escape while still being just a few blocks away from the main ""downtown"". They were wonderfully receptive to my service dog and I would stay here again in a heartbeat."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a beautiful apartment. I absolutely loved the back yard where there were a variety of blossoming flowers and well maintained greenery.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Molly and Victor are very lovely Host. The place is as described with a few extras I really liked. We stay in lots of Airbnb's and Molly and Victor's place was nicely stocked with coffee, sugar, spices, and everything you need to get started on your night's stay. It's located right on a Main Street, but it was very quiet and great off street parking. We liked the heated towel rack and extra heat in the bathroom that you can turn on. It was also very clean and you have everything you need. We had one issue with Roku and within minutes Molly and Victor responded and had us up and working. Lots of close coffee houses and restaurants. We would stay again! Thank you Molly and Victor!"

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place to stay in the area. Wondeful hikes nearby. Hope to return.
2022-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Molly & Victor were responsive and helpful in advance and during our stay. The space was nicely setup with adequate amenities. It was actually larger than I understood, which was great for our family of four. It’s located on a busy street in a small city, but we felt comfortable. It’s an easy 10-minute walk to downtown where there’s an historical theatre, a few restaurants, a cool used book store and even a fabulous art gallery space run by a non-profit. In the other direction on Main Street there are a handful of Latin American grocers and shops. The garden on this property was a hidden gem, with a coy-fish pond and a river running past the very back."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The communication was very good, a minor glitch with checking in was addressed immediately, centrally located and quiet at night. Clean, comfortable, and much appreciated! Thanks!"

2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The apartment was quiet, clean, comfortable, centrally located and features a beautiful backyard and off-street parking.

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy and clean. Much better than the local hotels.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Molly and Victor's place was great. It had everything I needed for my stay. Their communication was outstanding too. Check in was super easy and their little apartment was perfect, and just so happened to be 3 minutes to restaurants, shops and my sister's new home! The home is close enough to Waterbury that I went there several times during my stay. The apartment was very quiet despite it being on Main St and I never heard the traffic. The people in the other apartments were quiet which made my stay very relaxing. Molley and Victor's place had internet and all the amenities I needed to cook. The only thing that was a little less than perfect was being able to take a hot bath, as the hot water ran out before the tub was filled. Definitely not a deal breaker but thought I'd note it just in case their are others who enjoy a relaxing hot bath like I do. The yard is incredibly beautiful and unexpected. I got to see it covered in snow and free from snow during my stay and it was beautiful either way! Overall, the place was lovely and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again. One of the best Airbnb's I've stayed at in Connecticut.
Thank you Molly and Victor!!!!! You two are the epitome of a great Airbnb experience!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Very nice place, Molly and victor very accommodating."

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I rented all three units in this house for a reunion with friends. It was perfect for all of us. There is a lot of space in each of the units - full kitchens! - and is especially great for groups since all three units are connected and can be accessed if you book together. The backyard space is also really nice. The place was really clean and tidy and had plenty of room for us to hang out - inside and out.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Molly and Victor are wonderful hosts and the units are meticulously clean. The apartments are easy to adapt to when you go from your home to a vacation spot or a place to stay while in town. You will enjoy the beautiful backyard and views from the home.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Victor & Molly's spot was spacious and wonderful – the backyard was a special treat. Wonderful hosts who are communicative as well. Would recommend to anyone heading to the area.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Molly and Victor's unit was perfect for our needs! It was clean and check-in was efficient. The unit offered a cozy porch, perfect for morning coffee, overlooking the gorgeous and deceitfully spacious backyard oasis! It offered a nature escape while still being a short distance from the food and outdoor activities we were looking for. The lock on the garage gave us some trouble but Molly was very fast in responding and trying to trouble shoot the problem. We would definitely recommend checking this space out!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay! The bed was comfortable, the place was clean, and the backyard was so relaxing. We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This airbnb is such a well organized and cute place to stay, the yard was beautiful and a nice play to spend time. There were food places walking distance as well as a short drive. Overall, this airbnb is worth it and a nice stay in CT."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Molly and Victor's Airbnb was great! It had all of the creature comforts that I value when I travel - coffee maker, easy parking, location, cleanliness, responsive hosts, and, specifically for this trip, air conditioning! I specifically chose their Airbnb over another because of the latter option, knowing I'd be traveling during a very hot and humid period of the year. Molly and Victor checked in with me and were responsive to my questions. I highly recommend them and their Airbnb.
Thank you."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful space!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Terrific place well done !!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was super clean. Nice. It was super close to where I needed to be. The owners are nice good and fast communication. The price was better than the local dumpy motel (and closer and nicer). The bed was super soft. Where I stayed had a little seating area because I had guest visit me. Certain seasons they have berry picking (blueberries and raspberries). Dairy queen and a Chinese food place is close. If you pull in the gravel driveway I would do a K turn to get out it's not impossible but interesting especially because I have rear wheel drive. Watch your step going up the back paver stairs go slow... It had everything all I had to do was come in and put my stuff away...I would definitely stay here again.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My experience staying at Molly and Victor's Airbnb was phenomenal. The space was lovely and exactly what I needed for a week-long remote workcation! The living space was clean and had everything that I needed plus being located in the downtown area I wasn't far from stores and amenities to go grocery shopping and pick up essentials for the week. I was able to get my work done and then go outside and enjoy the beautiful garden and koi pond. I loved stepping out into the garden each day for a session of yoga and meditation. The experience was like going on my own private mini retreat!! It was exactly what I needed as a personal reset to spend some time away from the city and enjoy fresh air and positive vibes.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed here while visiting family in Harwinton. It was perfect for our needs. We didn’t use the kitchen but it seemed to have everything you would need. The grounds are very pretty.

2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Molly and Victor are great hosts and allowed us to book right away. The apartment is very comfortable and very well equipped. They have a dream garden and even allowed us to harvest some strawberries! It will be a safe place to come back to. Thank you!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Victor and Molly’s place worked out perfectly for us in every way. We would definitely stay there again!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Molly and Victor were caring hosts, and we enjoyed our stay in Torrington. The apartment exceeded our expectations, and had a nice airy feel. It was very clean, nicely decorated, and had everything we needed. The back yard and garden area was surprisingly large for a place in town, and had been lovingly landscaped over many years. The pond and the patch of ripe strawberries that our hosts shared with us were a treat. We would highly recommend a stay with Molly and Victor."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"So glad this place is now here! I come up to Torrington often to visit friends and in the past there hasn’t been anywhere good to stay. Check-in was seamless, the apartment has everything you need, and the gardens are just incredible. Thank you Molly and Victor- hope to come back soon."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Levity's Airbnb was a perfect spot for us to stay for a weekend in NW CT for my niece's graduation. The space was very comfortable and had everything we needed.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"My partner and I had a perfect night to ourselves and enjoyed the space Leviy had to offer.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved it!!!!!!! So clean and cozy and Leviy was amazing
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"What mainly drew us to this home was the outdoor sitting area, as well as the overall clean/relaxing vibes we got from the photos. Unfortunately, the outdoor space was not available at the time of our booking due to the season.
While the home is just as beautiful in person as it is in photos, our experience fell short of expectations. We were seriously terrified when we came across multiple doors we did not know about, such as the unlocked trap door in the kitchen and the two separate doors that lead to the garage, both have deadbolts and unlock with the keys provided. The host assured us no one else had access and we were safe, however we still felt uneasy knowing anyone in the garage could easily access our side of the home.The bedroom was very hot, we turned down the temp on both thermostats and it stayed just as hot. Contacted the host the next morning about it and she got back to us the following morning, 4 hours before checkout. We did not sleep well at all. Disappointed."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean and private. It is even more beautiful in person. Really enjoyed my stay.

She was responsive to our needs and has responded to our suggestions for general improvements. Although the location was near to ""downtown"", it was more a drive-able location than walk-able, unless you are a regular hiker. Quiet neighborhood, nice landscaping around the house, and a private ""in-law"" type setup. This is a much better solution in the Torrington area than any of the motels/hotels."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,The space is much bigger than in the photos and has a quaint beachy vibe . Everything was super clean and we never heard a noise from the other side of the house which is separated by a two car garage. The neighborhood is quiet and nice. Would recommend!

He wanted to travel back to CT and enjoy the snow for a couple of days! We decided on Leviy's Airbnb in Torrington which was absolutely amazing! From the moment we walked in the apt everything was so clean and smelled like brand new! It was such a peaceful couple of days! It snowed the first night and the next morning our car was cleaned and the driveway shoveled thank you! We def recommended anyone to stay here!!!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Booked this space for a mini valentines getaway with my boyfriend and it was simply amazing.

2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a wonderful place to stay, highly recommend!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was, by far, the best stay I’ve experienced through air bnb. The location is perfect! It’s less than a five minute drive from the main business area where all the restaurants and shopping centers are. Additionally, the area of Torrington is beautiful to drive through and take a hike with your significant other. The host is extremely kind and willing to go above and beyond to ensure your comfort during your stay. This is 100% a place that I plan on returning to next time I’m in Connecticut."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"WOW. This was the best Airbnb I have EVER stayed at. I was looking for a place that had a FULL KITCHEN and that is HARD to find on Airbnb. I wanted to be able to cook on the stove, and use a full kitchen to make breakfast and dinner if I wanted too, use the dishwasher, use the sink. I also wanted to be able to use a WASHER and DRYER. This place has it all! It's a remodeled section of a home with a private entrance on the other side of the garage from the main house. we had a spot in the driveway off the street to park right by the door to our section. We got there and there was a lockbox with a key in it. I was staying there for Christmas and the house had Christmas lights up which was a nice touch! I never heard any noise from the main section of the house. It snowed the first night , and we went outside the next day to find the driveway shoveled and two ice scrapers next to the door for us to use. Communication was always prompt and helpful with everything! The bathroom had a really nice hair dryer, the bedroom had an iron and ironing board, and bed was SUPER comfortable! The space had two TVs and Netflix to watch on both of them! TWO thermostats for the living room and the kitchen/bedroom areas. There was soap, shampoo, and conditioner dispensers in the shower! the kitchen sink had hand soap and dish soap dispensers, a coffee maker, a full canister of coffee grounds, sweetener, a couple of snacks, and even purified water in the fridge which was perfect for my CPAP! The town of Torrington is a very safe and cozy small town, not far from some towns that inspired Gilmore girls. There is a quaint movie theatre only 1 mile away - with reclining seats, and some nice diners and burger joints nearby. My standards will be really high after staying here, everything was above and beyond! I couldn't be any happier! Thanks for everything!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Adorable eclectic home and close to everything. Wish we had more time to enjoy the garden and town! Would definitely go back and the host was professional and friendly.
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,Every time I visit Litchfield I plan on staying at the Doctors House. Hal was a great host and the house was ideal in every way. Not only was it spacious and comfortable but the location is 10 out of 10. I’ll be back!!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Hal is a great host - very organized and accommodating! We will be back!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family had a lovely stay at ""The Doc House"" for a wedding weekend in the Litchfield area. We were 4 adults and a toddler and we felt the space was just right for our needs. The place is historic and has a lot of character and charm. Kitchenette and bathroom all fully updated and modern. It is also easily walkable to all Litchfield Green shops and restaurants. Easy and ample parking; easy check-in and check-out. Scott was a very responsive host who made himself available for questions and recommendations. He was flexible for an early check-in. Definitely take a moment to understand the floor plan/ layout (which is explained accurately in the description). The kitchenette, for example, is in one of the bedrooms. This could pose a problem for some travelers. It did not for us, but worth a mention!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved staying here. It was perfect while visiting my daughter at boarding school. Walking distance to boutique shopping and quaint restaurants. Really enjoyed our stay. :-)
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,There for two nights and overall a great place to stay. Host was great. Would recommend!
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"Perfect location, the house had charm, very clean and welcoming"
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"My family and I had a lovely stay over the Thanksgiving holiday. Parking was easy and offered ample space for our 3 vehicles. Scott was available to give us a quick tour of the house and was flexible with our arrival time. The house was warm and cozy and all 6 of us enjoyed getting together in the living room. The location was right along the green of Litchfield which was great for walking and taking advantage of all the shops and restaurants.
👍👍"
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Scott’s place was perfect for our small family gathering. The house is in a great location right in the heart of historic Litchfield. Scott was a wonderful host and was very responsive. Note that the kitchenette is located in one of the bedrooms (this didn’t cause an issue for us but might for others.) Would definitely recommend.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay! Exceptional accommodations and ideal location. Highly recommend!
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Our group of 7 had a fabulous weekend at Scott’s home. The location to shops and restaurants was perfect. Scott’s home had a lot of charm, with room for everyone. He was a great host and very accommodating to our group. We would look forward to staying again."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Scott's place was gorgeous! I stayed with my inlaws, husband and 6 month old and we had so much space and were happy to be right in the center of town. Scott's space is filled with many unique artifacts and art and is colorful, fun and historical! The quality of workmanship in every detail of the home is incredible, and you can tell it has been restored and is maintained with care."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great place to stay in Litchfield with lots to do on the doorstep. Spacious rooms, excellent bathrooms and friendly and helpful hosts. We arrived in pouring rain and Scott couldn’t have been more welcoming in getting us settled in."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great stay! Perfect location right in town. We stayed for a wedding and it allowed for our family to all stay together. We loved being able to walk to restaurants and shops and the art festival! Scott was a great host. Would stay again!
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Scott’s place is charming and conveniently located near downtown. He did a great job communicating and his hospitality was first class. Highly recommend his place for anyone staying in Litchfield.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at the Doctor’s House while attending a nearby family wedding. Scott was a wonderful host and very accommodating and responsive to our requests and needs during our stay, even when we needed to add a guest and check in a bit early. The Doctor’s House sits across the street from the Litchfield Green within a short walking distance to restaurants and shops. It has a very convenient location. The grounds are lovely and we made very good use of the patio in the back which offers a private place to sit among flowering shrubs, gardens and trees - it was a perfect place to enjoy lunch with other family members who were passing through on their way to the wedding.
All in all it was a lovely stay."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Scott’s wonderful home on the green in Litchfield! The location couldn’t be better!! Thank you, Scott!"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Hal was so friendly and helpful! We stayed at the Airbnb the weekend of our wedding, Hal even left us a bottle of champagne to celebrate our marriage. The home was spotless!!! The historic and cozy feel was the cherry on top. Highly recommend!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Great stay! This place is beautiful! To say it was clean and well kept is an understatement. It was pristine! Our host was quick to respond, not only during our stay but before and after as well. I highly recommend this historical setting!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Doctor’s House was very charming! We love staying in AirBnbs that have character and add to the vacation experience which this historic house certainly did.
The landscaping was full of gorgeous flowers and the house was thoughtfully decorated with high quality furniture. The linens and the towels were all brand new and super soft. We all slept very well!
Our host Hal was so responsive and thoughtful - he even purchased a pack and play and a high chair for our visit which was a huge help while traveling with a baby and a toddler.
This was an ideal location in the very center of town. We were able to walk to coffee, restaurants and cute shops. And it felt very central to our driving trips as well.
Highly recommend and we’ll be back!"
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great house and very clean
2024-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Great communication! Convenient location!
2024-06-01,4,Group trip,"Fantastic weekend stay! Easy check-in and very responsive hosts, even helped look into local bakeries for us. Ample parking, and unless you're not used to it or have incredibly sensitive hearing, the house does a fantastic job of blocking out the sound of all traffic. Coffee truck steps away from the house was a major plus.
Only reason we couldn't give a full 5 stars is the beds weren't all that comfortable (we all fell asleep fine) but a couple of us did have to use extra blankets to help pad the bed and still woke up with springs digging. We also wished there was a light over the dining room table for board games.
All and all we'd happily rebook this again if we're in the area!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay! Cozy home. Hosts are amazing — had a crib and kiddie table there for our 1.5 year old daughter when we arrived. Highly recommend!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I came to Torrington with my family for a dance competition at the beautiful Warner Theatre downtown. The house was exactly as pictured and described. It was clean and very well appointed. The beds were comfortable and we slept well. The road outside is busy, but the bedrooms are in the back of the house so it was of no consequence, and the gas station next door was actually quite convenient for snacks and drinks. The house included helpful amenities like shampoo, a hair dryer, and body wash. The decor was cute and thoughtful. My kids loved the mini arcade. Our hosts were responsive and friendly. We would stay here again."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Thank you!! We felt right at home! They were very responsive and always helpful
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was in excellent condition just like the last time, Ryan and Razine were very responsive by text. The house was a great deal, not really any more expensive than a hotel room these days. We will stay here again the next time we are in Torrington if we need a place to stay."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful small home - convenient location
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Ryan's place was quaint for our short stay in Torrington. Batch Brew is conveniently steps away from the home and great for coffee lovers. The only thing to note is that because it is located on a main road, the noise from the streets are audible from around 6am so we couldn't sleep in. Overall, a nice stay for our short noticed trip."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect spot for an easy overnight! Cozy, well equipped for families, loved being able to walk to dinner one night and breakfast the next morning. Plus the coffee truck next door is rather convenient! It was a little noisy in terms of traffic bc it’s on a main road but nothing a little white noise couldn’t handle. Easy trade off, though, in terms of convenience of location. I’m sure we’ll look to stay there again. Thx!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was exactly as described! We thoroughly enjoyed our morning lattes from the coffee truck!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great spot for a ski weekend. You can tell they have really done a ton of updates on the inside of the house. We were very pleasantly surprised when we walked in! Everything we needed for an easy stay with our family.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Conveniently located 20mins away from the mountain Ryan’s places was the perfect lodging for our skii trip. It’s also close to lots of places to eat and grab coffee.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a very peaceful stay here. Love the proximity to White Memorial Preserve and Litchfield. The place was clean and cozy, and we were especially happy to find an affordable place that was dog-friendly."
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Ryan and Razina were both very responsive and always answered our questions in a timely manner. The house was quaint and had everything the listing stated. We were in town for a short weekend ski trip, and could not have picked a better place to stay in."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"R & R are awesome hosts! The location is great. As long as you don’t mind a busy street. There are wonderful restaurants! Access is easy, and the place is beautifully maintained inside the coffee at the coffee truck next-door is exceptional! I highly recommend this Airbnb and the hosts they are wonderful!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Place is beautiful and peaceful… had everything there that is need and a great place to be with our family.
2023-12-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed here shortly after Christmas and found the home to be well appointed and suitable for our needs. You can tell the property owners put a lot of effort and time into it, and it was an added perk to have great coffee conveniently located next door. It’s an older home, and next to a gas station so there’s always some level of noise coming from Main Street - if that’s something that matters to you."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,We had a great stay at Ryan's air bnb. Ryan was incredible with communication- very responsive. The house was charming and we felt very safe and comfortable. It was the perfect location and we are so appreciative for our stay so we could visit family for the holidays. Not to mention the delicious coffee just two steps away. I would definitely recommend staying at Ryan's place!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Overall an amazing place ! So beautiful !
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Ryan has a wonderful and clean home and was very responsive! We would definitely stay again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Fantastic stay. Cozy home. Kind host. We enjoyed Thanksgiving there and had some of Batchys great coffee!!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Being here was incredible. I may be biased, because it’s my dad’s old house. He lived here for like ten years and I have many happy memories here. Bright, warm, and clean. The coffee truck next door was convenient and fun. I tried a new flavor every day! I brought my dog and she had an awesome time too. Ryan and Razina were incredible hosts. I visit Torrington frequently, and I will NEVER stay anywhere else. As long as it’s available, I’m booking it. Thanks so much guys, can’t wait to come back."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Cute as a button inside! Convenient location and a perfect choice for the family to come back to our local stomping grounds!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Ryan's home was lovely inside. We enjoyed the little touches around the house that made it feel like home. He was also quick to respond when we lost the house keys.
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,This was a great little house to stay at for a family wedding. Very clean and well maintained with a cute little yard ideal for traveling with pets. This house right on a main road but was pretty quiet at night and we had no trouble sleeping. Everything was comfortable and it is conveniently located.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just what me needed , nice place plenty comfortable and clean and neat had everything we needed and more"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Comfortable, very clean older home on a busy commercial street. The house is between a gas station and a coffee truck business (with excellent coffee!). There is street noise, but it didn't bother us. There is a quiet residential neighborhood around the corner were we walked our dog, who also enjoyed being in the grassy backyard.
Ryan was immediately responsive when we contacted him to ask whether there was an iron we could use. He provided an iron within a couple of hours.
This home had everything we needed, was conveniently located for our needs, had excellent restaurants within walking distance, was spotlessly clean, and was reasonably priced."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely beautiful home, very comfortable and exactly how it was described. Loved having somewhere to stay that was close to family!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,The place was better than the pictures. Great price and cutely decorated. The host was very quick to respond and even gave recommendation of local events. You have to have a cup of coffee from the truck next door. 10/10
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed staying at Ryan’s. It was very comfortable and close to many essential stores for a traveling party of four trying to find some sense of normalcy while our home is being renovated.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The home was lovely for a weekend getaway. This inside of the house was described. The outside of the house looks like it needs some TLC.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was very quaint and well looked after inside. We felt very comfortable. It was convenient to downtown Torrington. It’s on a noisy road- but next to gas and a coffee truck. The hosts were very accommodating!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute and cozy home! Thoughtful touches and great coffee from the coffee truck next door!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were visiting a family member in a nursing home and this was a perfect location. It was very convenient for us visiting other family in the area and we had our own space to go home to. Cooking a few dinners at home and having everything you needed was a plus. Washer and dryer was awesome! Super clean and well maintained. An older house, but nicely renovated, love all of the windows! Hopefully it will be available when we come back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I rented this house for my daughter who was visiting from Boston.
The house was perfect, she was able to bring her dog because the house is pet friendly. It is in a very convenient location.
The hosts were extremely accommodating and friendly.
I would definitely book this house again
Tony"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,great stay in torrington!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our family of three plus a dog really enjoyed our time at the house. Ryan and Razina did a wonderful job furnishing and updating the house in a smart way that was a perfect fit for our visiting family (and were adding a fence around the property that will be a great addition for the backyard!). Our 5 year old enjoyed trying to finish the puzzles, our dog appreciated the quieter side streets for walks, and we appreciated having nice spaces to get work done while we were staying.
The house is located on a main street close to businesses, but noise from the road was minimal and it made the house a convenient location for getting around the area. It was wonderful being right next to Batchy Brew - the coffee food truck next door.
Ryan and Razina actively communicated any necessary information during the stay - and we enjoyed our time!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,We stayed here the night before my wedding and it was an absolutely beautiful home! Very clean and well kept! It was close to everything we could need! Would absolutely recommend! It made the night before my wedding and the morning of stress free! Thank you!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ryan’s place was as described! Close to the in town but far enough from the business; is on the main drag but it’s not very noisy! Would stay again. Ryan was responsive through my stay
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Great spot. My family of 5 stayed here and enjoyed it. The coffee truck next door opened bright and early at 6am which was great.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house is cute and cozy. Everything was clean and the bed was comfortable. The best part is being able to get coffee from the coffee truck in the morning. 😊☕️
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect for what we needed. Quick Uber ride to our destination. Check-in was easy; house was cute and clean. Will book again if ever back in Torrington.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"super clean! Had all the basic amenities, barring an outside grill, which would be a nice addition if it was possible. if you're looking for a place to crash in Torrington or just a simple place to go out and do day trips, this was perfect for that."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,We had a very comfortable stay at Ryan's house. We enjoyed the very comfy bed and the fantastic coffee right next door. I'm a very light sleeper the only noise I heard was a happy cricket outside. i slept really well!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The inside of the house was very nice. We only stayed one night but it was perfect. As described. Ryan was responsive to messages and was very accommodating. Would stay there again.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Exactly what we needed for a long weekend stay for a wedding. Was equipped with shower necessities and even a blow dryer. Walking out to the front yard for morning coffee was probably the highlight. Thank you for the hospitality!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super responsive and accommodating. Such a cozy place in Torrington. Highly recommend!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We needed an overnight space following a family wedding. This was better than I expected. The beds were very comfortable. The house was very clean and they cover all aspects of what is advertised. We’d gladly stay there again!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place. Busy street but could hardly hear traffic. Restaurant across the street, food truck next door, and easy access to multiple local restaurants. Uber is low cost to get in and out of town."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,A quaint little house in a very convenient spot located close to the center of town. The coffee truck also being right next door was so nice to have in the morning! Everything was neat and clean. Would definitely recommend staying here!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Stayed here to host a small 3 person Easter dinner with my mom who lives nearby. Airbnb was very clean and spacious and worked great for our overnight trip. On a busy road, but it was generally not too loud inside which I was happy about. Kitchen had most the basics, but missing a couple things like a whisk and larger cutting boards."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was perfect for our weekend trip to the area with small children in tow. Razina was helpful and accommodating and supplies for the little ones were available without me even requesting them which my mom and I felt was very thoughtful. When visiting friends and family in the area again I would definitely consider Ryan and Razina’s home again unless we have more family looking to stay together.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ryan’s home was very clean and welcoming on our arrival. We appreciated the extra towels in the bathroom. The bed and comforters were very comfortable. We also liked the coffee pot set up in the kitchen for guests. We didn’t know the house was on an active busy street. The good news was it wasn’t too loud at night. Great hosts and a great stay, thanks."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"R&R's place was R&R for us as we passed through the town I grew up in and stopped to stay a couple of nights while visiting family and friends. It had all the cozy feels of a historical home with the perks of updated appliances (that met every need we had and beyond) and fun touches of boho interior design throughout. It accommodated my family of 5 plus we had a couple of friends stop by for a couple of hours with plenty of space to entertain all of us.
The queen bed was comfortable, everyone slept well. The entire home was very clean including towels and bedding. We loved walking over to get freshly made lattes, cortados, and hot chocolate (something for everyone in our family). It was really special for me to see visionaries doing something locally and being able to experience it. Thank you, R&R for making my old hometown a better place with the beauty of your unique creativity and vision. We enjoyed staying at your place and love what you are doing!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay. Had all the supplies we needed and more. The gaming chair was a hit and the two boys fought over it.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Sahra and Richard are wonderful hosts! They made us feel welcome and we felt right at home. There were some delicious fruit, snacks, English muffins and eggs for us on the kitchen table. The house is bright and spotless! A lovely place to celebrate our 30th anniversary! We appreciated the ACs in each bedroom and the living room which helped during the warm days. Comfortable beds, fast wifi for work, tvs in each room, use of the washer and dryer and use of the garage to park our car. The location can't be beat! Close to shopping and restaurants. We enjoyed the huge backyard full of shady trees. Checking in and out were a breeze. Thanks so much for having us, Richard and Sahra!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We throughly enjoyed our stay at this cozy little home. Right away walking in the door we noticed how clean and tidy it was. We made ourselves right at home. The couch reclines and she had plenty of blankets in easy reach. The electric fireplace was a really nice touch! It was cold & snowing outside. There is a great little mud room so we didn’t track snow into the house. Also I’d like to add there is a washer and dryer. We didn’t know this before going but it was a wonderful surprise to dry my kids wet snow play clothes! She left us a bunch of items in case we forgot something ie toothbrush, shampoo, deodorant and mouth wash to name a few. Also laundry detergent to wash clothes. The beds were very comfortable and we really liked the ceiling fans in the bedrooms. In the kitchen we had many items available to us. There was a big selection for cooking, seasonings and even an air fryer. Outside there is plenty of yard for kids to play and it was nice to use the garage for our rental car!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was charming and we all loved the kitchen layout especially. We appreciated the snacks and waters left for us as well as the helpful notes.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best airbnbs I’ve ever stayed in. My colleagues and I stayed here a week because we worked nearby. This place is so conveniently close to our job, but that’s the cherry on top. The kitchen is equipped with so many tools it made cooking so fun and easy! We loved staying there so much, we are staying there again next week. Melissa is such a wonderful host too, she is very responsive and very understanding."
2024-01-01,4,Group trip,The pull out couch in one of the bedrooms was smaller than we expected
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great find with a cozy feel.
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Melissa made my crew feel right at home. She is by far one of the most proactive and responsive hosts I have seen. She is kind and will definitely take care of you. My film shoot went smoothly because of her.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Melissa was amazing! She is helpful and gracious. She even had a Christmas tree for us that was fun. I added an ornament so that a tradition could start.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had to come to the area to help my Dad in a nursing home. It was a nice place to relax and feel at home.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home, great value for the area. Melissa was proactive in contacting me about our trip and making check in and check out very easy. The house was super cute and had some really nice personal touches. Will definitely be looking at rebooking in the future for future trips."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a very comfortable stay. The house was beautifully renovated and decorated and super clean. The owners have thought of everything; it contained all the comforts of home and more. We would definitely stay here again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very thoughtful host! She makes everything feels like home away from home.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Melissa is a wonderful host. Kept in contact, was nearby if we needed anything. My family and I stayed for 9 days, it was just like home, kitchen supplied, easy to find and central to where were traveling. We would stay again anytime."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Melissa is a superb host!! The home was beautiful and clean. It’s an older home that had been renovated — the renovations were done in a way that ensured the house didn’t lose any of it’s charm. The bedding looked and smelled freshly cleaned. The house manual covered everything we needed to know. Whenever I reached out to Melissa, she responded nearly immediately.
There were a lot of little touches that made our stay perfect — the chair’s all had cushions, plenty of towels available, cute treats placed on the dining table with thought, nice water pressure, a bench near the front door, a light and camera pointed at our car that made us feel extra secure, wind chimes, ice in the freezer, no clutter, kitchen with all the tools needed, lots of coffee options, lots of books, plenty of lights.. I could go on!!
We didn’t get to meet face to face; however, her care, support, and dedication were all immensely felt nonetheless. Thank you again, Melissa, for such a stellar experience!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such an amazing spot! John was super wonderful making it feel like we LIVED there! He had the place ready in perfect condition for us! Definitely coming back here!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cottage had everything we needed , inside was spotless. Beautiful quiet neighborhood would definitely stay again ."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place is very comfortable and spacious. The heat,which we needed for our cool, rainy October weekend getaway was very easy to control and worked well. Well supplied both by John and previous guests. Nice area to drive around. The Saltwater Grille in Litchfield was excellent. Also, check out Espresso 59 in Litchfield. Not only pastries and caffeine. Also, really good soups and pot pies which we took out for quick, inexpensive meals. DIdn't meet John in person (no need), yet he was very friendly and responsive in the couple of phone calls we made to ask questions.
THere were just two of us, so it was a bit pricey but worth it. Would be great for two couples or a family."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"John was a fantastic host. This was our first time traveling out of state with our two year old so we were a bit nervous to begin with, but had to travel as we were in a wedding close by. John's house was super comfortable and had everything we needed and more to make our stay enjoyable. We were not expecting snacks, coffee, or any toiletries so that was a super appreciated touch. His home is cute and cozy and makes you feel right at home. Awesome place and host!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a great stay! The view was beautiful!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wow!!! Loved this stay! The place was cozy and also spacious. Everything we needed was there. The private beach was wonderful. our kids enjoyed swimming and we did some fishing too. John was very helpful and kind. We will definitely stay again if we are in the area!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"John’s place is nicely rennovated and appointed with well stocked kitchen including canned bubbly water, snacks, spices/herbs etc.
The bed is comfortable and he offers upgraded towels and toiletries!
Loved the outdoor seating & firepit complete with marshmellows for those of you with a sweet tooth!
Lastly, his place is across from a nice lake with beaches. He even provides kayaks/canoe for those wishing to do some paddling.
I would no doubt stay at his cottage again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed this excellent location, the house was very comfortable & had everything you could ask for. We spent five days visiting family and friends in Torrington and John's house was perfect. We took advantage of the kayaks and enjoyed walking the 2.5 mile loop around the lake. We've stayed in many Airbnbs and this was one of the best. John was a friendly & responsive host & is to be commended for the quality of the house. We will definitely be back if it's available next time we're in the area. Thank you John!"
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay for many of the reasons stated by other reviewers but feel it’s necessary to point out that the property has a water view but is not located directly on the lake (check out the overhead photo for a better representation).
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"Wonderful accommodation. One of the best equipped Airbnbs I have ever stayed in - wonderful coffee, snacks, toiletries. Great place to kick back around a camp fire on a nice night."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location and an amazing place
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved this little cottage.
Shower was so nice, I can’t say why but my family all loved it! Lots of options for soaps, etc, too.
Beds were comfy, including the little cot, and additional bedding was easy to find.
Laundry room—heck yes! So helpful. Washer and dryer were great, low chemical detergent included.
The owner was commincative whenever I had a question.
Kitchen was nicely stocked. Lots of pans, dishes, cups, even some basic cooking oils and herbs. Coffee and coffee maker. We did a decent amount of cooking without any problems. Fridge is small but sufficient.
We didn’t spend much time outside, but it was very cute and the lake is across the street. Very pretty in the fall!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect little house. Loved our stay.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at John’s cabin. The neighborhood was lovely and quiet. And the cabin was adorable, clean, and comfortable. John even left snacks on the counter and there was a water fountain and seltzers in the fridge, and as a breast feeding mother who gets hungry in the middle of the night, this was greatly appreciated. Unfortunately we did not get to utilize the beaches as we were just in town for a wedding but it was lovely to look at every time we drove by. We would definitely stay here again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay here. Very clean and beautifully furnished. The queen sized bed is super comfortable with lovely sheets and towels. The lake is very clean and great for swimming. Enjoyed the grill and the fire pit. Nice restaurants nearby. Will come back.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a really comfortable stay at John's property. This has got to be one of the cleanest ABNBs we've stayed at, was truly professionally cleaned before our stay. The lake beach is just a 30 sec walk from the property and was clean and safe. We loved building a small bonfire in the property's fire pit and making smores! Just wished we had discovered the kid's sand playing toys in the shed earlier- our 3yo would have loved building sand castles. Can't think of anything that needed improvement. Look forward to returning some time."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Really enjoyed John's lake house. Comfortable and cozy on the inside, and a nice yard with table and fire-pit. The proximity to multiple quiet beaches made it ideal for us and we had plenty to do for the 5 days we were there, including an outing on John's canoe. Community is well organized and keeps the beaches clean, with no motorized vehicles on the water! Its like a post-card photo in the morning."
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,John’s cottage by the lake is charming. It is well-appointed with the basic necessities and more! The bed and pillows are really comfortable. The yard where we hang out for barbecue was huge it felt so relaxing just hanging out by the fire. We are planning to go back to this place and enjoy Lake Harwinton again.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I loved this place! John provides EVERYTHING you can possibly need to feel comfortable and at home. I normally always bring my own toiletries but if you forget something, I’m sure John will have you covered. Such a peaceful place to really relax and really get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. If the weather is right make sure to take a dip in the lake. The beds were comfy, and if you’re wondering the shower pressure was on point! We hope to visit again soon! Don’t hesitate, book your stay you won’t regret it :)"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a great little house with access to three beaches on lake Harwinton. We only live in the next town over and needed a place to stay while having work done on our home. Check in was super easy, John pays attention to the little details. We were heading into a heat wave while we were there and the ACs kept the house cool. Also, having a washing machine and dryer was key! We loved having the firepit and chairs to sit outside (and a picnic table). Staying here was not only a better value than staying in a hotel, but it felt like being at home!"
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"The home was very cute and comfortable. John was a great host! He answered any questions we had and provided numerous snack and drinks for us. Check in was easy. We spent a few hours at the lake on the kayak and canoe and we loved it! It was a quiet and peaceful neighborhood, we would definitely stay here again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,A wonderful spot! John is a great host and has everything covered. We spent the week working remotely and still felt like we had a vacation. We felt comfortable from the minute we arrived and loved taking a swim every day. We'll definitely be back soon.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The home is comfortable. Absolutely love the lot. We spent evenings at the fire pit and had morning coffee overlooking the lake. Very quiet neighborhood for peaceful sleep. Wonderful break from city life. We'll be back on our next CT trip!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"John’s place was fantastic. He went over and above providing multiple amenities not found in most AirBnb stays. The bathroom drawers were full of all any possible toiletries that you may need. Not only did he provide top notch brands of shampoo and conditioner, he also provide FOUR different body wash scents. The kitchen had BOTH Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks coffee available, plus many snacks to tide you over after a long day of traveling., including a bottle of wine. The house itself was tastefully decorated and very welcoming. It was clear that the house had recently been refurbished, as it was a very old structure. All the renovations were done with great care and thought. As we were there on a business trip we did not have time to enjoy the outdoor amenities which include a kayak, an outdoor fireplace, and a lake just across the road. Check-in was easy as he provided a code for the door before our arrival. This place ticked all the boxes for the quick business trip we were on, as well as for a longer vacation type stay. As a superhost myself with two AirBnb units that we maintain… I can only say that John has been very successful in creating a welcoming and relaxing environment for his guests."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"John was an amazing host! The home was very clean and had everything we needed! Only a very short walk from the beautiful, clean beach! The water was clean and we enjoyed the swim! Unfortunately we were unable to use the kayaks, me and my mother enjoyed sitting outside enjoying the day! There are tons of things to do in the area and we were able to experience a few! We will definitely be back to this peaceful getaway!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely remodeled lake cottage (the kitchen with red cabinets was my favorite) in a serene, charming neighborhood. With only a step up from entry to kitchen and living room, it was fine for 75 year old me. There are three small beaches, and my granddaughter caught her first fish from one of them! We didn't have time for canoe, kayak, or pool noodles this time; a longer stay is in the plans! John was quick to respond to our questions, and checkin was simple. A great experience."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"John is a superb host. He met me at the property for a walk-through discussion of the area. Passes for parking and beaches will waiting for us. A cute little snack station with chips and nuts is there as is both Dunkin’ Donuts and Starbucks coffee. Spring water is available in the kitchen and every appliance that you could need for a comfortable cooking stay is there. I love to cook and bake. During my week there I used the griddle portion of the gas stove and I baked two loafs of bread in the oven. It’s lovely to have a washer and dryer available for use during the visit. Too. The bathroom is spacious with lovely bath supplies. I loved the little private beach a few steps away and visited almost daily. The outdoor property at this B&B is spectacular! It’s roomy and quiet with Gas grill, fire pit, ergo dynamic chairs for lounging, picnic table with umbrella and chairs around the fire pit…and fire starters! The thing I want is stress is that the entire beach association neighborhood is very quiet and friendly. This was R&R rest for me and I enjoyed the quiet, the sunsets, the beach, the walks, the fishing.
I cannot wait to return! 💕"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"John was a wonderful host. His communication with us was kind and helpful, and he had so many thoughtful touches around the Airbnb. I have a lot of dietary restrictions, so it was great to have a well-stocked kitchen. I also work in the sustainability field, so I appreciated that John had green/healthy cleaning and personal care products available—many brands that I use myself! The location is beautiful and worked perfectly for a wedding we were in town for in Litchfield. It was easy to park and get in, and the Airbnb is roomy and comfortable with A/C and nice furnishings. We would gladly stay here again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent place! Can’t wait to come back!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful home and location!! The home was welcoming, and it was spotless. It offered everything that one would need for a peaceful stay. The craftsmanship and amenities are very high end, and much better than any hotel or airbnb in which I have stayed. Don't wait to book or you will have missed a beautiful home."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The mountain escape was stunning! The house was very well kept, clean, and spotless when we arrived. The kitchen was stocked with a variety of appliances and had everything we needed. The bedroom was beautiful with its included loft and wonderful main bathroom.
Ralph and Jodi put their love into this house and I enjoyed my stay to the fullest. I would definitely recommend!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"we so enjoyed our stay. the house is beautifully appointed, squeaky clean, very comfortable, decorated with care and communication with the hosts was impeccable.
fantastic experience!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hands down the cleanest, well organized, comfortable airbnb we have ever stayed. The street is beautiful, calm and quiet. The curb appeal is perfectly done. Check in was a breeze. Upon stepping into the home I was relieved to see that the listing not only matched, but exceeded my expectations. The home looked as if it were brand new....as of that day, that is how clean, tidy and organized it was. You could clearly tell every single detail was perfectly planned out. There is nothing that was lacking. I also very much appreciated the snacks waiting for us, as we hadn't had a moment to eat and I was famished. The bed was truly perfect in comfort, we both slept as though we were at home. The tub was absolutely divine, I felt so pampered. My husband loved the variation of coffee offered. Every necessity has been thoughtful placed in the home. I appreciated being accommodated to stay an extra night, due to weather and really appreciated being able to do a quick load of laundry!!😊"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Blew me away!! Beautiful views and such a lovely house! Perfect for a weekend getaway!! Hosts were welcoming and accommodating. We will be back!!! 5 STARS!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved staying at Ralph and Jodis place. It was amazing and peaceful exactly what we needed. We will absolutely be coming back!!!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had an amazing time staying at your home place was exactly how they described it I have no complaints love how super clean everything was , the mattress and sheets were perfect and super comfortable and most of all the piece and quiet you get in this lovely home so glad I picked your home and definitely will return when I stay in Connecticut. Thank you"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Had a great time and plan on coming back!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Woo Hoo like hitting the jackpot. Pictutesque location. Like being in a 4 star hotel. High quality. N worth the price... We had a great time. Was concerned, being first time up here, but Jodie n Ralph communicated well. Eased concerns with checkin etc.. Really a first class place"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Who knew that the best Airbnb I’d ever stay in would be located within 45 minutes of home. We chose Jodi and Ralph’s immaculate Mountain escape for our getaway without having to “get away” and we could not have been happier with our choice. Not only was the home spotless (it truly looked as though we were the first people to have ever stayed there), but there so many special and thoughtful touches throughout that truly made the space feel like home. From the slippers left for our comfort, selection of toiletries left for our use, and fresh half and half left in the refrigerator for coffee, every aspect of the home is well thought out to make a guest’s stay easy and comfortable. Plus, Jodi and Ralph were so kind and super easy to communicate with (though there was nothing we ever needed to communicate with them about during the weekend). We wish we could have stayed forever! Thanks again, Jodi and Ralph!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,If you’re looking for an escape book with this house. Absolutely beautiful home with such a nice view and quiet area
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Peaceful. Kitchen had everything we needed. They had snacks set out when we arrived which was great for our late arrival. Thoughtful touches throughout. Nice home base for the area. Thanks!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a great stay! Amazing people! Were so helpful
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place - peaceful, comfortable. We came for a ""leaf peeping"" weekend and the fall colors were beautiful even from the porch yard. Lots of great state parks and cute old CT towns nearby. House is well equipped with everything you could need, bed super comfortable, lovely outdoor seating area. Highly recommend for a couple!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved staying here and will definitely be back.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed two nights while attending a wedding nearby. Ralph & Jodi's house is a beautiful place to stay. The house has all the amenities listed. The coffee and tea was a great treat. Everything is incredibly clean, well decorated, and thoughtful. The outdoor space is relaxing with great views. Do not hesitate to book this house. Thank you :)"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fabulous stay here. The place is gorgeous, clean, and peaceful. Everything was perfect. Mornings on the front porch, sipping coffee and watching the sunrise was the perfect way to start off the day. We needed a quick escape from the city and Ralph and Jodi's place over-delivered on that. The air smells fresh and amazing, the birds are flying around and singing, and everything about the location is just so peaceful. The home itself is beautiful inside as well. The kitchen is perfect, the decor is tasteful, the bathrooms are clean and upstairs has a great soaking tub, that, if you're into cold plunging, can easily be filled with just cold water for a convenient plunge. The bed and living room were very comfortable as well. Highly recommend this place!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This weekend was booked for our anniversary and we could not have picked a better place to stay. The house is located on a beautiful road and feels very private. The views are amazing and we especially enjoyed breakfast on the porch while watching the sunrise and the birds flying about. We’ll definitely be back!!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ralph and Jodi's pristine, beautiful house on Mountain Rd. could not have been better for our needs. It was pristine, full of luxurious amenities, such as a Japanese soaking hot tub/shower combo plus a separate half-bath downstairs, pristine, and had a super-comfortable mattress upstairs-the Number One need of an Airbnb traveler, and we slept like dogs. Many wonderful touches, including books on Torrington history, snacks when we arrived at midnight, stress-free, easy entry into the house without bothering the owners, and lovely outdoor furniture that we barely had time to enjoy on our quick trip but loved the few moments we had time to be out there. As I wrote in Ralph & Jodi's book, I honestly couldn't believe it was in Torrington. A bucolic setting with nothing across the street but a lovely pond and impressive stone walls. WOW."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying at this beautiful home and we definitely hope to be back! The house itself is immaculate, peaceful, and has amenities that make you not want to leave the property- even though there are plenty of restaurants and things to do near by (there’s a binder inside with a list of places/activities to do!). Our first stay was during the winter months so in comparison staying in the summer it was really nice to be able to sit out on the porch next to the blooming hydrangeas and read. The house is on a quiet road, but very close to near by towns so you don’t need to travel far to places. It is the perfect combo of feeling like you’re peacefully away from everything, but also right in the heart of everything. Would highly recommend staying here and hope you enjoy it as much as we do!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Ralph and Jodi were wonderful hosts - they went out of their way to ensure that our stay was comfortable and easy! The house is immaculate and extremely well appointed. We were easily able to self cater for the duration of our stay, with the exception of a very tasty breakfast at George's restaurant (c/o a $25 gift certificate that Ralph provided us with upon arrival!). The beds and bedding are very comfortable. The construction is brand new, with thoughtful design. While the description for this airbnb indicates a ""tiny house"", it's really quite commodious! The primary bedroom is spacious and boasts a desk, laundry, closet space for clothing, and a beautiful en-suite bathroom with a great shower and soaking tub. The lofted bed sits above the main bedroom and is accessed via a sturdy ladder with thoughtful handholds along the side and at the top to ensure safety and confidence in ascending and descending. The location provides ample privacy and lovely views. We would love to return!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is a beautiful hidden gem ! We absolutely loved our stay. If your looking for a relaxing calming home this is the one. Pictures doesn’t do justice! Thanks Ralph & Jodi for sharing this beautiful home with us. Will definitely come back.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The thoughtfulness behind every aspect of this home made it an exceptional stay! The house itself exceeded all possible expectations- warm/inviting beautiful layout, comfortable and luxurious amenities, spotless kitchen and bathroom. You can tell there is a lot of care that is put into the home from the hosts as well such as slippers provided as you walk in, snacks on the counter and plenty of recommendations of things to do in the welcome binder. Absolutely by far the best Airbnb we have stayed in and we are looking forward to returning!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a stunning gem! Brand new, immaculately clean, thoughtfully curated...Ralph & Jodi's home has all of the amenities of luxury hotel room, with the added bonus of privacy and beautiful surroundings. It provided a great home base as we adventured around the Litchfield Hills for an anniversary weekend. We will absolutely be back in warmer weather to take advantage of the beautiful patio and views!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful house . perfect for the family . recommend to everyone
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Brand new and beautifully and thoughtfully done. Everything about this spot is perfect and a wonderful rental. We have stayed at many air bnbs, this k e definitely top 3. You won’t regret it!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ralph and Jodi were wonderful hosts. Their place was absolutely perfect, and the views were gorgeous. The cleanliness was top notch and the details in the home were lovely. The complimentary toiletries and slippers were a very nice touch. We stood on my wife’s birthday weekend and they also gave us a nice gift and gift card. Highly recommend this spot, the pictures do not do it justice! It is very close to downtown Litchfield which has nice restaurants and shops. 10 out of 10!!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The home was perfect. It is essentially brand new construction and the hosts have thought of everything that one could need for a great stay. The home is outside of town so is quiet and peaceful with a nice view. Sorry that we weren’t able to enjoy the fire pit and the chairs on the patio.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect rental for me and my husband. We needed a place for a few days away and we got exactly what we needed. Very clean and exactly as described. Highly recommend if you’re in the Torrington area and need a place to stay!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Molly and Victor have a great setup here with this awesome apartment! Highly recommend this stay and hope to do it again in the near future!

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was very clean and a great space for a night in Torrington. I was very comfortable and had lots of space to stretch out after a long drive. The apartment was very clean and bed/couches were very comfortable which made it easy to rest after a long drive.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay at one of Molly's properties, and it did not disappoint. I have a new home away from home when I travel to Torrington."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Molly's place was perfect for our stay. Although located right on Main St, the bedroom is not noisy at all, but allows for walking access to restaurants and shops. Extremely clean, and communication with Molly was easy. I would definitely stay with Molly again in the future."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,This is the 2nd time I've stayed at this house with Molly and Victor. The first time in this particular unit and I absolutely loved it! It's huge and nicer than the pictures show. The kitchen is well stocked and there is even a separate little dining area. My favorite thing about this space though was that it's just a 10 minute walk to downtown. So I went out to a show at the Warner and didn't have to drive. Will definitely be staying here again when I am in Torrington.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Large, wonderful, bright apartment with great amenities. Molly and Victor’s place was impeccably clean and incredibly comfortable. Great location, easy walk to downtown, good cafes and restaurants. We are so happy we found this place!!!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I have nothing but good words to say. I agree with all the good things others have posted.
My unit in this house was well set up for my two month stay. I particularly loved that the kitchen was well equipped. That was so nice. And when I didn't feel like cooking, I loved that there were nice places to eat just a nice walk away. (If you like pizza, you'll love Sasso's!)
You really are located in the heart of the town and whatever you need is just a nice walk away. It's a very historic area of this town and walking around in the neighborhood in itself is very interesting and entertaining. And you can pick up some groceries while you're out.
For short term it is nice. For long term it's great!
Nothing but good things to say."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Had a long stay and really enjoyed the place. The backyard is peaceful, Molly & Victor are great hosts, and the space has everything you need. Would definitely recommend."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Booked this place for one night, totally last minute on July 4th wknd. Appreciated Molly's quick response for approval.
Place is super cute, tastefully decorated and very large for a one-bedroom. Bed was comfy. Had a small issue with the dryer and Molly came right over to help. Victor was also thankfully available, after I stupidly locked myself out of the unit in the morning.
The back garden is amazing! Walk all the way to the back and look at the creek. Overall, peaceful and affordable find!!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Great apartment with everything you could want. Molly and Victor are so helpful and quick to respond. We stayed 2 weeks whilst our daughter was at a summer camp, and the location and facilities were terrific. The back garden is beautiful too!"

We'll be back when we're in the area."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We 100% recommend Molly’s place! We felt very safe, the unit is close to everything, very clean and Molly is very responsive to any questions. If we are ever in the area again we will definitely book again."

We had coffee every morning on the balcony in the crisp fall air, enjoyed sitting by the koi pound in the afternoon sun and made s’mores over the fireplace at night! You don’t want to miss out!!"

We can recommend this accommodation and we will most probably come back, when we have to Torrington region again."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed my stay at this location. Unit was very welcoming. Bed, super cozy. Kitchen, fantastic. Grounds, wonderful! Especially enjoyed feeding the coy fish at the pond with the fish food Molly left for guests to use. Oh and a very luxurious shower, a bit small but also a bit indulgent (waterflow). Molly is super responsive and very kind to me when I messed up my booking details. Definitely recommended!!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was a wonderful place to stay. Molly was prompt with responses and had the place stocked with everything we needed when we arrived. The yard was beautiful, and my boys enjoyed feeding the fish daily! The apartment was perfect for two adults and two children. We utilized a blowup mattress and the futon, both provided by Molly. It was clean and true to photos. Key codes for exterior doors were nice for easy checkin and also secure but easy access. TV was easy to use while connecting to all of our providers from home. We will be back."

We were highly satisfied and will stay again with Molly and Victor when we’re in the area."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a beautiful place inside and outside.
They have a beautiful garden, that We enjoyed having coffee and listing to the birds every morning.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,So grateful to have found Alyse’s place—what a gem! The location was perfect and the space was exactly what we were looking for. Alyse was incredibly responsive and we really appreciated her flexibility with our (last minute) ask for an earlier check-in time. Everything was exactly as pictured/described and the layout is fabulous! Bed was super comfy and my 6’5 husband was incredibly grateful I finally booked an AirBNB with a bed he could actually fit on. We will absolutely be looking to book again in the coming months.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family loved our stay at Alyse’s property! It’s located in a great location with easy access to the center of Bantam, Bantam Lake and surrounding towns. The property was spotless and appears to be a new renovation. The beds were fantastic-seriously, I might need to know where Alyse got them because I slept so well! I appreciated that the kitchen had all the basics we needed and it was so nice to have smart plug extension cords by each bed!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,I loved every moment of my stay. I can hardly wait to return!!!

Jim is an excellent host - proactive, friendly, responsive and thoughtful - and the property was filled with not only the basics but thoughtful extras, from lots of spare linens and towels to welcome cookies and a pre-stocked fridge. We would happily stay again or recommend to others looking for a very user-friendly option in the Litchfield Hills!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I absolutely loved staying at Jim/Carol’s place by the barn! They went above and beyond. We were gifted pastries, including muffins, scones, chocolate, and a happy anniversary card. We met Carol at the barn / coffee shop / flea market, and it was so much fun. The location was great: lots of walking trails, coffee, ice cream, and Gilmore Girls towns nearby. I would come back here in a heartbeat!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jim and Carol are exceptional Airbnb hosts. Their place was clean, in good repair, well equipped, and beautifully situated yet still close to town. Communication was easy and expectations were more than met. We have stayed at many Airbnb locations over the past several years and this was by far the best we have encountered. I wish I could give this place more stars than 5 as it and our hosts certainly deserve them."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jim and Carol could not have been lovelier. A wonderful place to spend a weekend!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jim and Carol are amazing hosts. They answered our check in questions promptly and were so hospitable. They went above and beyond. Carol's homemade chocolate chip cookies and blueberry were amazing and a sweet touch. Very relaxing location and a perfect place for us to recharge for the rest of our trip. Quaint house and farm!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was such a pleasure to stay at Jim and Carol's lovely cottage. From booking to departure, Jim and Carol were attentive, welcoming, and so helpful. The house was beautiful: it was bright, clean, and in such a lovely and peaceful setting. My family and I felt safe and right at home from the moment we arrived - it was no surprise that we all slept peacefully. We enjoyed the baked goods from the Wright farm as well; it was a sweet little touch. I was even able to sit on the porch and read my book with a cup of coffee, in the morning sunshine. I can't remember the last time I was able to enjoy a moment like that. I would very gladly stay here again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This lovely, clean cottage is located on a peaceful, dead end country road across from an antique shop which is fun to visit. Everything you could need is supplied including a washer and dryer and, yes, even an iron and board! The hosts are very nice and immediately made us feel welcomed. It was a great stay!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a nice comfortable stay at Jim's. Besides being very tidy, the interior looks very new and fresh. The AC units are very quiet and kept the house cool during the hot weather. The queen bed felt like it had a memory foam mattress while the twin had a firm traditional mattress. No problem with hot water or water pressure for showers. We enjoyed the complimentary coffee and baked goods. Hopefully there will be availability if we visit the area in the future."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is the best Airbnb I have ever lived in. The room is very warm and all the facilities are complete, as comfortable as in my own home! The environment here is beautiful, and the landlord is super good. He has prepared delicious blueberry cakes and cookies for us. My child and I compete at the nearby golf course. The next stop is far away, and we can't leave with regret! I will definitely come back to live next year! Thank you to the landlord for keeping it for us to check out at 3 p.m.!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriend and I LOVED our stay at Jim’s, we wish we stayed longer! The house was so clean, cozy, and it felt like a home away from home! And with the rainy days we had, we enjoyed the small goodies and drinks left for us, such a sweet gesture! Love this place."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,This little home is immaculately clean and holds anything you might need to pass a lovely rainy evening like popcorn and games and movies and books … to a BBQ to grill on a sunny day. Simplistic and quiet. And fabulous home baked goodies too!

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jim and Carol's place was everything we'd hoped for and more. We came up from the city to have a cozy, peaceful ski getaway weekend and that's exactly what it turned out to be. When we first entered the house we were thrilled at just how cozy, warm and welcoming we felt right away. There were fresh homemade blueberry muffins and cookies waiting for us on the kitchen counter! They've thought of every little detail to make the experience comfortable, from the softest of tissue paper (it matters!) to warm air blowing on our toes at the sink (heat must come from under the cabinet around the kitchen) The view out the window was magical, snow falling on a beautiful field with birds feeding at a bird feeder.
The icing on the cake was getting to meet Jim and Carol at thier fantastic flea market right across the road in the barn. They are the real deal, truly golden people in every way. An experience we will not forget and can't wait to return to."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I've stayed here quite a few times now and each time is nothing short of delightful. Jim and his wife are wonderful hosts. I'll be back!

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second time at Jim's place and it won't be the last. Carol and Jim are the supreme hosts. Of the dozens of rental Airbnb rentals I've had over the years, of all kinds and all over the place, they are the most hospitable I have known. This place really does feel like going home."

The barn across the street, with a café and indoor flea market, is a must see!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jim's place was great. Myself, my wife and my adult son stayed for 3 nights and found it to be more than just a place to stay. The personal touches were everywhere, from the notes, to the homemade muffins and cookies to the care package for the ride home (thank you Carol). Jim and Carol made us feel right at home and went out of their way to accommodate us. Communication was superb, the house is cozy but very clean and neat, with a new bathroom and kitchen. The second bedroom has a twin bed which was a little small for my adult son and he was more comfortable on the couch with sheets and pillows supplied by our hosts. The surrounding farm and barn across the street (has an indoor flea market on Saturday and Sunday) make you feel like your transported back in time to a simpler age. We found Jim's place to be a great place to spend quality time with loved ones!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing spot and hosts! Highly reccomend
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jim and Carol are the nicest hosts! They left baked goods from their cafe, thoughtful notes, and a guide to restaurants and activities in the area. If you staying over a weekend, we definitely recommend checking out their cafe and flea market in the historic barn next door and saying hi. It's a beautiful drive there and the location is convenient to a few small town centers with shops and restaurants."

And the baked goods that were left as a surprise were amazing."

Due to omicron we did take out both nights (first night from Anthony’s, second night from YiaYia—both recommended). Saturday we hiked at Peoples State Forest and the enjoyed some delicious beer at Little Red Barn Brewers. Sunday we drove back with some delicious baked goods Carol and Jim sent us home with. Highly recommended!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house and hosts and perfect.

Thank you Jim and Carol"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location. quiet street. Close to town. Nice decorating touches as well. I will definitely stay here again when my work brings me to town!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Visited with myself, my wife, and our 5 year old son. The location couldn't have been better, and the hospitality of the hosts made us feel immediately at home just minutes after arriving.
The pictures of the landscape around the house don't do it justice; it was an absolute treat to get to sit outside and enjoy the scenery at every meal. The outdoor table is located under a large tree that provides excellent shade, and the backyard is very large allowing for any sort of outdoor activity you can imagine.
All in all we loved our stay, and I wouldn't be surprised if we find ourselves staying here again!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,We quite enjoyed our time in this quaint farmhouse. Baked goods arrived throughout our stay—wonderful touch. Proximity to attractions in Connecticut and the Berkshires made it a great location.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here! We wanted an escape from NYC and just to be somewhere quiet for a girls trip. This was the perfect backdrop to our weekend. We spent mornings and evenings just sitting outside watching the birds, chipmunks, and bunnies. Check in was a breeze and the space felt cozy and private. Thank you for everything!!! Hope to visit again soon!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a beautiful piece of property! They could’ve stuck me in a cardboard box with those views to wake up to and I’d have been happy. Great, clean, spacious little home with everything we needed. Jim & Carol are so sweet and hospitable. Went there to work and be out of the city and it was perfect. My daughter loved the yard space. Would book again!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect house with a great yard. Hosts took good care of us.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had such a lovely time here!! The location is perfect, the house was so tidy, and Jim and Carol were so gosh darn sweet.

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great getaway on an idyllic farm, this is probably one of the best Airbnbs I've ever stayed in. Jim and Carol are wonderful hosts who are both super helpful (we got great local hiking and restaurant suggestions) but also leave guests with their privacy. My partner and I arrived to delicious homemade muffins and snack bars in the kitchen, and they even made extra biscuits when they found out I had an egg allergy. Since we stayed during the week, we weren't able to visit the cafe or flea market, but we definitely would love to return on a weekend to check those out. The heat and A/C both work great, and the house is tidy and clean. Highly recommended!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lovely and quiet spot in Torrington. The house is super clean and tidy, but it truly feels like home when you walk in the door. The treats and beverages were really appreciated! Jim and his wife obviously take good care of the house- and the cafe and flea market they own is a must-see on weekends. The house has a lovely view and a nice outdoor space as well. I was really pleased with my stay and would definitely return!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ah, peace and quiet Ah, green and flowers Ah, woods and squirrels living in a piece of history. Charming, beautifully maintained and stylishly decorated farmhouse which has almost everything the guest wants.
For the moment we talked in Jim’s house, his scrumptious and satisfying cookies really uplift our whole day. In addition, his family prepared us one more surprising gift - blueberry muffins - extra-large and yummy with the sugary-cinnamon crumb topping. Great hospitality I never ever enjoyed in my entire Airbnb experience.
Furthermore, Jim helped lend me ties to solve my last-minute headache, so I had a terrific presentation for my daughter's graduation ceremony at Kent School. Our family really enjoyed our stay - a great place to relax and reset ourselves – a true love home away from our own house.
Superior host! Two thumbs up!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jim’s guest house is a perfect weekend getaway. The sunrise over the field was delightful on this quiet little street. Jim was extremely communicative with clear concise directions for check in and check out. If I’m ever back in the area I would definitely look to stay again!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Terrific stay. The house is very cozy and everything is clean and good order. The area has a done to do and make sure to say hello to Jim and Carol who run the Airbnb, they are lovely to chat with! The baked goodies (blueberry muffins, cookies and scones) all made the stay that much better.
Make sure to check out the flea market across the street!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jim and Carol made sure that we had a comfortable stay. The cottage is clean, quiet and peaceful. We loved the fact that it is on their own little road with their antique shop and cafe. It was a lovely atmosphere. We would love to go back someday!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay here. Our children enjoyed roaming the fields and the woods nearby. Jim and Carol were spectacular hosts. They communicated before our arrival and were very considerate of our children. When we arrived there were freshly baked cookies and muffins that were delicious as well as two activity books for the children. They were kind enough to let us know when deer were in the fields- it was a sight that was really special for us. The house was cozy, clean, and charming. There were many thoughtful touches around the home- many interesting books and family games. Jim and Carol were very responsive and made us feel very welcome. They offered early check in and late check out without our asking. We left on a cold windy day and Carol was considerate enough to drop off a care package for our return home. We had an amazing stay in Torrington, mostly due to the peaceful and private stay at this home."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jim and Carol were excellent hosts. They were so welcoming and hospitable, and they responded quickly to any questions that we had. And they left us sweet treats!We would definitely recommend!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jim's home was absolutely perfect for our family of three little weekend getaway from the bustle of city life :) The home was stocked with games, books, movies, TV, kitchenware, linens/towels, fresh baked pastries, tea, Keuring coffee, and a helpful local guidebook so we were comfortable when we wanted to stay in. For the times we went exploring, the hiking trails, bigger towns, dairy farms, bison farm, and restaurants were just a 10-25 minute drive away. Jim was always available to answer my questions and was very flexible with check-in/check-out times, which is helpful when you have a young child. I highly recommend staying at Jim's home :) My family and I want to visit again in the summer! Thanks so much for everything!!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jim and Carol’s home was cozy, comfortable, and clean – perfectly suited for a weekend getaway. The kitchen had everything we needed for cooking, the main bed was comfortable, and the living room was pleasantly adorned with coffee table books. Jim was responsive and helpful, offering suggestions for hikes in the area when asked. Carol is a wonderful baker, and was so sweet to provide us with baked treats on arrival. In all, a great weekend stay!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jim’s place was a very cozy get away for a weekend ski trip. Home had all basic amenities needed for our stay. Host was easy to reach out to and made sure we were comfortable. Would definitely recommend to other guests.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"wonderful airbnb and responsive and caring hosts. Fresh baked scones, cookies and bars awaited us in the kitchen. Jim even lent us snow shoes so we could explore the White Memorial Conservation Center. We loved getting a chance to see their antiques barn and cafe as well."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This rental is a perfect getaway from the city! It isn’t too long of drive and the owners are amazing! Very responsive (they provided their cell number and were in the cafe across the street if we needed anything), beautiful home and so warm and toasty during the winter. Additionally, their cafe and antique shop across the street is AMAZING! All the vendors are really sweet and we were able to find newspaper articles from the 50s! Seriously an incredible stay and I can’t wait to come back in the summer.
P.S. As all the other reviews mentioned, the baked goods are delicious! I definitely recommend buying from the cafe before heading home to enjoy later and remember your wonderful trip."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My son and I wanted a place that was primarily near mohawk mountain (where we wanted to go skiing). We needed enough space so we can attend school / work during the day, and go skiing in the afternoon / evening. This place exceeded all of our expectations.
As a host, Jim was beyond accommodating. On our first day, we arrived many hours early. Jim openly communicated with us, told us we can arrive anytime since the place was ready. As soon as we pulled in, he met us in the driveway and helped us get situated. He even suggested we park in the barn (it was snowing hard). Throughout our stay, Jim continued to be an excellent host: he communicated with us whenever there was an issue (the internet service dropped out at some point due to the snow storms, we got regular updates from Jim via cell/sms). My son needed some paper for a homework assignment, Jim provided some. Each day, he dropped off some delicious snacks (cookies, cupcakes, etc.) Every time it snowed, our walkway was shoveled before we even dared peak outside, much less actually go outside. I have yet to meet such a responsive and attentive host. Thank you!
The place itself is also sweet: The place has been renovated: all the windows and outlets and lights and bathroom are brand new, everything is really clean. Each closet is full of all the supplies that we needed, e.g. plenty of extra towels, napkins, Kleenex, cleaning supplies, blankets, coffee (both decaf and regular), anything we needed and beyond, was already there. And, there were plenty of extra touches all around: kit kat chocolates in the living room, extra half/half in the fridge, etc.
We'll definitely be back."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,The cottage is perfectly situated on an old dairy farm that provides a classic and cozy landscape for any season in Connecticut. The cottage itself is very comfortable and sweet & our hosts were wonderful. They thought of every detail and treated us like old friends from the start. We loved staying here over the holiday season & highly recommend it.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place to get away for a weekend trip. The house was cute and quaint and had all of the amenities one could possibly need. There were even some homemade treats left by Jim and Carol upon our arrival, which added to the great hospitality already displayed. The location was central to everything we wanted to do: wineries, downtown, restaurants. Such a lovely weekend spent in Connecticut. Won’t be our last visit that’s for sure!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for a “ladies weekend”. The quiet setting, and honey accommodations were perfect for relaxing getaway. A cute place on a beautiful piece of property. The hosts were more than cordial, and even left fresh baked cookies and muffins for us."

2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I've had the pleasure of staying at tens of airbnbs at this point, throughout the US and abroad, and I am confident in saying Jim's place is in the top 3 (if not top 1) I have experienced. The location is absolutely beautiful, on a quiet road, with great views of fields and nature. Jim and his wife are fantastic hosts: they provided almost immediate responses, helped me out with some questions I had ahead of time, and then were extremely kind once we arrived (e.g. they knew it was my wife's birthday, and were kind enough to leave a birthday card for her). This is a 10/10 listing and I cannot emphasize enough how great it was. I highly recommend for anyone looking to explore some of the natural beauty in CT."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A well kept, cozy cottage that is the perfect place for a getaway. The house was sparkling clean and the bathroom looks brand new. We were greeting with pumpkin cookies and blueberry cupcakes. The house is easy to find the hosts are extremely attentive. Would definitely stay here again."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at this little house was a very comfortable and peaceful two days. The place is freaking adorable and the farm surrounding it really gives you an experience of quite country life. Jim and his wife were extremely accommodating to us as we both got locked out and lost the keys right before we were going to leave. Yet we felt nothing but sweetness from our hosts.
We eventually found the keys (on top of the car go figure) and were still treated to the most delicious lunch at the barn cafe (open on saturdays and Sundays)! Oh ya, I almost forgot the complimentary pumpkin cookies that didn't last the ride home.
Very nice people and an excellent location."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This house is perfect for a small group. It's well kept and the hosts are very nice.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My first time in an Airbnb, and Gwen's place will certainly set the standard for comparison for the future. When I arrived, it was easy to access, and while there is a winding staircase, there was more than adequate room to fit my luggage. When I opened the door, I immediately saw the pristine kitchen with a full refrigerator, stove, microwave and even a toaster oven for cooking. a Keurig unit plus some K cups, tea, sweeteners. There was also silverware, cups, glasses, plates and everything you need to serve a. Cleaning supplies and everything else was included. The living room was stocked with games and there was free Netflix as well, but I couldn't find mainstream network and cable channels. There are 5 bedrooms in this unit, and the doors can be locked, so 1 person or a family can stay just by unlocking the number of doors needed. Great bath with a coin washer and dryer as well. fully stocked with personal items! I will definitely return when I return to Torrington!"
