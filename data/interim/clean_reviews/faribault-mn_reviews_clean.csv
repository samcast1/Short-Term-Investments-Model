2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,beautiful home lots of twin beds for a large group gathering. beautiful kitchen multiple sitting areas. I'm already considering rebooking for a family gathering in the future
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,great house
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Great house. Very good location - quiet neighborhood near enough to downtown that we could walk to restaurants. LOTS of space inside the house and everything was very clean. Also very nice to have plenty of bathrooms. Kitchen was fully stocked (coffee maker etc) and having Heggies Pizza in the freezer is a great idea.
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"We rented the whole house for our staff running a camp nearby. It was a great and pretty place to stay right next to the old stone chapel. No problems, nice rooms, well stocked, like a little boutique hotel."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,This place was THE PERFECT PLACE to stay with my bridesmaids the night before my wedding. We had thee most AMAZING morning getting ready.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"A simply wonderful and fun place to have a group of people. Our son's wedding was in DT Faribault and we had a LOT of family and friends coming from out of the state and country. The house is the former rectory to an old church so it has a plethora of rooms and unique spaces. The updates and remodeling that has been done is sensitive to the original design. The kitchen is wonderful and the outdoor areas were perfect to get our group together. Just a gr8 experience. Thx, Lynn!"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"A stayed at Lynn's place while we were out for a family reunion. Our extended family of 10 felt right at home and the place was PERFECT. Lynn was proactive and everything was spotless and cozy. Lynn was available, but never intrusive. We felt cared for, but private.
We ended up having a fire in the backyard firepit, cooking in the kitchen and playing games at the big table. Although we had 9 people staying in the house - it was big enough to offer plenty of quiet and privacy if you needed to get a little ""me time"". We did get a little rowdy playing games, but the house was so big and solid, we didn't wake up those that were sleeping. In short, the house could not have been more perfect.
The area was fantastic as well! We walked a few blocks to the farmers market, brew pub, park and charming downtown.
We left with incredible memories and can't thank Lynn enough for sharing her home with us."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,It was bigger than I thought! Felt like we had a huuge but still cozy and homey space! I rented for me and my bridesmaids the night before to wedding to relax and it was so cute and perfect and even got great pics of my dress hanging!
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Excellent!
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful home with plenty of space to spread out. My family of ten very much enjoyed our stay!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place for our family of four to stay for 17 days! So much room to spread out and cozy places to hangout together when we wanted. Extremely clean! We would definitely stay again!
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Our group of 12 guys loved the house! It was the perfect lodging for our golf weekend. There’s plenty of room to spread out without feeling cramped. It also contains several places to all gather together for meals or relaxing. We really enjoyed the private backyard where we grilled out and played yard games. Thanks for helping to make the weekend so enjoyable!

2022-09-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful house! Lynn is very easy to communicate with and the house had everything we needed and more.
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,This house is absolutely perfect. I have stayed overnight in just one room and now have rented the whole house with extended family - 10 people. It is wonderfully roomy. The bedrooms are large and so so quiet. The kitchen is very well-equipped; we baked a cake! We had a barbecue for our daughter’s graduation with about 30 people on the back patio area. It was perfect. Lynn even messaged to see if we would like extra chairs which she brought out for us. I wholeheartedly encourage you to stay here!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lynn has a uniquely wonderful house. It was unanimous among the guests I brought. The house was a hit and definitely worth it.
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"The house was beyond perfect for celebrating my grandpa’s birthday! We had 3 cars of family who traveled from Wichita, KS to Faribault so my grandpa could be near and see all of his sisters while celebrating his 90th. This was the perfect gathering place and we couldn’t have asked for better weather or location. The rooms were all so cozy, we loved the touches of history, and the kitchen was amazing for cooking meals at the house. It is such a beautiful home and we’ll definitely recommend it to others!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Was a great place to stay for our softball tournament. Very clean, thorough walk through, and very nice host! Definitely would recommend and stay again."
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,"The House Next Door was the perfect place to gather 10 of the ladies from my family for a weekend. We enjoyed the well equipped kitchen, the spacious dining room and the comfortable gathering spaces. The bedrooms were quiet and the beds comfortable. There were extra blankets, lots of towels, soap and shampoo. Everything was clean and well maintained. We were even lucky enough to have a beautiful day to sit outside in the courtyard and enjoy the fall colors. The location is within walking distance of some good restaurants and a fun downtown area. We would all recommend a stay at the House Next Door."

We appreciated the homey feel of the fully stocked kitchen, plenty of blankets and towels, and easy to find cleaning supplies.
Thanks for letting us rent this house!"

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent accommodations
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,"The House Next Door did not disappoint. Our whole family relaxed in comfort both inside and out, taking advantage of the many rooms for needed privacy and personal space, and using the common areas to converse and enjoy each other's company. Lynn was helpful during check-in and available throughout our stay. Worth every penny."

2020-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Huge house! Great for hosting a group of ladies for a night away and everyone gets their own bed!
2019-06-01,5,Group trip,"This house is an incredible time piece, beautifully appointed. We stayed there for Carleton's graduation weekend, 8 of us for 2 nights and 9 for one. Lots of places to sit inside and out Almost all twin beds. My husband and I slept in the lower double bunk in the back room on the 2nd floor. We enjoyed our stay very much. A unique opportunity."
2019-05-01,4,Group trip,"The only thing we was a little disappointed about was in the description of the property it said we would be renting the entire home. But upon arrival we was told that we would have to share the common areas of the home Living room, kitchen and bathrooms And someone would be staying downstairs.. and to top it off, Saturday we was planning on having a barbecue with the team in the backyard and come to find out the backyard was being occupied by a baby shower that was never announced to us during the rental process of this Airbnb.. So this house should be marked as a shared home, not the entire home.."
2018-12-01,5,Group trip,"We found that ""The House Next Door"" in Faribault worked well for our gathering over Christmas. We had 8 people staying overnight in the house, and as many as 19 (total) for some of the meals at the house. The house is very spacious, with seating areas in four or five places around the house. The dining room table held eight or ten. We found that we could easily sit and visit without it becoming too noisy in any one place. There were a huge number of Christmas decorations, including outside decorations and two Christmas trees. The kitchen had a dishwasher that was so quiet that we had to put a hand on the front to feel the vibrations, to make certain that it was really operating. The kitchen was well furnished with supplies of all kinds."
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lynn is a great host! She made us feel like we at home away from home!
2018-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It's true the pictures don't do this house justice. Much larger than expected and oh so much fun! The perfect place to relax and spend time with family, without feeling like you're crowded or can't have some privacy. Lynn was gracious and quick to respond. We will definitely be back."
2018-08-01,5,Group trip,"Lynn’s house was beautiful, unique and had lots of character. It was very spacious and comfortably accommodated our large group. Lynn responded in a timely manner to all communication and was very forgiving when we made an error during checkout. Thanks Lynn!"
2018-08-01,5,Group trip,Probably one of the coolest houses I've ever seen!
2018-08-01,5,Group trip,"This house is both beautiful and functional. The website does not do this house justice, and the house exceeded our expectations in terms of beauty, size, and amenities. Lynn was charming and gracious."
2018-08-01,4,Group trip,The house is very clean and the host is very welcoming and helpful. Lovely patio and nice kitchen. We were asked to use the refrigerator in the garage which was somewhat inconvenient . Also were not informed the basement tenant shared the kitchen with us. Somewhat awkward to have him show up in the middle of a family gathering or breakfast to cook his meals. Otherwise enjoyed our stay.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is a true one-of-a-kind experience. It was such a comfortable and beautiful setting and the lake view was incredible. Our hosts were kind and accommodating and had great recommendations. We would definitely recommend!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot speak highly enough about Kim and her family's tiny house! It was clean, cozy, practical, and full of delight. Kim called once I arrived to check in on me and make some local recommendations. She was very considerate and made the experience feel personalized. The little cabin is a perfect space to retreat and is so full of love and thoughtfulness. Even though neighbors are close, you still get the experience of peaceful solitude. I enjoyed my time reading, relaxing, sitting by the fire, and kayaking on the lake. The tiny house is an exercise in living simply yet having everything you need. The cost is also very reasonable considering the included amenities. (It's outrageous how much it can cost to rent a kayak!) Could not recommend enough."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best Airbnb experience ever! (and we stay in a lot of them).
Everything about the stay was prefect. More than a Tiny Home, a BIG experience!
My husband and I stayed a couple of days. He enjoyed being able to fish at the lake I enjoyed the paddle boat and relaxing in the hammock.
Though it is a tiny house, it had everything we needed. Decor was so cute and boho. Comfy bed, hot shower with great water pressure.
Kim was an excellent host! The attention was in the details. Loved the little notes throughout the house, The plants, The handmade organic soap! We went to the coffee shop she recommended and did some shopping. She truly made us feel like we were a guest in her home and wanted us to have the best time!
The lake was awesome. Great lake community and beautiful scenery. I'm already planning our next stay!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tiny House living was a perfect way to ride out the spring snowstorm. Cozy and convenient, with just enough space to relax and watch the blizzard. We enjoyed finding the tiny music boxes and being creative with limited space. Plus the outside space provided adventure to our stay - patio Happy Hours with the fireplace roaring - snow, rain, or sunshine! The diversity and history of Faribault was a wonderful surprise! The bench tour and murals are fantastic.
Thank you for sharing your Tiny House!"

I’d love to stay here again in the warmer months!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had a wonderful time staying at this beautiful tiny home on the lake. I couldn't have asked for a better place with breathtaking sunsets every evening and a warm cozy home to hang out in and write to my heart's content. The local restaurants and the Faribault Woolen Mill are well worth visiting as well.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a fun stay, the place is extremely peaceful! If you’re looking for a getaway not too far from the cities I highly recommend.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I spent a weekend retreat at Kim’s place and had the best time. Kim had excellent recommendations for restaurants in the area and we loved the view from the tiny house. Although the weather was too cold for any lake activity, we still enjoyed the scenery from the shore and hope to come back in the summer. Our favorite local restaurants were Janna’s Market and Grille (the owner was just the sweetest!) and Redemption (such good food and service and the atmosphere was fantastic). Faribault had so much to offer and Owatonna was a great place to scope out as well. Since we came over a holiday weekend, many places of interest were closed, but we plan to return again to see more of the things to do in the area. We highly recommend this terrific tiny house!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"absolutely beautiful tiny home right on the lake, couldn't ask for a more peaceful setting for a getaway not too far from home!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This tiny house exceeded my already high expectations. Cute as a button, very clean, comfortable, gorgeous surroundings and an easy drive to town. The mattress was great, I did not have any back pain or discomfort (a common problem with mattresses when I travel). The shower is awesome: there is a tankless water heater and good water pressure, so if you have long, very thick hair like me, I’m happy to say that you’ll be able to rinse it very well AND not worry about running out of hot water. The natural light is amazing, loved all the plants. I also made good use of the deck and outdoor fire. This was perfect for one person, I plan to return for another me-weekend. Thanks so much to the wonderful host, Kim!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderfully relaxing stay. Can’t recommend enough.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you have never tried tiny house this is a must! The location was beautiful and the house had everything we needed. My husband was able to do some work remotely as a trade off for spending an extra day there. The host was super helpful and friendly. We visited a couple of local breweries, distilleries, restaurants, and parks for hiking and picnics. We also spent plenty of time next to the fire on the deck watching the lake and enjoying nature. Absolutly perfect! We will definitely go again when the weather allowes us to go out on the lake!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing and relaxing!! Loved the tiny house feel!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as in the photos. Beautiful tiny home with a lakeside view, we had a great time at Kim's place. Highlight were the trails at the nearby Riverbend Nature Center"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a lovely time getting to spend time by myself as a birthday gift. The ride down from the Twin Cities was easy and straightforward with stops by a few shopping areas.
Once you get there, there is a clear parking spot with stairs leading down to the house. The outside space is spacious and includes the area down to the left, the yellow dock. The tiny home itself is easy to access. It was easy to cook and clean with the given utensils and supplies. Surprisingly the bathroom doesn’t feel that small. I really enjoyed the loft area and since I am short, was able to sit up with plenty of head space. I loved being able to read in the hammock with its view of the lake and when it got dark, stargazing. Overall, I enjoyed my time alone with this tiny home.
Kim, the lovely host gives recommendations for additional activities in the area. She’s quick to respond and easy to talk to.
I had a lovely time and would definitely recommend."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed here for our 1 year wedding anniversary, and it was absolutely wonderful. The tiny house itself is wonderfully set up, cozy, and had everything we needed. The large deck with a fire pit, lounge chairs and a grill was excellent for relaxing and being outside—as were the swinging bench and hammock. We used the pedal boat and kayaks and had an amazing time on the lake. Kim was a lovely host, and went above and beyond to ensure we had a great stay. She had wonderful recommendations and was extremely kind and responsive. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone looking for a charming getaway!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and relaxing location on the water. We loved the hammock overlooking the water, it was a nice quiet and private spot to relax and have morning coffee.
Great location, feels peaceful and private but also close to town and hiking. We didn’t get a chance to go out on the water, but kayaks and a paddle boat were available. Tiny house was very clean and had everything we needed, and also a very nice outdoor space. Spent most of our time out there, especially in the evenings. Host was amazing and attentive. Had an awesome and relaxing mini-getaway.
Downtown, we loved Janna’s place for brunch/breakfast and they’re amazing, made-in-house desserts with gluten free options."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kim is a very friendly and easy to work with host. The tiny house was exceptionally clean and had everything we needed for our long weekend.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim has added so many thoughtful touches to The Tiny. She is a wonderful host, gave local recommendations, and was extremely responsive. There were helpful and cute post-it notes added throughout the cabin as well. We really enjoyed our getaway here!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We went on our one year anniversary trip! We wanted to be tourists in a random town. We recommend Redemption, 10,000 Drops distillery, Corks and Pints, and Jana’s Market Grill. We loved the Tiny House it made you love the simplicity of it. Highly recommend!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim was a lovely, friendly host! The tiny house was very clean and it provided everything we would ever need!! Fun experience!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect get away location! Quiet, private, beautiful, serene….the ideal location to unplug from the world for a couple of days. Had everything I needed to enjoy my stay to the fullest. The lake was not very busy, so sitting on the deck enjoying the view and reading was the bulk of how I spent my time. However, the location is only 5 minutes from town if you want to shop, eat and/or be social. The tiny house was cozy and comfortable, both inside and out.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at the tiny cabin was so great!!! Kim was very helpful with suggesting things to do around faribault and the lake was so quiet and relaxing! I loved how clean everything was and how Kim explained where to find everything inside the cabin!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim’s tiny home was truly a magical experience for my partner and I. It’s secluded on the lake just enough for privacy but we also felt safe being within a neighborhood. The tiny looked just like the pictures, clean and beautifully decorated, and truthfully as taller people we had way more room than expected! The loft was super cute and the bed was so comfy, having the TV just above the bed made us feel so spoiled😂 Our visit was in July so the heat and humidity were high, but the AC in the tiny home worked amazing and things cooled off overnight. We sat out every night on the giant deck and used the gorgeous fire pit (wood provided!). It was SUCH a peaceful getaway. Having our own dock on the lake and paddle boat was incredibly fun as well! The home was beyond gorgeous and Kim really thought of everything one could need and was super responsive to any questions we had. We felt like we were in our own little fairy house, I would recommend to anyone looking for a unique getaway!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I had such a splendid time celebrating 10 years married!!

Communication with Kim was easy and she responds right away.
The inside is equipped with everything you need for a relaxing vacation. The personal touches around the tiny home are very thoughtful and all the plants make the space feel much larger than it is. The outdoor space has everything from a large deck, lounge chairs, hammock, grill, kayaks, paddle boat, and dock into the lake.

All the decorations are darling and artistic. Be sure to check out their story in the book ""Turning Tiny"" -- SOO inspiring!!

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The tiny house was beautiful! You could tell that Kim went a long way to make it feel like a home away from home.

We are telling everyone we know to check it out, it was such a comfortable and wonderful stay for our elopement. That being said… the neighbors are close and loud. They were constantly walking right through the property, luckily not during our ceremony! I can handle a little noise but at one point when we were sitting on the deck, someone walked over took a leak about 20ft away from us. We’d still come back, just maybe on a week day instead!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay! Kim was a wonderful host, she arrived shortly after we did to welcome us and show us around. I loved all of the details, such as lights around the house at night, multiple seating areas on different levels, eco friendly hand & dish soap, notes around the house, a small wren house with baby birds. We loved kayaking and tried the paddle boat. My favorite was early in the morning sitting either out on the dock steps or by the fire pit with a cup of coffee or hearing the rain out the loft window at night. We brought our bikes for the Sakatah trail, rode 25 miles, came back and fell asleep on the hammock. Couldn't have wished for any better of a time."

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This tiny house is something very special. Kim and her family have put such thoughtful touches throughout the space, making it so warm and cozy. The home offers a beautiful view of the lake and is a great spot to watch both the sunrise and sunset. Kim was very considerate of our time and space, and was extremely responsive starting from the time we made our reservation to the end of our stay, helping us immediately address any concerns we had. The reading nook was so cozy, and the leisure loft was stocked with fun activities to keep us occupied. If you're willing to brave the winter weather, you can enjoy a nice fire out on the deck. If you're planning on cooking, the kitchen is stocked with the essential tools (one thing to keep in mind is that there's a small toaster oven, not a full-size oven, if that's something you need). Overall, a wonderful space to relax."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic time, enjoying the view of the lake, and the different parts of the house. It is so cute!

She sets you up so that from the moment you arrive until the moment you leave, you are all set. However, IF you should need anything, she is readily available and makes that very clear. From my initial booking, her response times were impressive and that was consistent from the initial communication until the follow up after my amazing stay. I plan to return again in 2022!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kim was such an attentive host! She went above and beyond to make our weekend perfect! The tiny house is so clean and cute! You can truly feel the love when you stay at Kim's place! We are so thankful!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such an amazing experience at this tiny home! Would recommend to anyone and everyone who loves tiny homes! There’s so many fun little secrets and what not within the place which makes for an added fun bonus. Stayed in the winter and was the coziest place. Kim was a great host, giving us all sorts of fun recommendations to make our stay all that much better!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first time ever using Air BnB and this was the best experience we could have ever had! The space was beautifully designed with so many personal touches. I loved the aromatherapy diffuser, pillows in the leisure loft, and homemade hand soap. The location was absolutely divine right on the water. We went just as the lake was freezing over so it was fun to watch it freeze a bit more each day. We grilled every night on the gas grill and made fires in fire pit when the wind allowed. We brought an entire thanksgiving dinner (turkey breast, potatoes, sweet potatoes, stuffing,gravey) and it all fit in the mini fridge. I’m glad I pre-cooked though because there are a total of 3 burners (counting the bonus one attached to the grill) so cooking that much from scratch would have been challenging to time. We were initially nervous about how much hot water there would be, but were pleasantly surprised that there was more than enough for two consecutive showers. The space was perfect for the two of us (medium sized adults) but I could see it being a bit too small for a group larger than two. Just an FYI, for those who might have mobility challenges, doing stairs is absolutely necessary to access the houses. The only way to access the loft is by ladder, and the only way to get to the leisure loft is to crawl along a “hallway” on hands and knees. We loved the adventure and the space!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This tiny house is an incredible value with an even more incredible experience. Between the cozy loft and exceptional views of the scenario, we couldn't have asked for a better stay!! Kim is the go-to hospitality expert when getting to know Faribault!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I spent 4 days and 3 nights at this location and it was all wonderful! It’s a perfect place for a peaceful getaway. Kim, our host was very friendly and gave us lots of recommendations for exploring the area! We would definitely recommend this location!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It's an amazing Tiny Home, Kim is so welcoming with her presence as well as putting so many little notes around for you, setting up everything for you if you want a fire, etc. All the little things that matter, Kim and her space provide. We couldn't ask for anything better for a small get away!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The tiny house is exactly as described. Cute, clean and comfortable. It’s small- tiny in fact! But manages to fit all the modern conveniences. We enjoyed the novelty of staying in this compact vacation home."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! Where do I begin…what an amazing tiny home and equally amazing family hosting it! Booking this home was easy and Kim did an excellent job communicating before, during, and after the stay. Upon our arrival to the tiny home after a long day at work, Kim had made a special trip to the tiny home to turn on the heat and some lights!! Extremely welcoming host and space. The next morning, Kim stopped by following our welcome to say hello! Our stay at this tiny house was in celebration of our 2nd wedding anniversary, 5 years together. My husband also dreams of building a tiny house of our own! Kim was wonderful about answering my husband’s many tiny house questions. Hearing her first hand experience and what they have learned was priceless. Kim also gave us lots of great recommendations for food and fun in the area. The tiny house is a warm, cozy space full of natural wood, bright colors, and beautiful house plants. The attention of detail is splendid. Little things like the tiny fan in the loft where you sleep and soaps & q-tips in the bathroom made our stay ideal. Only trick is no oven (there is a small toaster oven) so we ended up making lasagna on the wonderful grill that is provided. Wood and fire pit are also provided. The mattress in the loft was surprisingly comfortable! The tiny house is surrounded by a beautiful deck overlooking the lake. We didn’t want to leave and hope to be back! Bless this Tiny House!!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is such a gem! It is a perfect little getaway place right on the water and hidden from the world . We used every area outside like the deck, hammock, fireplace...Kim is a great host and so helpful with her suggestions on what to do and where to go."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It is quite a different and fun experience to stay at a tiny home. It is very nicely decorated and set up and the deck and dock are beautiful, too. Thank you to Kim for being such a great and communicative host. We loved of the wonderful recommendations from her!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great deck and view of lake. Has a nice place for an outdoor fire and grill to meet all cooking needs. Great intro to what tiny house living is all about with great indoor accommodations.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was amazing. The best Airbnb that we've been to. Design, warmth, hospitality, thoughtfulness were immaculate. Resources, supplies, suggestions for activities and places to eat were wonderful. Kim was so personable with her handwritten notes, welcoming us in person, and detailed touches throughout the home. Rewarding mini-discoveries everywhere. The location on the lake is amazing, along with dock, paddleboat, and kayaks. Comfortable seating everywhere that beckons you. What a restorative, relaxing place that she has shared with others. Loved it!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim is the most wonderful host for this perfect little gem. Her communication and availability is outstanding, and she truly wants to make your stay everything you’d imagined. You won’t be searching for much more, though, as she’s literally thought of everything. We were so impressed with the design and accommodations in the tiny house. The furnishings, amenities, toiletries, and overall design makes the stay effortless, cozy, and comfortable. There were even things I never knew I needed (**the cute little fan in the loft**). We especially enjoyed all of wonderful little design elements that kept us looking and interested every day; trinkets, books, little notes, plants, blankets, cute curtains, vintage light bulbs, the list goes on. The outdoor spaces and accommodations are beautiful and functional, and the sunsets on the lake are beautiful. The location is fantastic. Easy and fast access to Faribault, Northfield, and Owatonna, all with extraordinary history, shopping, dining, and attractions/destinations. Truly a hidden gem. Thank you for a wonderful opportunity to reconnect as a couple and break away from the daily grind. We are definitely looking forward to more trips 💗 God bless"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at the Tiny House. It's so well decorated and organized, very warm and cozy. The fire pit, outdoor seating, peddle boat and grill were wonderful amenities. We would love to be back someday."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,House well equipped as described.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This listing was just as beautiful as the pictures showed it to be. I loved every thing about the house, it was clean, well organized and the view of the lake was wonderful, I could wake up every morning to it. Very quiet and relaxing at night to sit by the fire pit. This was more than words can truly describe."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely amazing! Super relaxing! Perfect host! Everything you need for the perfect relaxing vacation is here.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a truly magical time at Kim’s tiny home, and would 100% recommend to our family and friends. Such a quick drive into Faribault from the metro area, but we truly felt like we were in a whole different world. My fiancé and I went paddleboating during the day and enjoyed all of the outdoor space on the deck into the evening. We also had tons of space inside the tiny house to cook pierogis from scratch, no small feat! Cozy and spacious, we’ll definitely be back in the future!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay at the tiny home and it was for our wedding weekend. Every small detail is thought of in this home. Kim + family really outdo themselves! We will back back!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and cozy Tiny House. Beautiful MN Lake location. Kim is a fantastic host.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little tiny home is the perfect getaway! Very clean and cozy! Has everything you need. I was very excited I was able to cook (and grill) rather than having to eat out! The paddle boat was a ton of fun and it’s tucked in a private cute location right on the lake. We rented a boat one of the days from the lake house! Friendly neighbors. Will definitely be coming back! If you are questioning if it is worth it, it is! Kim is very helpful and has great communication with whatever you need!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kim was an awesome host and communicated with us about possible weather advisories well in advance! The outdoor amenities were great. Only small issue was that the water had a particular odor to it so we ended up getting a pack of plastic water bottles for our stay.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Bless this tiny house was cute and cozy. Kim was a great host and quick to respond.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved the tiny house! We had a very relaxing time and Kim was very kind and responsive. Highly recommend!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The thing I love about tiny houses is that they encourage you to spend more time outdoors, and the deck area + lake here were absolutely perfect for doing that. Kim was a very accommodating host. I’d love to come back someday!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My first time staying at a tiny house, and it was as sweet as could be. #blessthistinyhouse is the perfect retreat- lakeside, with a dock and kayaks, grill, fire pit - basically everything one could want.
There’s a bed and loft space, and a wonderful patio to relax. I enjoyed the hammock. (Especially bc I didn’t fall out.) I even made lemon bread in the toaster oven, and made use of the prayer box. Kim is a wonderful host! Great family, great hospitality, and superb Tiny House. Recommend A+++++!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The tiny house was GREAT! I am a stickler for cleanliness and this place was extremely clean. It also is better esthetically than the photos which is hard to imagine possible. SO beautiful. There were also a lot of touches that went above and beyond expectation (ie: a Polaroid camera for you to use, complimentary soda waters, bug spray wipes, grilling equipment, a French press, etc). There was also extra care for comfort that I think comes from the hosts previously living there (ie: fan in the loft, reading light, extra pillows etc).
The only things I would be aware of next time is the location itself. Everything was closed Monday-Wednesday (making our Monday-Wednesday stay a little rough to find things to do) I also would be advised that the lake truly is at this time of year (end of July) so thick with moss getting in wasn’t really an option."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful place to stay! Very comfortable and incredibly clean. Everything is thought of and Kim is a wonderful host. If there is any activity you are interested in she provides suggestions with links for them in the area or surrounding area.
We were there for an unplugged couple’s getaway. We spent lots of time in the lounge chairs enjoying the view of the lake and watching the boats. We also played many card games on the deck.
We highly suggest Crack of Dawn Bakehouse for breakfast. We also grabbed some donuts at Roberd’s Resort for the drive home. They were the perfect road snacks. We spent an afternoon in town checking out a couple shops and restaurants.
Kim was very easy to get in touch with for any questions we had that popped up."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kim is a fabulous host! The house is amazing and even better in-person! Kim was so great to work with. Her communication skills are wonderful and she had several ideas of things to do and see! We will definitely be back!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My week at the tiny house was such a blessing! Every little detail made it so special & cozy & I just loved the creative flair & how thoughtful Kim was about everything. It truly felt like being home. Can’t wait to stay again sometime!

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very nice stay while visiting with family in Faribault over the holidays. The house is very large and spacious, while also offering a warm and cozy atmosphere. There are board games and both air hockey and foosball tables. The house was also well stocked with everything we needed, including pots and pans, dishes, etc. for cooking. The neighborhood is pretty and quaint, and is also in close driving distance of downtown Faribault, restaurants, a pharmacy, and groceries stores. We would definitely recommend!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very beautiful home, cozy and welcoming. Had a lot of extras which was a plus for us coming with kids. Definitely kept them entertained, they went above and beyond providing an extra table and seats for us and dishes. Very nice and very appreciative. Only thing was there was a lot of light switches and trying to figure out what rooms they went to and how to turn on lol but honestly wasn’t a big issue after a few days of getting used to the place. We definitely loved our stay and would come back again!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Had a great get together with long time friends. Great space to spend quality time together. Local restaurant had great food. The house was very comfortable and offered everything we needed.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great communication and fast response! Thank you!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was an absolutely beautiful house, and was within walking distance of downtown (15-20 away, or 3 mins driving). It was so clean as well. While we didn't have any kids, they do provide books and games for young ones as well as air hockey and foseball. They also have so many blankets around to cuddle up in, although the thermostat is really easy to use, but sometimes blankets are comfier..
All of us adored it and would definitely recommend."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home and so well thought out

2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,This is an absolutely stunning Guest Suite with an great garden view. The decor is beautiful and so thoughtfully done. Very comfy beds and excellent showers. I had a wonderful time and would love to come back next summer. Dion was an incredible host and I was so happy to share her lovely home.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It is a lovely space, bright and quiet. It was great for teleworking. I saw deer and a hummingbird in the backyard. Deon was a very responsive and considerate host."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Mario and his family made such a huge effort to make their airbnb so comfortable and cozy for us! We stayed here after our wedding! It is in a safe neighborhood, well maintained and the house is so cute! The inside of the house was spotless, the style and decor were adorable and comfortable! The bed we slept in was soft, the sheets were clean and crisp, the pillows were so soft and supportive! Everything was perfect! And it was SO quiet!"
2024-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"The house was in a great location for our visit to St Olaf-easy and scenic drive. It’s an older home, but is well equipped and fit our needs for our visit!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lovely place, great fenced in yard, personable host."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Arch House is a terrific place to stay in Faribault. Classic house in historic, quiet, pedestrian-friendly neighborhood just a short walk from downtown. Clean interior filled with heritage furniture, interesting artwork, and intriguing architectural niches--even neat play places for kids. Mario communicated efficiently and clearly, and the flexible and quick check in and check out procedures were very accommodating for guests. Highly recommended!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Mario’s… “Arch House”… was cozy and comfortable. Located in a nice and peaceful neighborhood with good sidewalks for walking your dog or just walking yourself.
Mario was very pleasant to deal with and responded quickly to any questions. The kitchen was nicely appointed with everything we could possibly want. The dining room was nicely furnished. It was great to have a ping pong table in the basement for some competitive fun! The bedrooms were nice and mattresses very comfortable. The upstairs bathroom very nice with only a tub but the downstairs bathroom did have a shower. The Arch House felt like our home away from home. Thank you Mario and Emily for sharing your cozy and comfortable home with us! It was a very nice experience!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Charming home in quiet neighborhood, walking distance to downtown and the river bend trail - so pretty! The home met all of our needs for an extended stay. Mario was responsive to our questions and requests, and even offered to bring by candy for Halloween trick or treaters! Would definitely stay here again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect place to stay when my mom came to town! Beautiful and well-stocked kitchen, plus charming built-ins and decor throughout. The backyard with fire pit and Smores supplies was a great touch!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Charming home. We stayed here for our daughters wedding at the 310 venue. It was so close.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay while our daughter moved into college at st Olaf. Very easy drive and Faribault is lovely in its own right.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Located in a quiet neighborhood, this place is clean and tidy; the kitchen is fully equipped and the host Mario was very kind and helped us a lot.We would come back again. Recommended!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is in a beautiful & peaceful part of town and gave us an authentic feel for the American lifestyle, complete with squirrels and at least one raccoon (which we don't see at home in Australia).
The home was easy to find and access, had everything we needed, and was a short walk from town. We had a lovely stay & would highly recommend."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is an older beautiful historical home that has a lot of character and had everything we needed plus. Mario and Emily have really put a lot of thought into making their guests comfortable and a feeling of at home. The neighborhood is safe, very pretty, and in a great location to everything. Would highly recommend the hosts and home- super strong communication skills, responses, as well as thorough; they are very appreciative of their guests! We would definitely stay again."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mario was an amazing host. The house was clean with the most charming touches. It was the perfect location for our week of camp at Shattuck!
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This home was such a quaint place to stay! It was very clean, was decorated so cute, and made you feel at home. It was in a perfect location to walk to downtown but far enough away to be quiet and away from the busier streets. The only issue was trouble working the shower."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Arch house was very homey with nice linens and towels. It would be a great place for a family with kids or animals. It seems to be in the process of upgrading. Nice outdoor space in the back. The one real drawback was that there is only one shower and that is in the basement. It has very low water pressure. Mario was receptive and did check in to see if everything was ok.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you again for a wonderful stay. I appreciate you letting me in the house so early.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Would highly recommend staying with at The Arch House, Mario was great to work with. He responded quickly. We had an issue with the fridge and he had it taken care of very quickly. Was very accommodating! Gave us our space but was also available when we needed something. The house was beautiful with a lot of character! Had great recommendations for things to do in the area."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We have stayed in other Airbnb but nowhere has made us feel more at home or more welcome. Our hosts were caring and the house was incredibly comfortable and clean. One thing I noticed is how good all the linens smelled! it was decorated beautifully and all information was at our fingertips. Truly a wonderful experience. I would give it more than five stars if possible.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, convenient location. Would stay again."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great house for our hockey weekend! Very close to Shattuck and had everything we needed. We would stay there again next time we are in the area!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay at the Arch house. Thank you Mario. We will be back!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"1000 characters is simply not enough space to share how amazingly wonderful this stay is. Let's start with the basics: the bed was luxuriously comfortable, the wifi was fast and reliable, kitchen was organized and well-stocked with pantry basics. The house was pristine. Everything was well organized and spotless. Check in and out was incredibly smooth. No crazy cleaning tasks.
In terms of entertainment and amenities, there were so many things we didn't even have time to use! There was space for a toddler to explore, board games, and even a S'mores kit! We'll definitely be back in the summer to check out the backyard and firepit.
In general, this space felt like an homage to the local community. There were lots of amazing little details, and notes from Mario and Emily. They highlighted local authors, coffee shops, and even had a local hot sauce in the fridge! The little details were always a wonderful surprise (also, great coffee).
Terrific stay - probably our best AirBnB experienc"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Spent a little over a week at the Arch house and it was great stay!!
Loved that the kitchen was equipped with not only all the cooking supplies but also spices, flour, sugar etc. so there was no need to buy all those “little extras” for the cooking.
Loved all the “welcome” gifts and notes. Great location for me and internet was great so I could remote into work while there.
Mario was great at responding and helping out with instruction so it was easy to check in and find the property. It was very cold during the week, but the house kept nice and warm despite the negative degrees outside:-). Did not have to change the thermostat at all.
Will definitely come back when I have a longer stay planned again:-)"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was a great place to stay near Faribault. The owners were kind enough to even come out and salt the walk when an unexpected ice storm hit. We will be back.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing stay!! Check-in was a breeze, and the home was spotless, warm & inviting! It had everything we needed! Host recommended local restaurants and shops that were terrific!! Quiet residential area yet so close to food, shopping and hockey!! May need to find an excuse to come again soon!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Place was fantastic and way more space than expected! Beautiful lake view! Will definitely be booking this location again! Instructions to the cabin could have been a little clearer but we found the place. We did drive in after dark.
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"while there were many bugs near the entryway (which is to be expected in a campground), we enjoyed our stay on the lake. the cabin was fairly clean and felt homey. the views were beautiful. the neighbors 2 doors down were also extremely sweet"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Nice little cabin, right on the lake. Wonderful hosts."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The cabin was the perfect solution for our needs, just far enough from town to have a peaceful setting but close enough that it wasn’t a chore to grab something we missed.
Although the space is smaller than some listings, it comfortable without feeling cramped and provided us with exactly what I was looking for. True cabin layout providing the necessities with the focus on outdoors vs a 2nd home to maintain.
Gage was very responsive and accommodating, providing needed items and suggestions in the area. Highlight of the trip was canoeing for hours with my son & the spectacular view of the Northern Lights. Will be booking again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family stayed here while waiting to move into our new home. It truly felt like a home between homes. It was so relaxing, I looked younger when I left. Seriously! 😁"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice quiet private place for a relaxing time. Would definitely go back.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Liked the location and everything of the house would rent again
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Right on the lake and allows animals. Thus 2 bedroom is great for a family or couple spending 1 night or longer term. Would stay again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"beautiful place, Glad to stay here.Will stay again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We will definitely stay here again! The place was great and Gage was very nice as well! Overall great experience!

2023-10-01,4,Stayed with a pet,The area was very quiet and peaceful. Just what we were looking for. Discovered a short hiking trail nearby which we all enjoyed. Nice fire pit and the lawn chairs provided made for an enjoyable evening by the lake.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a great time at here. The view was beautiful and peaceful. The bugs were pretty bad but that's to be expected this time of year. The kitchen was perfect for making our meals and our golden retrievers loved the water! We are thinking about coming back next year.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a lovely stay! Great place for our family for the night. We loved it!
2023-09-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"We needed a place near Northfield that accepted pets and this place fit the bill. The cabin is close to a campsite and has few amenities. No salt, pepper, coffee, oil, hand soap, etc that you might find elsewhere. We were there for Labor Day weekend and the bugs were fierce. The outdoor light (that we could not switch off) was above the entrance, which meant tons of bugs would whoosh in every time we opened the door at night. The checkout instructions asked us to clean, dust, vacuum, etc. which would’ve been ok except we woke to a carpet of dead bugs every morning. Beautiful area, friendly neighbors and locals. We would stay again."
2023-05-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Such a peaceful and beautiful area! The living room overlooks the water which was great! This cabin is in a good location as it is far enough in the countryside but close enough to town that it was not a hassle. We mostly had everything we needed but there were no towels or personal care items such as shampoo, conditioner, or body wash. Overall, we had a great stay 🙂"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,So nice to stay again in your cozy home. The trail access is nice too!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you love vintage, you will LOVE Granpa’s Place! It is a GEM! The house is SO homey, my husband and I both find the vintage feel absolutely charming! It is very clean, comfortable and very well stocked with practically anything you could possibly need – including chocolate!!
Bruce has certainly earned his superhost title, he is very responsive and accommodating. We got to meet him our last night there and he is so nice, it felt like talking to an old friend! Next time in Faribo, we are definitely renting again!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Really enjoyed our stay! The home was comfortable and did feel like being at grandpas cabin in all the right ways. Loved the walking trail behind the home; the games in the home; the big sectional. Close to Shattuck and hosted some of the hockey team for a meal. Enjoyed our stay and will be back!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place for the cabin vibe. Bruce was a wonderful host. You can feel this place is special to the family. Coffee was provided from a local artisan and that was great! The sunroom is fantastic and quiet. The kitchen table w its padded chairs was nice as well played a few hours of marbles. There is a very very firm bed and one softer one. Pillows were great. Sheets very clean. Coming back in nicer weather to hike and have bonfires would be fun. The Furball Farm Cat Sanctuary was one of the reasons we visited Faribault and had no idea it’d be literally right down the road just about a mile! It was also nice to have a tv w live tv option.! Would stay here again. Thanks Bruce and family
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place

Good location - quiet neighborhood backing up to a lovely hiking area and nature center - not too far from the Twin Cities area. Highly recommend!
2023-10-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Grandpas place is definitely a rustic getaway cabin house. Reminded me of visiting my grandmas lake cabin. Cozy, quilted blankets and deep sinking couches, antique-like juddering beds. We loved waking up with the warm sun shining through the windows and the dogs loved the back yard and chasing all the box elder bugs. Had everything we needed for making food and taking showers etc. The candy jar was such a sweet touch. Thank you for the stay!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Very welcoming. A true cabin feel close to Nature Preserve. Close access to town. The host stopped by and made us feel welcome and answered questions.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place really does feel like staying at a grandparent’s home, in all good ways. The nature sanctuary behind the house is lovely - we only wish we had more time to explore. Good WiFi, tv, board games, comfy couch, and a great sunroom! It was a good stay for us before we dropped off our child at college nearby!"

Great kitchen to cook in, fabulous 4 season porch to relax in, comfortable beds, and lots of places to sit and visit. The nature trail adjacent to the property is beautiful, and there is a fire pit and hammock and even a tree swing for the kids. Bruce is a gracious host who thinks of everything. We are already looking forward to our next stay."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family traveled up to the area for summer vacation and visits with family. The place was perfect as described. There is a peaceful presence set back in time when staying at this home. My family enjoyed the firepit with hotdogs/ s’mores, bbq, hiking , biking, fishing, playing Monopoly. Bruce was very attentive and loaned us bikes to use during the stay. We slept well and enjoyed our respite here. Great place to “unplug” from the hustle of modern day life- returning to a much simpler version of living so often missed nowadays. Thank you for the memories. We would love to return !"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We(2 adultsand 3 grandkids) thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Grandpa's place. It was our home for the week while my grandson went to hockey camp. It was homey and relaxing and we loved having our dog with us. Our favorite room was the sunroom, we read and learned how to play shut the box board game. The overall comfortable feeling made the week more enjoyable. Highlights were being able to access the hiking trails right at the back of the property and catching fireflies. Bruce is a wonderful host."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely wonderful experience staying at Bruce’s place, we are so glad we found it! Hiking the park and enjoying the fire pit were two of my most favorite memories!
Incredible views and loved spending time on the 4 seasons porch playing games (shut the box!) and listening to all the old CDs on the boom box."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay! The location was perfect, and the house was clean, homey, and very functional for our family. We got into town late and asked about good places to see the Faribault Fourth of July fireworks show. Bruce not only drew us directions, but he and his family saved a prime spot for us! We'd love to stay at Grandpa's Place whenever we're visiting the area in the future!"

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved the easy access to the nature center, we did 4 miles of beautiful winter hiking, right from the back yard! We loved the lovely 4 season porch, great for sunrise and morning coffee. We felt that it is time to update some of the older living and dining room furniture for ease of hanging out together comfortably, for 5 adults. Otherwise we love the amazingly well stocked kitchen, and obvious sentimentality of this sweet place."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Grandpa’s place is a peaceful getaway. The host was great!

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a perfect little gem is a quiet area. Bruce had the snow cleared before we got there and gave us a very warm welcome.
This place has everything you need for an indoor or outdoor stay. The extras are definitely thought out, ie; Coffee bar, porch packed with outdoor activity accompaniments, extra chairs and blankets, etc. Very clean.
And if you stay in the winter, that sun room was hard to leave. Watching the sunrise and set w/ the fireplace truly gave me the contentment of being at grandpas.
This will definitely be my go to when I visit the area."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We all loved Grandpas Place! Hope to stay there regularly. Great place to stay!!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wow! What a fantastic place to stay! I felt like I was back at my own Grandpa’s place :) Our very favorite places were the cozy outdoor room and the Nature Preserve RIGHT OUT BACK!! We had such a blast sledding and playing in the snow in the woods. Bruce was so kind and hospitable too! We would love to come back again someday :)
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Staying at Bruce's place was great! It was a very lovely house that was peaceful and relaxing.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We made this home base for our weekend in MN to celebrate our friends wedding! Bruce met us at check In.

2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"a clean, nostalgic place to stay. it will bring back memories of where you grew up or your grandparents house. Bruce met us the night we arrived to make sure we knew where things were, how to use, wifi etc. had a great chat with him before he left. definitely recommend if you want a place to stay that is in a quiet neighborhood and has access to a large nature area. we enjoyed the 3 seasons room with the stove. it was great to sit and have coffee and enjoy the warm while the sun came up."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A really pleasant place to stay. Lovely location, backed up against the nature preserve. Faribault is a great little town."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We found out about this home on a parent page from our daughter's college on social media. It mentioned that this was a wonderful place to stay when visiting your child - and it was the truth! It was a great home base for us while moving our daughter into college, but also keeping our distance to give her freedom. Faribault was a charming little town and we enjoyed being able to visit with our dogs. The home itself is immaculate and offers any and everything you may need while staying there. Bruce was easy to contact and made himself readily available if should need anything."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"You would think that one might expect more after a long 3 year wait since our last little vacation that 3 days of mostly rain, with a few peeks at the sun, humid days would be a disappointment. Far from it. This has been, by far, the most relaxing and peaceful and fun vacation we have had…ever! There were enough breaks in the rain for us to enjoy a few walks down the beautiful quiet trails with our Golden Retriever “Winter”. When the rain came down, we enjoyed listening to the rain on the roof and watching the leaves of the trees undulate in the breeze. The light show and rolling thunder from the night time storms were exciting and beautiful!
Now for this little cabin of Grampa’s… about all I can say is “perfection”. I am a vintage dealer, and I lean most towards the styles that bring me memories of my own growing up years. Oh the memories it stirred of my girlhood home in the 1950’s and 1960’s. !.. the pole lamp, the owl clock, the little Mid Century Rocker, the cabinet under the tv to mention just a few. The knotty pine paneling on the Porch room, the narrow board wood floors in the main part of the house and the wonderful midcentury cupboards in the kitchen. Don’t forget to pay attention to that amazing bathroom with the gray and black plastic tiles, the same tiles I remember from my own childhood home. The house / cabin is about the same size as our use, the same efficient use of space. You could raise 5 – 6 kids here… back in the day. It amazes me what people think is necessary these days. Here is the almost hidden treasure I want you all to notice… that chrome covered recessed toothbrush and soap holder in the bathroom right under the medicine cabinet. I had no idea what it was, but Gale is more inclined to test things out, so he pushed on it and there it was! Love it!!!
Thank you, Bruce and family, for the best mini vacation ever."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We look forward to stay with you again in the future. It was a real pleasure to see your kids and chat with you! Best wishes to you and your family.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Grandpa’s place is great. Easy check in, great communication with the host. Adjacent to a huge nature center with many walking trails out the back yard. The house is very clean and has lots of nice touches that made our stay extra comfortable, such as gourmet coffee, plenty of dishes and cooking supplies, and s’mores! There are lots of comfy chairs and couches to relax and visit inside. The yard has swings for the little ones and a great hammock, as well as a lovely fire ring with plenty of wood."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Bruce’s place was a great spot for a few days of relaxation while we were in the area for work meetings. The nearby trails are awesome to explore and there are a few really great restaurants in town. Would love to stay again next time we are in Minnesota!

2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"Bruce’s place is welcoming and homey, and the house is set up to make guests comfortable. Bruce is one of those special Airbnb hosts who makes the extra effort to make sure his guests have everything they need. All questions we had were promptly answered, both before and during our stay, someone was on hand to welcome us and give us local recommendations, and the house was clean and stocked with all we needed. We would recommend Grandpa’s Place to anyone!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was an amazing place! So beautiful, great location. The yard and lot the home sits on is perfect! Huge backyard, the trails were awesome! The house is blocks from dozens of beautiful farms. Take a drive south and check out the backroads!

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Grandpa’s Place is fabulous! The house and decor will take you back to memories of your grandparents place! Bruce has done a great job updating the house without taking away from the “yesteryears vibe”. The location in Faribault is great, especially if you are in town for any of Shattuck St. Mary’s events. However, you are interested in the solitude and needing to unwind, this place will not disappoint! You can engage in walks along the park system directly behind the house as well. The place was clean and definitely well stocked with the essentials! We were able to eat in a few times and had all the comforts of home. Would highly recommend this place!!"

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Where to begin, this was just the perfect place for my son and I to relax in while visiting St. Olaf College and friends at Shattuck. Easy entry, comfortable and super clean. Bruce was quick to respond and came by to greet us - we had very nice conversation and felt right at home. We had everything we needed and I appreciated how wonderful the cooking utensils were. Almost everything in this home (decor, furnishings) reminded me of my childhood which was so comforting. If my son chooses St. Olaf I can see myself staying here with family in the future."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Bruce was an excellent host! He was good at communication and has set up Grandpa’s house as a great place to stay. The home was very clean, and we throughly enjoyed being able to walk directly from the backyard to the nature center paths. We also really enjoyed spending time in the porch area and even played some of the bird games that were at the home. We highly recommend this as a comfortable, homelike place to stay!"

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was clean, well labeled, and well stocked. Bruce met us for check-in to discuss particulars.

2021-12-01,5,Group trip,Great house with a wonderful sun room that we spent most of our time in. House was clean and is in a wonderful location with the Nature Center literally right in the back yard! We will be back to stay in this house again some day!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Grandpa's place is wonderful. We stayed with our toddler and my mom, and we were all quite comfortable. The sun room was the favorite spot in the house, and the Christmas trees were a nice touch. Easy to cook, make coffee, and run the dishwasher. House is older and clearly loved. We took the trail from the yard to the nature preserve for a morning walk and it was beautiful. For those traveling with kids, there's a booster seat, a high chair, and a pack and play if needed (we brought our own so we didn't use them). Location is quiet but a quick drive to various restaurants and stores in Faribault. Would definitely stay here again! Thanks Bruce!!"

The detail and quality here were off the charts. It felt like a home that has been so cared for.
Really simple and really well done. I loved my stay at Granpas Place.
Bruce is the hosts and was very kind and accommodating. Bruce may be one of the most enjoyable people I have ever met.
The house has a back yard that has a trail leading into the Riverbend Nature Center which has miles of great trails.
I would stay here again.
Thank you Bruce."

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are planning a visit to the Faribault area, and Grandpa’s Place is available — grab it. You’ll consider yourself lucky the moment you set foot in this comfortable, well-appointed cottage, with its beautiful location bordering a nature preserve. We were there in the fall, and enjoyed a colorful autumn leaf show. Grandpa’s was spotless and outfitted with everything you can think of — and some amenities that are welcome surprises. We loved discovering the jar of Oreo cookies. A bag of marshmallows awaited us and led to a fun evening around the fire pit. Bruce is a thoughtful, gracious and accommodating host. Communication and check-in were smooth. The location feels secluded, but is actually very convenient. We were looking for a relaxing, serene place to stay. Grandpa’s provided that — and much more! Thank you, Bruce, for being such a great host."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Location ideal for visiting families in Rice County. It is right next to the Nature Center for peaceful walks. Bruce made check in easy and was very accessible. We'd stay here again.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is very comfortable! The small town of Faribault has a lot to offer and we were able to try it all! The place was very clean! It has all the charms of an older house and you cannot beat the nature preserve in the backyard!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay at Grandpa’s Place. It is quiet and peaceful with plenty of space to spread out. I loved the cozy mornings having coffee by the fire in the porch. We made some magical memories from skipping stones in the river, to roasting marshmallows by the fire and my favorite, star-gazing as my little boy fell asleep on my chest his last night before starting Kindergarten. We’ll definitely be back soon to kayak the river."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at Grsndpa's Place. The cabin was clean and roomy. Lovely quilts covered the beds. The enclosed year round porch was especially pleasant. Upon our arrival our host greeted us and offered many suggestions for activities during our stay. Fresh strawberries and a large bowl of wonderful honey crisp apples were waiting for us.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Allana's place was perfect for us. It was nice and cozy! It had everything we needed and it was comfortable. Felt right at home. Would love to stay again and recommend to others!

2024-03-01,3,Stayed one night,"The house was cute, and we had everything we needed. It would have been a great stay except it was not well cleaned at all. There were long hairs all over the tub and bathroom floor, the sinks and mirror were dirty, and there was so much hair on the carpeted floor that you’d get hair between your toes walking across the room."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! Allana had great communication. Home was very clean and location was great. Would stay again when I’m in the area. Little touches throughout the home were splendid: snacks, coffee, hot chocolate."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely perfect host in every way. Property was so cute and exactly what we needed. We needed something after pulling off the highway and Allana responded within a minute or two and even let us check in early. We couldn't have asked for a better place. House was toasty warm with sub zero temps outside. Great location - town has everything you need.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I stayed here with my bridesmaids the day before my wedding. It was a great space for a girls night and was roomy and comfortable for getting ready/doing hair and makeup the next morning. Allana was incredibly hospitable and responsive, made sure we had everything we needed and even left us with ingredients for mimosas and some cinnamon rolls! Everything was clean and tidy, such a cozy place. Highly recommend!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We are a family that has a student at Shattuck St. Mary's Academy and wanted to stay near the school. So this house worked out well. Very close to school and the downtown area.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Allana’s home was in a very convenient location. Cute home with everything we needed for our stay. Her little added touches were very thoughtful. Very friendly and responsive!

2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re in Faribault to visit the Shattuck campus or to golf at Legacy GC, then the location is perfect and still not far from downtown Faribault.
The location is very quiet and residential. The hosts are quick to reply."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice place while traveling for work... homey space while away from home.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable, cozy, clean, not cluttered! I had a great stay overall. It was so much more comfortable than a hotel especially after a long day of working and on my feet for 10 hours and having an easy chair to come back to and put my feet up! The host was communicative and also allowed me to check in early after my meeting times were changed.
The only note I would point out is that it is a shared wall with the main house and so you can hear much of what is going on with the family, albeit muffled, sounds were of: voices, moving about, dishes,/cooking, music - the background beat of which got annoying after a couple of hours. (Which means they can also hear your noise too).
It was nice to have the door between the two spaces so while in the ""sitting room"" closing it tamped down the sounds coming from the main house somewhat. It got completely quiet a bit after 10:00, so the noise did not affect my sleep.
The sound level was similar to what you might find at a hotel or apartment."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice place to stay especially for us as our reason for visiting is just down the street from here. Hosts are awesome to communicate with and the place is always clean and well equipped!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Woody and Lisa were excellent hosts and we’re very accommodating and easy to work with. Would definitely stay here again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The home was sparkling clean and the beds comfortable! When they heard that we would arrive late, they made the sofa bed for us so that everything was ready to go to bed when we arrived. Great area."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very beautiful and cozy home.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We adored our stay here. It was clean, cozy, comfortable. And the hosts were very helpful. Loved it here. We will stay again if we are back in the area."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place had everything we needed. Great location. Host was super accommodating. Let us check out later since our flight was in the evening. Very clean and would definitely stay again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"A relaxing haven just as described. I recommend highly and I would stay again when in the area. Everything is on one level inside, except two steps up to the back deck where you gain access. We needed a little later check in and they were very accommodating leaving a light on as it after dark. Spotless, comfortable bed, we lacked nothing."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is clean and organized, in a quiet environment, especially surrounded by green trees in the front courtyard, and small squirrels play, people and nature are perfectly combined."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,It was very clean. The price was more reasonable than the nicest rated hotel in town. Clean and private. Can't beat it.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Woody and Lisa are wonderful! Warm and welcoming from their initial correspondence, they proactively communicated and promptly replied when asked for local recommendations leading up to my stay. Lovely home and comfortable...a home away from home! A bit fussy about cleanliness...their home is IMMACULATE and every thing is meticulously arranged and organized! We also found Faribault fun and can't wait to return! (Be sure to checkout Janna's Market Cafe - a breakfast gem with yummy desserts you can grab and go!)"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay once again!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thoughtful amenities & very clean! You can enjoy the sunrise from the living room.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything was perfekt!
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great place and very convenient for what we needed during our stay. Some recommendations from our experience.
1) Arriving at night as we were it was a bit difficult to see where the house numbers were so perhaps a more prominent/better lit display of your house number would be helpful.
2) A subscription to one of the pay services like Netflix instead of Dish would be preferred.
3) Thermostat control of the space. We felt comfortable but others may not."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,We've stayed here several times in the past and as always very pleased with our stay and so close to family. Great neighborhood to stay in.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and convenient!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect location next to SSM. Well-equipped with all the necessities. Great hosts. Will be returning.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Quiet neighborhood, clean place and the hosts communicated very well"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My son attended a hockey camp at Shattuck St. Mary's for the week and everything about Sherry's Suite was perfect for our trip. Location couldn't be beat. It was 2 minutes to the rink. It was just my teenage son and myself and the suite was spacious enough for each of us to have our own space along with being able to accommodate his goalie gear laid out every night to dry. The suite was exactly as described and matched the pictures on the listing. Everything was very clean. There was a small amount of noise on the first night (as others have mentioned), but nothing that would be any different from a hotel, actually it was less noisy than a hotel and was very brief. The internet was great. My son brought his gaming computer and had no complaints regarding the WIFI. Woody and Lisa responded right away to any communications/questions I sent during out stay. The neighborhood was quiet, safe and parking was right next to the suite. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice clean place
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect spot if you’re visiting Shattuck St. Mary’s.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very comfortable space right on Shattuck’s Legacy golf course. Nice quite neighborhood. Thoughtful touches throughout the apartment. Private entrance. Comfortable bed. Spotlessly clean. Solid local recommendations for restaurants and things to do. Good water pressure for shower and reliable WiFi. Woody and Lisa are quick to respond to any questions and are both very friendly. Will definitely stay here again in the future.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The suite was exactly what I needed for my 2 night stay. The location is quiet and close to town. I heard a slight noise of dishes from their kitchen once but it was not a bother at all. I would definitely recommend/stay there again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This little gem was comfortable and homey, I felt safe and had everything I needed. It was priced right, and I would definitely stay here again! I requested a noon checkout which they were happy to accommodate, which I was very grateful for because I arrived late the night before. They do have a dog that woke me up barking a few times, and there is no temperature control in the suite (but you can send them a message if you want them to adjust it from the main house)...two small negatives for an otherwise very positive experience!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was my second pleasant stay at “Sherry’s Suite” in Faribault.
It was very clean and all the furnishings were in excellent shape. The main bed was quite comfortable. I’m fussy about pillows and theirs suited me. The shower worked great but watch the top rail, it’s a bit l lower than I was used to.
Despite not having a full kitchen, I made due with simple breakfasts, pre-made cold salads, sandwiches, etc. just fine. I liked that the apartment had just what I needed but no extra clutter. The view of the woods in the back was a pleasant bonus.
The pre-checkin info emphasized that you can sometimes hear the hosts in the rest of the house and that is true: TV, talking, etc. Things generally quiet down around 10:30pm. But the guest area is private—no usable doors connect the two parts.
The hosts, Lisa and Woody, were friendly, responded quickly to my questions, and readily helped with a request of mine. They have a nice FAQ sheet In the unit that helps a lot."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Looking forward to visit this beautiful home and lovely surroundings again. The area is safe and the community center activities are plenty. The home was exactly that, a home. Tidy, extremely cleaned and comfortable. Thank you."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Woody and Lisa were wonderful hosts. They were attentive and made sure we had what we needed to feel right at home. Their space is comfortable, well appointed and spotless. It was easy to feel right at home."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay at Woody & Lisa's place. They were very responsive and the place was very clean.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sherry’s Suite was exactly as described. It was also very clean, very well maintained, and had everything I needed for my stay. I worked remotely from the AirBnB and the internet was great. The location is quiet and beautiful. Woody and Lisa were extremely responsive and checked in on me a few times during my week-long stay. This is a hidden little gem for SSM parents. I was able to zip over to campus in under five minutes - closer and more comfortable than any hotel in Faribault. All the other parents were jealous of my find! ;)
I look forward to staying here the next time I’m in Faribault."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice place to stay!

Lisa gave us a recommendation for a local restaurant that turned out to be a great place to eat."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our first stay at a B&B, we were pleasantly surprised. It was a short stay overnight but felt like home, much better than a hotel."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an incredible stay! Everything was very clean. They had games, menu’s for local places and a very helpful guide.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Sherry's Suite by Woody & Lisa was extremely clean, cozy, quiet, and private. Also loved the close proximity to the Faribault downtown. I would definitely choose to stay here if I were to travel to Faribault again!"

2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very cozy place. it definitely was very clean and well maintained. I liked that there was a private entrance. There were clear instructions for how to check in and use the appliances. The only thing was that you could hear what was going on in the other side of the house easily. We aren't used to it because we don't live in an apartment or with other people. However, they weren't really noisy and we weren't woken up with noise during the night. Overall, we enjoyed our stay. The hosts are really kind people."
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Extremely clean and private, would definitely recommend"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a wonderful stay! They were very responsive and accommodated us last minute.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sherry’s suite was absolutely lovely. Nice, quiet and safe neighborhood was easy to find and communication with the hosts outstanding and helpful. The suite was efficient and included creature comforts for us of absorbent towels, comfy linens and bed we didn’t want to get out of! Everything was comfortable and immaculately clean. Available for use in the suite was a refrigerator, microwave, glasses, utensils, plus coffee options for use with the Kurig. It was exactly what we needed to enjoy our weekend away from home. We will definitely stay here again!! Thank you Woody & Lisa!!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"My stay was great. Only a short distance to my son’s home. Very clean, cozy and comfortable. I will be using this place to stay in the future if available."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Woody and Lisa delivered the goods! Admittedly, this is only our second AirBnB experience, but it is the standard that we will use to judge any future stays. All we can say is that if a better AirBnB experience exists, we'd love to find it!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Located minutes from downtown and a mile from the Allina Health medical facilities. In town for a short notice outpatient procedure and their home could not have been situated any better! Very neat, clean and clutter free! Perfect place for my daugther and I while we waited out the winter storm. Woody and Lisa offered to extend my checkout due to inclement weather and cleared the pathway to the suite as well as the driveway daily. Absolutely recommend and a GREAT VALUE! Thank you both so very much!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"“Sherry’s Suite” in Faribault suited my needs quite well. It was very clean and all the furnishings were in excellent shape, practically new. The main bed was comfortable. The sofa bed was pretty comfortable, too, according to my associate. It was nice to have doors on the different sleeping areas for privacy and quiet.
Despite not having a full kitchen, I made due with simple breakfasts, sandwiches, etc. just fine. I liked that the apartment had just what I needed but no extra clutter. The TV, Keurig coffee maker, and toaster worked well. Despite frigid outdoor temps, it was warm inside. The view of the woods in the back was a pleasant bonus.
The hosts, Lisa and Woody, were friendly and responded quickly to my questions."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Woody and Lisa are great hosts! They communicate well, before, during and after the visits. Will definitely stay again."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfection!
Spotless, cozy, private and convenient."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Sherry’s Suite is exactly as described. We frequently arrive at MSP late and like a place to stay before driving home to Wisconsin dodging deer at night. Sherry’s Place now joins our other favorite AirBnB!
In addition to the hosts’ description, here are few personal observations:
The location is a bit out of the way from I35 but easy to find (even at night in a snow storm). Our stay was super quiet, the rooms were spotlessly cleaned and the bed was very comfortable. There was plenty of space. The written “User Guide” was clearly organized and complete. Parking was very close to the door. The hosts were attentive (though we did not meet them), checked on us by text and cleaned the snow from the sidewalk shortly before we arrived. We’ll be back."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Probably the cleanest AirBNB I’ve stayed at. And when we had a bit of inclement weather they went above and beyond to try and help me.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Comfortable, quiet and very clean. Definitely recommend."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sherry’s Suite was welcoming and perfect for our quick getaway. The high ceilings give you the feeling it’s bigger than it is, comfortable surroundings and furnishings. We recommended it to my local friends for other out of town guests."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This special space is just four driving minutes from downtown Faribault making it perfect for attending a performance at the Paradise Center for the Arts. The space is comfortable, sparkly clean and accurately described."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay was perfect. Amenities were just what we needed and the location, although quick and easy access to food and shopping, tucked away in a peaceful neighborhood."

The ONLY thing that could have been better was the couch bed - it was really a futon, and was leaning/not level so it made it really hard for my two kids to sleep on it. We brought an air mattress and it worked out and I’m glad we did.
Absolutely would stay here again!"

2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Spacious, comfortable, lovely location."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We traveled for Graduation at St.Olaf. Less than a 20 minute drive to the college. On a peaceful lake with kyaks & lifevests , fishing, fire pit, cornhole boards, plenty of out side seating and tables for hosting family. Inside the home is so inviting. Beautifully decorated. Large laundry room. The kitchen was fully equipped with every amenity from home. Even a pizza oven. Nice touch with local fresh eggs. The bathrooms were immacllent with nice big soft towels. We slept so well we forgot we weren't at home."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,The condo was gorgeous and the location was beautiful! I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a fun time on a lake with lots of thoughtful amenities. The host was amazing! We’ll definitely be staying there again.

2024-05-01,5,Group trip,"Booked this place for a bachelorette weekend. We originally booked just Saturday night, but a few weeks before decided to try and add Friday night as well. The change was super easy to make and Joanne was very responsive. Easy check in and check out. Would absolutely stay again."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"We enjoyed our stay very much. It was a lovely home, beautiful view, spacious, comfortable beds, selection of coffee, and tea, kitchen with most of the essentials. Thete were some nice games, puzzles and books, a few toys for children. It is a bit more challenging if you have mobility issues (split level with stairs, and some stairs and short walking from parking to enter). But we made it work with a bit of assistance for my elderly mom. Very nice airbnb, would love to return someday!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot for us to gather
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at Joanne's place was peaceful and enjoyable. I can only imagine what it's like during the summer and fall. We dared our sons to jump in the lake which they did! I watched the sunrise from the kitchen window with my morning tea and it was spectacular. The house is a duplex, so we were right next to Joanne. With two teenage boys, one of whom walks pretty heavily, I was worried about the noise, but it all seemed okay. The space itself was nicely decorated, clean and very well appointed with all necessary comforts. We only needed to shop for a few food items. It was nice to have our own bedrooms and the beds were some of the most comfortable we have had at an AirBnB. We had a snafu with getting locked out but Joanne was quick to respond. As newcomers to the area, we were not aware of all the gravel roads. My husband is a car guy so it really bothered him getting in and out to the property, most wouldn't worry, I just mention it for anyone who might consider that an issue."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,More than 5 stars!! It truly felt like home away from home. Woke up to a beautiful view of the lake and peaceful surroundings. Your home was so clean and comfortable. Thank you so much for making us feel so welcome!!

2024-02-01,5,Group trip,We enjoyed the nice/clean lakeside accomodations. We stayed here mid February and are sure it'd be very enjoyable place to stay in summer.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is a absolutely gorgeous home with the great lake views. Peacefully quiet neighborhood. The place just felt like home. We are already talking of rebooking for this summer when it is warmer!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We had a great time.
The space is spacious, cozy, and very clean. It has all the amenities you need for the stay. The location of the house is beautiful with a view of the French lake. When you get up in the morning you can see the sunrise on the Lake, it's splendid.
Our two teenagers had their own space on the ground floor, they loved it. There is also everything you need to do laundry and dry laundry. We are French and were in Faribault to spend Christmas with our son who studied at the University of Mankato and we had great holidays with family. I recommend Joanne's place."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Traveling for an out of town wedding with family and an infant, we wanted an Airbnb instead of a hotel. We were so pleased with the house. It was as described, peaceful, comfy and convenient! While we were attending the wedding, Joni even swept and salted the sidewalk so we were safe returning back to the home after the wedding we attended. Very thoughtful hosts!"
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"This was a perfect getaway place for three generations. The grand kids loved the selection of books, games, puzzles, toys and the real cute kid-sized kitchen set. Kept them busy! They also got a taste of bunk beds, too.
The big kids appreciated the comfy beds, the quality towels and and very well equipped kitchen! The view out the windows onto the lake was a real treat for everyone. We'll be back in the Spring to check out the lake.
Thanks, Joanne!"
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Joanne’s property is gorgeous. Plenty of space for everyone. She even had a futon and air mattress aside from already having numerous bedrooms. I would definitely recommend Joanne’s for everyone’s weekend getaway.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,The place was lovely and I liked the communication from the host and the water access
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved the spectacular views over the lake. It was very comfortable and just what we needed. They even came and cleaned the snow off the steps and porch after it snowed overnight. Would definitely stay there again.
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"My girlfriends and I had a wonderful ""ladies weekend"" at Joanne's place. It's location on the lake is beautiful and offered views throughout the 2 level duplex home. Plenty of parking, easy access and we founf Joanne to be very accommodating and helpful. She even had farm fresh eggs for us in the fridge!
The bedrooms were adequate and clean. There were fresh sheets and towels. The bathroom downstairs is a little dated but clean. The master on the main level and bathroom were the best rooms. The king bed was comfortable and the bathroom was also clean. The kitchen is open and had great utensils and cookware. The location is good, however getting there is on a dirt road and it's a little dark in the evening. Faribault restaurants are about 15 min. away. My group was very satisfied with our stay and accommodations and we would not hesitate to come back or recommend."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"My high school friend and I get together a couple of times per year, with one being an overnight. We chose this location because it was peaceful and quiet, and we looked forward to sitting around a fire by the lake after dinner. It was everything we’d hoped it would be. Clean, easy to get to, remote enough to be quiet, close enough to town to visit shops, breweries, and restaurants. We enjoyed s‘mores by the fire, and taking in the beautiful moon and the stars glistening off of the lake. Truly a wonderful weekend catching up with a dear friend at a beautiful Airbnb! Thanks, Joanne!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Was in town with some old friends for a wedding and stayed during the fall season. The leaves were perfect and so was the house. We’ll definitely be back during the summer
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed staying here. The surroundings are beautiful, and the home is very comfortable!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"We had a wonderful stay at Joann’s AirBnB. It was everything she said it would be. The kitchen was stocked with anything and everything we needed to use, pots, pans, cooking utensil, nice size coffee mugs to go along with the Keurig and the drip coffee maker.
Joann was extremely responsive when we reached out to her.
Great host…"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place on a wonderful lake. Exactly what we wanted.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, peaceful location right on the lake. Was a perfect spot for a girls weekend. Home was spacious, clean, and well appointed. Joanne was friendly and answered questions promptly."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Clear communication, properly was as described, clean. We enjoyed our stay, highly recommend."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place it is a duplex but close to mall of America and good fishing lake overall 5 stars
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"We were in the area for a wedding in Elysian. There aren't many accommodations in the area, so this was perfect. It was a 30 minute drive there but not bad. It looks like the road may be getting paved soon? House was quiet, bed was extremely comfortable, & there was a Keurig & even eggs left in the fridge for us, although we didn't eat any of them. It is in a beautiful location on French Lake... wish we would have had more time to relax & enjoy the lake."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful place to enjoy a few beautiful fall days! The home has a great open design and tasteful, modern furnishings. Loved the large kitchen and breakfast bar. Much time spent on the upper deck with a glass of wine listening to geese and welcome lake sounds. I was serenaded by an owl one evening. Cool! This location was convenient for me to visit old friends in my home state. We enjoyed hiking at the River Bend Nature Center and had a terrific breakfast at Janna's Market Grill in Faribault. Joanne is a great host. I appreciated the fact that she provided all required information concisely and didn't overwhelm me with too many unnecessary details. Perfect."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved our stay. It was so peaceful and the views amazing! So fun to spend time fishing off the dock and the house was clean and decorated beautifully!
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,A wonderful stay!
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,The stay was awesome. Beautiful views and a lot of space and enough places for everyone to sleep.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lovely spot--super clean and peaceful and very well maintained and appointed. Everything very easy to find and in good repair, no poking around in scary basements, etc. Kitchen had everything we needed and a nice coffee selection to boot. Just had that nice vibe of a host who cares about her guests being comfortable. The inside layout and deck spaces work well for a group, and we comfortably slept six (one adult and five kids) with room to spare. I brought my daughter and her friends and they had a blast on the big inflatable in the water. The upstairs/downstairs bedroom arrangement is especially nice if you have adults and tweens who keep different hours. Would definitely come back with my family for some kayaking and swimming in the deeper water, too. There are a lot of stairs to the water so heads up for anyone with mobility issues, but the shoreline is sandy and very nice and clean. I'm only sorry we didn't bring marshmallows for the fire pit! Definitely recommend."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Can't recommend this place enough! We loved being on the lake and enjoyed a beautiful sunrise on the dock. Joanne's place has everything for a perfect getaway - a fire pit, boats, and more to create so much comfort and enjoyment. Thanks for a great stay!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Joanne's Lake House was a great place for our family get-together. House is well-appointed with a great view of a peaceful lake. She was a very responsive and friendly host to any questions we had. Would definitely stay again!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is at an awesome location. Has a private dock & kayaks & canoe & lifejackets are all provided! We took a boat so we could dock & eat & go fish as we wanted. The house is half of a duplex which we were unaware of. It did not bother us tho. The neighbors, if they were even home, did not make a peep. This place is extremely family friendly, had more than enough beds for all of us. I’d say for a night or two on the lake, this will fit your needs! Thank you, Joni!"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,The space was quiet and peaceful. Felt at home. Brought a boat and the boat lift was easy to use. Loved the view of the lake.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,It was my favorite Airbnb so far. The atmosphere and decor was perfect. The view and open kitchen were stunning. We had a wonderful and relaxing time. So thankful there was availability for us to stay. Would love to return next summer! The towels were luxury towels and the mattresses were extra comfy. Such attention to details! Highly recommend. 5 stars!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was peaceful, beautiful and serene. What a lovely listing. Thank you for the tranquility and we will be sure to check on its availability next year."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Group of 7 gals. Only stayed overnight but had a great stay. Gave us some flexible check in & out times. Because of rain did not get to enjoy the outside. Very clean & plenty of space for us!! Only used the coffee machine because we ate out. Would stay again!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful place to stay! Super clean and the bed was so comfortable. You do get a good workout from the steps, but the view and peacefulness is well worth it! Planning to return!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! The house was very clean and inviting. My girls loved taking the kayaks out! We caught lots of fish right off the end of the dock! Perfect little family vacation!
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Enjoyed our stay here!
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"We had an AMAZING Girls weekend at this BEAUTIFUL lake home! The house is cute & clean. The beds & linens were super comfy! Joanne was super responsive and friendly! She has literally thought of everything when stocking the home!
The home is located close to a Winery too, which was the perfect end to a day of floating on the Lake!
The only cons would be all the stairs down to the lake, so make sure you have everything you need before heading down! Also, we didn’t love the weeds in the lake near shore, but we just wore water shoes and got in at the end of the long docks and hopped on our floaty!
Book this BEAUTIFUL Lake home! You won’t regret it!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very beautiful location and home! It was very clean and the kitchen was fully stocked with appliances and cutlery. The view from the house was perfect. Would definitely stay here again!
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,it was a lovely place. beautiful view. very comfortable really enjoyed the stay
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"This was a great place for my friends and I to stay at, plenty of room for the five of us and it could even fit a couple more. We also enjoyed being right on the water! Also the owner was very nice and good at communicating with you."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,love the location and the house. Wish I spent more time at the location.
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Really enjoyed our stay. It was easy to find & house was right on the lake. Plenty of room & boys loved the utube tv.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The listing was exactly what we were expecting- clean, and spacious home great for two families coming together! We loved the two decks and the extra long dock. Having kayaks provided was nice as well! The water wasn’t swimmable the couple days we were there but cleared up as we were leaving. The house was a duplex- not a problem at all, all was quiet and there were privacy barriers. The only minor problem we noticed was a slight odor throughout the house. The large kitchen was great, and there were several gathering places where we could spread out comfortably with 8 people and not be in each others’ hair! We felt that the price was very reasonable compared to nearby cabins/houses and are glad we stumbled upon this property!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Great stay! Plenty of space for multiple guests and lots of lake access
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great all around! We will definitely go back.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The shallow lake meant warm swimming. Bring water shoes!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Owner communicated very well. Everything was taken care. Very easy and nice to deal with.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cute house! Clean and a great place to stay!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this beautiful home, on the west side of French Lake! The kitchen was perfectly clean & well supplied with all the basic cooking utensils, plus extras- like high quality cookware, a waffle maker, blender, Keurig coffee & herbal teas. The beds are remarkably comfortable, with nice, elegant bedding. The view over the lake is wonderful, & it's fun to sit @ the end of the amazing LONG DOCK! We would love to stay there again!! ❤️"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is a great place to get away. Close to the Cities but far enough away to be away from all the hustle and bustle. Very quiet and peaceful. We will stay again next time we are in the area.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Joanne’s place was so lovely! The lake and the dock were gorgeous. Joanne was very responsive and provided plenty of amenities. The house was incredibly clean and had plenty of space - would be great for a small family reunion or a friend trip. Would recommend and would stay again!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Excellent cabin, very good views and they have everything inside, it is very organized."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Perfect getaway right on the lake. Lake is pretty shallow on the Wells side. Loved a nice kayak cruise.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and beautiful sunsets on the lake. Home as described.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was great and met expectations. The lakefront access was perfect and there is a lawn area with lots of seating options.
We could see pelicans and other birds from the house. Binoculars and picture window were provided.
The two bedrooms on the main floor were good. The third bedroom in the basement is what you’d expect in a basement."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing weekend! Julie’s place was just what we needed - peaceful, beautiful, quiet, and relaxing! The kitchen had everything we needed for cooking great meals and we loved the deck and the dock! Julie is a great host!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The photos were good but the place is even better in person! The place is secluded from neighbors and noise and truly peaceful lake house vibe. We loved grilling and sitting outside with the view of the lake. There’s even a spot to easily bring your own boat. I like how it’s not too far from the airport either. The beds were very comfy. The host had fast communication and check in was very easy. I would definitely recommend and I would surely book again!
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful views, particularly at sunset. We spent a very relaxing weekend at the cabin. We loved the kayaking, playing games and watching movies. Wi-Fi was strong enough to take a work meeting outside. One of our family members biked on the nearby trail. Tons to do! Very clean and updated house."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful cabin. Julie is a wonderful host! We had everything we needed and she answered all our questions very quickly. We enjoyed kayaking, paddle boarding, and bone fires. We also went into town for delicious dinner and breakfast. Such a peaceful and relaxing getaway!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This little cabin on the lake was amazing to have the opportunity to stay at! We could have easily doubled our length of stay and had plenty to do and enjoy! The water was much loved by our kids and the kayaks and paddle boards were great to have and use. The view from the dining room table is hard to do justice in writing - it is absolutely stunning to watch the sunsets and sunrises over the lake and that huge picture window is just absolutely perfect for it. The house is well equipped for making family dinners and packing lunches for daily outings. The beds are nice and comfortable and the home seems to make you feel cozy and welcomed straight away. Can’t wait to come back!
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,A great family place and perfect for relaxing for the weekend! Thank you!
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and wished we could have spent more time at the house. It was inviting, peaceful, and relaxing. Natalka and Jeff think of every detail to help you feel welcome and ""at home""."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this space. The sun room was amazing, and sunsets were gorgeous. The space was easy to navigate and set up well. Host was communicative and accommodating."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very lovely space and amenities! My favorite spot in the cabin was the sunroom. Had it been a bit warmer, the deck would have been my next favorite. Beautiful view of the lake! Would definitely stay there again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We reserved Natalka’s place for a relaxing book weekend. It was the perfect, most peaceful spot to spend the weekend reading. Everything was very clean and organized, it felt like I was in my own home. I would fully recommend this place for anyone at any time of year. We’ll absolutely be back!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay at this warm, very clean and private cabin. We look forward to returning to this gem of a place on the lake!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Gorgeous lake house with stunning view. Super cozy with everything we needed -we felt at home. Natalka is a great host - accommodating and friendly.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really happy with the feel and attention to detail. They made us feel welcome as much as their beautiful home did. Would definitely stay here again as another mini stay cation in the future with my family. Great owners with a great location. Thank you Jeff and Natalka for making us feel welcome!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is easily the cleanest and coziest Airbnb I’ve stayed at. The furniture and beds were comfy. The kitchen was stocked with everything you need. The bathrooms had extra towels and necessities. My family and I packed the bare minimum and with Natalka’s thoughtful hospitality, we didn’t feel like we forgot anything at home at all. The best part about this cabin was the magical sunset views. The unobstructed beauty is literally right outside the cabin and over the lake. You can’t help but stop and absorb its radiance. As others mentioned, there’s a road between the cabin and access to the dock/lake. It’s a smaller road with speed limit of 25 mph. Plenty of cars drove by but not enough to take away the serenity or feel that it was dangerous for my young children. The lake was rocky & had green algae when we were there so we didn’t swim but we did go across the lake to a sandy resort recommended by Natalka and swam there. We really loved this cabin and will be back for sure!"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Best stay ever. Hosts are amazing people and very accommodating!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay at this lake view home! Natalka was great with all communications. We loved the spaces, comfortable furniture, and unique decor. Everything was clean and functional. We would love to stay again!
Access was very easy. However, we preferred the paved route from the south rather than from the north via Canby, which is gravel. It is only a few minutes longer (exit 56 rather than 59)."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Above and Beyond! From the first contact with Natalka to the individualized welcome notes at check-in, this place was above and beyond. Perfect for an extended weekend with our family of 4. Super clean, beautifully decorated, supplied all the household essentials, quality kitchenware, and responsive communicator. Home is newly remodeled, driveway held 2 full sized pickups and boat trailer. Lake is across a road, but very close. Quiet neighborhood. Only downside was not much of a yard. Would stay again for sure!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a beautiful lake home to get away to. Just a quick vacay before my oldest goes to college and my youngest into Kindergarten. Perfect space for all ages. Close to necessities and just enough away from the twin cities. Very quiet and welcoming. Sitting out on the dock at night was peaceful. My boys enjoyed the pedal boat of theirs. After we got home Natalka reached out bc my little guy forgot some figurines there. She’s making sure they get back to him. Not everyone would do that. So friendly. Great getaway and amazing hosts!
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Wonderful lake-sided accommodations and equipped for a very comfortable stay. We traveled with friends but took note on the amenities and furnishings being ideal for an extended family vacation.
Clean, comfortable and jammed-packed a lot of extras that you didn’t even know you’d want from an Airbnb rental. Fantastic value and great communications, we hope to visit again.
*small note rental is located on a busier bend of road, if traveling with children be mindful of them crossing street from lake dock/fire pit are to driveway/house. Overall traffic moves slower around lake and drivers accommodate pedestrians, but sometimes littles can be hard to spot."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was the perfect relaxing getaway. Located where you could drive to other places and come back to a place where there is peace and quiet. Beautiful home and hosts we amazing.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"we had a very relaxing time at Sunset Cove! Great views of the lake, close to town and everything you need for peacefultime with family!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"We had a great stay at Natalka’s place! It had every amenity we could have needed, and it was so nice being right on the lake. Couldn’t recommend this location enough!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Was a perfect place to celebrate the 4th with family. Beautiful sunsets by the fire. The home was comfortable and most relaxing. We hope to come back.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our family was excited to stay at this charming lake home and the place didn't disappoint. So cozy and relaxing. Beautiful view! The hosts were very responsive and friendly. The house had everything we needed.

2023-06-01,4,Group trip,Very clean nice stay!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were visiting for our son's graduation from Carleton College and it was a perfect lake getaway, 20 ish minutes away. from Northfield- beautiful, peaceful, spacious for our family of four. Natalka was incredibly helpful and always available for questions. Thank you so much !"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The lake home was beautiful we enjoyed our weekend in Fairbault close too family this home was very clean comfortable and cozy we loved it I highly recommend lovely place the host was great I will stay again
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful lake house with fun decor and private dock on lovely lake Roberds! Great views of breathtaking sunsets over the lake from the four seasons porch, deck, living room, or lakeside. The house was well stocked with anything you might need. Natalka and Jeff are nearby and very quick to respond to messages. Looking forward to our next visit."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Will stay there again.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Natalka thought of absolutely everything to make our stay seamless. Her home is beautiful, pristine and so cozy. We will definitely stay again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for sharing your home with us. We all enjoyed the beauty and peace and quiet.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Check in was seamless. Natalka has provided lots of useful information about the cabin and surrounding area. The cottage is beautifully redone. The kitchen is well equipped and spotless. The two king beds were very comfortable. The choice of indoor, four-season porch or outdoor deck (both overlooking the lake) offered great bird watching and lake watching. One small mention is that the road does pass between the cabin and the lake, though there is a private shoreline and dock. Hard to tell that detail from the photos. Very much enjoyed our long weekend at the lake."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was our second visit to this wonderful home. We will surely visit again. Sunsets are amazing!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The owners are committed to ensuring your stay is fantastic from check-in to check-out. This house is beautifully maintained, clean and inviting with thoughtful decorations and smart features/upgrades. The view is amazing, and the location is convenient. This was a fantastic experience for our family!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Natalka is a great host, she's very friendly and communicated with us promptly. I booked her place for 3 of my employees and they all enjoyed her place. It's nice, cozy and comfortable. Everything they needed to enjoy a good rest."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home..the beds were awesome, the fireplace added a coziness and the heated sun porch was a very comfortable space to relax."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was exceptional and deserves strong 5 stars!
We were staying at Kristy BoatHouse for 3 nights. The place is really close to both: Northfield and Faribault, but it is located on the beautiful small lake in a private and very cozy Neiborhood.
The first impression was that it was brand new: inside the house was so clean and beautiful, like we were the first visitors there. Everything crystally clean, nice furniture, a lot of board games. Kitchen is fully equipped, including what you might need for a dog. Fresh duck and chicken eggs was a great surprise!
The lake view is wonderful, very quiet, very comfortable bed, clean restroom. Our requests ware responded immediately. Kristy and Casey are great hosts.
There is a long bike trail nearby and I even found a place for rollerblading.
At our last day Kristy even let us to do a late check out and use kayaks for the last time!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very responsive and helpful ..greeted us upon arrival. Had a loss in the family and had to adjust our reservation hence, we missed out on the pontoon ..time with duckies and bonfire 🔥 .blessings and thank u 🙏 for your understanding"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is just super, an ideal place to retire and spend time together. The house is located on the shore of the lake, the view from the bedroom is amazing. You can watch sunrises and sunsets without leaving your home. Kristy is a very responsive hostess, she answered any of our questions instantly and helped us. We are very pleased. We kayaked, had a barbecue and just enjoyed this wonderful place. Thanks Kristy 🤝☘️"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Kristy and her husband are the most accommodating hosts we have ever had! Not only did they tolerate our toddlers attitude (ha-ha), but took us on a peaceful boat ride to fish, enjoyed fresh duck and chicken eggs for breakfast, gave us flowers and a card for their condolences and were always willing to help us when needed! Best Airbnb by far we have been to! Extremely clean and cozy! Thank you again for putting up with us! We had a wonderful time!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Amazing place to stay. The view was wonderful and the boat house was very comfortable. My wife and I had a very relaxing anniversary stay. Kristy was great and very quick to respond.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"It was perfect for the two of us and our dog. Nice and relaxing, quiet spot for an easy weekend."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It's hard to sum up in a few words but I'll try. Kristy and Casey are fantastic hosts. They were both so friendly and welcoming. We felt like we'd known them for years! The Boathouse is the perfect spot for a peaceful getaway. The bed was super comfy and the morning view was worth leaving the curtains open for! We enjoyed the flexibility of check-in and checkout time. Fox Lake was great for birding and kayaking! We were even invited for a pontoon ride at sunset! Fresh chicken, duck and Mallard eggs were so appreciated and the built in ""Easter egg hunt"" was fun :) All in all if you are thinking about booking this place, do! We can't wait to come back!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The boathouse was a very nice escape. It was so peaceful. We enjoyed seeing the ducks, chickens and other wildlife out each day.
We really enjoyed our stay, and our hosts were friendly and even took us out on their boat to tour the lake. Very clean space. We had everything we needed from linens to cookware and other nice amenities.
The location was close enough to towns and nature hikes and the hosts had recommendations collected in their welcome booklet and were responsive to questions.
Highly recommend the boathouse."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife, two dogs and I had a very pleasant stay. The boat house had everything we needed. It feels like you’re floating over the lake! So quiet at night.
Fairbault and Northfield are a short country drive to great restaurants and breweries.
Hosts were helpful and friendly yet respected space.
Would love return in the summer!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"What a great place to stay. Very nice hosts, great view right on the lake, will definitely return if I’m working in the area again"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very relaxing place with a great view. I would definitely stay here again
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,Was a great experience. I would definitely recommend and stay again
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay at The Boathouse! Kristy was super friendly and reached out before our arrival to ensure we knew she was ready for us. She lives next door and we felt we could contact her anytime if we needed anything. But we didn't need a thing! The house is very well equipped, squeaky clean and Kristy has thought of everything--even treats and poop bags for our dog! The surroundings are absolutely beautiful and fantastic hikes were not far away. We found some delicious food in Faribault and Northfield too. Highly recommend staying at The Boathouse!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kristy and Casey are very gracious host. Prior to our arrival, Kristy messaged us if there’s anything we need in addition to what was offered on their site. The boat house was a nice and comfortable place, very quiet, and private! The lake view was a gem and it’s the first thing you see once you open your eye in the morning.
They provided more amenities than was posted on their site! The kitchen was well stocked with condiments and other things that a family might need or use for cooking.
They even allow us to host a dinner for my daughter’s friends at school and joined us for dinner. The homemade venison sausage was treat and gave us more to take it back home!
I highly recommend the boathouse and will definitely stays in this place again!
Thank you Kristy and Casey🙏🏼"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to get away!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Kristy and Casey are amazing! We were asked if we wanted a hands off self check-in or a welcoming check-in with a tour. They were very mindful of giving us our space while still being attentive if we needed something.
We spent a long labor day weekend at the boathouse - binged watched some shows on netflix, went into a couple of nearby towns for food and groceries, and just felt right at home. Other residents around the lake had a bonfire and invited us to join them so we did. We saw the sun rise and set on the lake and star gazed. It was breathtakingly beautiful.
We love Kristy and Casey - we bugged them a lot and they treated us like family. We had forgotten a few things and they accommodated for us. They took us out on their pontoon for both swimming and fishing! We were shown different t fishing techniques we didn’t know about. We had an amazing weekend and will definitely return!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect!!! Small cottage next door to Furball Farm Cat Sanctuary. Every small detail in the cottage is cat oriented. There were two resident cats. it was nice to have some friendly feed lines to keep me company while I was away from mine.
Everything exceeded my expectations . Especially since this was my first time at an Airbnb. Julie was so sweet and friendly! The purpose of my trip was to spend the Furball Farm Cat Sanctuary. if you are a cat lover, you must visit and this Airbnb is the perfect place to stay!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Julie is a great host. We felt right at home on our second visit. The cats are wonderful too. Can’t wait to return next year
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you love cats, this is a must! The AirBB is on the same property as Furball Farm Cat Sanctuary! The farmhouse is absolutely beautiful inside, and very well supplied. Since we came at night direct from the airport, i was extremely grateful to find drinks, snacks, and a loving house cat, Marley, to wind down our evening with. There is so much to look at and enjoy, especially if you've been following Furball Farm for a while. The house is very clean and very well stocked with kitchen items if you want to cook meals. Very cozy and charming. Absolutely no issues, and based on responsiveness, if there had been something come up, im confident it would be resolved quickly. Loved having the sanctuary live on the tv so we could watch the furballs when we weren't in the sanctuary."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Julie and everyone at furball farms made this one of my favorite getaways. The Air B n B was so peaceful and made me feel right at home. Marley being their was a definite plus and he is such a snuggle bug. The sanctuary is right across the way making it so that we could just wake up and walk over. The sanctuary is beautiful and everyone there made us feel like family. I could not have asked for a better experience. If you are looking for a wonderful, peaceful, fun time I highly recommend and will be back"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was a great stay and a must for any cat lover! Can't wait to go back!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My friend and I had a wonderful time the house was beautiful and very clean and we felt like we were at home. Marley the cat was the sweetest cat
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved staying at furball! Have been following furball on social media for awhile now so it was a dream to be able to stay there! Housemate Marley is such a cutie and full of energy. Can’t wait to come back again one day! 🐈🐈‍⬛😻
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just got home from our amazing visit to the sanctuary and the Airbnb. It’s even better than I imagined it would be. The farm house is very nicely remodeled, clean and comfortable. Marley, the sweet kitty who lives there, is a bonus to complete the feel of home! Access to the sanctuary is an experience you don’t want to miss. Everyone there is working hard, having a few laughs and super kind and welcoming. The Furballs are all adorable, fat, happy and living their best life! Team members at the sanctuary go out of their way to make sure you get the most out of your stay. If you love cats don’t miss an opportunity to visit if you can!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet location. Was easy checking in. Close to town. The sanctuary was just a short distance walk, and even had a few feline visitors at our door. would definitely visit again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely house; beautiful windows to see the outdoors. Right next to the cat sanctuary which was amazing.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Furball Farm Inn is a perfect place to stay for any cat lover. The extended visiting hours at Furball Farm and having Marley (the cat) stay with you at the Airbnb is a treat. He is so affectionate. Lovely home with all the amenities you may need - towels, toiletries, extra blankets, dishes. Enjoyed the Firestick and being able to connect to Netflix. The hosts and volunteers at Furball Farm are so welcoming and friendly. The convenience of staying next door to the cat sanctuary is so worth it."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thank you Julie and Furball Farms staff. This was our first Air B&B experience and we already made another reservation here in the fall. It was peaceful and quiet with just enough activity to not feel isolating. We came expressly to see the cats, plus our cat-host Marley was a real character and added enjoyment to our stay. It's a good feeling to know part of the cost of our stay will be donated to helping the cats in the sanctuary. The volunteers were friendly and we saw how hard they worked to make the sanctuary comfortable for the cats and also for the staff. We felt like this was our home away from home. We loved seeing the cat themed memorabilia around the house. We also appreciated that Faribault is less than 35 minutes from the Minneapolis area which we also visited. Thank you once again for making our first Air B&B experience one to remember."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"A fantastic and unique Airbnb! Five stars!
We loved our stay at Furball Farm. The house was exceptionally clean, modern, well organized and had so many unique touches. It was so relaxing and private.
The house is nicely renovated and spacious, we were really impressed at all the details that made for a fun and comfortable stay.
Marley the resident cat is the friendliest feline host and made for a lovely house companion. It is nice to have his purrs and cuddles while watching TV or reading books.
The best perk was being able to visit the cat sanctuary outside of visitor hours and having dedicated time with all the kitties. We soaked up lots of time with the cats and chatted with the friendly volunteers.
Thank you for a fantastic stay at Furball Farm! And kudos to all the incredible hardworking volunteers. We had a blast and cannot wait to return!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We love staying here. Marley and Colton were great hosts. Love spending time with all of the cats and will definitely be back!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved our stay! Such a unique experience at the cat sanctuary and Airbnb. It was very clean and welcoming, and everything was cat themed. Plenty of room and very cozy as well. The hosts were very responsive and kind. We had no complaints, overall a great time! Can’t thank the hosts enough."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,We felt right at home. Newly remodeled farmhouse with main floor AND upstairs bathrooms. Lots of windows and natural light. Kitchen had everything we needed.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,You absolutely must stay here! Such a unique place and the work that’s being done by the selfless men and women across the way for the kitties is nothing short of amazing. The home was gorgeous and came complete with a house cat (Marley). You’ll feel right at home :)
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a fantastic place that included unlimited visits at the Furball Farm. We were comfortable and welcomed by all the volunteers. The resident cat, Marley, was friendly and loving. We had all we needed and would love to return someday."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,I came for the sole purpose to visit the Cat Sanctuary. The Airbnb is on the property. What could be easier?
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cats, Cats, ad more cats at this Airbnb sanctuary! This home is very comfortable from the moment you walk in the door. Marley the house cat welcomed us."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"1st time staying at an abnb everything was completely AWESOME my wife spent almost all of her time loving up the cats. Comfortable,quiet,clean and very relaxing. I can 100% guarantee my wife will be back this summer…
Thank you ❤️

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is very unique and special from other airbnbs. Not only do you have access to furball cat sanctuary, but you also have Marley (the cat) as your housemate. How amazing and rare to have a pet inside a house. He is a fun character and friendly to all. He made the stay even better.
The place is quiet and in a nice area but is close to town for all needs.
If you have some mobility issues, inside the place is very accessible but there is a large step to get into the place.
Overall the house is amazing and very comfortable. If you are a cat lover, you must try this place or at least visit the cat sanctuary"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you are considering booking this place, just do it. It is very comfortable, clean and beautifully decorated. The hosts could not be any nicer. And if you are a cat lover in any way: This. Is. The. Place. It is on the same grounds Furball Farm Cat Sanctuary.
If you are not a cat lover and just want a place in the Faribault area, this is still a great option as it is very convenient to downtown Faribault and hiking/biking trails as well (5 minutes or so)."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything was perfect!
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,we had a wonderful stay in this beautifully renovated farmhouse. the adjacent cat sanctuary is like nothing we've seen anywhere else! Just wonderful. The kitchen was very well appointed and large enough for cooking with the family. We would rent again next time in the area!
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,My group had a nice time at the house. Marley was sweet and wanted to snuggle anyone and everyone. Kitchen was well equipped and house was plenty spacious for our group of 4.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a go to place if you need to get away from it all. And it’s a must see place because the Furball Farm Cat Sanctuary is on the property!
The amenities are thoughtful, the host friendly, and the property peaceful."
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"Our stay was wonderful. We were greeted upon arriving and were able to stop in and see all the amazing fur babies we have been so excited to meet the first night. Julie, Janis, Kris and all of the volunteers at the sanctuary were all very welcoming, kind and friendly. We loved having our very own ‘live in cat’, Marley, who couldn’t have been more adorable, so fun and chatty and was an excellent nighttime snuggler. We also really enjoyed the games, puzzles and cards in the AirBnB and had lots of wine and laughs. Overall it was an incredible time! We would definitely recommend it this place for cat lovers and those just needing a fun getaway/break from everyday life. Thanks for the great memories. We can’t wait to visit again soon!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"My son and I absolutely loved our stay. The farmhouse is really comfortable and in such a beautiful setting. The decor is such a winderful tribute to the cat sanctuary. It was clean, quiet, cozy and big enough for a huge family! We felt right at home and really enjoyed Marley, the cat. He's quite the entertaining little housemate! We were able to relax and reflect on the day we spent working and hanging out with the amazing volunteers and cats - which was our reason for staying at the Airbnb. We even met Julie on the second day, and she is an awesome person, as were they all. We can't say enough good things about the experience and hope to be able to stay at the Airbnb for an entire week next time! This is THE place to stay for cat lovers!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This stay was a birthday gift for a friend who loves Furball Farms. Once Julie found out she went above and beyond and put up a Happy Birthday banner to greet her when she arrived. It meant so much to my friend. The house was was clean and inviting and she had such a wonderful time with the extended hours at the sanctuary. She said ""the sanctuary is so clean you would never know how many cats are really there! The volunteers are very friendly and willing to answer any questions you may have."" So the entire visit was a huge success and I can't wait to come to Furball Farms myself and stay for the weekend."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at the Furball Farm Inn with the intention of volunteering our time at the cat sanctuary! It was so nice to just walk across the driveway and get to work! Everything we needed was there, all we had to do was buy groceries for our stay!
I got lucky and Marley chose to sleep in my room down stairs! He was the perfect cat to greet new visitors to the Furball Farm Cat Sanctuary! We’ll be back, for sure!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Stayed the weekend before Halloween. Loved everything. There is one cat that stays in the house and is super friendly.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome stay!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,I was very impressed. The house was well stocked with supplies and appliances. I appreciated the use of the washer and dryer as I got a lot of Churu on me! Marley was the perfect cat host and bed fellow. I would love to have stayed longer.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful time .The place was everything I expected
It was just like the pictures on line If you go you have to stay
there.Hope to go back next year.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were so happy with our accommodations! We chose the BNB so we could visit the Furball Farm Cat Sanctuary, which was just a short stroll across the parking lot. The house is beautifully appointed and well stocked! It even came with cat host, Marley, who was the perfect gentleman and snuggle kitty! Julie, Janis and all of the volunteers were super nice and treated us like royalty. Julie came to the house to help us understand the TV remote and then stayed for a while to visit.
It was a perfect weekend get away. We will definitely be back!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Julie was amazing and having the sanctuary a few steps away is perfect.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We went to experience the cat sanctuary and felt very welcomed. The farmhouse was peaceful and we opted for Marley, the cat host, to stay with us. He was charming!! My husband LOVED the huge heated vibrating recliner (with Marley in his lap of course!)The farmhouse was roomy, clean, and peaceful with a beautiful view and right across the parking lot from the sanctuary. Julie, Janis, Kris, and other volunteers were extremely nice!! We travelled from NC to see Furball Farm and it did not disappoint. Liked the town of Faribault. No problem finding a place to eat. Some lovely old homes there too. Friendly people everywhere. Great stay!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stepping in to the Furball Farm Inn was like stepping into a good dream. It was like stepping into and living in a movie that you’ve seen and loved many times over. The house was exactly as advertised, and a perfect setting for any cat lover. The facilities are very modern and it is tastefully decorated. Charming. Quiet. Comfortable. Convenient. I loved it! Everything was well-stocked. Everything worked. Plenty of linens. Kitchen was well-stocked. Internet TV was a little slow at times, but for a remote area, that can be expected. It was not a problem. WiFi was great. I loved the company of my four-legged roommate. Marley is a sweetheart! It was my dream to visit the Furball Farm Cat Sanctuary, and getting to stay right next door at the INN was fantastic. I loved it. And I hope to return again someday. Highly recommended!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Furball Farm Inn is the place to stay if you want to visit over 350+ feral kitties. Located on the property of the Furball Farm Cat Sanctuary, you have easy access visit the Furballs when you want and even volunteer to help clean. The Farmhouse has been updated, is clean and quiet at night and even comes with its own in-house kitty Marley should you choose to have him stay with you. The property is out of town and is surrounded by trees and open fields. The trees were just staring to turn beautiful Fall colours. We had a wonderful time with Julie and all the volunteers. Everyone was very helpful and kind. We are so grateful we had the opportunity to stay in this lovely Farmhouse, visit the kitties and meet the wonderful volunteers. Thank you so much Furball Farm for making our vacation so memorable. We cannot wait to go back again next year and stay at the Furball Farm Inn!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This AirBnb was perfect! Beautiful setting, beautiful inside, absolutely loved it! The main reason we came was to visit the Furball Farm Cat Sanctuary. The AirBnb was an added feature, and even came with its own resident cat, Marley! If you love cats this is the perfect place for you!. The house was spacious, clean, welcoming and inviting. I loved seeing all the info about past and present cats at the Sanctuary. We will definitely be making a trip back soon!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Furball Farm Inn is not only a beautiful space and extremely clean but is also on the grounds of the Furball Farm Cat Sanctuary. It is a private and serene location. Would give this place 10 stars if I could. Thank you for everything- can’t wait to come back!
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"My Mother turned me on to Furball Farm Cat Sanctuary...and when they opened their airbnb, my mother was all about making a trip, motivating us to join her. She and my aunt drove from Illinois, and I flew in from Denver, to meet them. There was not one thing we were without during our stay. The airbnb is stocked well, had everything we needed, and is of course a wonderful option to visit, as a bucket list trip. Marley, the resident cat, is a great host...along with the other cats that hang about outside, and greet you. I highly recommend staying at the airbnb, for the total and complete ""Furball"" experience. We are already working towards our next trip...and will be back soon. Everything needed is in close distance, restaurants, grocery stores, gas stations, etc. We enjoyed Carbones (lunch buffet was yummy) and the Crooked Pint Ale House. Many thanks to all, for a very memorable experience."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you are a cat lover, this is a must see. Great people doing great things. They care for all of these cats and know all their personalities! We will definitely make a return trip and stay at the airbnb. We were also able to talk with Julie about how she started up the sanctuary. Very inspiring ☺️"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, quiet, location, surrounded by pines and greeted by kitties outside every morning looking for treats!
It’s a very nice, warm farm house. Shower was nice and big. Spacious living room and kitchen. Good internet service. Love the train that goes by and toots the horn. Fully stocked with what you need. Hosts are very nice, available and accommodating if you need anything.
Sanctuary is steps away! An unforgettable experience!!! I fell in love with all the beautiful cats!! Julie and Janis and all the volunteers there are all so nice!! They work like dogs at the sanctuary to keep it spotless!
I would definitely recommend and plan to return!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay and cuddles with Marley! The house was clean and cozy!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks you so much for a great visit! Furball farm and the Airbnb were wonderful. The area is so peaceful and beautiful. We loved how close we were to the cat sanctuary and how close other amenities were. Julie is fantastic, can't wait to see her again. Thanks for a great stay."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We chose this home because of the cat sanctuary. Our family was welcomed to visit the cats, and we were included in the evening treat time. We highly recommend this experience to cat lovers."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, peaceful farmhouse next to the Furball Farm Cat Sanctuary. If you love cats, this is a must. If you want to understand rescue and the needs of feral cats, this is a must. Wonderful people."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb Farm House is a MUST for all cat lovers! Not only is it clean, modern, spacious, and comfortable, it is ""steps"" away from the cat sancuarty. It is so uniquely decorated for anyone needing a dose of cat decor! Julie is the most amazing host... friendly, kind, personable, attentive, and respectful. I can't tell you how ""at home"" I felt, with easy access by keypad, free wifi, privacy, very peaceful at night, tons of lighted security, and has a beautiful view of cats and the sanctuary below.
I can't wait to go back there and I highly recommend this awesome place to stay. Thank you SO MUCH, Julie. You are absolutely the best!
-Jill B."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolute bucket list tick!!!! We all had the most amazing time at furball!! Go give those kitties some love!! The house was so special and even came with Marley the cat. We felt right at home :) so much love to Julie, Janis, Kris and the team!! Y’all are a blessing!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved the Furball Farm Inn. I had a fantastic stay. The house is comfortable and complete. Marley the host cat made my stay 10x more enjoyable. If you’re looking for a relaxing retreat and you love cats, this is a must place to stay. I’m planned my trip from North Carolina with the sole purpose of experiencing the cat sanctuary and walked away with precious memories. I plan to return yearly! Thank you Kris, Janis and Julie. Thank you volunteers for being welcoming and friendly."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This Airbnb was wonderful. We loved visiting the Furball Farm Cat Sanctuary across the parking lot. Marley, the cat was a great host, very friendly and was quite talkative. Marley enjoyed sitting in our laps. The location was quiet, peaceful and beautiful. It was a short trip into town to eat. We especially liked The Depot.
We would love to return for a longer visit in the future."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had the best time staying and visiting with with all the kitties at the sanctuary each day. Extended hours for our visits were such a treat! Marley our housecat ensured our time between santuary visits did not go without plenty of kitty cuddles. The house was clean and so comfortable, plus peaceful and private. The hosts were very kind, attentive and helpful. I just can't say enough about what a wonderful experience we enjoyed!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Fun times visiting the cats!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you love cats, then this is a must bucket list item. The house was exactly the way the pictures showed. Given the temps were close to 100, we were grateful for the air conditioning. Nice and cool. The previous customers even left some goodies in the refrigerator. I nice assortment of snacks were available for us on the counter. Beds are so very comfortable. We highly recommend the Furballfarm Cat Sanctuary Airbnb. Julie, Kris and all the volunteers made us feel right at home. And a perk for staying right on the grounds, you get to visit the kitties after the normal visiting hours. You will not regret booking this Airbnb 😻😺😽
Ellen and Diane"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay, house was beautiful and clean, staff were great and very friendly. Love furball farms and will be back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed it and would stay again!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Fun girl's night out!
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Our family has always said ""the purrfect Airbnb experience would include a cat,"" and this one included the most amazing cuddler named Marley plus another 350 of them that we could visit just a few steps away! Heaven! The house was spotless, adorable, spacious, and as comfortable as home. Everyone in the sanctuary made us feel welcome. Thanks for having us, we look forward to returning! A truly therapeutic and memorable experience for us."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an AMAZING experience. And if you love cats, you must put Furball Farm Cat Sanctuary as a must do experience on your bucket list. I learned so much about feral cats, their care, and why places like this sanctuary are needed and we all must spay and neuter stray cats. The house is quiet, bright, and includes thoughtful amenities in case you forgot something, as well as delightful surprises related to the cats they care for—pictures, books, puzzles. When you rent, you get a few extra hours with the cats beyond visiting hours, and I came to volunteer which was THE BEST so I was able to really experience a few full days. I can’t say enough good things about the Furball Farm Cat Sanctuary and the people who staff it."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a great experience, the house was perfect. There were 6 of us and we were quite comfortable. I love that people leave what they don't use, there were a couple of sodas in the fridge along with some snacks left out so we returned the kindness and left some donuts, frozen pizza, soda. Will definitely use again when available."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,The perk of extended visiting hours at the Cat Sanctuary enticed us to stay at the airbnb. We thoroughly enjoyed the interaction and volunteering at the sanctuary. The home was conveniently located right next door. It is. Spacious house with all the accommodations a family needs. We made our own meals in the kitchen. My kids had good Internet connection so they were able to use their electronic devices when we were not at the sanctuary. All in all it was a fantastic experience.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Love the host Marley❤️ Julie and her siste walked through with us showing the hospitality. They even invited us to cook out. We did go and had a good time. Will definitely come back❤️
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,I had the pleasure of staying at Furball Farm Inn recently. It was a dream come true. I got to spend the day at the furball farm sanctuary next door then got to walk across the driveway to the Airbnb for the evening. I relaxed in the recliner and watched some TV. The bedroom was very comfortable. I paid a visit to the outdoor cats in the evening while they were all out and about. Location was good- only about 10-15 minute drive to food and coffee. The entire experience was an A Plus and I can’t wait to come back (hopefully for longer next time). This should be on ever cat lovers bucket list!!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This says say a few words, hmm. This is a cat lovers dream. You are greeted by cats. Can sit outside at night with the peace and quite of the country, and of course more cats. You wake up in the morning and are greeted by cats. Most of all a kind compassionate owner. They should be proud. This beautiful remodeled house is perfect in every way. Huge open concept, large bathrooms. We did not stay long enough to use the great laundry room. Loved the outside seating!!! A place that will not disappoint. The cat sanctuary is the biggest bonus and my personal favorite. Put this on your bucket list!!🐈🐈‍⬛"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Enjoyed very much.!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend!! Very beautiful house and quality host!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything was very clean, lovely place to stay."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I will absolutely stay here again. Lisa was a great host. House was clean and had lots of extra amenities that made it comfortable and luxurious to stay in.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I don't normally write reviews. However Lisa stood out amongst a sea of mediocrity. The effort they put in as hosts is evident in every aspect of the home and they take pride in what they do.
We had issues (our own) at the beginning and they helped us remediate the problem IMMEDIATELY. Even when we lacked the collective brain cells to unlock the door.
I would visit Lisa's (and Kevin's) place again in a heartbeat. I hope to when we visit family next year.
Thank you for the wonderful memories during a friend's Wedding weekend."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kevin and Lisa were great hosts! They went above and beyond to accommodate some unique needs I had and additional requests. I will definitely stay at their rental again!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our 3 generations had a wonderful time. The place was so clean and decorated so nice. It was a hot weekend but we enjoyed every minute of it. The cows are definitely worth seeing.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a home on a lake with great views and a great place to relax, take in the quiet life and enjoy fishing from the dock or from a boat if you have one. The one drawback is the 57 steps down to the lake or should I say the 57 steps back up the hill. But every step is worth the view."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a great stay while my son was at hockey camp. We swam, rented kayaks & really enjoyed the lake life. Plan to be back next summer!
As an add on…I accidentally left a bag of stuff to return to Walmart…and Lisa returned for me without even being asked! Hero status! A great host!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was super cute, clean and very comfortable. The front porch deck was nice to hang outside and just chill. Actually we did lots of that after a long walk and or bike rides. Best place to bike is the Sakatah Singing Trails bike path. We parked at the Dairy Queen and went from there.
Can walk across street and down 59 steps to access a deck to sit or a few more steps to the dock. We often took our chairs down to be closer to water and watch any lake activity. Saw Eagle one evening. Pretty quiet town with most places not open til Wednesday. Enjoyed food trucks at 10,000 drops with cocktails or beer. Both excellent. Great place to relax."
