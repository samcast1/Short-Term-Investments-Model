There was a nice fenced-in backyard and lots of extras (bathroom toiletries, condiments, and cold waters). There was also a good selection of games, foodball and skeeball. Josh was friendly and quick to respond to questions or concerns. He was also flexible with check-in time. Check-in was easy, but there was a strong air freshner scent upon entering. This was easily remedied by removing the extra plug-ins. The beds were comfortable, but one of the upstairs beds was very squeaky.

Unfortunately, we had a very hot uncomfortable sleep without any real remedy or reimbursement provided by the owner."

I wish the washer and dryer wasn't down steep steps, it didn't make me feel safe going down to do my laundry, so just brought dirty clothes home with me. I'm 60, so I can't afford to fall and get hurt. Other than that, I loved the place. Enjoyed it being quiet. Loved the bed, very comfortable.

Large and spacious luxury. Bathroom with everything you need.
The space may be the cleanest place I've ever rented through airbnb, and it made you feel very welcome.

The street parking was easy, it was a quiet area and we ended up bringing our own water but there was also bottled water in the fridge. Charles was responsive to a date change we needed, and we got a message the morning of the stay saying we could check in early at our convenience. The distance from the Civic Center was great for the conference we were attending, and it was fun to admire the other historic houses in the area. Close to lots of restaurants and cute shops as well. We would absolutely stay again!"

Great neighborhood with some stunning houses, right by the university campus. Easy check-in and check-out. Bathroom was clean and kitchen was well stocked with plenty of kitchenware, refrigerated water bottles, Keurig cups, and tea.

The bed was comfortable. Place was clean. Charles was very responsive and helped us out with a later checkout which was great because we had a late flight out. Wish there was a tv. If you don't like climbing stairs, this place probably isn't for you... the home is older and the stairs, steep. We would stay again as we felt safe and comfortable."

It is a nice place to stay and relax."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This house is so charming and cozy! It was the perfect space for 2 moms & their teenage daughters to stay. Charles provided so many extra amenities such as cold water bottles, coffee, creamer, tea, toothbrushes, toothpaste, box fan in bedroom, plenty of blankets, pillows & towels. Beds were very comfortable! It does get bright in the larger bedroom so if you prefer to sleep in I would bring an eye mask. The neighborhood is adorable! Just 2 blocks up is W Moss street which has some beautiful huge homes to look at. Also, just a 5 min walk from the house is a great restaurant we had breakfast at called West Town Tap. We were just a short 10 min drive from the riverfront which was a beautiful area. Charles let us check out a little later so that we could enjoy a walk around the neighborhood and he was very knowledgeable about the area. I would defiantly stay her again!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Charles Cottage makes you feel home away from home. Minutes away from Bradley University. Love how Charles has items that you may have forgotten at home at your disposal during your stay and a thoughtful gift to take with you to remember your stay in IL.

Just an FYI, there is no TV or games in the house, so come prepared for that if you have kids or teenagers as I did. Apparently, I missed that in the listing, so that was on me. I went and bought some games so we had something to do in the evening when we were winding down.
Anyway, highly recommend this place."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay at The Cottage. It felt like a home with nice features like live plants, quality stainless ware, and Illinois pictures and mementos.

The houses on nearby Moss avenue are impressive and Bradley University is close by. Well-done, Charles."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Three of us stayed at the Cottage. It looked like the pictures. It‚Äôs a cozy space designed to accommodate no more than 4 people but comfortable for those 4. The interior is lovely with newer furniture and beautiful plants. Both bedrooms are upstairs, along with the bathroom. One bedroom is larger with easier access to both sides of the queen bed, but both are easy to navigate. There is a tiny outdoor space and more beautiful plants in front of the home. The stairs are steep outside and in but relatively easy to navigate. Charles was also open to feedback. I would definitely rent the cottage again when visiting Peoria."

We enjoyed the back deck and riverview immensely! We wish we could have had more time to spend having fun using the home's amenities including the kayaks and ping pong table that were readily accessible.

You can tell that Kim puts ALOT of work into perfecting this place. Everything was extremely comfortable!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,my wife and I loved it. We can't wait to plan our return trip!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I wish I could have stayed for more than just one night! Having the water right outside your backdoor is so peaceful at any time of day. The house was clean, had fun decor, and had all expected amenities. The hot tub was wonderful to soak in after a long weekend of traveling and was clean and functioning. We were able to fit 6 with the pull out bed. It's a pretty small space in general and definitely felt tight in the living space with 6, but worth it anyway for the peaceful location, hot tub, and price imo. There is also plenty of outdoor space to occupy as well as a downstairs if needing to spread out. Also you will absolutely not run out of towels in this house. üòÖ There were probably ten in every closet and cabinet I opened. If you like maximalism decor and design this is definitely your dream place, but I think it could be a bit overwhelming to some.
Final review is that I would definitely stay here again if I'm ever coming through Peoria!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have enjoyed staying at Kim's other place at Chillicothe earlier and we were sure that this one would also be great to have a peaceful stay for the Labor Day weekend.

The hot tub worked great and it was a beautiful view. I also appreciate the care in letting guests feel at home. I would definitely stay there again. The only downside was the downstairs patio was pretty buggy.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My parents had a wonderful few days in Kim‚Äôs beautiful house. The house is adorable and they were able to watch eagles fish in the river from the porch. The weather was cool enough to enjoy being outside, and they had everything they needed to cook at home and relax. It was easy access to be tourists in Peoria, and they loved the Caterpillar factory. Kim was extremely communicative, and we highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a beautiful space to relax!"

2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Kim was very forth coming with keypad instructions day of check in. Parking was easy & very close to house.
The art in the house was so beautiful & we loved admiring all of it. For max occupancy of 4 people there were too many chairs & tables in living room area making it a bit cramped for just 2 people. The shower on the main floor was a joy to use!
Both patios were great. We used the second level one the most. It was enjoyable to use the hotub at night. And in the mornings the sunrise views were amazing.
Kim has an amazing house & has done a great job with the landscaping & patio areas as well as the decor & furniture inside!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Don't hesitate to book your stay here! The pictures of the house simply don't do it justice. Kim has curated a wondeful collection inside the home, not to mention the beautiful views of the river from the 2 levels of the property. The hot tub is a great added touch. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this clean, inviting home, and liked its close proximity to the city as well."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Kim‚Äôs home is exactly as described in the listing. Very artsy, comfortable and clean. The hot tub was pristine and as someone who has been burned by getting to a rental to find a dirty hot tub, this exceeded expectations! Kim has been thoughtful about the home with touches like having lots of towels available, multiple dog beds in the lower location, and plenty of ways to have seating (that also doubles as decor). I might have missed this in the description, but I hadn‚Äôt seen the number of bathrooms listed and we were pleasantly surprised to find two full bathrooms. I highly recommend this rental!"

Her home is beautifully decorated, has every necessity you can think of, and the view of the lake from the hot tub was amazing. We will will definitely be back again!!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super cute space. Loved hot tubbing with a bald eagle in the tree next door. Never heard a train come by. Bring an eye mask if light wakes you up. There are awesome windows and a great view but no blinds. I'd totally stay here again.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spot for 4! Thanks Kim!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are traveling to Peiora or the surrounding area this is a must stay!! The pictures don't do the view justice.

My favorite was on the deck watching the Sunrise with the humming birds."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The pictures do NOT do this place justice. The house and view were amazing! We loved taking the paddle boat out for sunrise & sunset. Great amenities!

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The views for this house are absolutely amazing as sunsets over the water with multiple areas to enjoy the waterfront view was excellent. Overall, the house has everything you need. I also appreciate Kim as this was booked a week before an event as my other Airbnb was canceled last minute. Communication was excellent. Highly recommend."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kim was very attentive and prompt when communicating about anything we needed. The house was very clean and well maintained, and the hot tub was amazing! The pictures do not do the view justice, and she even had a hummingbird feeder on the deck that attracted some feathered friends! Her directions about the check in and out were clear, and for a first time Air B&B user, I felt like the communication made it feel almost like staying at a nice hotel, rather than worrying about messing up somebody else's house!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The mornings on the back porch are amazing. We had geese and ducks come visit with sailboats tacking out on the water.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very clean with great view.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The home was exactly as described. We all enjoyed the early morning hot tub soaks watching the sunrise.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful host.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"this place was EXACTLY the kind of spot we were looking for to get away from the noise of chicago. the home is beautiful and decor is very thoughtful with lots of character, right down to the googly eyes on the fish on the living room paintings!
some airbnbs have an artificial feeling, but kim's place made it feel like we were staying in an actual home.
the illinois river is right behind the house, accessible via stairs. it was low tide when we got there and we still managed to leave our three day stay with about 8 catfish and 2 bluegills.
very private and quiet location, only saw the neighbors on each side of the house maybe a total of 4 times during our stay, but they're very respectful!
it's off a road, but we didn't even notice it because the splashing of water in the back was so calming and at night, the sound of the giant TV helped drown out any road noise.
it rained a little while we were there, but there is a ping pong table that we enjoyed!
we were welcomed with a note from kim! she is also very communicative and texted me to check in on how our stay was going.
the hot tub is just an added bonus to an already wonderful place!
if you're looking for a nice and quiet time away from your regular life, this is the spot!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kim‚Äôs place was the perfect getaway for 2 plus our pup. It was super clean and stocked with everything needed for staying over. The hot tub with the view of the river was amazing. We ate at KO Sushi while we were in town and would definitely recommend. Kim was communicative and a great host. Thanks Kim!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was great.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful little high-end cottage, right on the Illinois River! The bed and sheets were primo and so comfortable. we didn't even use the kitchen since we only stayed one night, but I'm sure we would have found all we needed. The jot tub was the icing on the cake. Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful rental!!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host and place to stay! Super quick to answer any questions regarding the home and gave concise and clear instructions for check in and check out. Loved the place and I definitely recommend for anyone looking for a quick getaway!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Relaxing in the hot tub on the river with friends was exactly what I needed! This home is spotless, eclectic an beautifully put together.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had such a great time staying here! The river views and hot tub were very enjoyable. The inside was very cozy and accommodating. Kim has done a fantastic job of blending many different styles for eclectic and edgy decor vibes! There is a busy street and train tracks nearby but the traffic noise blends in when soaking in the hot tub or watching tv inside. We would definitely stay again next time we are in town! Thanks Kim for being such a great host!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a great place to relax! The hot tub overlooking the water was very nice. Everything was clean and we appreciated the small personal touches (beach towels, coffee, rocking chairs on the deck, etc...). We enjoyed our stay very much!"

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Such a fun place! The owner has put so much love into it. Highly recommend.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My friend and I are two teachers who were in desperate need of a relaxing spring break getaway, and this lovely home most certainly did the trick! The views out back are great, especially from the hot tub! We think it should be noted that there are train tracks very close to the front of the house. In two days we only experienced one train passing by, which was at 6:30 am; but it wasn‚Äôt as loud as we expected it to be thankfully. The huge tv and all the fun art details are beautifully done, and we overall really enjoyed our stay; it flew by far too quickly!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Right next the river, beautiful scenery, easy access and greatly decorated. Wife loved the how beautiful the place is."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,You‚Äôll definitely want to see the sunrise over the river! So beautiful. And Kim is the nicest host!
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kim‚Äôs place is clean and beautifully located! The hot tub was perfect. Kim provided nice dog amenities. However, space is pretty crowded with more than two people, including the hot tub- maybe better suited for two and a pup."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful view! Beautiful rooms! Sooo cozy and the hot tub was the cherry on top of the cake. So divine! We will definitely be back!!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place for a weekend getaway! The hot tub on the deck was amazing and so relaxing. The house was so clean and very well decorated! It was also nice to have a two big TVs in the living room and the bedroom. Overall, such an amazing Airbnb!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kim's place is a private oasis all season long. We visited just after a snow storm and the frozen lake Peoria was a sight to behold. An upscale interior in the middle of a rugged Midwestern landscape is an experience you should not miss.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We chose Kim‚Äôs Airbnb in hopes of a relaxing and peaceful evening. We were extremely pleased with the decor and overall warm and inviting home. We loved using the hot tub at night while watching the barges go by. Will definitely stay again!

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A unique, well appointed getaway. Kim was very helpful, and ensured that we had everything we needed for a memorable stay. Cozy TV room, wonderful patio with hot tub, and engaging artwork created an experience that was just right for a family with a baby, a teenager, and mom and dad. Enjoyed easy access to natural areas and the amazing Grand View bluff line as well. Highly recommended."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"For years, I've been looking for a great getaway that was close to restaurants and shops, but had a nice getaway feel. Kim's place is it! The accommodations are impeccable and lush. You will not want for anything! The art she has in the cabin is beautiful and a real treat to have surround you. There are so many bland Airbnb's, this cabin is a treat. And that view off the deck--with a hot tub! Every evening we enjoyed it--especially in the snow! I cannot wait to come back during other seasons to see the area and more of what Peoria has to offer. Kim was also incredibly helpful, thought of everything and answered all of our questions so promptly. We needed this vacation (don't we all?) and it was a very rare moment when not only was it all we hoped--it FAR exceeded our expectations. Don't pass this up!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great host!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great river views and relaxing home. The hot tub was pristine. We would come again.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved my stay here. You can not beat the view of the river while relaxing in the hot tub. Great stargazing and sunrises. Very magical place. Best of all pet friendly! Kim created a truely zen like retreat with her eye for design. Nothing basic about it. You are right on the river. There is sandy beach and a place to build a fire. Super easy check in and out. Complete privacy.
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"The only bad thing we can say about the property is that it is deep in the neighborhood. Because of that though, it was very peaceful and homy. If I am in the area I would definitely book this location! Great value!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was great! Jillian had everything we would need to crash for a night.
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy place, and Jill provides a lot of ""extras"" to make your stay enjoyable. Would have loved to have blackout curtains for many of the rooms, as it felt a little weird that neighbors could see through curtains into the house."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Clean, well kept house. Hosts are very thoughtful providing activities and toys for kids."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Not our first stay and we will most certainly will be back again! Wonderful, quiet location yet SO convenient to food, shopping, and for us‚Ä¶family!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jillian's place worked perfectly for our family. It was the second time we stayed there and will stay again when we visit family in the area. It's close to several restaurants and a mall. With a 2 and 5 year old, we appreciated the basement area where the boys could play and run around. Nice, clean, well supplied. It's a great place to stay in Peoria!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I‚Äôve stayed at quite a few AirBnb‚Äôs but Jill‚Äôs was probably the cleanest and one of the most hospitable! Her home was VERY clean and she had snacks, beverages, and even courtesy freezer bags for leftovers. Thank you, Jill."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The house was very clean and the host was very responsive and flexible.
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Place looks just like pictures inside. Outside of the house didn't match how nice it was inside. Owners were very accommodating and nice. Place served it's purpose. Thanks for the snacks

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Comfortable home in a quiet residential neighborhood. Shopping and restaurants within a ten minute drive. Jill provided many extras - snacks, toiletries, books and games for children. Pocket door in bathroom made it possible for one person to be in the shower and another person finishing their bedtime/morning routine at the sink with plenty of counter space. Nice place to stay while visiting family in the Peoria area. Would stay again."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice home close to lots of restaurants and shopping
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Highly recommend this place to families with young kids! We stayed with our 3 children under 5, which is always tricky. But the trundle bed, bed rail, available pack n play, and lack of stairs and breakable clutter really helped! There were snacks and small toys out which made a huge difference when we arrived at bedtime and needed to entertain grumpy kids while unpacking. I know it's hard to choose where to stay when traveling with young kids, but this place is a really great option."

Wonderful experience and stay!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I stayed here on our way home to Ohio. The location is in a peaceful residential neighborhood but close enough to a mall, many fast food restaurants, grocery stores, etc. The pictures describe the home perfectly. The home was very clean. Jillian had top notch linens, bedding, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, etc. my families absolute favorite though was the snacks and juice she had available for us. The kids were so excited to see them when we first walked into the home. She also had ice packs and to go cartons if you need them. It‚Äôs those extra touches that made this such a great place to stay. We will be back!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This charming home was spotless and fit the needs of my husband and I, my daughter, her husband and 2 kids. Everything about the process was easy and trouble free. I would definitely stay here again and will recommend it to others."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was by far the best Airbnb we've stayed at within our budget. We felt completely at home... very cute, comfortable, and clean. Lots of extra added touches we haven't found in other places. Jillian was very helpful, responsive, and friendly. Our only complaint was the mattresses. None of us were used to hard mattresses but that's just a personal preference and a small price to pay for an overall lovely Airbnb. We enjoyed our stay and hope Jillian will have us back again next year."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Tidy, well stocked home in a quiet neighborhood. Conveniently located."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very nice home! It was clean she had everything you could possibly need and want!! Very convenient!
2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Pros: Very cute place. Clean and had quiet surroundings. The bed in the main bedroom was comfortable and had nice bedding. The bathroom for the home was neatly adorned and very clean. There is even a pocket door to provide some sense of separation between the toilet/shower area and the sink. This is useful since this is the only bathroom in the home.
Cons: I was not expecting the TV in the living room (the sole TV in the home) to be quite as tiny as it was. There was also an issue with ANTS in the kitchen that was quite overwhelming for me, especially being in the kitchen, eeekk! The only other con, more for convenience, it would have been nice to have a full size ironing board since this is a house and not an apartment rental.
Over all this rental served the purpose for our family ."

Check-in and check-out were easy, and Jillian left a list of clear and reasonable house rules to abide by during our stay. Jillian's home was incredibly clean, and the decor was very aesthetically pleasing and inviting. We traveled to Peoria during a particularly snowy couple of days, and Jillian informed us that she would be coming to the home to clear the driveway.
She didn't have to do that, and it was very much appreciated and made our departure go much more smoothly than had she not offered to do so! All of the amenities listed on her advertisement and then some were included in the home--she has clearly gone above and beyond to make her guests feel right at home during their stay. Would highly recommend staying here!"

2021-10-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pros:
Good Location
Snacks and some beverages available
Cute decor
Mostly well equipped
Cons:
Dishwasher left a film on the dishes to the extent that they didn‚Äôt look clean‚Ä¶ We ended up hand washing them.
The host received a alarm that there was water in the basement and asked me to go downstairs 3 separate times check it out, clean up the water, and take a picture of the thermometer. Subsequently, we didn‚Äôt have hot water for showers the last 24 hours.
No sponge or dish cloth for washing dishes"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A super-thoughtful superhost with a very home-y house! Walking into this space feels like coming home with art on the walls and comfortable bedding available (including a variety of pillows). The food amenities were more than expected and very adequate.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough good things about my first experience at Blackbird on the Drive, and of Jim & Rebecca.
They were helpful in booking, responded quickly to questions, and were super friendly!
Being from the area, I was already familiar with the location; however, I was pleasantly surprised at how peaceful, quiet, and serene the home was. It felt like a 5 star resort rather than a home in the heart of a thriving city!
I was blown away by the cleanliness, furnishings, and extras inside the home!
The robes made me feel like a celebrity, the stocked bar with fridge & recipes were a hit, and the beds were incredible. BEST SLEEP EVER!
This was a work/play stay and I will be recommending it and returning!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home was beautiful and so comfortable! The view was fantastic. There were extra amenities that were a pleasant surprise!

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had an amazing birthday weekend at Blackbird on the Drive. The space and views are absolutely beautiful, and of all the many home shares and vacation homes I have stayed at, this one easily offered the most amenities and hospitality items--including a well-stocked bar and entertaining fridge. I had a minor issue getting into the home when we first arrived, but my call for assistance was answered right away and it was figured out almost immediately. I had a few local friends over to celebrate my birthday and they were all raving about the space and talked about how comfortable they felt while there. This is my second stay at a Jim and Rebecca property, and it definitely won't be my last."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jim and Rebecca‚Äôs Blackbird on The Drive is the absolute best AirBnB I‚Äôve ever stayed at. The home is stunning, the views were beautiful at night with the city lights, the bar was fully stocked, they left Christmas cookies and a charcuterie board for us. I used the space for boudoir photography and my clients were shocked with the beauty and how comfortable they were in the home! While I wasn‚Äôt photographing clients my toddler and husband and I lounged; there were 3 living rooms to choose from so it was easy to get cozy. I already have clients asking when I‚Äôll return and originally I planned on using other spaces to add variety, but this home has variety enough and Rebecca & Jim were just fantastic! Thanks again!!!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Jim and Rebecca‚Äôs Blackbird house was an incredible stay for us, probably the best Airbnb experience we have ever had. Very clean and extremely welcoming."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This home is STUNNING. Even more beautiful in real life. I booked this home for my bridesmaids and I to stay at/get ready at and it was perfect - absolutely no shortage of mirrors and outlets. Hosts were extremely welcoming and generous. Would definitely stay again just for a fun weekend retreat!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We booked this for the weekend of my wedding and my bridesmaids and I got ready here. It was the most perfect spot and we were able to get some beautiful pictures!!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jim and Rebecca‚Äôs place is great. The view is beautiful and peaceful. We would definitely stay there again.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jim and Rebecca are excellent host. We were met with comfort and a homey feeling. The home is absolutely stunning! Only complaint is that we wish we would‚Äôve booked more nights! Will definitely be back soon‚Ä¶ this is our second stay of their five ‚ÄúBeatles,‚Äù named properties! We plan to stay in the other three asap. Highly recommended!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing! No other word can describe it.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a lovely home!!! We felt so comfortable and safe. The home was decorated beautifully and the views were great.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,The hosts where amazing and the house was beautiful!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an amazing place to stay! We live in the area but we felt like we were at an all together special location away from home. You can't help but relax and enjoy this lovely, comfortable home. We highly recommend it!"

The design and aesthetic is stunning.
Bravo Blackbird!!
Well done Jim and Rebecca."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was great. There were multiple sitting areas where we relaxed and hung out with the other couple staying with us. Some nice deck areas that are available if the weather is nice. Easy to use appliances in the kitchen. Jim and Rebecca provided a number of cocktail choices in the upstairs lounge area that we sampled. They left us some breakfast muffins and juice. The location was perfect for the disc golf event we were participating in. It was close to all 3 courses and plenty of dining and shopping options.
The only challenge we had was that the only true shower is in the master suite on the third floor and there is no door to the master bath area. The couple that was staying in the second bedroom on the second floor had to walk through the master suite to shower. My wife and I would stay on the first floor to give them privacy. This required some coordination around showering. The second floor bath has a tub with a shower wand which they did use a few times."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Not only was this the most beautiful Airbnb I‚Äôve been to, the house was one of the most beautiful decorated homes. The interior design is phenomenal. We rented this place to take my bridal photography shoot and this place was absolutely perfect for that. We will definitely come here again. Hosts were great, professional, and hospitable."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have been booking/staying in home sharing properties in multiple countries since 2016. I can confidently say that Blackbird on the Drive is THE BEST property I have rented, hands-down. Pictures do it no justice (even though they look great!). I knew it would be an awesome stay when the hosts messaged me after booking to thank me for choosing their home and offered great suggestions for local restaurants. My husband, friend and I were blown away by the hospitality provided: a fruit/cheese plate, cocktails, coffee, anniversary cake, high-end toiletries/robes/linens and an enormous shower that I did not want to leave! The home is stunning, from said shower to the massive outdoor patio that we found ourselves enjoying each morning and evening. Comfy beds and sitting areas‚Ä¶I could go on forever. Thank you for making our anniversary trip a memorable one and we will definitely book with you again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at the Blackbird was exactly what we needed for this trip!!! With a busy week, we loved coming back to the house to relax and enjoy the beautiful view.

Jim and Rebecca are amazing hosts! Their attention to detail and commitment to hospitality shines through. They are very responsive and have included so many special touches to make you feel welcome. Upon arrival I was greeted with a note and a fabulous breakfast board with a variety of fruits, cheeses and croissants. The place is beautiful and comfortable with so many cozy seating areas for lounging. I especially enjoyed the soaking tub and the fully stocked bar‚Äîwhat a treat after a long day of appointments. I was in town on business and felt so fortunate to land here instead of a hotel‚Äîso much better. Oh, and did I mention that view? Thanks again Jim and Rebecca for curating such an incredible stay. Can‚Äôt wait to come again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very relaxing! Lovely home with great views! We highly recommend this house. Jim & Rebecca were excellent hosts. They surprised us with a cake for our 50th wedding anniversary. Thank you for helping us have a great anniversaryüíï M & F
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,We were in town for an unexpected death in the family and staying at this place allowed us to focus on our family and not have to worry about where we were staying. We had to extend our stay and Jim & Rebecca even stopped by to refill the bar at the house. We can‚Äôt recommend these hosts enough and will definitely be looking at staying at either this location or one of their other locations next time we are in town.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic place to stay! Super easy to find and great location next to shopping, restaurants and the interstate. Neat view. Place is better then the pictures looked! Welcomed with Cocktails and a little breakfast tray. The owners have went above and beyond to make the place cozy and to feel at home. Highly recommend and we will be back!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Book this house! It is beautiful, and Jim & Rebecca are fantastic! We had a girls‚Äô weekend here and couldn‚Äôt have picked a better place. Great spaces for togetherness and apartness. Customized refreshments abound! The views from every level are breathtaking. We also recommend two restaurants: Sugar Wood-fired Bistro (and they Doordash too) and Thyme Kitchen & Craft Beer (just over the bridge into Peoria). And the house is also very close to a shopping center with lots of budget-friendly eateries and shops in case you forget anything. I‚Äôm already working on organizing a return trip. Book. This. House. ü§ó"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at ""The Old Farmhouse"". Very comfortable and homey, but with all the modern amenities.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My stay was a bit unusual. I rented the house to be close to my daughter after she had given birth. I checked in on day one of agreement just before 3:00. I began making some meals in the kitchen to bring to the new parents. By 8:00 my daughter was on the way to emergency room and I was back at her house watching the dog and 2 day old grandson. I never got to sleep at the house because my daughter was admitted with an aneurysm. The next morning I removed my things from the house and ‚Äúchecked out‚Äù. Due to the situation we had more family come from out of town and needed a place for them to stay. Back and forth communication of all the chaos was responded to quickly and we were able to continue our original agreement with Andrew. I would have loved to stay here as it was a 3 minute drive to my daughter‚Äôs house. I will keep it in mind for further use. The house was updated and super clean.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed in one of the best Airbnb since we started using the service‚Äîthe 100-dollar charge to clean after the stay was excessive based on what we experienced. With that high of a charge, expectations were higher."

This Airbnb is our first choice for accommodations in Peoria. Centrally located, a large variety of shopping and dining options within a 10min drive--one of Peoria's favorite (and oldest) bars is within walking distance.
The host is super. Quick responses and very friendly. The layout of the Airbnb is very nice--open floor plan with enough amenities to make hanging out relaxing.
We are looking forward to a return trip in 2024."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great experience here. We were in town for a wedding and the hotel was over 400 a night and that was not in our price range. When we got to the house, the thermostat read really warm. Andrew answered our questions at all times of the night and when it wasn‚Äôt getting colder he personally came over to see the issue and got a technician out to the house within the hour to fix the issue. He turned an uncontrollable issue that came up into an incredible customer service action. The house was clean and looked exactly how it did in pictures. The only con (which it wasn‚Äôt a deal breaker at all) was the location of a bar not far from the house which was kind of loud the first night but the price and the customer service made this a 5 out 5 experience and I would recommend anyone to stay here."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to post up for a few days while working in Peoria. Will definitely use again when back in Peoria!

It is worth noting to guests who may not have considered a riverside location, you may get an unwanted visitor in your living quarters. We had a very persistent little mouse try to enjoy the living room fireplace with us the first night there. Tressa was quick to respond to the message but there was little that could be done at the time, though she assured us it would be addressed. Overall, would recommend for the view alone!"
