2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Decent location but you should plan on having a vehicle if you want to really see the city!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed the step back in time provided by the beautiful old house combined with all the modern amenities we expected from an Airbnb. Meeting Stephanie and Jason there as they were working on another apartment was special.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stephanie's apartment is 100% as described, spacious, clean, nicely decorated and ideally located. The neighborhood is in the most beautiful part of Downton Little Rock, and restaurants and bars are within walking distance. Stephanie and Madison are helpful, courteous and flexible. So it was possible for me to check in earlier and the bikes provided for free are great for exploring Little Rock.
An unrestricted recommendation!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a cool apartment in a historic home - totally comfortable, spacious and with everything you might need in the kitchen! Loved the SoMa neighborhood as well, not a bad walk all the way over to the river even, and hosts were very welcoming and accommodating. Would be happy to stay again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A spacious studio in a big old house. Easy parking and great location. Around the corner from SoMa, a great neighborhood with lots of restaurants, shops, etc."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It was very refreshing in the area, and inside the home as well. I stayed upstairs in bed #3 and everything was clean. I only spoke with Jason for a few minutes since I arrived early and he was welcoming and explained everything to make sure I was comfortable. It was a peaceful experience and I enjoyed my stay."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I stayed at Stephanie's for only a night and that's probably the only sad part about my stay. My first thought when I checked in and dropped my bags off was that this was one of the best places I've stayed at using this platform. My room came with its own little kitchen and bathroom and both were extremely clean and pleasing to use. Things were extremely clean and the room even had a ton of pamphlets with local recommendations. I will use this place again if I ever find myself in Little Rock.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stephanie's place was well worth it I felt right at home the minute I walked in their home was very comfortable very cozy very easy to call my own I would love to own a place like this I would recommend Stephanie's place for anybody it is a lovely and well worth the price
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay! I felt comfortable walking my dogs at night. I would stay there again!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Accommodations were perfect for our weekend here with a kitchen that had all the tools we needed, super easy street parking in front of the home, walking distance from multiple great restaurants in a hip up and coming area. There were other guests staying here when we were and the A/C unit was a great sound machine, so we couldn’t hear them. The apartment had awesome blackout curtains in the bedroom area that really helped keep the morning light out & the mattress was extremely comfortable! Loved being able to stay in a historic home and the vintage furniture was a great touch. We had a wonderful stay here and would love to come back if we are in the area."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super cute and quaint! Loved it
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,love it here!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,love this spot!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was clean, cozy, comfortable, and charming! We really loved staying here! It has the vibe of a New York City apartment or international hostel, with lots of character! The location is excellent! SoMa is a fun, vibrant area, with lots to see and do! Check-in & check-out was super easy, as well as parking. Thank you Stephanie for providing this lodging option! We’ll be back!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great spot!
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The unit we stayed in was clean and was a great value for the price. It had a full kitchen and dinning area, the bathroom was a little small but the bedroom had a comfortable accent chair to relax in."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed our stay and were especially thankful we got to bring our dog along!

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great value for a cozy two night stay! Love the amenities like board games, bikes, etc."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Adorable home. Very well thought out and equipped for a short or long stay! Loved the chalk boards!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay very much! The room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. It is in a great location as well, close to everything. The hosts were very accommodating and friendly. Will stay at again if we return to Little Rock in the future."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nice apartment located in a decent area! I really enjoyed how close the apartment was to restaurants. I felt safe walking my dog late at night when I arrived in the neighborhood.
The space was very nice and clean, definitely as others have mentioned be aware before booking that the walls are pretty thin so quiet guests would probably be most favorable. The hosts were very quick to respond to questions I had which I appreciated!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our second stay there. We will be back again!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,It was a lovely place to stay! I was able to walk to dinner. The bed was comfy and the room was clean.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Was passing through on a road trip with my dog and had never stayed in Arkansas before. I was pleasantly surprised with the welcoming energy and surrounding neighborhood at Stephanie’s! You can tell she put a lot of thought into the space. It doesn’t feel like a random bleek home that is only used for rentals. Privacy was not an issue and the check in was a breeze. I even asked to stay 30 minutes longer because I was enjoying myself so much and didn’t want to hop back on the road….i would love to return in the future!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Stephanie and Jason were responsive, kind and I never actually met them, but their communication made me feel at home. They communicated clearly and let a bit of humor shine through. Their place was lovely, private. As a single woman I always have to be extra careful about safety and I felt perfectly safe my entire stay. Thank you both! I would stay again :-)"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great, quiet place. Perfect for my overnight stay with my dog. Clean & cute! 100% recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Snug little place that was perfect for a quick night layover. Thank you!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location and great host. There is no huge pre-checkout cleaning list which is so rare lately. Very thankful for that! Everything was clean, cozy, and quiet. We will definitely be back."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Huge old house in a residential neighborhood but just a couple of blocks away from restaurants, bakeries, ice cream and lots of boutiques. We felt very safe walking around there. Kitchen is pretty dated and bathroom is small but both were clean and had all you need. Comfy bed, overall good value. Really like the entrance with the wooden bench and staircase and just an overall welcoming vibe."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful little place to stay with lots to do nearby! The building is charming, perfectly clean upon arrival, and there was no long list of tasks for guests to do before checking out, which is rare to encounter these days."

Lots of recommendations of things to do in the area and in the city. Safe neighborhood and easy parking. Wish I had more time to spend here."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location and price. Perfect for an overnight in Little Rock and close to where I wanted to spend time.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It was great - super easy to get to, get in, I liked how they allow dogs on the bed but also said ""please use old bedsheet on top of bed,"" (but of course). Bonus? Cornbread Festival was going on the wkd I was there and totally walkable from the AirBnB, lol! I would def stay again on my next pass thru Little Rock."
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very comfy bed and nice neighborhood for walking our dogs. We checked in late and left early, so all we did was sleep. It was just fine for what we needed!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a great find! I stayed only one night however I was able to walk to the river in 20 mins which has a lovely river walk. Nice and quiet and slept so good on the bed. Will stay here again if the opportunity arises.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The place was just what we needed for a weekend stopover in Little Rock. So close to south main - which has cute coffee shops, restaurants, and boutiques. Extremely walkable. We stayed during a particularly rainy weekend in Little Rock, but took the opportunity to walk around when it slowed down.
Stephanie as a host was extremely responsive. Instructions for checkin and check out were so easy!!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Charming building and neighborhood. I was with my pup, so it was nice to be walking distance to the dog park and places to eat and drink. Definitely would stay here again if I’m back in town!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great affordable spot with a super welcoming host.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely wonderful place! Stephanie was a very considerate host! I got there very early and she had recommendations of where I could go with my dog while I waited for the apartment to be cleaned. The apartment (#3) was very lovely and cozy. We really liked the layout. This apartment is within walking distance (2-3 blocks) of the main street with all the restaurants and the distillery. The neighborhood felt very safe and the local residents were very friendly. I am looking forward to staying there again.
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,My room was clean and nicely decorated. The bed was comfortable. It was nice to have a kitchen with a full-size refrigerator with ice trays in the freezer. The lock on the door was easy to get open. I enjoyed sitting on the front porch.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cool house in a great neighborhood. Walking distance to some great restaurants and the distillery. Stephanie was easy to communicate with, and check-in was seamless. Would stay here again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent stay in a lovely space! Perfect for exploring the surrounding area — so many restaurants/shops/cafes in walking distance. Comfortable and secure. Can’t wait to return — highly recommended!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay here. The apartment was perfect for our needs and was a really good size for us both and was very clean.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Totally recomendable :)
The place was perfect, I could stay longer there. I was there for 3 nights and I felt very good. The place was very welcoming, all clean and comfortable. The bed was perfect to rest and you have all you need in the kitchen.
A supermarket is close even walking and there are many places a short distance, so you feel like at home. I knew that there were other apartments in the same home but I we never see each other I felt a good privacy.
Excellent communication with Stephanie.
Thank you !"
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Was what I needed for the night. Bed was super comfortable, check in was a breeze"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved this stay! The place was super cute and quaint. Hosts are very responsive and supportive! Thank you for a lovely stay.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely great find!! Loved it. So did my four legged companion and honestly one of the more unique airbnbs I’ve been to. Highly recommend
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I came back because the stay was fantastic! I and my daughter enjoyed it for many days. I'm a stickler for quietness and peace. I had an amazing Stay! I will recommend to anyone traveling here to Little Rock. They generally give you everything you may need and better than a hotel. Yasssss!! This place will not disappoint you if your seeking. The skyline out the windows is my favorite because I love trees and loved 👀 seeing the Monarch land on the window as I cooked. Being able to cook, and have essentials like pots, pans, access to a refrigerator, most of all a coffee pot makes all the difference in the world for awaking early morning. Being able to open the kitchen window in Apt #4, was truly unique. I love hearing outside noise and it was my highlight. I'll book it any day over a hotel if your a more reserved person. I am!
Best,
Kanisha"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An older home and shows its age. The room, kitchen, bathroom, and all spaces were clean and well maintained. Nice location. We stayed for three nights and found the property to be well suited for us."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I enjoyed it so much, I felt like I was visiting a family member's home. Private, Peaceful and very chill. I and my daughter both familiar with the neighborhood because I once lived at 1400 Cumberland location over a year ago for 5 years, so I wanted to stay close to SOMA which is why I wanted a downtown location to relax in before I move back downtown area permanently again soon. Stephanie and Jason's place gave me those memories of living back downtown again. I grew up on Rock street 1 street over and have lived in downtown most of my entire life, and I felt right at home at this residence. I miss it so much being close to nearby restaurants, convenient grocery stores, and the entertainment district especially the Bernice Gardens, and my favorite Pizzeria Rad Uno. Thank you all for the experience and I look forward to lodging again. Never a dull moment living in downtown Little Rock, Arkansas.
Best,
Kanisha and Scarlet"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Stephanie responded quickly to my questions, and even assisted me with a mistake I made while booking. The room was just as pictured and clean. I would definitely recommend."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I stay at Stephanie's place when I pass through Little Rock and it's always worth the stay! Very walkable neighborhood with shops and restaurants within 2-3 blocks from the house. Parking is very easy out front.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great cozy stay! Definitely recommending friends and family stop, as it is a great half way point on the road trip from IL to TX. Thank you for the stay and for allowing fur babies into your home 💙"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful stay! Definitely my favorite AIRBNB and we stay in them very often! Very clean and friendly host! Beautiful location!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Thanks so much Stephanie! The spot was perfect for us. Convenient and comfy. I wish we’d gotten in a little earlier to take better advantage of the local eateries. Though we did get a couple great sandwiches at the “membership “ bar/billiard spot. Perfect neighborhood walking for the dogs.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,One of the nicest most unique stays I’ve had. Beautiful space in a great hip area
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great value. Perfect location. Super walkable neighborhood with beautiful houses, cute shops and several great restaurants. This was a long weekend for me and I brought along my dog. We had a great time and we’re able to rest in a good space."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I slept so well at Stephanie’s! I will definitely be returning!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Stephanie and her co-hosts were great! Very helpful and responsive. She came in person to resolve an issue which made our stay very comfortable. Being new to the area and not having done much research about the area, I didn’t know what to think of the area, but other than that very comfortable stay!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Stephanie's place was the perfect accommodation for our short stay in SoMa. We loved how dog friendly she and many of the local businesses are. We enjoyed Community Bakery Coffee, browsing in the Sunday Farmer's Market, The Root Cafe, and The Bark Bar. Wonderful location in a neat area of town! Thanks, Stephanie!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Right next to SoMa! Stephanie’s place was such a cool local experience. I loved the character of this house and that I had a private kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom in this cute old home!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay! Everything was as described, and we had everything we needed!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed Stephanie's place! The bed is really comfortable, and there are clear instructions for checking in/out and things to be aware of during your stay. We loved how close it was to restaurants (less than a 5 minute walk), and we enjoyed checking out some of the local spots nearby."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for letting me stay here! It was perfect for the short visit with relatives.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Super convenient and cozy place! It did get a little hot with only the window units, but otherwise I had a wonderful stay."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely lovely stay & Stephanie and Jason could not have been nicer. Would definitely stay at their home again!!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay in this bnb. We felt right at home. Stephanie was so nice and let us check in an hour early. We loved the atmosphere of the old house. There were a lot of recommendations on the magazines that she provided by the door! The place is close to a lot of nice restaurants and the museum! She responded right away whenever we asked a question and was always very accommodating. There was construction going on which was actually helpful for us so we can wake up and explore early! Haha! Would 100% recommend this bnb to anyone I know :)
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,place is kind of funky and eclectic. a fun place to stay. very convenient to downtown and the rest of Little Rock. the apartment was cozy and clean. and the chalkboard in the kitchen ( you just have to see it to understand) was a fun addition.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean and decent place for the price
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay! A good location with lots of things to do a quick walk away. Very clean and cozy space. Would stay again when in Little Rock!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a charming apartment in what seemed like a safe neighborhood. We were on a long car trip, and did not feel like fully unpacking the car, and it was fine on street parking in front of the home. There were renovations happening, but they weren't a bother at all.
The host provided detailed information on the area, which was very helpful.
The bed and provided linens were very comfortable. Absolutely would stay again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome listing! Would definitely recommend! Hosts we’re definitely accommodating. Property is located right by any local business you might need.
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very reasonably priced. Easy access to downtown.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Nice and cozy place with a nice little kitchen. Best part is that it’s near a Main Street with good food and a farmers market. Had a great time walking my pup around the neighborhood too. Will be coming back in the future!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks so much
2023-03-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place in a lovely neighbourhood with easy access to downtown and other spots around the city. I really liked the place with had a warm and cozy vibe and Stephanie was attentive and easy to communicate with.
While all that was great, there was some pretty intensive construction going on at the house at the time which woke me up pretty early each morning. Moreover, I couldn't get to the laundry without stepping on discarded roof tiles littered with bent nails, which was not a pleasant experience."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a great place to stay. Very old building with lots of history and character! Stephanie was very quick to respond to my request to book and followed up to all my questions immediately. I will definitely stay again the next time I’m in the area!
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"I perhaps missed this in the description, but I didn’t realize the apartment was on the second floor. Because I’m taking a long trip, I have a cool chest and food along with me in addition to my suitcase and my dog. This was a lot of carrying up and down the stairs for me. Being an older person, that made it harder. Perhaps they could mention that. I can see that they’re renovating the house, so there is a lot of construction material in the hallways, and in the apartment."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Cool place and great location! We will try and stay here if we ever return to Little Rock!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Responsive host, easy check in. 5 stars."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stephanie was kind and very responsive.
The space was beautiful and was within walking distance to downtown. Stephanie also provided bikes and the river trail is a great space to bike.
Stephanie is a fantastic host!!!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place and Stephanie is an amazing host!! Planning on moving to LR and she helped us out a lot with local places and job opportunities 🙂
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great and clean place!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was a great find for a last minute stop to break up a longer drive. We didn't get to experience it as part of a longer trip to Little Rock, but with the detail and level of information provided by Stephanie as well as the location, I imagine a longer stay would have been great. Especially love how pet friendly it was-it's not always easy for us to find a place that will allow all 3 of our dogs. Also really appreciated the thoughtfulness: having a white noise machine? Genius."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a great place and amazing hosts! Clean, comfortable, dog friendly, and safe location.  Everything you would need for a trip. Short walking distance to some great restaurants, dog park, museums, and more."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I was able to make this reservation the morning of our stay! Such a lovely place with lovely hosts. Communication was great. Would stay here again.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Had a great stay at Stephanie's place. It's a comfortable studio that's easily walkable to lots of restaurants, a nice park, etc. Would happily stay here again next time I'm in the area!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I loved it. Very cute and comfortable
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location was great for walkable restaurants, bars, and access to things to do. In my opinion, it was a central location. The apartment served my needs as far as a comfortable place to stay. Kitchen was nicely stocked with cookware and serving utensils and you could cook your own meals. The house guide was very helpful and informative."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It was a lovely stay! It’s in walking distance to the Main Street with all the restaurants, so you can take pets on a nice walk. The apartment was clean and I felt safe!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Close to grocery store, restaurants and pharmacy. Quiet neighborhood.
Owner very serviceminded and easy to get in touch with. Also Jason is very friendly and serviceminded. I would come back anytime"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a great little place for one or two people. You’ll actually be surprised how big it is inside. The kitchen is quite spacious with a long hallway, leading to the bed. The bathroom is small but that’s to be expected from an old building. It’s really close to restaurants and cafés. You must go to the Root cafe for breakfast. There are also some bars just down the street. The people in the area seem to be friendly. I actually got into a two hour conversation with a couple on the street while walking my dog. I would definitely stay here again so I could explore the city more."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is the third year in a row ive stayed here and each time its super easy to check in, people are really nice and the host are responsive. Ill be back next year again for sure!
Love this place"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,You’re only two blocks away from a great selection of restaurants and stores but the place itself is remarkably quiet and homey. The full kitchen with a full-sized table was great to have. Even during an extreme cold snap the suite was toasty warm.
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,It is a very nice and comfortable place. A large and older home that has many interesting attributes from the front porch to the beautiful old staircase in a neighborhood of similar older homes. Thank you for hosting my stay.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great little place to stay, just a couple blocks from South Main. Great value, and highly recommend!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the cutest place ever. We honestly kept saying to ourselves how this is like our dream home! Loved it! Quaint, quiet, adorable, charming"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very comfortable and cozy bed and linens. Easy access. Coffee included with all the kitchen stuff. Nice towels.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Stephanie's place is awesome! It's a two-block walk to Main St where there are cute shops and restaurants. It's a pretty nice, walkable neighborhood in general; definitely great for walking my pup! The space itself was wonderful and the bed and pillows were very comfortable. Check-in was a breeze and I'd highly recommend this place to anyone coming through Little Rock!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A very quiet, safe and walkable place to stay, but know it is not the most updated home. However, it has what you need for a clean and cozy stay - plenty of fresh towels, good water pressure in shower, comfortable bed, cooking amenities, shampoo/conditioner, soap, lotion, tissues, etc. It's a great place to stay for a few nights for one or 2 people as it is a tight space. As mentioned, it is an older home so quiet guests are best as you don't want to be hearing other conversations, music, etc. from the other rooms. I will say the wifi didn't work great for the smart TV at night but that isn't a big deal if you don't plan to stay in the apartment most days. No drinking water provided, but luckily I had brought my own. There was also no dish soap to wash the few dirty dishes I had (hope that wasn't a pain on my hosts!). I really liked the place overall and felt right at home. I would stay here again for sure!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Stephanie’s listing is very accurate and it was a perfect stay for us in a big old house with lots of room and character. We brought our bikes and we’re easily able to store them inside the house. The location made it easy to get around town. Too bad we only had the one night to enjoy Little Rock.

She was great at answering all my questions and pretty quick about it as well. I also appreciate that she was willing to host us with our two huge dogs while in our roadtrip cross country.

The building is quiet and the check-in was super smooth. We had some trouble with the door sticking but we were able to get a hold of someone and get in with absolutely no delay.
We really appreciated the little touches, like the trail guides and neighborhood guides. There is also a fully functional kitchen if you need it! 5/5"

The yard was really nice and fenced to let my pup wander in the morning and have coffee. Everywhere I travel I love to go on walks and runs to explore the city. So much is close to this spot, great coffee (a must), a beautiful park and dog park across the highway and there is a nice walkway across just a block away, museums, breweries, and close enough to walk or run to the river market area and trails. 10/10!

At no time did we hear any traffic noise from the interstate. We had a great stay and plan to return. Thank you!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This wonderful space was the perfect layover for me and my pups. We were passing through on a road trip and wanted a nice place to rest. I would suggest The Layover to anyone! It’s fabulous!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This tiny house was the perfect size for my husband, myself & two pups! Dero was super speedy with his messages and although we didn’t need anything extra from him, I know he would’ve gone out of his way to make sure our stay was perfect!
For anyone who will be bringing dogs - The yard was a good size and being an owner of smaller dogs I’m always extra careful when it comes to making sure there’s no gaps around the fence! Deros lot was perfect - he also provided a couple dog treats & bowls!
We walked to a couple close places and felt comfortable - I’m not going to lie, the area has a couple rough spots but that comes with any city, there were a couple homeless people a couple blocks away but they were friendly and didn’t harass us walking around. You can tell they are doing lots of remodels on many of the lots in the area, there are some really beautiful modern houses including Deros!
We highly recommend
The rail yard
Lost 40 brewery
Root cafe
Nexus coffee
Thank you!"

We got to meet Dero, he was warm, gave us great information about local surroundings, restaurants and made us feel right at home. We would definitely stay at his place again. Hopefully we will be back for more than one night."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was a perfect place to stay for a single person or couple- lots of restaurants nearby as well as a lovely dog park. The outdoor area was such a nice tough being fully fenced in and having seating as well as a picnic table to make eating pleasant since the inside is more setup like a modern hotel room. Everything is exactly as described and Dero was responsive and helpful. They even had dog bowls and dog treats ready- my little dog had a great time in the yard as well as the nearby dog park. The bed was extremely comfortable and the tv was easy to use with access to streaming services. They even had some provided bottled waters and coffee pods- I cannot imagine a more perfect place to stay for short trips. I wish we had more time to explore the area, this was a stop in the middle of an out of state move so we were only there briefly but I confidently recommend this for anyone needing a short but very comfortable stay in the area."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect place to stay for a night’s rest to break up a cross-country road trip. It’s like having a hotel room except you have a fenced in yard and premium parking, and no elevators! Dero left the place welcoming including dog treats and filled water bowls for my pets. Room and yard were very clean, which is appreciated for a pet friendly place, which is usually not the case for hotel rooms. There was an issue with someone parked in the designated spot when I arrived but Dero was quick to respond and resolved it in person right away. Will try to stay here again for my next trip!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful little place, great recommendations, loved the porch. My dog and I loved this place"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This stay was one of my first stops on a very long road trip. The location was exactly as described, super easy to find. The bed was very comfortable and over all, just the perfect stay when you’re passing through or visiting!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"we absolutely love staying at this house! it is absolutely gorgeous and the perfect size for what we needed. I love the fact that there were dog bowls already there - and even some dog treats left by the house, which was a nice touch! The property is lit up very well what you made me feel safe as a solo traveler. I wish it was warmer, so I could use the space outside but it was a perfect outside area for my dog. it is a semi shared driveway, which was no big deal, but completely separate from the main house, which was perfect and private. I loved the fact the host had the separate fenced in space for just this house. The bed was comfortable and everything was super clean! I will definitely be staying back here when I come back through in a few months. The location is right because it is right off the interstate but we did not hear any type of noise."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Came in on one of the coldest weeks of the year I’m pretty sure, and I was definitely thankful for this place. It was perfect for me, and my dog, exactly what we needed and easy to find. The owner was super responsive, especially when I locked myself out, ha ha.. really appreciated this cute space. Wayyyyy better than a stupid hotel! Thanks for the soda, chocolate, and milk bone—the way to these girls hearts! 💕"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I cannot rave about how awesome this stay was! I was only there for a night but I could not be more appreciative of how easy the check in process was! I absolutely LOVE the design on this place and the accents! The host even made additional touches for my fluffs! It’s literally like staying in a mini house. There’s even a separate fenced off front yard set up for relaxing as well just for the tiny house :). Would definitely stay there again!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Dero’s place is in an up and coming neighborhood and had every amenity we could think of for our stay as we passed through Little Rock. His attention to detail in prepping this little space was really well done. Everything from water bowls filled up and treats ready for our dog when we arrived to herbal teas and folded up towels for us, this was the perfect cozy spot to stay and relax after a long drive. Dero also responded immediately when I had a question about the lock and had a book of recommendations for exploring. Highly recommend this cute spot!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely LOVED this stay and will choose it any time we’re passing through Little Rock again! It was so pet friendly — the fully fenced yard with plenty of seating was such a hit for our group. The place itself was such a neat, cozy little place and had all of the amenities you would need. Can’t speak highly enough about this stay — just book it!"

I’ll definitely stay here again if traveling here. I thoroughly enjoyed the stay.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Dero’s place was perfect for our long road trip with our two dogs to get some rest.

Conveniently located off the interstate, but with that comes lots of road noise. Great place to stop for the night."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a cozy spot extremely convenient to the airport but also the SoMa area of Little Rock. I was just using it as a ""layover,"" which Dero names his spot, but it would have been great for multiple days. Dero was responsive to a couple of questions I had and even left out Halloween candy:). Wish I'd had another day in Little Rock to explore more...."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,As the name Layover House implies it is a perfect place to stay for a night or two while enjoying Little Rock on your journey.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was perfect for our overnight stay until we flew out from LR airport the next morning.. Conveniently 6 mins from long-term parking located across from the airport just 1 minute away by provided free shuttle included at the parking site.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"THE place to stay in Little Rock! Like a great, modern design hotel room but with a fenced private yard! The Layover was exactly what we needed for a restorative stop on our road trip with our dogs. So nice to let the dogs be off-leash in a totally secure yard. The queen size bed was very comfortable with nice bedding; great that there is a mini-fridge, dishes, microwave, and coffee; lovely window treatments that kept out the light in the morning; and a desk to get some work done. Perfect. Really."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My wife and I stayed over to break up a car trip and this little place was perfect for a one night stay. Dero is a great host and the place was clean and comfortable. The neighborhood was a little rougher than we were used to but we still felt safe.

The place was easy to find, super comfortable and within distance to a number of places. We went to SoMa for dinner and had the best time at Raduno! Don’t miss the Loblolly ice cream shop for those with a sweet tooth! If it weren’t so hot and humid we would have loved to sit and enjoy the fire pit. Dero was also very accommodating. Little Rock is currently undergoing what seems a major transformation, so don’t let the construction and projects deter you, this is a little gem of a place."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was probably our fourth or fifth stay here. We keep coming back because it's the perfect spot for a quick overnighter when traveling, and because it's pet friendly! Dero's Layover is clean, comfortable, and located in a very cool part of Little Rock. Literally blocks from great dining, a dog park, and all that the SoMa neighborhood offers. It's just an unbeatable stay for the price, and the neighbors are chill and friendly. We LOVE the fenced yard for relaxing after a long day's drive. Sharing a Raduno's pepperoni at the picnic table is the perfect ""date night"" on the road! We are looking forward to visit number six and beyond!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The layover was perfect for my cross-country road trip to bring a disabled baby goat to my nonprofit sanctuary in Massachusetts.

Pat & Charlie"

The host, Dero, was great with his communications and instructions. He even left me a handwritten welcome. Among many other things, I really appreciate the information binder with an intro, instructions, and dining recommendations. Try Dero’s recommendation of The Root which was within walking distance. Delicious!! Check-in & out instructions were simple. Quick easy access back on the road to continue my journey. Thank you so much, Dero."

The yard and fire pit are a great place to relax after a long day. We loved our stay! There was plenty of coffee, human treats and even some dog biscuits for the pup. I would definitely recommend staying here! If you do stay here, make sure to check out The Root Cafe as well."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is awesome and has a great description of the area and the home.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Best airbnb I've stayed in. The hosts have thought of everything and all the small things really added up. There were condiments in the fridge, a small bowl of welcome snacks, to-go cups for morning coffee, single-use eye masks/ear plugs, robes in the closet, the electrical sockets next to the bed had usb, etc. The decor was coherent and i really liked the styling. The proportions of the house were also great considering its a tiny home: spacious walk-in shower with double vanity in the bathroom, good-size comfy bed, and some space to eat/lounge. Hosts were very responsive and there wasnt a massive list of check-out responsibilities (hate when theres a whole to-do list for check-out). Absolutely worth the price! Would stay again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,As always a fantastic stay at one of Angela’s cottages. Every amenity and impeccably clean. The neighborhood is great as well and the hosts are very friendly. Don’t hesitate to stay here.

Loved the house and all the little touches (front door and gorgeous little porch). Beautiful restoration of a historic home that needed much attention. Plenty of plugs and choice of lighting. The king bed slept wonderfully and the bathroom had plenty of space. A big plus was there was plenty of parking behind the nest. There is lots of exterior lights at night (we were not use to) but it was nice when coming in at night or after dinner. But there is darkening curtains throughout. When we come back to Little Rock we definitely would stay in the Nest."

From a very lovely welcome to an inviting fair well, I enjoyed Ms. Angela’s listing to the fullest & I’d definitely stay with her again as I felt it was such a privilege to do so this time.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Angela has one of the best properties I’ve stayed at and I’ve stayed at 3 of hers. The details she put into everything is very impressive. She communicates very well it was an ice storm coming in and she was willing to refund me my money if I wasn’t able to make it.

We can’t wait to come back!!

Clean, chic, and comfortable, you'll feel right at home here. The Parking is so easy and safe. Not one of these places where you are worried the entire time about your vehicle. Sorry KC a comfortable stay with everything you could ask for, and more. Looking forward to another stay!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had an absolute lovely stay at Angela’s new little gem, the Hummingbird cottage. Every aspect of this stay was 5 stars 🌟 Angela was quick to respond to all of our needs, including questions prior to booking regarding property & dining recommendations as we were a late arrival. The Hummingbird cottage has been totally renovated with high end boutique vibes while still embracing its historical elements. It’s obvious that every single detail has been well planned with the intentions that you feel relaxed & pampered during your stay. We had a good nights rest on the well dressed king bed & the blackout curtains made it easy to sleep in a little later than normal. Even though we were only there one night, I could easily see us staying longer. There was ample storage/ drawers to totally unpack & even robes to snuggle up in. Another plus was the dedicated parking spot at the cottage.
Don’t miss an opportunity to stay at the Hummingbird cottage, it’s a must book location 😊"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at the Hummingbird was a very good experience. Everything is new: dishes, silverware, towels, linens, and appliances. Angela and her crew have done a remarkable job in renovating this property. Bed is big and comfortable, shower and bath are roomy and highly appealing. I really enjoyed being here!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location and a cute place! Would recommend staying again.
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Cute and clean. We felt mostly comfortable but we were not told that two panes of glass in the living room window were broken, or that one of the living room windows would not lock. One pane had a 11”x 5” hole that I could stick my hand outside and air moved freely from outside to inside. The other pane had a plastic grocery bag barely taped over it, with five small pieces of painters tape. Both broken panes were located next to the window lock, but the window is unable to be locked in the first place.
None of this was communicated prior and when I emailed them to let them know, this was their response.
“Hi yes- we know about that- our handyman is in process of fixing it. Thanks!”
Everything was great but being in a location where the homeless are present, an unlockable window and broken window glass should be addressed before guests stay."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was exactly what we were looking for. Close to everything and convenient parking behind building. This was a really cool loft looking forward to staying again.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed my stay at South Side Main Loft’s! The place was even more beautiful in person. Loved the natural lighting throughout and all the walkable dining surrounding it. Will definitely stay here again!

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great location, huge space, cool, very clean. Would absolutely stay again. Love that it’s accessible from the front and back of the building.
There is minimal noise at night from a close 5 am bar however it was not at all a problem, for anyone familiar with the location.
Big windows for natural light and an extremely comfortable bed.
Make sure to eat at El Sur when you stay here! Delicious.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for a comfortable and fun place to stay in Little Rock. We loved how we could walk down the street to several different restaurants and shopping areas. We look forward to coming back and staying here in the future!❤️
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed the stay and the loft was perfect!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautifully done❤️
Will definitely be hiding away here again!"
2023-12-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was nice and we felt safe and secure when we were in the apartment area. Both nights my wife and I did wake up to music being played and could not sleep because of the noise, so that is the reason for the lower rating."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely LOVED this place. We only drove our car once or twice because everythingggg we wanted to do was walkable (fine arts museum, farmers market, tons of restaurants and antique shops, local bakery/coffee shops, etc). If you’re looking for a place to experience the best Little Rock has to offer on foot—definitely visit this little place! If ever returning to Little
rock—I’d stay here again in a heartbeat. The only issue was noise/voices from people outside during the night/early morning. But earplugs were provided & this location was so great, we didn’t mind a bit. Can’t say enough about this space! It felt like home."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If Studio McGee had an Airbnb. So thoughtfully designed and decorated. I was hesitant to leave a review because I didn’t want others to find this new hidden gem in an up and coming neighborhood in Little Rock. Responsive host, very clean and every detail well thought out. Will be happy to stay here again. The building is historical and can have a little noise but it just adds to the charm and character of this space. 5 stars all around."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a perfect location to enjoy all that SoMa has to offer!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing little gem for a quiet getaway.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host and house! Will highly recommend.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for sharing this wonderful place.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home in North Little Rock was exactly as described. For our family of 4 adults, it was perfect with ample space to spread out a bit. Loved that there was no clutter, and everything was just as described. As shown in the pictures, the one bathroom is small, but honestly, it works. And the more important thing was that there were plenty of linens and towels provided which was very nice. And things just smelled ""clean"". Kudos to whoever makes the beds as the clean crisp sheets were tucked in at the corners just the way I like them! You can't beat the location either if you are in town for an event in NLR or in surrounding suburbs as this home gives you very easy access to the highway without being right on the highway. The neighborhood was quiet. Unfortunately, we didn't have time to use the backyard but it's a nice big backyard so you could go out back and throw a football around. Thanks to our host who accommodated the one request that I had."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful and quiet space. Owners left detailed notes as well as clean up instructions. Place could use some upkeep in relation to cleaning.
While the obvious was done across the board, it isn’t fun sitting in a tiny bathroom looking at dirty spots all over the wall and a dirty window seal.
The instructions were perfect and easy to follow. I’m glad my other two guests did not make the trip or it would have been rough with a bathroom so small.
I felt like I was in a super 8 when in the bathroom. Also, many of the floors have slopes that make you feel like you’re going to trip.
The kitchen had items that were helpful, especially since I forgot my seasonings.
The highlight of my stay was the peace and quiet. The lowlight is the blinds in the room that shares a window with the neighbors car. Especially when sleeping. Maybe curtains would be better than blinds."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was an incredible find! It was so perfect for our family that I ended up booking an extra night! The house was clean, in a great location, with a beautiful & peaceful neighborhood! It was so cozy & the beds were sooo comfortable! We felt right at home! Jocelyn was a great host & I would definitely stay here again if we come back to Arkansas! I absolutely loved this little home! ❤️"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A very rural feel and look to the location, but you are walking distance or a very short drive from just about anything you need. Friendly neighbors as well. Firepit... Outdoor seating..."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed over Easter weekend when we came to visit with family. Everything is updated and very clean. Supplies like coffee, paper goods, spices and kitchen cookware and dishes were better than most places I have stayed. It is very obvious that the owner takes pride in this rental and keeps it top notch for visitors."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying at Park Hill! The house was very comfortable and had everything we needed. Bathroom is small, but we expected that based on the photos. Bedrooms were spacious with plenty of closet space. We would happily stay here again."

Host responded immediately when a plumbing problem occurred, sending over a plumber in the evening of December 23.

We did appreciate the spotless condition of the cottage."

The neighborhood is quiet and beautiful. such greenery and beautiful trees. The location is perfect being close enough to anything you could want to do. Wonderful restaurants, great shopping as it's close to the mall and great entertainment. I cannot recommend this place enough. any question I had, I was not afraid to ask as Jocelyn was very helpful and was wonderful at every step of the way.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved this hidden getaway. It was very close to restaurants and activities but gelt secluded. Myranda was awesome.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Myranda and Lamonte’s place was amazing. The Tree House was more than we expected. It was a high end experience start to finish. I’ve stayed at many Airbnbs and this was by far the best. The space was well built and impressively decorated. I’m still in awe of the huge glass wall and doors that lead to a porch surrounded by trees. Will definitely book again. If you are in Little Rock check this place out, it is truly worth it!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb is a gem! It was even better than the pictures! My husband and I loved waking up in a beautiful forest. We were in town for the eclipse and we received a very thoughtful eclipse-themed goodie bag.

The house was so nicely done and curated for the Airbnb experience.
To note, the surrounding neighborhood is a bit rundown, but I did not have any issues with this. Also, bring your own laundry detergent and coffee/tea. Otherwise, has everything you need!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A wonderful little cottage in an up and coming area in Little Rock. The house was pristinely decorated in mid-century modern decor down to every detail. I’m in love with painted ceilings and built in furniture.
Christina was accommodating, answered all of our questions quickly and was kind enough to let us check in a little early. She gave wonderful suggestions for food. You should definitely check out Three Folds Noodle and Dumpling Co., as well as Pettaway Coffee."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Ivy Cottage was probably the cleanest Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at to start. Every room was absolutely stunning.

Christina was highly communicative and thoughtful with her recommendations. Couldn’t recommend more!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Just as pictured! I stayed at the ivy cottage on a solo trip to LR for work.
I slept in the Teal room but had a hard time deciding which room I liked better before I committed.
I wish I had been able to enjoy the backyard and porch but it was raining and chilly and I only stayed one night. Next time ;)
Close to the interstate and SOMA, easy to get to, clean, communicative hosts. Would stay here again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was AMAZING! It’s in an old neighborhood area that you can tell it’s revamping . Neighbors were sweet and quiet . Walk away from the nearest coffee shop . Main Street really is walking distance but we drove . It was nice fun area close to restaurants. We were there for softball so it was nice to have a spacious room to be in but nothing huge . Definitely a fun and perfect place to get away!! We enjoyed Mexican and hibachi while there . I would definitely come back !!!! Christina was amazing too! Gave us lots of ideas to go do and see!!!

The space was very clean and well appointed. We arrived late and didn’t get to spend much time at the house before heading out for the second half of our drive to Austin TX. We were still able to appreciate the space and Christina’s extra special touches. Ex. Snacks on the counter, special makeup washcloths and a fenced in backyard.
I will be back again for sure. Thank you for sharing your home."

Christina’s recommendations were spot on and we enjoyed checking out the local eateries and breweries. The cottage looks exactly like the pictures, it was clean, cozy and comfy. Christina has helpful recommendations on the kitchen cabinet and the kitchen was stocked with coffee, creamer, sugar and quick snacks for morning.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,so good i had to book again love this home
2023-01-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"While the Ivy Cottage is well designed and communication with host is lightning fast and much appreciated, the neighborhood is quite unsightly and safety felt questionable to me. I was excited to have a fenced in back yard for my Boston Terrier but unfortunately could not use it due to previous irresponsible pet owners who did not pick up after their dogs. There were landminds everywhere and of course my dog ran through one. :( While it should go without saying, host might consider a sign to remind pet owners to be courteous to future guests and pick up all dog waste."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Christina’s place was the perfect accommodation for our family when we had an urgent trip to Children’s Hospital for an emergency and extended stay while my grand daughter needed special care.
The home is inviting and welcoming. Christina had provided more than the basics which really helped our family focus on the important things.
We did also find that the wonderful space for our dogs was perfect ( she even had dog treats, dog bowl’s etc…)
During my stay I never left the house and I was able to easily care for my 2 year old grandson by having groceries and other items delivered so my son and daughter in law could easily go to and from the hospital ( 7 minutes away)
Thank you Christina and family for making our time at your place feel like our own!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,great home
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It’s a lovely, IKEA-style home located in an underserved neighborhood near downtown. It’s the perfect situation for someone looking to purchase a home for cheap and then renting it at a high rate. Thus, while the home itself is comfortable and clean, the rate is a little exorbitant."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed in three different spaces along our cross-country move, and this was BY FAR the our favorite! The space is beautiful and well-designed. Pet friendly was a huge plus, and we loved every minute of it. Wish we could have stayed longer!"

We will be back!

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay at the Ivy Cottage. Quick trip to Little Rock and this was the perfect landing place for us. Restaurants close and lots to choose from!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a fast overnight very chill restorative stay at Christina's cottage. She's great with proactive communication and the house was just as shown and described and was a lovely moment in the middle of two long drives on a cross country move. If I was in Little Rock again I would surely stay at this same spot. Thank you for the hospitality and great design choices.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was super clean! Christina left local grocery store, asked if we wanted recommendations and even left out “in a rush” snacks. the place was amazing and the details to this home were perfect, everything was so aesthetically pleasing. the only thing I would say was a little unexpected was the neighborhood. the houses closest were in good condition but the farther you went into the neighborhood, the more “sketchier” it got. but the house did have a ring security camera which made us feel safer!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We’ve stayed in dozens of air bnbs, and this is definitely one of our favorites! Beautifully designed, immaculately cleaned, super cozy and less than a 5 min drive from Main St. The host is so kind and accommodating. Would absolutely recommend!"

The neighbors are very nice as well!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Christina went above and beyond for me while I was in town for work! The cottage is my favorite Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in. It was kind of hard to go out and explore Little Rock because it was just so cute and fun to stay here! The yard was amazing for my dogs to get their zoonoses out:)
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This house/cottage was everything pictured and more. Each detail within the finishes of the home we’re great. There is even a backyard patio area.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Christina’s place was exactly what I needed for two relaxing days in Little Rock.
Decor: perfect. I love the green tiles, and everything from the shower water pressure to the thermostat to the bed linens was very thoughtful and well executed.
Logistics: check in and out was a breeze, and the hosts were super communicative and gave great neighborhood tips! I especially liked strolling down Main Street in the SoMa area. South on Main and the Root were my favorites! (I went to the root 3x in 2 days - great food and coffee).
Location: I rented a car and found the location ideal for everything I wanted to see and do. I walked a lot too, and found the neighborhood surprisingly walkable and very friendly.
In all, a wonderful stay and I would happily visit again. I felt very at home for my 48 hours in Little Rock!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful stay — incredible mid-century meets glam decor. Also very clean.
Pets aren’t allowed to get on the furniture and since we have a new puppy, this was a difficult rule to follow. We kept her in her kennel to ensure she didn’t get on the furniture, which was hard on us. A pre-warning about the furniture rule would have been great.
All in all, I would recommend this stay sans the furniture rule."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Thanks for everything Christina. Our adult kids live everything about it. Your personal touches made it a very rememberable experience. Thank you!!

2022-06-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"This is a really well-designed and decorated little house. Be advised, it’s in a sort of rough, low-income neighborhood, with some boarded up buildings nearby.

One thing to note is if you are staying with a dog, there are grape vines growing all over the fence in the front yard (which gives the front yard such a quaint look). Our dog isn’t too curious and didn’t get into them, however if your dog will eat anything it comes across, I would handle with care since grapes are poisonous to dogs :)"

2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The picture used of the outside of the home must have been taken 10 years, based on the size of the trees. Had they used a current picture, I probably would not have chosen this location. They need to clean up the property.
Also, the neighborhood was run down. I did not like having to park on the street.
Now, the inside of the “tiny home” was great. Very clean, plenty of amenities.
The location of the property was perfect for everything I wanted to see in Little Rock.
Had the property looked as advertised, this place would have been fantastic. Did not appreciate the misrepresentation."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This mini home far exceeded my expectation, well crafted , spotless, quiet, close to Main St restaurants. The neighborhood is safe, reasonably quiet for the city, it's was terrific to wake to the sound of chickens! I'll be back!!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a fantastic experience! Will be traveling on our way back in a day and I'll write a more thorough review.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place is a gem! Perfect size for party of two and so clean! We loved the details and care put into hosting us and cannot wait to return!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful home with a great yard that had so many different kinds of fruits and berries growing! Our dogs had the best time staring at the chickens while they roamed around their coop. You have to get food from Tamalcalli - I’ll be dreaming about it for weeks.
The host was responsive, informative, and kind. Easy clean up/ check out process."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Second time staying here—just as great as we remembered!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Had a lovely one night stay at James'. It is just enough space for one or two people, plus they allow pets. The home was so clean and is well-finished.
Check in was effortless and James had left us cold waters, snacks, and ice in the freezer. We didn't cook, but the kitchen has a full-sized stove and all the things you may need to make a meal if you so choose. There is street parking right in front of the house, so it's just a short walk to the front door with your luggage.
The yard isn't overly large, but plenty of space for a dog to run around since it is fully fenced. The back has berries growing and a small garden and chickens, which is fun. No roosters, so no need to worry about crowing.
The home is a short drive to many restaurants, bars, etc. and was easy to find with GPS. We enjoyed Bruno's. Great Italian! And ice cream from Loblolly.
Would highly recommend this rental for anyone needing a smaller space that has all you need in Little Rock.
James was also quick to respond :)"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"So enjoyed our anniversary stay at The Tiny House. It was all we needed--great accommodations, cleanliness, beautiful wall decor, listening to the rain, and meeting the chickens. Added to the experience was the smell of peaches in the front yard. This is a great stay if you are on a long road trip, or if you are attending a concert and don't want to drive home. It's also close to many good places to eat and visit! If you remember Hansel and Gretel's gingerbread house, this has all the goodness and none of the scary stuff!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was awesome! We reserved for my daughter's 12th birthday celebration with a few friends. The layout was great, with the pool being the ultimate entertainment. We found the house to be incredibly clean and well stocked. There were plenty of sleeping spaces and all were comfortable. I would no doubt book again and recommend to others."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed the Devine Oasis very much!!! The pool was a huge hit, we even struggled getting the kids out of it! After booking the place I found out I knew one of the owners and she added a special touch for my son. (We rented this house for his birthday) He had such a great weekend! Thank you for having us!! We are looking in to renting again in the future !"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay at the Divine Oasis! The home was clean, beds were comfortable, with all the necessities for a comfortable stay. The kids enjoyed the pool with lots of pool toys available. We would definitely stay here again!"

It felt like our home away from home. It was so cozy and clean. Our kids enjoyed the indoor pool and they were happy to be able to swim even in the chilly days. Dana was very quick to respond if I needed anything the entire trip. I definitely recommend you book your stay at this beautiful home.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family from Mexico and Oregon stayed there for a week and they enjoyed their stay.

Thank you!!!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place for our family to gather and allow the kids to feel like they were on a mini vacation for the weekend! Absolutely loved that there was plenty of room for the adults to be entertained while being so close to the kids in the pool.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The Devine Oasis was perfect for my 13 yr olds birthday sleep over. More that enough room for myself and 10 teenage girls. Very homey and spacious and clean. Dana was very responsive and I would book this place again!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had an amazing time! Dana provided everything we needed. The house was decorated for Christmas, which made our Christmas even better. We only had one issue the whole time, the pilot light to heat the pool went out but Dana came out of Christmas Eve and Christmas Day to make sure we were taking care of and able to enjoy the heated pool! I would highly recommend a stay at the Divine Oasis! You and your family will not be disappointed! The rooms have child locks so the kids can’t get to the pool in the middle of the night for those with small children! We absolutely loved having our Christmas there this year and hope to be back soon!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had our family Christmas at the devine oasis. A very unique place. The set up worked well for our family. The place was clean with many amenities, & the pool was amazing! One of the best features is that you can see the pool from any room in the home which made it easy to keep an eye on the kids. The pool area has it's own heat/air unit which allowed us to adjust to a comfortable temperature. The pool water stayed between 80-85 degrees & felt great! Everything from extra towels to crock pots were available. Plenty of toiletries & laundry pods. The host Dana was absolutely amazing! She greeted us upon arrival to give us information & instructions for the property. She was available to contact with any questions & very quick to respond. This place made one of the best and most memorable times for us! We will definitely be back!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"I love the family feel

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"!!!Amazing Super Host !!!
Super Fun Place for a Family Gathering"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house is uniquely awesome & was just perfect for our group of 11!! Having an indoor pool (with a fun slide) in the middle of the house is super neat! The 3 bedrooms are spacious & comfortable, very large master suite king bed, the two bunks are twin over full which was great, and the other room has two full beds. Beds & decor very nice. Everything is fresh & new, super soft towels, convenient laundry room by the bath & bedrooms. Welcome cookies & a bottle of wine were appreciated.
While the pool being located between the bedrooms and the rest of the house (living, kitchen, & dining) worked great for us, the pool is just steps from each side of the house, so young children who don't
swim would need to be watched carefully, obviously.
Dana's place was a house
like no other & we
enjoyed ourselves very
much!!
We hope to stay again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Divine Oasis is an amazing private getaway, perfect for a family just wanting to get away. The indoor pool and amenities are more than enough for the kids and the waterslide is a big hit. The master bedroom is perfect for couples and includes an in-room jacuzzi and a huge vanity area for two. There are 3.5 bathrooms with one conveniently located in the pool area. The Divine Oasis will be our go to for affordable memories with my family. Dana went above and beyond to make sure our stay was perfect."

Highly recommend to anyone just wanting to get away and relax while having all the amenities you could think of for the space.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely beautiful just as pictured
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It’s hard to put the experience into a few words. The place was spotless and decorated beautifully. We picked up food and sat in the hanging chairs to eat. The weather was perfect and we sat there for hours. We enjoyed watching barges, wildlife and the city changing from day to night. It surprised us in feeling like a romantic scene from a movie. I highly recommend it!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Myranda’s place was top notch and quite an experience! It made our 9th wedding anniversary even more sweeter!
The Mack’s"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The little boat house was exactly as described. We got an added benefit of a fireworks show over the water the night we were there. Very romantic for couples!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"By far the coolest and nicest Airbnb we have ever stayed in, if we could give it 10 stars we would. Hard to put it into words how amazing this place is. It is located right on a bike trail that does a loop of the whole city. It is in biking distance to downtown a park with sweet skate park. It really was amazing, perfect for anyone that wants to enjoy the outdoors or just get some quiet time in a peaceful relaxing space. Thank yall so much we will be back and we will remember this trip forever"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It looks exactly like the photos. I love the decor and style. It was so peaceful. The surroundings were beautiful from daytime to nighttime!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for the eclipse and it was everything we had hoped for! Quiet, safe, close to downtown, beautiful scenery! The swing chairs were our favorite place to hang out!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We can't stop talking about this amazing place. It was an unforgettable experience. It was so charming and relaxing that we didn't even go anywhere the first night. Just sat on the deck and on the dock, and watched the world go by and the sun set. Barges, blue herons, Canadian geese, little fish jumping up to eat, funny sounding birds, relaxing waves hitting the side of the boat-all so enchanting.
The interior decorating was beautiful, the attention to the small details that travelers are often looking for was over the top excellent, and all of the furnishings were warm and inviting. It did not feel like a small space at all. We loved our stay."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Probably the most unique place we've ever stayed - an incredible spot to spend our only night in Little Rock. The house has been beautifully restored and decorated and we felt right at home. Amazingly beautiful and private setting. We loved watching the sun rise and set and all of the wildlife - during the night there were pelicans diving for fish just off the dock! An experience we won't forget!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was one of the most fun, relaxing and tidy places i have stayed at. It was truly special and I hope to stay again sometime! Thank you"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a perfect little country getaway in the city! We adored the houseboat which had all the amenities we needed. Peaceful and great access to all the things Little Rock has to offer. Hope to be back again sometime!

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This was a unique place to stay! The place looked just like the pictures. The scenery was amazing. We did book when it was cooler out and windy, I wish we would have booked when it was warmer so we could have enjoyed the balcony more. When the winds did pick up we could feel the motion of the water under the house which threw us off the first time it happened. However, I would recommend this place for the experience :)"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,So relaxing. Just perfect! Will definitely be back to stay.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"After about 5 minutes in the place, we immediately extended our stay just to enjoy a day relaxing in the house. We were blown away with the little amenity touches like robes for the guests. We loved the porch and the swings to sit out, drink coffee on and watch the sunset. Truly could not have been happier about a unique stay. felt home-y, artsy, and clean. Highly recommend. We will for sure be back!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic location and a fun way to enjoy the city from a different point of view. Definitely worth a visit.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a great place to stay in Little Rock. Very clean and comfortable. A must stay for those wanting a place out of the ordinary.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This air bnb was amazing!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Is there anything better than a sunset on the water? I used up so much space on my phone snapping breath taking photos of the sunset and sunrise. The road leading to the marina is in a newly renovated upscale neighborhood. The Floating House is the only permanent boat there, so it was very private. The gate leading to the boat dock stays locked. An Access code is given prior to check in. The River is calm and gentle, therefore we did not feel any quesiness. This is a one of a kind, must-stay place. Trust me, you'll want to go back."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great place
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful! We highly recommend it! Not only is it modern with stylish decor. Everything about it is cozy and comfortable. If you are looking for a peaceful romantic or just a private place to spend your time this is it! We enjoyed relaxing on the deck and watching the birds and feeling the breeze. Also it is so close to all the downtown attractions and restaurants. It felt safe and secure being down on the marina. Would go back!!! We appreciated the snacks and robes and we felt very luxurious being on the little boat! Also appreciated the guide book! We tried The Fold and The Root Cafe . Both so good!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a unique stay- perfect for a getaway - thanks for hosting us!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,One of the most unique and enjoyable Airbnb stays I’ve experienced.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I absolutely loved this little home. It was so peaceful on the deck in the mornings and evenings. I highly recommend this floating house!! Such a great option for a little getaway, passing through to another stop (which is what we used it for), or even a longer stay!
Clean, organized, beautiful and relaxing ❤️"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is so creative and fun! We enjoyed listening to the sound of the water and the geese. The sunrise and sunset from our chairs on the boat was breathtaking. You’re right by a walking/biking trail and even walked to the ballpark for a ballgame. So close to great restaurants and evening activities. But you won’t want to leave this peaceful place! Loved it!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was exactly what we needed! A little get away, but still close to places to eat. We enjoyed spending time on the porch in the swings - it was a perfect place to read a book and watch the geese, tug boats, & barges go by. We also enjoyed watching the kayakers from the business close by! We will definitely be coming back! We've already been looking at dates to book again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A peaceful retreat. Close to lots of things, but felt quiet and isolated. Absolutely gorgeous views! The hanging chairs on the porch are an absolute dream."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Communication with the Host was easy and clear. She goes above and beyond to make the stay wonderful!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We came to Little Rock for a Hogs game and didn’t feel like driving a hour and half back home. So glad we booked this instead of staying at the Marriott. We were worried about security. But the locked gate to gain access to the house boat gave me peace of mind. This place is so beautiful, clean, and unique. The host has a great taste in designing!! The back porch view is amazing in the evening and early in the morning. The robes and snacks were very kind and thoughtful. Thank you!! Wish we could of stayed longer. We will def be back and recommend to everyone!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was awesome. We did a river cruise to celebrate my boyfriend’s birthday and being able to hop off the boat and into this beautiful tiny home was perfection.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The houseboat is gorgeous! We loved this unique stay. Everything was spotless, and extremely comfortable. The AC worked flawlessly and was such a wonderful amenity because it was seriously hot and gross outside. We'd definitely book again in cooler weather so we can more fully enjoy the view off the back. I love self check-in places, and checking in/out was super easy with clear instructions from Myranda. Easy access to the river walk was nice too, we were able to walk back from the arena after a concert. Highly recommend and would stay again!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Myranda’s beautiful houseboat is now my all-time favorite AirBnb. I’m always bummed after leaving my daughter’s home in SC to return to our home in Texas. So, I strategically found a place that would bring us peace and joy on the way home. My husband and I spent hours on the porch watching ducks, trains and kayakers go by. We definitely plan to make this our new “pit stop”!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was exactly as pictured and described. It was perfect for my wife and I. It was in a new living community. it felt as though the neighborhood was very safe. It is right next to the River Trail which runs a great distance down the side if the river. The only issue I had was the ramp down to the marina was very steep. I'm not sure if it is like this all the time or if the river was low (obviously not the hosts fault, but be prepared). Check in was a breeze. The bed was very comfortable. The barges would make a wake and it would rock ever so gently. The back porch was amazing and was absolutely great at night to relax and look at the city skyline, and for having breakfast in the morning. Only regret is not having a couple of more days to spend there."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Little House on the River was wonderful! Such a unique place to stay. It was just as the pictures show, very nice, new, and clean.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is amazing and I HIGHLY recommend staying on the houseboat. It was beautiful and quiet and private, yet moments away from restaurants and other fun things to do. Truthfully we would have stayed a long, long time enjoying the peace, the view and the lovely accommodations. We will definitely come back - to get away and read or to enjoy the downtown fun."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Two words, BOOK NOW‼️
This Airbnb rental will be my top choice for anyone traveling to the area for a solo or couple getaway. I would absolutely book Myranda’s accommodations over any hotel. The privacy & peaceful energy of the houseboat is unmatched. She did an amazing job with the beautiful aesthetics even with the limited space.
The back patio area with the astonishing view is where you will spend most mornings and nights, especially with the special touch of binoculars supplied by the host. From the exceptional communication after booking to the special snack basket you will not go wrong in booking this space.
Mark my world, this houseboat will be a top rental! I foresee many people traveling for the experience & those locally even selecting the rental for a staycation. There is nothing not to love, it’s truly a beautiful home away from home.
Thank you Myranda for the amazing experience, you are sitting on a gem!❤️"

Directions were clear and everything is well labeled. Plus, the home just felt so welcoming! Myranda had left two bottles of water, some snacks, fantastic Keurig coffee and tea, binoculars to view birds and the like on the river, and more! It just felt like Myranda goes out of her way to make guests feel luxurious and the home is just an absolute diamond in the diamond state. I cannot wait to go back! Thank you Myranda for opening your beautiful houseboat to others!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The property has an absolutely unparalleled view of the city and the river - you’ll not be able to match it anywhere else. It’s peaceful and relatively secluded but still very close to all the dining and entertainment in Argenta and downtown Little Rock. We can’t praise the location enough! It’s worth it for that alone.
It’s also beautifully decorated and maintained. It had everything we needed and then some, including thoughtful and unique touches for staying on a boat."

Very private location yet close to many options for dinner plans. First class service from host who always responded with any questions at any time. Extremely clean home with tons of unique decor. I was extremely happy with the security of the home and private slip at the marina. Small touches the host provided made us feel right at home. Price was well worth the night at this hidden gem on the river."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Spotlessly clean. The home is obviously recently thoroughly remodeled, with tile and hard floors everywhere, tile bath, etc. Abigail was very accommodating of my desire to do laundry before she got home.
The neighborhood is a fairly OK residential neighborhood, with no business nearby.
Houston, the dog, is affectionate and surprisingly well behaved. He did get into a bag of snacks that I carelessly left accessible on the LR floor, so watch out for that. We wouldn't want him eating any chocolate!"

Also, the host is incredibly kind, personable, and quick to respond. We had a minor issue with the A/C (definitely user error on our part), and even though it was late, Angela responded quickly and was so helpful to get it resolved. We appreciate that a lot! :) She also helped us with recommendations for restaurants and other things like advice on parking around town which is always great.
Will definitely stay here again if we have another event in LR!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved Angela’s place. Angela is so nice & responsive, the only person we stay with in Little Rock."

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay here! The place was clean, cozy, and located close to downtown. Thankfully we were provided a guide for local restaurants. I would absolutely recommend staying here if you want to explore Little Rock!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a great place to stay. I will stay here again! Thank you for the fantastic visit!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my home-away-from-home. I stay here regularly and have been doing so for over two years. Things I like about the Craftsman: (1) big comfy bed, (2) big closet with good wood hangars (those are hard to come by in most Airbnb's), (3) everything works - the stove, microwave, TV, coffee, washer/dryer - and they work every time I'm there, (4) the front porch (another thing that many similar places lack), (5) good linens and towels, and (6) Angela and her team are always available and helpful. This place is easy to ""highly recommend"". Two thumbs up for the Historic Craftsman!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed once before at Angela's AirBnb. Not only was she quickly responsive to requests, she followed up to make certain that everything was good. As an example I had to ask for her to reprogram the mini-split HVAC to provide heat when the weather suddenly turned much cooler than it had been when we arrived. She did this promptly and asked permission to enter the AirBnB while we were away in order to accomplish this. Then she followed up with a message to make certain that the heat was working and that we were comfortable again. This place was immaculate. We have tried to stay other times but found the unit was occupied on the dates we wanted, so we were really pleased to get this on our recent visit. We will stay again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As I've said many times before, The Historic Craftsman is my go-to place in Little Rock. It is a very comfortable place with up-to-date features. It is always clean and Angela and her crew are great hosts."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a lovely house with a warm feel of home. Just the walk up the stairs to the beautiful front door invited you in with a feeling of comfort. This cozy inviting feeling continued into the house. We will definitely stay here again. We have stayed in many Airbnbs and this one is at the top of our list. So clean, comfortable and relaxing!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Angela was an absolutely amazing host. She was communicative, respectful, responded quickly to my questions, provided recommendations for places to eat, provided some information on the weather and tornado sirens that were going off (which I learnt is quite common in Little Rock, AR), and even helped look at a ticket I had received. She always made sure I had everything I needed. As for the place - it is absolutely beautiful. It was very, very clean, comfortable, and I felt really safe there traveling as a solo female. I appreciated the little details in the apartment, as well as the snacks provided. I would highly recommend Angela's place to anyone visiting Little Rock, AR. Thank you Angela for hosting and for a great stay!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I stay here on an almost weekly basis due to business travel to Little Rock. I've never been disappointed. Angela and her crew do a great job of communicating and with keep the place neat and clean. Highly recommend.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot to land at the end of a day being out and about. I wouldn't consider a hangout spot due to it's humble size but would easily accommodate two.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed the most perfect stay at Angela's historic home near downtown Little Rock. The home is spotless and wonderfully equipped with everything we needed (and more). She was kind enough to turn the heat on prior to our arrival as the temp dropped from earlier in the day - and later checked on us to ensure we were set. The attention to detail throughout the space surprised me; she definitely has a knack for hospitality and obviously enjoys hosting.
We are in Little Rock a few times a year and will begin checking Angela's availability each and every time."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautifully renovated historic home blocks away from Little Rock Central High school, a famous national historic site for civil rights.

Got reservations there in February again."

The place is spectacular, neighborhood is peaceful and it’s close to great shopping and restaurants. We could not be happier with our trip and the value was excellent.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the easiest 5 star review in the history of 5 star reviews. If you’re in Little Rock for a few days just book this place. Stop looking elsewhere. The host is a pleasure to deal with, so helpful, great communication and genuinely invested in you having a great stay. The space is wonderful, the pics are completely accurate but don’t do it justice. The bed is crazy comfortable (the host even shared the brand and type because I need one of those at home). I like most places I stay but having stayed in airbnbs in c.40+ states, this is right up there for me, a great experience. If I’m back in town, this is the only place I’m going to stay."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Historic Craftsman is a great place to stay!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"You see, this is why I don't like to give people five star reviews. because what am I supposed to give this person? 6 star 8? 10? this is absolutely the best Aaron b&b I've stayed in since my trip started. highly recommend as a place to crash, and as a host to have!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were very pleased with how clean and pretty this house is. We had appointments at UAMS, and it was so easy to get there from this house. Angela and Bobby were very helpful. We are booked there again in a few weeks!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We were in need of a last minute place to stay after driving 7 hours for a family emergency. Angela welcomed us with open arms and was so incredibly kind. The place itself was so cute and comfy! Hopefully we will get to visit again in better circumstances!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our recent stay was remarkable and is highly recommended if you’re considering such, too. The engagement, communications and considerations by Angela and Lynn were stellar examples of what you want out of a stay. This is a home away from home setup. They have done a beautiful job on the property restoration. That same detail and care poured into having the home ready for you. The details can be seen; the extra touches are evident. It even exceeds the accurate pics and descriptions the host provides. The porch is a great spot, too. The location is well-positioned and close proximity to Hillcrest, Central, Arts and River districts. Thanks for making us feel welcomed here! - Cheers"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We LOVED this Airbnb. So tidy and decorated so well. This place is in the most gorgeous art district you can imagine. They also have art on the walls you can purchase, if you’d like.
This is honestly the first Airbnb I’ve ever had where they provided actual food in the cabinets, waters, no harsh rules or instructions for clean up. Just overall very clean and nice.
Communicator was flawless and we were able to enter the home almost immediately upon arrival."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"From the moment we walked in it was just perfect. Place looked just like the pictures. We drove in from Texas so we were tired. We rested before heading out to dinner and the bed was just soo comfortable. We followed some of her suggestions from the house manual and so glad we did. We did trails and gardens in Hot Springs and we finished off with a climb of PinnacleMt, A Must! Thank you Angela for all your recommendations and for such a lovely place. Will highly recommend your place that might head that way ☺️"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We’re LR locals who were displaced when our power went out for a few days. This was a great retreat for us. Beautiful design with lots of interesting touches. I work nearby and will recommend this as a place for traveling associates in the future!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Anglea’s bungalow was perfect for a quick overnight stay. Located in cute and quiet historic neighborhood, right off the interstate for easy access. Never felt like safety was an issue. We prefer to stay in Airbnbs over hotels and this adorable little place met our expectations. Everything was spotless, smelled clean, comfy bed and furniture, well decorated and lots of special extras and personal touches. Angela was so sweet and responsive. We will definitely be staying here again when in LR."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place for our little staycation! Clean, cozy and comfortable! Everything (including restaurants and grocery stores) is conveniently close by. The armchair was the perfect spot for getting lost in a book and the bed was wonderful, as well. Having everything we needed in the kitchen to cook our meals helped us save money and being able to throw in a load of laundry as needed was super handy. Angela was friendly and helpful and we will definitely be staying again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Angela’s place was beautiful and peaceful. The historic neighborhood is awesome. Lots of great places less than 15 minutes away. The rooms are spacious and everything was squeaky clean. We plan to stay here again next time we stop over in Little Rock.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This Airbnb is hands-down my favorite ever. There are so many thoughtful touches and conveniences! The armchair and window dressings might have been my favorite part. The neighborhood is absolutely gorgeous and charming. I never wanted to leave. In my opinion, this place is worth more than what we paid. I will definitely be staying again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Angela was very very great at communicating.
The neighborhood driving in looks a bit sketchy but don’t let it discourage you! Once you turn down the street the neighborhood is very beautiful and filled with beautiful historic homes. It was very quiet. It was easy to get an Uber. The place is squeaky clean. I love that she leaves a binder with all the things to do! Super great place. We would def stay here again."

House is less than 10 minutes from downtown Little Rock, she gives great recommendations if you’re visiting and don’t know what to do for the night that was a plus of her going above and beyond to make your stay as comfortable as it could be. Don’t miss out on this one! You’ll love it!!!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our first AirBnB experience so we were nervous at first but Angela made it a blast! She was responsive and friendly with any questions or concerns we had.
Checking in was simple and the location was great. We felt safe and were surprised we were a close distance to the historic Central High School. Angela also offers great suggestions to local restaurants in a helpful guidebook.
The place itself is a beautiful restoration of Craftsman style houses. We were shocked when we walked in, so if you're a fan of the design like my daughter is you'll love it. The wifi is also fast with a nice roku tv.
Aesthetics aside it was very clean and well stocked. You truly felt comfortable in the space. Dishes, pots, and a gas stove were available to make your own meals. There was also complimentary coffee, tea, and snacks. The bathroom was realxing and the bed was comfortable after a long day of driving.
We wish we could give it more than 5 stars, will visit if we stop in AK again! :)"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We loved everything about this beautifully restored Craftsman bungalow.
The front porch was lovely for morning coffee. The furnishings, decor pieces and overall attention to detail in this newly renovated house was perfect. The bed was extremely comfortable with beautiful linens on the bed and in the bathroom. The neighborhood is very quiet. We loved having a washer and dryer and took full advantage of the smart tv for an afternoon of laundry and binging on Netflix.
We thoroughly enjoyed exploring the neighborhood restaurants, bakeries, and coffee shops. All the local recommendations from this host were fantastic. The house is close to so many wonderful destinations from the capitol and river market area to the governor's mansion and the hospital district."

Great Value better than any hotel and exactly what I needed for a day of planning and relaxation for our business.

The next time I am in the area I definitely have this location on my list to stay again.

It mystifies us when we go to a place and they don’t have a mirror you can see your whole body in before stepping out. But this place has one! Bonus, the towels were soft and smelled great. (It’s the little things that make the difference.)"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Could not have asked for a better stay! They did a beautiful job restoring this home while maintaining its original craftsman charm, which is something I appreciate. The house is perfectly situated in a safe neighborhood just minutes from Main Street where you’ll find plenty of local dining spots, patios, boutiques etc. The hosts are very responsive. I enjoyed communicating with them during my stay, but if you’d rather not, they’re respectful of your privacy - whatever you prefer! Look no further - book your stay here. The rave reviews are all accurate. Can’t beat the price. Perfectly clean. Amazing hosts. Great location. This will be my regular spot any time I’m in Little Rock!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the perfect example of the Airbnb listing ACTUALLY matching the Airbnb in real life! It was so pleasant & very much like a swanky cottage. I enjoyed everything about it, from the cleanliness to the prompt and friendly communication and great suggestions shared (to include a detailed list of restaurants and hot spots).
I’d highly recommended it to anyone who is traveling through Little Rock.
I’ll definitely stop through again, myself."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stay at the Historic Craftsman on a regular basis, and am sometimes a little lazy with my reviews. Please know, however, that I love staying here.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"You couldn’t ask for a nicer host. My wife is a very particular house cleaner. She looks for dirt in the corners around tubs, faucets, furniture, floors, toilet seats etc. This place passed her inspection and is the cleanest airbnb we have seen yet. You can park in the street, as so many in that neighborhood do, but we like to be in the driveway. It’s a little bit narrow but works. There is plenty of room inside and a at home feeling. Thank you all for being such great hosts."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was such a lovely home, beautifully restored, and extremely comfortable. Angela was very responsive. This is by far the absolutely BEST place we've stayed in, during our trip across the country. We're still traveling! On to Bisbee AZ!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This Airbnb has been one of the cutest ones we have ever stayed at. The host was very thoughtful in providing with things that we might need. From make up cloths, umbrella (and it was pouring the night we stayed) to ear plugs! It was super clean especially the restroom. We stayed one night for the Blake Shelton concert and we truly enjoyed our over all experience. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to stay in the area."

Home is located near the historic River Market District which offers shopping, restaurants, and a river walk. Check in and out were effortless. We highly recommend and will definitely book again. Perfect weekend trip."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stay here on a weekly and since I do a review every week I sometimes get a little lax due to the fact that the review is essentially the same every week - it's a great place to stay. Besides being clean and comfortable the Historic Craftsman has several features that are noteworthy. The closet is big and is well stocked with good wooden hangars - you just don't find that in very many places. The shower is roomy, water pressure is fine, and it's low-entry, which is good for me and my gamey knee! All the appliances are modern and they all work - again, that's not always the case elsewhere. There is a nice front porch to sit on; this is really nice and helps you feel more ""at home""; I've often had a little snack out there after a long day of work. Angela even has ""to-go"" coffee cups so that you can take coffee with you when you check out and get back on the road home. Speaking of Angela - she and her crew do a great job of maintaining the place and communicating with guests!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A Fantastic SuperHost that genuinely cares about your stay. So helpful and communicative. Super clean, comfortable, well decorated, great bed, truly a perfect stay!!! Don’t hesitate to book Angela’s place!!!"

I especially appreciated Angela’s attention to detail with the little things like providing snacks and also eye masks/ear buds for sleeping. Would absolutely stay there again!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,1414 S Summit St was a great craftsman home. Loved the exterior color choice. Nice front port. Wonderful river rock inside and outside. Momma Lyn was sweet as can be. She greated as we arrived and as we departed. That touch makes you feel welcome. Thanks Lyn. The inside was clean and roomy. Kitchen worked perfect. Bathroom was clean and bright. I appreciate good lighting. Very relaxing living room as we watched Netflix every evening. I like this home alot. It’s nice to see older neighborhoods being kept up. So many older neighborhoods just deteriorate and there are so many good ones across American cities with wonderful architecture. This neighborhood brought back childhood memories visiting Aunts/Uncles and Grandparents. Kudos too the owners for investing in the home. Thank you
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We love to stay in their special place. It’s delightful.!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,very relaxing this place is so charming. loved watching the thunderstorm roll in on the front porch with a glass of wine. cool historic neighborhood. Will definitely stay here again!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent all around and very comfortable. The historic architecture is a huge bonus, too. For the price, the quality of this Airbnb stay is a steal. The hosts could have easily charged more and I would still consider the stay a good value."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved this place! If I could give it 10 stars, it still wouldn’t be enough! It was better than I could’ve imagined! The hosts were exceptionally friendly and the home was just gorgeous! I felt like I was walking into a featured home in a magazine. One thing that stood out the most that I I hadn’t seen in other Airbnb’s was local art that was available for purchase. The best way to help promote local artists! I can easily see this home becoming a super host in no time! If there’s availability, seriously get it, you won’t be disappointed!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay! Beautiful house, just like the pictures. And the hosts were beyond kind and answered all of my questions!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My second time to stay in Angela's AirBnB. There's a reason for this: it's a really nice space in the beautiful Quapaw Historic District, and the thoughtfully restored home has lots of amenities. It's very comfortable, and Angela is super friendly and helpful. The location is perfect for getting anywhere in Little Rock. I encourage taking time to learn about the history of the neighborhood, the Quapaw, and Central High School while you're there."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful comfortable stay Angela was very responsive. The book of recommendations around the local area was very helpful whenever it came to dinner.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed at Angela's cozy cute craftsman home in Little Rock, AR traveling to & from a family gathering. (2 nights) Home was beautifully restored with modern comfortable décor. Home is super clean, organized, fluffy towels, comfy bed & all kitchen amenities if wanting to prepare a snack or meal. Coffee pods & little snack items were a welcome treat. Angela was accommodating to our late afternoon request to book for the night & later arrival. Communication was superb!! Easy entry into home with key pad. Angela checked on us to make sure we had everything during our stay & was helpful with restaurant selections. We are new users to Airbnb & all experiences have been great, but Angela's was the BEST home we have booked!! We highly recommend this home when staying in Little Rock!! :)"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautifully restored home. Graciously accommodating host.

Angela and crew do a great job preparing the place for guests and she is superb at communication. Very Highly Recommend!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the original details of this historic bungalow. It is spacious, impeccably clean, and lovingly decorated. The area is going through obvious gentrification and this particular street is absolutely lovely. The location is a quick 10 minute drive to numerous restaurants and pubs. We hope to stay again when visiting our daughter."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable! We enjoyed our stay and all Little Rock has to offer. We found the provided information and brochures very helpful when deciding where to go and what to do. The house is beautiful and very comfortable. We didn't plan on coming to Little Rock but availability of flights made it necessary... It worked out great! There is so much to see and do. The next time we are headed to Memphis/Millington we will probably choose to fly into Little Rock. We visited 2 (of the 52!!!) State Parks and rode the trolley. We also visited Hot Springs National Park... hindsight we should have stayed all 3 nights in this house not one day in a Hot Springs airbnb. Definitely worth the commute back and forth to Hot Springs to be able to stay in such a comfortable place. Thank you, Angela!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Historic Craftsman is my favorite Little Rock AirBnB. It offers comfortable furniture, a really good shower, ample closet space, and modern appliances. Angela communicates very well in timely fashion and I rate her as a great host."

,,,"This is a scam. I mean you will get the Airbnb in the pictures but it is nothing like you think it would be. It’s not as nice as it shows. Pictures can change a lot. Also, she has a scam going where she has a sheet in her drawer and there’s a sign on it that says if pets are going to stay on the bed put the sheet on the bed. My dog didn’t even sleep on the bed but I wanted to put the sheet up anyway in case he jumped up there and I actually stayed after my dog and my fiancé left the next day and slept for a little while longer and then I get a text from her later that evening saying did you know there was urine all over the bed and trying to get me to pay more money. I check every Airbnb before I leave and that definitely was not something that happened however she does make you leave the door open before you leave which is so weird. So yeah it’s tiny it’s cramped it’s kind of a crap hole I wouldn’t stay there. The only thing is if you’re on a budget and you really need a bed then yeah it’s fine but I would not bring a dog do not put the sheet on the bed. Oh yeah by the way it was open when I got there I thought there was a burglar. But I guess that’s just part of her extra money scam"
,,,Our stay was not pleasant because Abigail was upset about our hearing/service dog being with us. We were not feeling comfortable about the whole situation. We got up early in the morning and get out of that place.
