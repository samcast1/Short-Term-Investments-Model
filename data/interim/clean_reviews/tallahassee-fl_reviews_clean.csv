2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kelly was very responsive. Thank you for hosting us
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Another great stay at this condo! Kelly is a wonderful host: responsive, helpful and the place is always immaculate. This condo is very walkable to all things FSU. Look forward to staying here again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed at a couple of Kelly's properties and are never disappointed!!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I‚Äôm not someone who writes many reviews, but Kelly and her place were both awesome. I myself own an Airbnb and when setting it up, i thought a few thing were most important for guests. 1) comfortable beds. 2) great AC that pumps when it‚Äôs hot and fans in all bedrooms . 3) Big TVs. 4) hot water and lastly 5) very clean. Also, I can‚Äôt stay somewhere that smells and this didn‚Äôt have a hint of any bad smellüòÜ.
This place has it all and was perfect. My son played a golf tournament at FSUs course so being close to campus was important for us. Close to all the restaurants and bars, across the street from the stadium and better than a nice hotel. My son didn‚Äôt finish his tournament until about 3PM yesterday and Kelly was accommodating, letting us check out after so we can shower before driving 8 hours. This is a no brainer for anyone heading to Tallahassee that wants a bit more than a hotel without paying crazy money. As far as Kelly, she was as nice as someone can be. 10/10 for this place"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kelly was an amazing host and her condo is beautiful. Exactly as the pictures and descriptions. Parking spot was right in front of the door and door code made it easy to enter. Very close to the FSU stadium and campus. Kelly was very responsive and helpful when our first rental cancelled. I‚Äôm so glad they did as this was so much better. I would highly recommend Kelly‚Äôs condo and would book it again in a heartbeat. Thanks again for letting us stay in your beautiful home.

The apartment was extremely clean, on first floor with parking right in front of the door for easy transfer of bags, groceries, etc from vehicle into apartment. View out the front windows was of Doak, I mean come on, really, any garnet and gold blooded Nole would love that. Was 3 minutes from Mike Long Track and Tully Gym where I was spending the majority of my time. Could have walked there as well in about 10 minutes. This means its equally as close to Soccer, Softball, Beach Volleyball, of course Football and Dick Howser stadiums as well. Close to Jim and Milts, and short drive to Guthries. I mean as a Seminole, what else would you need. Thank you Kelly for a great stay, we will see you again in the future I am sure."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Second stay here. I don‚Äôt want to rave about it like it deserves so it will be available when I come back to Tallhassee. üòÉ Both the place and the host Jennifer are fabulous. Our first choice when we come to Tallahassee!

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Would highly recommend this listing!
What a lovely, cozy little getaway in a beautiful neighborhood. Everything we possibly could have needed was provided. I loved being surrounded by nature, and the feeling of being in a treehouse!
Communication was excellent. Will definitely stay here again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfection.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful stay in this lovely living space. The location is great and the surroundings are very peaceful. I enjoyed relaxing on the balcony and taking in the sounds of the birds! The space itself is comfortable, clean, and thoughtfully laid out so that you‚Äôll have all you might need. Jennifer is also a great host- communicative, kind, and proactive with all the information I needed to make my stay easy. I hope to stay again!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer was very kind and considerate, the place was a beautiful private guest home that made you feel right at home. It was perfect with great location around the colleges while it was also surrounded by nature and trees; being the best balance of city and privacy. I would love to book again when I head to Tallahassee again."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was close to a lot of great restaurants. A lot of beautiful, walkable parks nearby and everything was within 15 minutes away."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer's apartment is comfortable and homey. Although it is a one room, one bathroom apartment, there is a lot of space and room for your belongings. It did not feel crowded a or small. The neighborhood and yard is great especially for being so close to downtown. The location is fantastic. We would stay here again if visiting Tallahassee."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic place, nice location, great host, and great value. We will look to stay here again when we visit."
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely wooded setting. Instructions were clear and easy for access in and out of the space. Someone greeted us on arrival and showed us how to operate the space heater. Exterior lighting was good. The WiFi was easy to access. The place is small, but has a king-size bed and two desks. The futon-sofa is close to the bed, has a firm hardness, and will work well for someone shorter than 6 feet tall. The bed and bath linens are clean and of good quality. The hot water was an extra treat especially in the shower. Interesting reading materials and games were available and organized--we especially enjoyed the book on the history of airbnb. The weather was too cold for us to take the walking paths or to swim in the pool, but would be enjoyable in warm weather. The local co-op market was easy to drive to and offered good choices in food. The host provided use privacy during our stay. There was one power problem that the host fixed immediately and easily after we called."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a beautiful place to stay! Jennifer is a wonderful host and is super communicative and very friendly - she shares all necessary info well ahead of time and is incredibly helpful. The space has everything you need within it and more, and also has an extensive guide full of information and suggestions for things to do. The surrounding area is beautiful, very safe and so peaceful. The location is also really close to many things in the city, which is really great. I definitely recommend staying here, so glad I did! :)"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Though a quick trip for us, we were able to take in the the peacefulness of the natural surroundings at Jennifer's woodland retreat. This spot is perfect for 1-2 people and has all the amenities you'll need for a short stay. Easy to get to and the host is incredibly responsive and prompt. We will be booking again soon for another trip to the area. It's private and peaceful, yet close to everything. We recommend checking out the Co-Op grocery just .9 miles away on Apalachee Parkway!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,perfect place to stay!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful and private location. Host lives next door, but is not intrusive. Always responsive and helpful. Will definitely stay again next time we're in town!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is a nice hideaway from the big city. From the time you park your car walk up the stairs and open up the doors You start to relax.. It's like being in a tree Fort with all the luxuries. Coffee every morning I'm the deck. And the evening listening to the nature sounds. What a great place to come and get away I will be back

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer was a wonderful host. Even though we got there late in the evening, finding the place was a breeze thanks to her thorough directions. She checked on us via message several times during our stay to see if we needed anything or had any questions. I couldn‚Äôt come up with anything, though, because she had already though of everything. The studio was clean, comfy, and visually appealing with the perfect blend of indoor and outdoor spaces. I wouldn‚Äôt change a thing!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This Airbnb was perfect for our stay in Tallahassee. Very well equipped, conveniently located, and so many thoughtful touches. We will definitely be staying here again."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The only bad thing I can say is that we didn‚Äôt get to stay longer. This is such a cute place and very well taken care off. Our favorite parts were the cute little balcony with views into the woods and of course the pool. Oh, the pool - what a treat! Our stay felt like a vacation in a forest cabin but smack in the middle of the town. We used to live in Tallahassee and came back to town to visit, so I can say with authority that the location of the place is absolutely perfect.
We hope to stay again but much longer next time we come to town."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Treehouse was located in a quiet neighborhood and less than two miles from our daughter's home. It was clean and comfortable and the pool was refreshing! So glad to have found this hidden treasure! Thank you.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was very clean and cozy. We didn't get a chance to use the pool but it looked very nice. Very quiet neighborhood. Apartment is exactly as described. Jennifer was very quick with communication and attentive to anything we needed. Great place!

Jennifer let me cut short by one day and didn‚Äôt charge me.
I highly recommend"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at ‚ÄòFun in the Tallahassee Sun‚Äô was quick, but super enjoyable. Communication with the hostess, Jennifer was terrific! She checked on me periodically and made sure I had everything I needed. I would definitely stay here again. My only regret‚Ä¶.I wasn‚Äôt able to take advantage of the pool. Sad face."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A very pleasant stay; you feel like you're in the woods, and you're minutes from groceries, shopping, food, etc. Close to parks and other cool things that Tallahassee has to offer! The place was clean, stocked with amenities, and I felt super safe. Would stay again!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Jennifer's guest house is a great spot to work remotely! I stayed here for one week. It's got a good amount of space and is easy to pop in and out of with a full size pickup. The bed is super comfy, and despite not having a full kitchen there's still an electric burner so you can make anything work. Good bathroom, great lighting, good AC. Jennifer & Simon are also super friendly. Plus there's a pool! Definitely recommend checking it out if you're looking for a place to stay in Tallahassee."

And only about 20 mins from Wakulla. We didn‚Äôt have time to get in the pool, but it looked beautiful and lovely if you are just looking to relax. We would definitely stay here again, and highly recommend!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,this place was great! located in the most charming neighborhood! it was adorable and quiet and the perfect place to stay.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The property is beautiful, the house was clean, the kitchenette was super handy and met all of our needs, and the pool was my favorite part!

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I really can‚Äôt say enough wonderful things about our stay- Jennifer was a fantastic and accommodating host! This was our second stay here and for a good reason. This is such a comfortable, clean, quiet and conveniently located place to stay while visiting Tallahassee. We were in town to spend time with my family for a few days so it was important to choose the perfect getaway in between family time. During an intensely hot week in the area, we stayed cool inside and out - AC kept the place comfy while the pool cooled us off during the day. In the mornings we enjoyed walking for a few miles through the lovely neighborhood and around scenic Myers Park. We picked up supplies at the local Co-op shop not far from the house which has a nice selection of natural and organic groceries. So we had pretty much everything we needed during our visit.
There‚Äôs no doubt we will book this spot again next time we‚Äôre in town. Thanks again Jennifer!!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great time staying at Jennifers AirBNB. It was just enough for our honeymoon get-away and Jennifer was an amazing host. Couldn't ask for better/easier process! TV didn't have streaming capabilities(not a necessity, but would be nice).. That's the only flaw in this cute little stay. More than plenty towels and bedding provided, and the kitchen had the necessities. cute little patio to sit on, and a pretty nice pool with water toys/floats!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Clean, comfortable and close to everything."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place. Easy to find, clean, peaceful, cozy and plenty of extras. Jennifer checked in by messaging several times to see if we needed anything. Easy check in and check out. Would definitely stay here again if I'm ever in the area."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! Guesthouse has everything you could possibly need and Jennifer was a friendly and welcoming host, and was also quickly responsive any time I reached out. The pool and lakefront were an added bonus. I‚Äôd definitely stay here again!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great hidden gem - perfect getaway - really enjoyed our visit! üòé
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely great stay! I loved the view into the treetops and walking the beautiful property. The pond is lovely. The sounds of geese and birds filled the air - and sounds of nature were the ONLY sounds I heard! The pool was clean and perfect for morning laps. The room is spacious and has a great vibe. Clean and comfortable. Jenifer and Simon are the perfect hosts‚Äìshould you need anything, you know they're there, but otherwise they leave you to yourself. I look forward to going back!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely space for two people but works be a bit tight beyond that. The bed is very comfortable, and the space was very clean. Jen was a considerate and responsive host. Be aware that this is a second floor apartment with outdoor stairs."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What an absolute gem! We can‚Äôt wait to come back and stay here again. Excellent communication with our host and they went above and beyond to make us feel welcome!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer‚Äôs place was amazing for our trip to Tallahassee. She was very helpful with restaurant recommendations. Her response time was almost immediate, which I appreciated. The house itself was very clean. The air conditioning blasted like one out of a hotel room. The mattress was so soft. My favorite part was the balcony. The view was amazing, and if you like views the lake view was even better. There‚Äôs even a bench out there so you can relax a bit. I‚Äôve been to some places and there‚Äôs a bunch of debris in the pool, but her pool was clean! 10/10 experience I would definitely book again if I come through Tallahassee."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our go-to place when we are inTallahassee. It‚Äôs very compact but has everything we need, including a comfortable bed, and we love being able to open the doors or sit on the balcony and enjoy the greenery when it‚Äôs not too hot. Communication with Jennifer before and during our stay is always excellent. Definitely recommend."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Communication with Jennifer was great. She‚Äôs included a lot of thoughtful touches for those who might not be familiar with Tallahassee (ranging from a book of suggestions to bug spray and an umbrella). Very nice and quiet area.
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean & well organized apartment . I found the shower to be a bit small, but I am very tall. The apartment is comfortable & I would stay there again , very quiet neighborhood."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,everything is exactly as it seem I promise you going to have a great time.
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer is a wonderful host who thought of just about anything a guest(s) could reasonably expect. She's very easy to reach and the location is very convenient, especially for anyone visiting an FSU student! You can't beat the price, of course."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Simply a sanctuary! Exactly as described, but better! Quiet, comfortable, clean, and in such a peaceful place. Description could not have been more accurate unless it said that this was the most wonderful and communicative host ever! Jennifer was THE BEST. I cannot wait to stay there again! Thank you!!!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jennifer is a very generous host. Her place was perfect for our weekend. The pool was pristine and warmed just right. I will definitely be back.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"this place was perfect in every way. location, price, clean ,easy check in, everything went so smooth."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place and going to the lake was nice. Everything was perfectüëç
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is definitely a gem right in the middle of Tallahassee! It's set off in a quite & peaceful neighborhood, easy to find & soul soothing environment! If your looking to explore Tallahassee or surrounding areas & don't want to feel like your in a rat race, this is the place to be! Everything was perfectly described & accurate! Thank you for hosting us!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The listing is spot on! Very comfortable, clean and convenient!!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is AWESOME. I cannot believe the attention to detail the host has put in. Upon entering you'll find an adorable quirky guidebook that will tell you anything and everything you need to know about the place, the things in it, the surrounding area, and even Jennifer herself! There's a bag with sunscreen and bug spray, there's shaving cream and razors, feminine hygiene, a nail kit, cotton swabs, air freshener spray in the bathroom, it's like someone ACTUALLY lives here. Nothing was left out. Don't know how to use a fire extinguisher? You will after reading the guidebook lol. You'll also enjoy local magazines, tourist brochures, and 2 nice cold waters bottled IN Florida. In the morning you'll find a dozen varieties of tea - and not your boring old Lipton and Celestial Seasonings üôÑ Someone actually knows decent tea. Bigelow Earl Grey is one of my all time favorites. There's also twinnings, stash, and yogi. The coffee is great, the creamer could be better but THANK YOU for having ANY - so many places don't? And bless your soul for having both a coffee pot and a FRENCH PRESS üëå Living for the options. I'm from Michigan, so even in early April when it drops to 55 I can't ever imagine turning on the heater. But there's a very cute heater unit and a great air conditioner, both with remotes so you never have to elbow the hubby to fix em in the middle of the night. I actually really liked the shampoo and body wash, the water pressure was a little lacking, but maybe that's just my desire to be power washed lol.
When she said private, she meant it! The neighborhood is quiet (minus all the lovely wildlife of course! Lots of birds and frogs) and you're not sharing the property (OR POOL) with other guests.
We're obsessed with the integrated blinds LOL so cool and unique! I've never seen those before. I wanted to stand there opening and closing them for hours - but didn't wanna break em so I resisted üòÇ
Can we talk about the BED?! OMG. Perfect mattress, not too firm, and the pillows are BIG and absolutely to die for. I'm so picky about my bed and pillows, I've never had a good night sleep anywhere on the road, BUT I DID HERE! I'm one of those sensory issue folks that has 100 pillows and is never satisfied with them, but these are a dream. I'm about to ask if I can buy one ü§£ü§£
I went on a walk through the neighborhood, it's very nice and easily walkable! In 3.3 miles (took roughly an hour) we saw 4 different parks, several restaurants and 3 bars! Lots of turtles, frogs, tadpoles, ducks and geese. We did a circuit of parks ending with World Of Beer, which had an amazing giant pretzel, burgers to die for, and a lovely sour beer! It was about 35 dollars per person, so keep that in mind. Unfortunately the very close bar The Moon was closed the day we had time to go üò≠ but that just means we'll have to stop by again!
Potential cons : are you from the north? Never been to non-coastal Florida? It's HOT and HUMID. You're basically in the swamp, buckle up snow bird! (I knew what I was asking for, but for those who don't be aware haha)
Are you a smoker? You'll notice it says smoke free property and they ask you don't smoke in the room, which is great because even though I do smoke I hate a stinky room, we did however smoke on the balcony and nothing was said about it, but be prepared to bring your own ashtray or cheap bowl! Don't be a littering jerk üò§üôÑ Some parts of the neighborhood seem to just not have a sidewalk or pedestrian lane? I feel like I'd be nervous walking with a stroller/little one in those areas. Though to be fair I only saw about 4 cars in total and the speed limit is 20."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jennifer‚Äôs place is great! It‚Äôs in a quiet neighborhood and feels like you are off the beaten path. The guest house has everything you need and is cozy. Would stay here again.

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at Jennifer's Woodlands Guesthouse was wonderful. I appreciated the extensive guidebook that was available for guests. The Guesthouse had an adorable and well stocked mini kitchen. Added bonuses were coffee and a nice variety of teas. I was able to cook breakfast, lunch and dinner with no problem. The balcony was lovely to sit out on and take in the late afternoon sun while being surrounded by nature. Great location and close to everything. I would stay at Woodlands Guesthouse again for sure."

The view from the balcony was beautiful. The kitchenette was organized and stocked with enough items to be able to fix a meal. The bed was comfortable. We needed the heater because of chilly nights and it worked very well. She even had coffee, tea and all the fixins'. Although we never saw her, we knew she was at our beckoned call. The location was superb, in that most everything we wanted to do was just a short drive. I highly recommend her place!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a delightful little hideaway in the trees and I enjoyed every minute of my stay. The space was impeccably clean and well stocked with all you will need. I listened to the birds‚Äô chorus while drinking coffee on the sweet deck which overlooks a pond and beautiful trees. The in town location is convenient and was perfect for my needs.

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had such a wonderful two night stay here! The space is beautiful and quiet, and the neighborhood walks were just exquisite. (I went for four walks, a different route each time, and all were lovely.) It was fun (and Covid cautious) to heat up frozen meals in the toaster oven and eat them at the bistro table while watching movies on the big screen TV. Everything was just so clean and orderly, and very welcoming too. Can't wait to go back!"

We will definitely stay here again the next time we visit!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to sleep and shower if you don‚Äôt stay much in. Might see the owners of the location as it is in a shared lot‚Ä¶ very nice and respectful to privacy.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely would recommend this place! It's located practically right down the road from the mall and there is a lot of fantastic eateries nearby. When you are staying here, you don't even really feel like you are staying in town. You feel totally removed and part of nature.
I'm sad that we didn't take advantage of the pool while we there but it sure did look inviting. We purposely did not want to cook at all on this trip, but I have no doubt we could have. The bed was the perfect comfort level for us, a happy medium of firm and soft. It was just the right amount of space for both me and my husband.
Jenn is a total sweetheart. She made sure we were completely comfortable the entire we were there. Definitely read the notebook! Lot's of fun information."

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This little stay is just such a sweet spot! The green lake and green trees and light green home made us feel completely immersed in nature for the week. The covered swimming pool was completely luxurious, and it allowed us to have special time to swim this summer, which we wouldn't be able to do safely in public pools this summer due to covid. We are so happy we made the special splurge to stay in this Airbnb and enjoy the pool as a family. (We live in Tallahassee and stayed here for Father's Day week to enjoy a pool privately, since our child is not vaccinated and we do not feel safe going to crowded public pools this summer.)"

The bed is really comfortable, with extra blankets if needed.

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a nice clean place!!! The most comfortable bed - loved hearing the rain falling on the roof and the owl hooting.

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I really had a wonderful stay. It was very private and quiet. I especially enjoyed listening to the song birds while having morning tea on the balcony. The unit was clean and had everything I needed. I have already recommended this unit to friends and family when visiting Tallahassee. You feel like you are far out in the woods but you are conveniently close to all things in the city! Jennifer is very quick to answer all communications.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jennifer place was everything we was looking for in a relaxing getaway. The place has any amenity you could need. I was pleased to find the king bed was very comfortable and the cottage does in fact have WiFi. This part of the city is quiet easily accessible to the main road where you can find all local stores and restaurants.
Everything was as described and so lovely. Jennifer has everything you can think of to make your stay experience wonderful.
We were very comfortable. Surroundings were beautiful, truly a breath of fresh air for us.
there is a small balcony we enjoyed spending the early mornings with a cup of coffee before venturing out the afternoon.
the parking area with a few steps up the stairs made it convenient for us. on our last day I was able to take a walk and a peek at the lovely bench close to the pond.
we have many upcoming trips to the Tallahassee area, I am sure Jennifer place will be top of the list for us to stay.
if you want a unique experience, you have to stay at her place."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Suzanne's place was wonderful!!!
My biggest regret is that I had a busy weekend and did not have time to enjoy the pool or have a nice breakfast in the outdoor area - there is such an ADORABLE little outdoor seating area that felt truly peaceful!
There is intention in every inch of this space - the art and decor on the walls are lovely and make everything feel so home-y. I wanted to just bask in the wonder of all of the little things. It does come with a well-equipped kitchenette, and was in a convenient location. Suzanne was very clear with her communication leading up to my arrival, and even let me meet her sweet dog (after verifying it was okay with me before hand).
The walls are a bit thin, but it was completely quiet at night. Bed is comfy!
I look forward to staying here next time I am in the area, if I can!"

2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The room was super cute. One of the negatives was that we could hear the host in her kitchen. The apartment is a room added on to her house. We could smell their dinner through the vents. For the cost, the room was adequate."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Suzanne‚Äôs place was an amazingly cozy and comforting stay. Myself and my husband stayed for two nights we really enjoyed our stay.

It is great place for 1 person to stay for a short time, although might feel tight for a longer stay or if you plan to spend a lot of time at the house. Also one of the walls is shared between the studio and the main house so you occasionally hear noises from over there, but they weren't disruptive at all."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Suzanne‚Äôs space was exactly what we needed after our long drive. We stayed for just a night, but the bed was comfy and it felt very homey.

The indoor space, the pool, and the screened in porch - so serene and homey. Spent time reading every morning on the swinging bench. The pool area was like a slice of Eden and the pool was the perfect temperature for mid-August in Tallahassee. Suzanne was very helpful and friendly, but also gave us our privacy. We‚Äôll actually plan any future trips to Tallahassee by her availability! Suzanne‚Äôs place will be what we judge all future Airbnbs."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed walking the sylvan neighborhood, less than a mile from the city's San Luis Mission Park (not positive about the name). Separate apartment attached to the house had everything needed in a compact space. A cheerful spot in Tallahassee I'd surely return to if I'm ever back that way.
We did hear the family from time to time on the other side of door linked to the main house kitchen."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Suzanne was very kind, hospitable and her suite was super cozy. Live plants, big front windows that let in plenty of natural light, and warm low-level lighting made me feel like I was a guest at one of my own family member's home - even the smell of the suite was strangely familiar to me (in no way a bad smell!). The side entrance was convenient and the driveway space provided was ample for my full sized truck. Keep in mind this is a suite that shares an interior wall with Suzanne's home, so occupants can be heard from either side of the wall. That being said, Suzanne repeatedly messaged me to make sure her and her company were not disturbing us. One night they were playing acoustic guitar and singing songs, but it was not loud or disturbing, could not be heard over our TV volume and they stopped before 8pm. I only bring up the topic for those who have not stayed in an attached suite before. We were very happy and would stay with Suzanne again! 10/10 host and living space!"

There is a kitchenette with a small sink, toaster oven, microwave, hot plate and full size refrigerator. The king size bed was very comfortable. It is close to a major shopping area, but very quiet. The negatives: poor water pressure, intermittent mildew smell (but the airport also had that smell, and ventilating the room helped), internet wifi signal was weak. There are very few rentals available in north Tallahassee and we were thankful this was available. We definitely hope to return."

2023-02-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Travel trailer parked adjacent to the cottage made the space feel dark and confining. We booked the guest house based on the setting overlooking a manicured lawn and garden. We were surprised to find an RV parked within 5 feet of the entire length of the cottage, totally blocking our view from 2 windows and the sliding glass door.
The pictures in the listing are no longer an actual representation of the setting and should be updated. While the host recently added a comment about the RV, none of the pictures have been updated to reflect the current conditions."

2022-12-01,3.0,Stayed one night,The RV less than 3 feet away and the unkept grounds really made this Christmas Eve stay the least favorite of our 9 day vacation through the panhandle. I chose this cottage from the pics and thought it would be more quaint than a hotel room‚Ä¶ only to find an RV the length of the cottage less than 3 ft away from all the windows.
2022-12-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were there during a rather cold spell and were surprised that the facility had no central heat. After we found a plug in electric heater used while there - mornings & nighttime - it became reasonably warm.
Kitchen was very small and not well equipped - eg no knife.
Surprised that an RV was parked right next to windows and unit is showing it‚Äôs age.
Family warned us that there was no hot water in kitchen but since we had minimal plate.s & utensil use that wasn‚Äôt much of a problem.
Surprised that owner wanted all linens & towels bagged at end of stay - we think that is owners responsiblity."

The patio gave us a chance to visit with some friends while remaining socially distant. The neighborhood was fantastic with parks for our little one and restaurants and grocery stores very nearby. Jordan gave us our space but was available at a moment's notice if we needed her. We had a wonderful stay here!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jordan‚Äôs place was a clean comfortable home base as we visited an ill family member. We enjoyed the peaceful screened porch and listening to the birds a couple mornings and evenings. The bed was comfortable, and we cooked a few meals in the small efficiency kitchen (we brought our instant pot but there is a single burner, toaster oven and microwave). We really appreciated Jordan‚Äôs kindness during a difficult time for our family."

2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jordan is responsive to requests, but there‚Äôs great privacy in the guest cottage. It is clean and comfortable, with the bonus of a spacious screened porch that looks out onto a secluded part of the yard. This was my second stay, but I hope it will not be my last."

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jordan's cottage was the perfect place for my family and I to gather while I was visiting their home town. Between the Florida heat, some health issues with family members, and Covid, it was tough trying to find a way to spend time together without endangering the health of those who were sick. Being able to relax on the screened in porch and play croquet in the backyard was perfect! On top of that, Jordan was ready to help out when I needed it, but gave us our privacy when I didn't. We all loved her darling cottage and her entire family was friendly when we saw them. I definitely recommend staying here!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jordan‚Äôs guest home is just as described and then some! The home was very clean and we had everything we needed.

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute guest house. Ac is a bit noisy. Since I was staying for a work trip, I had to go in and out multiple times and reverse driving out of the parking spot was a bit hard to do. Needs a bigger trash can for kitchen area. Place is clean, cute pictures of the family. Very spacious. Couldn‚Äôt get hot water from the sink faucet. Host was very respectful of privacy."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We highly recommend Katie‚Äôs cottage! You can‚Äôt ask for a better host - she is super responsive and friendly. The setting was absolutely beautiful and we had perfect weather. While the cottage is in the country, you aren‚Äôt hit a few miles from Costco/walmart/grocery and restaurants. And Izzy the dog was a bonus visitor and the sweetest thing."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Can‚Äôt say enough positive things about Katie and her cottage on the lake. This is our second stay here while visiting family in Eastern Leon County. Everything just suits us - size and style and location. We are retired, and travel with our 65 pound family dog. The grounds are perfect for a run or two with her (leash). It is like coming to a cousins house to stay the weekend. Minutes away from anything you might need, and yet miles away from traffic and neon. Thank you, Katie!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely stunning property, I highly enjoyed my time spent here thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Can't say enough about this place! It had everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, you could possibly need for a little get away. The host was super sweet and made sure I wanted for nothing. There was even condiments in the fridge and dry pantry food provided in case you wanted to cook something and maybe forgot an ingredient or five. The heated seat on the toilet was a definite bonus in January lol. The view of the lake and cow fields from the cabin made you feel like you were way out in the country even though you're maybe 5 minutes from the interstate. Overall one of the best airbnb's I've ever stayed in."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Katie‚Äôs place was perfect, so glad we found it! Convenient to Tallahassee and Monticello, it was the perfect place to rest and relax between events. Will definitely be back!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the cottage. Katie was awesome and made sure that everything was taken care of. I would highly recommend a stay at the cottage and hopefully in the future we will get back there. Wish you would‚Äôve had more time to hang around and enjoy the lake, but it was holidays and family stuff was going on. Thank you Katie for an amazing stay we will definitely come again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cute little place, we were busy with family so didn‚Äôt get to enjoy as much as we would have liked! Definitely would book again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Katie‚Äôs little waterfront cottage was absolutely wonderful. The cottage is filled with thoughtful and intentional amenities. Everything you may need and more. And the grounds and view are dreamy and peaceful. Katie is really kind and an excellent host. I have stayed in many airbnbs and this one is really special.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Katie's Airbnb is one of the most beautiful and comfortable locations we've stayed at, and our holiday celebrations went as such thanks in large part to the kindness and care Katie and her sister and sweet ""ambassador"" pup, Izzy, generously provided us. We missed sharing an evening firepit, but gladly hope to enjoy one together during our next stay (hopefully soon!). We felt incredibly lucky to have experienced one stay, but again can't wait till the next!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can‚Äôt say enough great things about Katie‚Äôs place. I wish I could had stayed longer and I can‚Äôt wait to return when I‚Äôm back in the area.
The cottage is super clean, quiet, cute. It has everything you‚Äôll need and is comfortable and spacious enough for 2.
The surrounding area is extremely peaceful and just beautiful. Only 20 min away to the center of town. Several shops and restaurants only 10 min away. I highly recommend it."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Katie's cottage is a hidden gem in Tallahassee!! The space was perfect and had everything we needed. It's was spotless, comfy, and cozy. The setting is so peaceful and quiet. Coffee on the back porch in the morning overlooking the pond is so relaxing. Katie was a great and responsive host, and check-in was super easy. I even got to give Izzy a few belly rubs before we left ‚ù§Ô∏è. I look forward to many more stays at the cottage when in Tallahasse. Thank you!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful. Looking forward to staying again.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ms.Katie‚Äôs place is absolutely amazing. Peaceful surroundings and beautiful scenery. Ms.Katie is a amazing host.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful place to stay. You can look out at the water and have your morning coffee or a night cap. Very private and cozy. This space is great for a couples weekend get away. We had a fantastic time and would stay here again.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great, little escape for me and my partner. Next time we will probably bring our pup too! The cottage was extremely cozy and the surroundings were beautifully peaceful. Thank you Katie, Maggie, and Izzy for a wonderful experience. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Katie's Airbnb was perfect for our needs! The area was absolutely beautiful and so peaceful. It felt like we were a million miles away but only a short drive from necessities like stores and restaurants. The bed was the most comfortable Airbnb bed I can recall and I actually slept well, which is hard for me when traveling. One of my favorite parts is that I was lulled to sleep by the sound of crickets and frogs at the lake nearby each evening. A/C was super effective and cold (something important to me in the crazy Florida heat). The shower had great pressure and everything was super clean. Katie was also very accommodating with scheduling, which we greatly appreciated. Originally our trip was supposed to be in May, then December, and finally happened in August and each time Katie was super understanding of the factors outside my control that led to so much change. We will absolutely stay at this Airbnb again in the future when we travel back down to Tallahassee!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Katie is one of the best hosts i have had to date ! Super welcoming and accommodating!! The cottage was super cozy to the point where i could not point out any negatives. The surrounding area is extremely peaceful and a perfect oasis for any adventure seeking guests! 10/10 highly recommended and Im glad i know that i have somewhere to stay anytime i visit tallahassee!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Truly one of the best stays I‚Äôve ever experienced with Airbnb. Katie and her sister are the sweetest souls you‚Äôll ever meet and Katie is so understanding and patient. There‚Äôs so much land, it was my dog‚Äôs paradise, also the scenery was amazing. I felt very comfortable and welcomed my entire stay. Thank you Katie! 10/10!!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Of all the ABNB locations we have stayed at, this host and location were head and shoulders above the rest! Katie was very flexible when I arrived much earlier than she was expecting and she handled it like she has been doing this for many years - although I was her 11th guest! Her Border Collie Izzy met my dog & I when we drove up and she was as hospitable as Katie. Katie's sister Maggie lives on the property also and she was great - made us feel welcome the whole time. I can't say enough about the property - after recently losing my wife of 55 years, this place was exactly what my Goldendoodle Stella and I needed to unwind from the past 4 years of her illness. I can't wait until we come back to Tallahassee so we can book again!! Fantastic host(s) and location! Didn't know we could stay in such a place....unbelievable. Great job Katie, Maggie, Izzy, and Mom! Miss y'all already and I just left today....‚ù§Ô∏è"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We go out of town a lot and I have to say Katie‚Äôs cabin has been our favorite so far. It‚Äôs a beautiful cabin, extremely comfortable and clean and the surroundings are beyond gorgeous. You feel like you‚Äôre way out in the country while still being 10 minutes from the city. Can not recommend enough for folks staying in or around Tallahassee. We will definitely be back."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a hidden gem and Katie is the best host I have ever had the pleasure to work with. Katie's hospitality is one of a kind. The property is tiny house about 20 minutes or so away from FSU. It is on a family property and has everything you need for one or two people. The property is on a lake - it is quiet and peaceful. I really enjoyed my time there. The only negative might be the internet speed - but frankly Katie was prepared for that - offering a standalone hotspot if needed. I was able to work from the hotspot on my phone for a few video meetings I needed to do. The property was exactly as described.
This is a very nice property and a superstar host. I will stay here again if it is available. I thank Katie and her sister for their hospitality and kindness."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,what a relaxing stay. We saw all kinds of wildlife right at the cottage and the beautiful surrounding area.We had a great visit with the kids and our dog loved it.Even the weather cooperated and it wasnt too hot for us mountain folks. Katie and her sister were friendly wonderful host. Close to town but felt so rural and peaceful. Hope to stay again someday.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Katie was a FANTASTIC Host from booking through the entire stay! Very responsive, helpful and kind. Her cottage was perfect for my husband, myself and our dog Rocky. He loved playing with Izzie! The cottage and the property were super dog friendlyüëçüèª We look forward to another stay at Katie‚Äôs Cottage!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Katie‚Äôs Cozy Cottage is probably the top 1 or 2 AirBnB‚Äôs we‚Äôve rented. It was the perfect size for us (2 adults and a big dog, too!). Beautifully decorated for comfort and a bit of whimsy. With windows on all sides, lots of natural light and the lake-facing porch was a perfect landing for early morning coffee and pondering. Great open space to let the dog run free a few times. Everything we needed, plus things we used and didn‚Äôt know we needed. I needed a hand mixer to make a promised Easter dessert and asked ahead if there was one in the cottage as I could bring one if needed. No problem was Katie‚Äôs quick reply - I‚Äôll leave you mine to use. So helpful! From the minute we turned onto the gravel road I was smitten. And then the lake. And calves and cattle. Anhinga lakeside. Early morning prancing deer. Thank you Katy for an amazing stay. We‚Äôll be back."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,katie is amazing.Gracious host and so friendly. her and her sister were helpful when needed but very respectful of privacy. she went above and beyond to make my stay it's very best. I felt a such peace and relaxation during my stay which was priceless to me. I hope to find availability here any time I need to work in this area again.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved this place. It was peaceful and allowed us to step out of our busy lives and breath. If we could only keep it a secret maybe y‚Äôall won‚Äôt go and we can get in whenever we want! Haha. Truly a great stay and super cute too. Plan to be back for sure.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Katie's place is lovely and quiet while still very close to town. In the mornings I'd watch deer and turkeys by the pond and at night look at the stars. Had a great time and will definitely be back!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Katie's tiny house is a hidden gem just on the outskirts of Tallahassee. It has all of the benefits of a quiet rural setting, yet just minutes from the hustle and bustle of town. I felt very safe my entire time there, and you will never forget the view from your front porch. Katie, and her sister Maggie who lives on the property as well, made me feel welcome and right at home. you will also get to meet Izzy the Wonder dog who is always up for a game of fetch ( except that she always runs home with the ball after fetching it). üôÇ Katie is right next door if you need her and she was so helpful with any minor issues that I had. The tiny house had everything I needed for a comfortable stay, a well-appointed kitchen, a comfortable bed and mattress, huge smart tv, wi-fi, and a private bathroom. This was a five-star stay for me."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I visited Tallahassee to see my daughter and grand daughter. Katie‚Äôs cabin was clean, quiet, and larger than I expected. I wanted a place that felt rural but was still just a short drive from my daughter‚Äôs apartment. Katie‚Äôs location and surroundings were perfect! I loved watching the sunrise and sunset from the porch. Sunset over the large pond/small lake was especially beautiful. I saw Great Blue Herons, Bitterns, Anhingas, and Great White Egrets, Red Tail Hawks, and watched a Seallow Tail Hawk catch fish from the lake.
My grand daughter loved coming by and seeing the longhorn cows across the lake. It was too chilly to try the kayaks, but hoping for another visit at a warmer time. The cabin had everything I needed and the best equipped kitchen of all my BnB stays to date. Katie answered texts quickly. Her home is right next door, but the cabin is situated so that there is a good sense of privacy. Highly recommend."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is the second time we‚Äôve stayed in Julia‚Äôs properties. Loved it - this one even more than the last.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Julia was an amazing and very cooperative host. Provided an early check-in which I know is not always easy to accommodate.

2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Although Julia was responsive and apologetic, her place smelled like smoke. She, at first, seemed not to believe us, and then when the customer from the night before us said it smelled like smoke too, she apologized. But no discount was offered and we would have stayed elsewhere had we known it would smell like smoke. I am writing this review a week later so plenty of time was given for Julia to give us some of our money back. The neighbors were also loud, bass was heard throughout the night. The neighborhood didn‚Äôt feel safe. I would not recommend staying here."

2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Richard was great at communicating, the house was very clean, organized, and comfortable. A lot of thought went into making sure every guest had a nightstand, lamp, dresser, and comfortable bedding. The Hummingbird House can easily accommodate 2 families with room to spare. This house is strictly a rental. You won‚Äôt be staying in someone‚Äôs home with their food, trinkets, or clothes in your way. Richard also recommended Chef Alicia to us to cater our daughter‚Äôs FSU graduation dinner. Having the meal prepared and ready to eat when we walked in the house was the way to go!!! Delicious food, beautiful table setting, attention to detail, and no waiting in long lines in college town. Richard also recommended a nearby park/preserve for us to go walking. This was by far the best airbnb experience we‚Äôve had, especially in Tallahassee."

2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"I can't say enough good things about our stay at Richard's house! From his flexibility on the number of people we had in the house, to his fantastic and immediate communication, to the cleanliness of everything, to the quiet neighborhood, abundant driveway parking, and OH, the fire pit! I appreciated the little things: nightstands and lights at every bed, nightlights in the hallways, dish and laundry soap and garbage bags available, plenty of seating. Even the hot water heater held up against 20 people.
Everything (appliances, wifi, electrical; even the automatic-closing curtains) worked, the house was close to shopping and dining, and just 15 minutes from FSU and FAMU.
It was amazing, and perfectly suited our large group's needs.
We will be back!"

Hopefully, we will be able to stay there again the next time we visit Tallahassee."

2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Outstanding house and location. Comfortable beds, well appointed, and spacious. Excellent communication from Richard including great local recommendations. Renting from an owner rather than a company is always so much better! I would definitely stay here again. A++"
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Go Noles!!! We just stayed at the Hummingbird Haus for our annual Tally football weekend with family friends. Great place for a large crowd with tons of space that is VERY hard to find in Tally. It's been recently renovated, has 6 bedrooms (3 rooms had 2 double beds). Also had 2 living rooms & 2 full kitchens (upstairs and downstairs), and 3.5 baths. There was an awesome wrap around deck and huge back yard with fire pit. Plenty of space to spread out and hang out. Highly recommend. We will be back for sure. Just hope it is available next time we book if the secret isn't out."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Thank you Richard for letting our large family stay at your lovely property.
It was so peaceful and I liked that it was in a cul-de-sac, made it easy to walk our dogs around in.
Our dogs also enjoyed playing with each other in the large back yard!
The view of your backyard from the upstairs outdoor rap around patio was also very nice and the great weather made it even more enjoyable!
The beds were comfortable and it was great that your kitchen was so big, so that a few family members were able to prepare and cook in it at the same time.
Having the ramps in the back, besides the stairs, to go up and down to the first and second levels and to the driveway, made it much easier for a family member with her handicap stroller.
They also loved having the small bonfire and making s'mores!
It was also very close to FSU which made things quicker!
We hope to visit again in the future!
Sincerely, Lauraine"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Excellent house for 15 of us. Close to FSU‚Äôs campus which made football weekend awesome. The house was perfect, large yard for the kids to run around. Would definitely recommend and will stay here again next year!"

But the Airbnb was a great source of relaxation and peace for all who came. We all loved the home. My eight year old loved the split level and the massive and soft sectional. I adored the ample space everyone had to grieve in their own way. My mother in law loved the outdoor space. And we all agreed that the interior design was fantastic. It was a wonderful stay and if we return for any reason, I must stay here again. The host was very nice and responsive and understanding of our situation. After each event we attended as part of the funeral, I looked forward to going back to this home. My only regret is that we didn‚Äôt stay an additional day!"

We got lucky that it was available on this random weekend when we decided to visit with our elderly parents and youngest son! The house is two-leveled living and each level is so comfortable, accommodating, and homey. We had a great weekend, nestled in the trees and yet close to FSU, Wakullah Springs, and The Rez.

It allowed us enough space to spend time all together while allowing everyone to slip away for some alone time when they needed it. Richard provided baby gates, a pack n play, baby soap, kid friendly plates/utensils, etc - all of which was a great help! Three of the bedrooms have walk in closets, which served as dark bedrooms for the youngest babies.

This is one of the best Airbnb experiences I have had, other hosts should take note. Thank you Richard for such a great experience and welcome to Tallahassee!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this house! We hosted a graduation party with guests ranging in age from 21-86! The house more than comfortably fit our 12 guests. Grandpa was able to relax in his room and watch westerns when he wanted to, the grandmas enjoyed the private screened in porches for talking on the phone, our 20-30 year olds loved the lower level suite with full kitchen and the deck was perfect for listening to music and having multi-generational conversations. The exterior is deceptive as the interior is wonderful. Luckily, the Tallahassee weather cooperated as well. Also, it‚Äôs centrally located so quick trips to grocery stores and FAMU.
We paid a premium given graduation weekend, but the value was much better than the equally inflated hotel prices. Great hosts! Great house!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The captains quarters was beautiful it is way bigger than I thought it feels very luxury you have a shared carport with the other available unit and a shared foyer. When you first walk in you could hear the other guests walking into the foyer but you can‚Äôt hear anything coming from the other rental although when I went, it was raining and very cold. The pool area is very beautiful to look at, wish I could‚Äôve got in. The yard is very beautifully kept. They do have pets that come out and I think their cats are outside all the time because there was a couple of cats outside, but it didn‚Äôt bother me any the area is very nice. I was very comfortable and I was able to extend my rental one more night with no problem will definitely rent again"

I wish the weather had been warmer so we could have used the pool because it was definitely tempting! The place was SUPER clean (and I usually am very critical of this detail in particular). The shower was so great, and there was plenty of space for luggage and personal items. I loved the coded door entry. It made coming and going super easy, and we were very appreciative of the carport for parking. We‚Äôve already decided we‚Äôll be staying here again for our next visit."

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb is a beautiful themed, spacious room with ambient lighting options. XL towels, stocked minibar area, & 2 desks! The cherry on top was the complementary beekman 1802 toiletries (I use their goat milk serum, it is not cheap!)
There were minor drawbacks, but nothing egregious . The freezer portion of the mini fridge doesn‚Äôt work & the only sink is in the bathroom. There isn‚Äôt many plugs near the bed either.

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second time staying with Jennifer in one of the cozy homes she provides on the outskirts of Tallahassee but a great location if looking to stay near the Killearn area as we were. The place is charming, well-stocked for coffee in the morning, and bathroom amenities. The place was bigger than just the room with the bed I expected from the pictures and included a nook with most of a kitchenette folded in as well as a furnished pool deck adjacent to the room to use as well. I would recommend staying with Jennifer and will seek to do so again."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Captains Quarters is one of the top Airbnb places we have stayed. Jennifer , Paul and her 4 dogs are great hosts.

Comfy bed, fabulous shower & bathroom, microwave, kcup coffee maker, toaster oven, small refrigerator, and Roku TV make this a complete set up.

Very pleasant decor, comfy bed, great shower. The Suite felt even bigger than the pictures show. Nice property and neighborhood.
Completely safe and secure. I would definitely stay again! Great Airbnb experience."
