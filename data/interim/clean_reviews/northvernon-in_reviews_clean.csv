2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I booked this for our 2nd anniversary and it was just what we had hoped! It was secluded enough that it felt private, but we didn’t feel isolated away from civilization. Everything looked as described and we even got to enjoy a nice fire on our first night. We would stay here again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The cabin is so beautiful and clean. They have everything you need for your stay. It was so quiet and peaceful out there. We will definitely stay again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was a lovely weekend get away. Clean, well stocked amenities, and welcoming. I found it to be quiet and relaxing. Only wish I could have enjoyed outside, it was ripe with mosquitos so could barely stay outside like I would have liked to. However, I will go back in the fall, and enjoy it then."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of the best times I have had to be away from technology and just enjoy the nature. Such a blessing from God (Jesus) to see beautiful nature and be unplugged. And thanks to the Getaway team for making the stay such an awesome one. Many blessings. Cheers.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Freda was clean, cozy, and the perfect tiny home for our anniversary trip! The host blew it out of the water with the extra details left (the mosquito wipes, tick spray, and s’more’s kit) especially since we brought our dog along!
We were so pleased with the clean and surprisingly nice bathroom and kitchen that looks just like the pictures. Especially with the provided utensils and items that may have been forgotten at home.
We’ve already recommended these cute getaways and plan on booking again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was relaxing and enjoyable. Made for a great weekend getaway!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved this little place! Kinda hard to find, but worth it. I love the amenities included."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was perfect! I recommend this place!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to get away and relax. They had more amenities than described. It was very thoughtful that they left a smores package and tick spray! It was the perfect way to send the weekend unplugged. The views are amazing, and they provided a radio, free firewood, water, and extremely clean sheets! I cant wait to visit again! 10/10 would recommend to friends"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great cabin for two people. For those new to this location, there are a lot of bugs. All kinds and sizes I have never seen before. Only go if you like actual camping but don’t like carrying gear. Loved the included s’mores kit and sundries."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had wanted to try Getaway Brown County for a year now and was pleased to find listings on AirBNB, a platform I'm familiar with. There was a little lag in communication before checking in, but once I got there, I was very pleased with everything. They really thought of including everything for you - I had packed some seemingly extra items (lighters, a flashlight, first aid kit) and they already had those. It truly was grown-up camping, without needing to set up a tent or share a bathroom/showers with strangers! The roads to the site are gravel, so drive carefully. You're only 20 minutes or so away from Brown County State Park, my husband I spent an afternoon hiking, and the next day enjoying the sounds of the rain from within our cozy cabin. We will definitely be back!"
2024-06-01,2,Stayed one night,"It was horrible. I've never seen so many ticks in my life. I removed 50 of them from myself. The cabin was not equipped with internal ventilation. We stayed in a similar tiny house before, and there was ventilation in the main room. This time, we couldn't open the window due to heavy rain. Sleeping was uncomfortable. The air conditioner didn't help."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay! Very well thought out.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here with my boyfriend! Beautiful space, so romantic!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice quiet place to get away. Close enough to Nashville to do some shopping, will definitely rebook in the future."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I really enjoyed our stay! The cabin was beautiful, super clean, and exactly what we needed to take a break and disconnect. The host was very proactive and made sure we had everything we needed from the start. The property is beautiful! We enjoyed being surrounded by nature and also took advantage of the nature walk trail on the property. Highly recommended!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely beautiful & cozy. We loved our stay. Plenty of room for us and our pup!
We did bring a cast iron skillet to cook on over the fire pit but even that wasn’t needed as they had foil for the grate.
Looking forward to another getaway soon!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, peaceful, and very relaxing."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This is my first time renting an Airbnb. I would do it again. I am already talking to my husband about when we can go back and go on the hiking trails.
2024-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,It was a pretty area. And very quiet. We loved the view. But we wished we could have spent more time outside. Even with using the tick spray that they offered and our own we were still covered in them the second our shoes touched the gravel. Some ticks make sense. But to have coating objects outside makes it a little concerning. The last day of our stay we noticed sawdust material on the phone and light switches and watched little bugs pop in and out of the wall. Overall I’m sure that others stays are great. And we just got a one off fluke experience.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,I definitely recommend booking! It was a beautiful and peaceful cabin. The cabin had all the necessary amenities and was well-equipped with useful items. Definitely worth the price!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cannot recommend enough! Clean, friendly, absolutely gorgeous area. Great service. 10/10, we are already recommending it to everyone we know.
Friendly tip: take a screenshot of the directions to get to and into your camper before you get there. There’s no service and it’s a pain to handle that all once you’re there."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,I enjoyed my stay! It was exactly like the pictures and the surroundings were beautiful. Can’t wait to come back!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We stayed during peak tick season and weren’t warned about this until arrival. There was no spot to relieve my pet other than gravel- that was a bit of a challenge! My dog barely got close to the brush and we found a total of 3 ticks on her! Actual site was clean and well stocked overall.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love Getaway! I’ll be back!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a perfect getaway for my husband and I’s anniversary! Very peaceful!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,I enjoyed my quiet evening . Everything you need .
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"So much better in person! I was continuously blown away by their thoughtfulness (s’mores and campfire kit, informative signs, other amenities). I would 100% stay again because of this. I found the nature trail with the dog potty station in front and it was a beautiful hike with so many flowers. Extremely dog friendly if I had brought mine. I could tell that they thought of every single scenario and need that each guest would have out there.
The perfect getaway from city life and the reset that I needed. With that nature view from the huge window and the light rain noises, I was able to have a great rest.
Brown County State Park was only 18 mins away, Little Nashville was under 30. I had a blast exploring all the shops."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"i loved the stay! the location was beautiful. the surroundings were peaceful and serene. the way the experience was thoughtfully planned out from beginning to end with the smores kit, the bedside window (which i absolutely left open so i could wake up to nature), the tick spray (def needed), the pet supplies, all of it. it was such a pleasant experience. i will totally be using getaway again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great getaway like always.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,They were wonderful with communication and definitely someone we will be staying with again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very cozy. Loved waking up with the big back window. Thanks for being able to accommodate our dogs too!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just as the pictures show. The little smores kit was so cute and I loved the privacy. We had a little friendly raccoon come visit every night but as soon as we made noise and chased him away it was fine. The firepit and chairs nestled right against the woods was perfect for us to relax and connect. Everything was immaculate but I do recommend spraying because we had those big black ants everywhere but of course it's expected because you are in the wood. We Definitely recommend 👌
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A good place to find some quiet time and space! Cabin is comfy and perfect size to sleep, make easy meals, and hang out."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The inside of the cabin is really stunning. The large picture window, the well organized modern kitchen space. They really do have everything you need and nothing you don't. We had a wonderful time unplugging- we loved the suggested activities and the radio so we didn't need to use our phones for music!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This was amazing! Honestly the price could be more for what’s offered I didn’t want to leave and I will be booking again 🥰
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place to get away & find some peace of mind! Once we entered the Airbnb we were greeted with water as well as a pamphlet with recommendations. Very tidy, amazing view, will definitely be visiting again!"
2024-06-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"If you can get past the ticks that have made their way inside; the mice that have made a home inside will keep you awake all night as they chew through anything they can.
Our weekend getaway was something out of a horror movie."
2024-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"5 stars for the Getaway house. 1 star for non-responsive hosts. The Getaway house was perfect, just as shown in photos. Very clean, cozy, beautiful surroundings. Recommend it to anyone wanting a restful and relaxing couple days off the grid. The problem was the hosts don’t respond. We arrived 20min early (240p) for a 3pm check-in. We notified the hosts and asked if we could go into the house a few minutes early (there was no one staying in or cleaning the house). No response. We messaged through the app and texted the phone number listed. No response. We called the number listed. No response. Finally at 305p (5min after check in) we called the main AirBnB line, who tried to contact the hosts. Finally at 330p - 30min after check in - we received two different codes to access the house, which was confusing. Bottom line - definitely stay in the house because it’s awesome but don’t expect the hosts to help you."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Getaway was exactly what we were looking for. We booked last minute and they were very accommodating. Everything was as described. Each site is private, you can tell they really put thought into giving you a personal private experience. Would highly recommend!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"spent a couple nights here. beautiful place, would definitely recommend and will be staying again."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was perfect for a peaceful weekend getaway.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay! The host was super responsive and cabin was pristine. Fun to try out a tiny house. Rustic and peaceful setting. Will certainly visit again!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Thanks—I’ll be back!!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to get away!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We had an amazing stay. Gorgeous tiny home with an amazing view. We will surely return. Thank you!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was great!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Quiet
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An amazing little retreat for couples! Beautiful, relaxing space! We definitely want to come back in the fall!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed in a Getaway cabin for two nights. Wish we could of stayed longer! My first thought when we got inside the cabin was how clean everything was. I really loved all the extra touches(teas, coffee, bug spray, smores kit, ect.) put into the making the cabin welcoming. The veiw out of the large window was my absolute favorite aspect of the stay. The property was so beautiful as well, really appreciated how far apart each cabin was spaced. There was plenty of dry wood also provided which make our stay that much more relaxing. We will definitely be booking our next weekend away here! Thank you"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had an amazing stay, very clean! Host were very accommodating. We will definitely stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place and quiet
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice place. Looks exactly like pictures. 10/10
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Just what I needed for a quick break, beautiful scenery, clean space, fairly private, and thoughtful details like coffee and s’more kits. Will definitely be back!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, peaceful retreat. The cabins are in pristine condition. Even though I wasn't initially sent which cabin I was in, the host was immediately responsive when I texted them. The road sign is difficult to see and, initially, I was concerned as there is a property in front that is very ""junkyard"", but once past that, the area that the cabins are in is secluded, beautiful, peaceful and wonderful. Highly recommend!a"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cabin was a beautiful getaway. This was a well needed reset for me and my husband. Basic items were provided. I would definitely recommend this cabin as a home away from home.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My wife, puppy, and I all stayed here and had a wonderful experience. The privacy, neatness, cleanliness, and quality of the place was 10/10. Absolutely loved everything they provided for our stay and would most certainly recommend for anyone else looking for a comfortable & cozy stay!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is our second time staying at this location and we will most likely come again. We can’t get enough of how peaceful and wonderful experience is ☺️
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed for 2 nights and added an extra one because it was so great! Definitely recommend staying here, they have basically everything you need besides food. Super happy with my stay. Only thing is that some bugs occasionally got in the cabin, but you are in the woods so that’s expected."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was a cute weekend getaway!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place was so peaceful! It was very cozy. The best place for a weekend getaway! We will be staying again!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Peace, will be visiting again"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a peaceful and relaxing stay!
2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"I had a great spontaneous night away from home at this location! I deducted one star as it seemed the sheets had not been changed or cleaned in the cabin, also papers left in the previous persons name thanking them for their stay were there for me when i arrived. other than that, it was a quiet get away to reset!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a beautiful place to stay! And a very friendly and personal experience they provide without even having to be in person😊
2024-04-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed the stay overall.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfectly placed in a quiet setting. Simple. Clean and easy to find. Bed is firm. View is fantastic. Will book again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I have gone on vacation twice in 5 months and this was definitely better and more relaxing than going out of the country. My girlfriend didn’t want to leave at all 👍🏻👍🏻
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"A perfect getaway! The simple luxury and thoughtful design of the cabin, the high quality sustainable products used all made the stay memorable!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,beautiful place. very generous and responsive managers.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was incredible and a perfect weekend getaway! We will be back!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It is the ideal place for a getaway.. Disconnect from the city, the routine and meet nature.. beautiful place clean and tidy cabin with everything you need, we will be back soon.."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice cosy peaceful place out in the middle of nowhere
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved staying here! My husband and I had such a relaxing time!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic stay. Everything you need is in the cabin. Very secluded spot down a gravel road.
I am however very happy I did not get a spot that required steps to even get to the cabin. I have mobility issues (but I don’t require a full ADA style cabin) and while I am ok with stairs they did not have handrails. So if you have mobility issues make sure to let them know."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Getaway comes equipped with everything you need and then some! Great care was taken to anticipate needs and meet them. The home was cozy and well-appointed and maximized the outdoor space. We loved the big window and the encouragement to break away from devices to truly disconnect. Our only complaint: the bed was a bit too firm for our liking so we tossed and turned a lot (that’s just a matter of personal preference, though). I’d love an option to select a unit by mattress firmness in future. Also, the ticks were already an issue in early April. Not at all Getaway’s fault, obviously, but be aware and check yourselves and your dogs often!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I can't say enough great things! All of the rave reviews are correct. These are beautifully designed spaces with thoughtful amenities. You have everything you need including free firewood! The eclipse glasses, activity sheet, and local hiking recommendations were particularly appreciated. Thank you for providing a beautiful experience. We look forward to our next Getaway!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Lovely and clean location.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice to unplug
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, would highly recommend! The place seemed like it was brand new and it was spotless! It was very well stocked and they seem to think of every little detail! The location and surroundings were beautiful! That's"
2024-04-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"For the price of nearly $450 for two nights…… I am fairly disappointed. The listing didn’t say anything about the extra costs for the amenities mentioned in the listing (firewood, boxed water, hot chocolate, s’mores, etc). The stove was still oily from the last guest spraying Pam all over. There were dirty smudges on the bathroom door. The exterior door have oily fingerprints on it. The places is about 120sqft. I don’t think I am expecting unreasonable cleaning standards between guests.
The bed was clean and the place was cute. Definitely wouldn’t do it again for the price."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great getaway for my partner and I. We enjoyed the fire place, large window, and enjoying a peaceful weekend. I am looking forward to booking here again in the future."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My significant other and I originally had plans for a different cabin however the cabin we reserved was just not what we were wanting. We found Getaways listing and made a last minute reservation. Getaway was very accommodating and quickly confirmed our reservation. This little camper was pretty perfect for a cozy weekend in nature. Our dogs loved the area and we had plenty of trails and walks to try out. We enjoyed all the amenities it had to offer! The beds do get really hot at night so we had to make sure we set the air on the right temp but other than that, we had a great stay. Our pups even got a special treat. Lastly there were other campers within our view however everyone was very respectful and kept to themselves!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is definitely the place to go to to literally 'Getaway' ! It's a tiny cabin tucked into a wooded community of other tiny cabins! The only noise you hear is other guests driving to or from their own cabin! The great outdoors is your living room with nature as your TV!! This is the definition of simple living! The tiny cabin really helps you grow closer with your significant other because there's no room to have any ""space"" lol. My husband and I loved the simplicity of this stay and will be back very frequently!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Such an amazing space. It was easy to disconnect from the world and just enjoy some time together. It was fun going into Nashville and Columbus. The hosts were so kind to accommodate our pup and left him bowls, a lead tied outside, treats, and bags. We were blown away. We essentially had the place to ourselves. We are already planning our next getaway!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Just the getaway we needed!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very quaint place!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"my getaway was awesome. they had a tie out. bowls, even a treat bag for my dog. I liked trying the pour over coffee and enjoyed the bluetooth capable radio. I read all of the books provided; even bought one. the space was larger then I expected so I was comfortable with just me. the shower had hot water and good pressure; shampoo conditioner and body wash mounted right inside. I'm a tall plus size woman and the shower head wasn't too low and I was able to shower without being cramped. bathroom wasn't too small either. I love all the storage so not to be cluttered. the outside fit pit and chairs were nice. there was a fire ban when I attended but everything for a fire was provided including a smore kit. Bed was comfortable. Outside was very quiet everyone was respectful of each other privacy. check in was super easy and all cabins were clearly marked and there was a posted map right at the gate just to check before entering. overall was a great experince."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Getaway was so nice and such a great experience! would recommend to anyone who wants some quality time in nature
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you’re looking for a relaxing retreat….this is the place! As soon as we walked in to our tiny our stress started to slip away. Everything was perfectly set up and super clean. Not too much…but just enough. We took advantage of the walking trail and enjoyed exploring a bit of Columbus while we were there. We decided we want to visit during each season…summer, fall, winter and spring! This would also be a great place to book for a friend or family member who just needs to getaway and rest or reset after a stressful or challenging time of life. Highly recommend!!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful with a beautiful view of the stars. I really enjoyed my stay.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was the perfect getaway from the city
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and peaceful!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Place includes everything you need! A peaceful retreat for sure! Loved the big window.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to getaway. Was very relaxing. There is a nature trail to walk and gravel road between all cabins. Close to Nashville, In and Brown County State Park. Appreciated all the little touches, like dog food bowls provided with a bag of treats and waste bags. There was a burn ban when we stayed, but the fire pit with lawn chairs would have been a great place to relax by. The kitchenette was well equipped so we were able to cook despite not being able to use the campfire.
We will definitely return!"
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"We overall really enjoyed our stay. I will say, the cabins were much closer together than expected. Especially in a winter month when there are no leaves on the trees, you can easily see your neighbors. Cabins are quite close to the street and each other. But once you’re inside it still feels private because the big window faces the woods. The cabin is very clean and the design is lovely. It is very small but cozy. Note: There is a county fire ban that looks like it will stay in place until April 12 from what I’ve read online. We were not allowed to have any kind of campfire at all, which was a big disappointment. But obviously not their fault. I think overall this cabin is better for one night than for 2, especially with not being able to make any camp fire. There is a nice hiking trail on the property. Brown County state park trails about 30 mins away."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cabin was the perfect choice for a weekend away. We were obsessed with the picturesque view from the enormous window.
2024-03-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed here before and loved it, but the second stay wasn’t as good. There was a strong smell, like a cigarette smoke smell and then there was a mouse in the trailer eating the unopened groceries we had. We had to open up the windows and allow it to out. It was almost unbearable."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a PERFECT getaway! I will be returning. It was beautiful, peaceful, and they really do supply you with all the tools you need!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,My daughter and I absolutely loved it here! We should have booked for 2-3 nights not just one! It was absolutely gorgeous and had such a fantastic time. It was perfect and the atmosphere was even better! We will be returning!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,The cabin was so peaceful and beautiful. Will absolutely use this again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely will be back and will hopefully be back over and over again to enjoy the serenity and time away from reality when you visit this air bnb cabin - so fun
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great just wished the gravel road was paved.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was extremely peaceful and secluded. They included a ton of little extras like hot chocolate, a marshmallow kit, a kit for your dog, etc. It was very clean and just a great overall experience."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great weekend getaway for my husband and I. We enjoyed the location and amenities the rental came with. The smores kit and fire starter kits were great! We wished we had brought a 2nd blanket for outside at the firepit, but everything else we needed was provided."
2024-03-01,4,Stayed one night,Good
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was my second time to visit and it was just as wonderful as I remembered. love the location and cabin is perfect. I watched deer on the hill beside my site for hours one day as they fed on the leaves. Magical and special! The employees that manage the area are very kind as well. They have a great team of friendly people. I will return!
2024-03-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The view and the space were perfect. We did have a bit of an altercation with some mice that decided to share the space though. They were only active from 2am to 7am, but they were very noisy and enjoyed rummaging through our belongings."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super happy with the place
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It was a very cozy place with 2 huskies. Only bring people and animals you really like.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Such a beautiful place for a peaceful break from the world. They supplied everything for me and my fury friend! Treats, bowls and a long leash was outside so she could wonder around. Definitely will book again! Also, they were very fast to respond when had questions or needed something!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Cant wait to explore more areas.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"No words to describe this stay, our favorite. BY FAR! We wished we stayed longer and can’t wait to go back :)"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an incredible experience that is absolutely essential in life, especially if you’re working full time and have stressors in life like we all do. Something about being in nature is just good for the soul. These cabins are the best airbnb I’ve ever rented. In the description, it says “The cabin has everything that you need & nothing that you don’t need”, and that’s exactly what you’ll find. Getting away from technology and playing cards and being in nature is so healthy. What an iconic idea, we are already booking our next trip. We’re planning on traveling around the country as Getaway has Cabins in many places. Thank you, truly."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved staying here! The cabin was super cozy and everything is super clean! The view from the window was beautiful, both during the day and at night! They provide you with pretty much anything you need, and more! It was a very nice stay!
I totally would go again, it's the perfect place to wind down!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It was a perfect little getaway for my husband and furbabies to unwind for the weekend. Everything was provided for our peaceful trip including treats for my furbabies. Thank you for the tranquil stay. We'll be back!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had a wonder stay at the Bloomington Getaway. It was so quiet and peaceful and the cabin was perfect.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stopped by for 1 night passing through and almost cancelled our other plans to stay longer. What an amazing place! The cabins were very comfortable and thoughtfully designed. The view was unparalleled. Will absolutely be back again!
Host was responsive and kind."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best place I’ve ever had a “getaway” to, will definitely be back, as there’s one in my hometown as well! Will be great to just find some relaxing time with my fiancé."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,This was the perfect Getaway! Everything was as promised. We enjoyed our stay thoroughly and highly recommend if your seeking peacefulness in an amazing setting. Communication was excellent.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Besides the rocks driving in its amazing i enjoyed the view the silence the peace me and my wife will definitely come again
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely beautiful view, I could lay in bed all day and just look out the giant window happily. The cabin was very clean & had everything we needed including firewood!! I would absolutely recommend going and go again myself!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time on our trip! The cabin looks just as described and the amenities were great. We loved the s’mores kits and the fire pit. It was a short drive to everything.
The only mild complaint we had is that the overhead photo on the listing shows longer driveways to the cabins and more privacy than in reality. If you step outside the cabin there is no privacy meaning no privacy at the fire pit. We could see at least 4 other cabins and their occupants when outside. From our big window we could see another cabin and their fire pit and vehicle and could see them turning on and off lights in their cabin at night (we did visit in a winter month so if the trees were full there would likely be less visibility). This did not affect our enjoyment much and we would definitely visit again but we were a little surprised when we arrived because of the pictures in the listing."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay was incredible. The second we walked in, we knew we’d found a spot we’ll return to again and again. The setting and views are incredible, of course, but the amenities are exceptionally thoughtful. We had our dogs with us, and bowls, treats, etc. were provided for our stay; there was even a tie-out attached to the picnic table so they could roam a bit without being off-leash. We had an incredible time.
One note I’ll add for future guests is that the address provided leads you to a sign that says “staff only,” and there are a number of no-trespassing signs associated with a house on the same road. I’m still not quite sure what the setup is there but it made finding the spot initially a little confusing."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was a magical place to stay! I was able to totally unplug and just relax in the beautiful surroundings. Everything was perfect, down to the smallest detail. I can’t wait to come back."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great getaway.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,What a gem! And right between Nashville and Columbus! Will 100% be staying again and again and again.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Plan to come back! Absolutely loved our stay, and loved the location. Me and my husband had a peaceful and wonderful time. Would recommend to anyone!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spent a wonderful weekend here with my Fiancé. This place is truly special. They have everything outlined in the ad as to what the space has to offer, very transparent and we really appreciated this so we could pack more effectively. A bit hard to find, but we did come in during a blizzard so different circumstances. 10/10 weekend, we can't wait to come back!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was absolutely gorgeous!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The most majestic, tucked in the middle of the forest, getaway! Amazing location and perfect to disconnect from technology and just explore! Can’t wait to come back again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Lovely place. Will visit again
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a beautiful place and such a cute cabin!! Highly recommend!!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Getaway is where form meets function! This was truly a wonderful experience. First and foremost, the space is gorgeous and very private. It is equipped with everything that you could think of and beyond like a radio, cookware, stove, firewood, fire starters, even a complimentary s’mores kit! The bathroom is squeaky clean and has hot water which is wonderful after a long day hiking. Definitely recommend for any solo travelers or couples!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place to stay, nice to have a small getaway and be in a nice little cabin, would go back again"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Getaway! Peaceful atmosphere, clean space, and a beautiful view out the big window!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved everything about our stay it was exactly what we wanted!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our weekend away! It was so peaceful and exactly what we needed. We will definitely be coming back and we will definitely be recommending our friends to stay here as well!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I needed to get away, and Getaway we did! Way off the beaten path, the only things you will hear are the wildlife, breeze, and the occasional vehicle from other Getaway-ers. We really felt a peace in nature and did not feel the urge for the outside world. Thank you Getaway for helping us do just that!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"The attention to detail in every part of the stay did not go unnoticed. It was so relaxing, peaceful, and exactly what we needed."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful little getaway away just 45 minutes away from Indianapolis. You could see the stars at night! Highly recommend
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful place, super dog friendly!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed this cozy little cabin! The way the property is set up is perfect. There is many cabins but each has its own mostly private space. My only minor critique.. Both of us use a C-pap and the way the bed is set up against the end wall it isn't easy to set up the machine for the person sleeping against the wall. Will definitely consider renting from them again.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The stay was amazing. Only problem was when we first got there we did not have water. They had someone out right away and got the problem fixed asap! They were very fast at responding to messages as well! If you are looking to get out of town for some peace and quiet Getaway is the place to do it!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,LOVED this adorable cabin. The big window made it like sleeping outside without actually being outside. Falling asleep looking at a sky full of stars made for such a refreshing weekend. And everything in the cabin looked brand new. Will definitely book again!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Fun trip from Chicago to get out into woods and relax. One issue is the ticks for the dogs, after about 5 min if that we pulled over 10 ticks of our dog. Not getaways fault just a disclaimer for fellow pet owners to consider. It was every time they went outside we found ticks on her. Other than that place has all you need and is fun. It is very small if small ain’t your thing and cramped then don’t do this one. Otherwise a great time we really enjoyed ourselfs."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely speechless experience! I’m a person that pay attention to details and this play is overflown with details! We didn’t expect much at first but my gosh the built materials were above and beyond what you would expect of a remote cabin, and I could feel how the team absolutely loved their jobs and care about the experience of their guests. The view and placement of the cabin were carefully chosen and everything is just PERFECT! Thank you guys so much for a top notch experience!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful environment, very cozy space perfect for our needs. I will say without the black friday discount i never would have stayed here for the original price point. But other than that the cabin was well worth it. Didnt like that they are so close together that i can see all of our neighbors but at least we cant look in eachothers windows. The drive in was pretty treacherous and would probably be very difficult for smaller cars, especially in the rain. Overall great experience and only 20mins away from Nashville. Lots of conflicting information about weather the firewood and smores are complimentary. Please make it clear somewhere on the booking site."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I stayed here for the weekend just to get away. We loved our experience at Getaway. The picture window was beautiful and the small space was intimate and cozy. Getaway thought of every need and organized everything very well. I would love to come back again.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great place very peaceful
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,awesome weekend get away. Support staff is immediately responsive and polite. highly recommend getaway! you will not be disappointed.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely loved it and wish I could’ve stayed longer
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Love love love this place. My Fiancé and I spent a weekend here. It was pretty cold, but the place was well insulated and heated perfectly. we built a fire and roasted marshmallows. we did a 2 mile hike just 10 mins from our place. The place is extremely private, even with neighbors. We cooked with no problem. There was enough hot water. The kitchen was well equipped. loved it"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was a great place for a little weekend getaway
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Had a wonderful time, area was very peaceful and quiet. The host was very nice and responsive."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved everything about our stay at the Getaway. It was so peaceful and relaxing and view was great. The host was so responsive when we had questions. Can’t wait to go back!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"They went above and beyond to make us feel right at home by including firewood and extra little treats for our stay, and they even left our pups some treats and a note. The whole set up is super cozy and has everything needed for a true cabin in the forest getaway. We cooked all of our meals on the electric stove inside since it was so cold (got to 0F at one point). The heater and hot water tank did a tremendous job at keeping us warm and happy the entire weekend. 10/10 place to stay, and looking forward to exploring their other locations too."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful cabins and indeed a getaway! Much recommended throughout the year.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved my stay! So cozy and private. I didn’t realize how many getaway houses they have on the campus so I’ll definitely be back to stay at another. Hosts communicated excellently.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect getaway! Thank you! We'll be back!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriend and I stayed in Helena for the weekend and had a great time! We loved the great use of space in the small cabin, it had everything we needed for a cozy weekend in! Free firewood was a big plus! We will definitely be back!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Getaway gave us the perfect cozy weekend away from the city we were looking for! The window facing the woods brings in so much natural light and creates a private lookout. The amenities are compact but provide everything anyone could need. So peaceful, so comfy, so enjoyable. Can’t wait to Getaway again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just what I needed!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect spot for a quick weekend away. Peaceful, restful and restorative!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,it was an amazing place and perfect place to be off from everything. i would definitely get back!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a home away from home. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We are already planning our next trip back!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful spot to get away!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I came here for our 1 year anniversary and it was PERFECT. We love hiking and being in a private setting, and this was perfect. We brought our Golden Retriever, and Getaway was so accommodating. They left little dog bowls and doggie bags, which was so thoughtful. We walked the nature path at the back of the property and we loved it! We also hit some trails and shops in Brown County and it was a short 20 minute drive to downtown Nashville.
We even struggled with some snow, getting out of the drive, and their staff was already onsite and came up to offer us traction mats. They were around and available, but not too much in our space.
10/10 would recommend for a private, serene setting."
2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This location is very beautiful and peaceful. Clean, modern, and well built.
There was some strange confusion though about provisions (fire wood, coffee, s'mores, etc) inside and at the location. The listing says some things are included, like fire wood and s'mores for example, but when you enter the cabin you will find a list of items that will cost extra. Fire wood and s'mores are on this list. (Unless this is changed by the time you are reading this. which hopefully it is.) That said, I haven't gotten a bill for the items I used, and when I messaged the host they didn't answer my question about if they were included or not. Hopefully this confusion is cleared up before your stay."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I had a great time here. Wonderful hosts and we are looking forward to coming back soon!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at the Patricio Cabin was spectacular! It was exactly what my husband and I were looking for in the getaway experience. We were lucky enough for it to snow on Saturday morning as well. This was such a pretty sight to wake up to… having a giant window by the bed.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Its was beautiful and private. We loved the nature trail. Totally plan on coming back.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, relaxing place."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy and private. We will be going back in the future.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Getaway was a fantastic place, true to the listing: rustic and simple, exactly what we were looking for. Well off the beaten path and private individual campsites with great views."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and clean! They provided wood bundles for purchase which was nice!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little getaway 😁
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay & would stay again!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just like the photos!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I were wanting to plan a short trip after the busy holidays, we found this place on Wednesday morning and by Wednesday afternoon we were booked and headed there! This place was absolutely perfect for the 2 of us and our 2 pups. The picture window is absolutely stunning. The hosts were very easy to get ahold of and very helpful!! We will definitely be back in the future!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean and professional - perfect peaceful stay
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was such a nice place! We scheduled last minute and received a response right away. So Peaceful and the view was amazing! We really enjoyed and can’t wait to visit again.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"I absolutely LOVED staying here with Getaway. In fact, I loved it so much that I actually booked another night. The team was super responsive and helpful in getting me another night and reimbursing me so I wasn't paying a cleaning fee twice. This tiny house looked EXACTLY like the pictures and the woods were even more stunning in person. They even have a private walking trail, which is nice (though it's made of chunky rocks, not gravel, so bring good shoes). The amenities were great. The only downsides were that they mean it when they say there is a small hot water tank. I only had hot water for about 5 minutes both times I took a shower. The only other thing to warn about (which this is in no way Getaway's fault) is that the property is surrounded by a bunch of private property where people hunt, so you will hear occasional gunshots. Overall however, I had an amazing time and this place was the exact amount of peaceful and loveliness that I needed. Thank you, Getaway."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Small but clean and comfortable
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I really needed the escape. We had a great time unwinding and spending great quality time together. The atmosphere was amazing. We spotted some dear grazing near our cabin. We will definitely be back.
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"It was quiet and peaceful. However, they do charge you for things like tea and coffee."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful cabin for a quick get away!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Getaway cabin was so peaceful. Everything in that tiny cabin was well thought out and intentional

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a good stay at Jay's duplex. This 2-bedroom, 2-bath unit can house a family of four or two couples. It offers comfortable beds, a roomy layout, plus the convenience of an in-unit laundry. Jay is also a thoughtful host: I forgot a sweater as I packed up, and when I reached out later, Jay offered to leave it for me to pick up on our way home. We'd be glad to stay here again when we come back for one of Columbus's interesting architectural tours."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Jay’s was great. Had to reach out because of a change and got a super quick response. House was clean, comfy and well-stocked. BBQ out on the patio was a favorite of everyone. Great area and close to anything you could need."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an excellent first experience with an AirBnB.
Jay was a great host ! with prompt responses and easy to understand, clear answers.
His place was PERFECT for us.
First of all it was very close to where we needed to be (within walking distance).
Secondly it was very comfortable and clean. Making it feel like a home away from home atmosphere.
We are hoping to come again in a few months.
PS: It was wonderful to have things available that we had forgotten ( hand lotion, coffee creamer)
Saving us an early morning run to the store. 😀"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay was extremely short, literally 10 hours. We just needed a place to stay instead on a long, late night/early morning drive home. Jay's place was clean & cozy. We would definitely stay again if we are in the same situation in the future."

The huge sofa is very comfy, the television and air conditioning work well. Everything was clean, and the kitchen is well equipped.
On top of all that, Jay was a very kind host who always replied to our messages in a couple of minutes."

It was very clean, uncluttered and just a really cute place. I actually wish we could have spent more time there but we had to get back on the road. We stay in a lot of rentals and this is definitely on the “would stay here again” list!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Jay was fantastic about communicating with me, allowed an early check in, and had a great spot. I’d highly recommend this place if you’re planning to visit Columbus.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time we have stayed with Shawn in this location. He accommodated my mother and I on short notice and just like last year as soon as we walked into the space we felt at home.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great quiet place and very spacious.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always enjoy staying here. Plenty of space. It's clean and quiet.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We went to Seymour for the eclipse. The town had bands and food trucks on Sunday and that was fun. Coffee, tea and scones across the street at Moxie were yummy, and we loved Taqueria La Mejor for Mexican food, and also great bar service at rails. The place is exactly as pictured, and we liked walking to everything. We did wish there was a screen door to let in some fresh air. If you're a light sleeper, bring some earplugs as the trains pass close by at night. La Michoacana for ice cream is also close by, with some fun flavors you'll not find at a DQ. The people of Seymour did a great job hosting!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved the place and location

He made sure that the place was ready and even double checked that I would have snacks available because I was going to be checking in late. Shawn was very helpful and friendly. The space was very nice and close to things to do and since I was staying for work was very close to hospital. The space was immaculate and nicely stocked with items that you may need. Good parking and felt very safe in the area that the space was located. I really cannot say enough good things about the space or Shawn, was one of my best air bnb stays."

2023-10-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Never staying at an AirBNB... a tad leary. It was a good experience.
I wished it had a washer & dryer for my needs, but I knew it beforehand.
I had never stayed in a loft before. Being a country girl, I do wish I could have opened a window for fresh air. (There was an oscillating fan... that helped with air circulation.) I wished it would have had outdoor space /grill. Again, I knew it didn't beforehand. It just would have made my place perfect! I definitely would stay again... actually, l resereved future time slots!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great loft to stay at when in Seymour!

2023-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I have been traveling to Seymour for a year for my job. Most of the time I was in Seymour more than I was at home so I wanted somewhere to stay that would make me feel like I was at home. I stayed in 2 of his bnbs but this was my favorite. For part of the year I shared it with another traveler. It has a large bathroom with 2 sinks which was great. It has 2 beds, one a bit more firm while the other is softer, but both great. I really appreciated the full kitchen, a girl can only Door Dash so much so it was great to be able to make food. It was very well supplied with anything you could need. Shawn as a host is great! Communicates very quickly and stays on top of getting you clean towels and sheets. He was very considerate of my work schedule ( night shift) and always asked if it would be a good time to bring something. I’m very happy I found this as my home away from home and would definitely stay again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderfully cool space! The loft is HUGE, we had plenty of space to spread out for our wedding weekend. It was also very clean and easy to get to. Shawn was very friendly and very accommodating for some last minute changes we had. Absolutely recommend to anyone needing a place to stay in Seymour to stay here!"
2022-08-01,4,Stayed over a week,"This space was perfect for an extended stay. I stayed here for 10 weeks and I had almost everything I needed between towels, sheets, and kitchen utensils. My only issue was the kitchen sink sprayer hose didn’t work and the faucet water spewed when you used full pressure. Shawn was very communicative and frequently checked in to see if I needed sheets and towels and general cleaning. It was a bit pricey, even with the extended-stay discount. Other than that, I had no issues. I would recommend this loft to anyone who would want to visit, whether it be a quick weekend trip or a long-term stay."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very roomy! Huge bathroom (way more convenient than a standard hotel bathroom and hot water. AC works wonderfully for these humid hot days. Very convenient location. Very private area and host quickly responded to any concerns. The only thing bad is the steps but like everyone needs a good vacation work out right? Jk jk would definitely recommend and stay here when we visit again.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Shawn is a great host, and the space is a tremendous value. Definitely recommend!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice, modern BNB with an extremely comfortable king sized bed. It's located in the heart of downtown Seymour with several restaurants in the immediate area. Schneck hospital is only one block away if your visiting a patient."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Just as Shawn and others have described. Right downtown, lots of floor space, easy check-in … and nice hot water in the shower."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loft has a very open setting. There is plenty of room. Clean. Downtown Seymour so it’s conveniently located for anything you need in town. Large bathroom. Overall a great value for the money. Would definitely rent again.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean place with great location!! Very large space inside👍
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"A cool space right downtown. Walkable to a few local restaurants, and just 10 minutes away from Muscatatuck refuge. No neighbors to disturb since it's the entire 2nd floor of a standalone building, with a business on the 1st floor. Comfy bed options, lots of space, and snacks from Shawn were a nice touch! It's a shame we only spent any time in it for part of a single evening."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,this is a very nice place to stay if your visiting Seymore definitely recommend staying
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,If ever looking for a place to stay in Seymour this is your place. Shawn is a great host
2022-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Always a wonderful and responsive host! Thank you, Shawn!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such an unique experience! The place was charming and adorable! Everything was clean. The water pressure/heat was good, plenty of space throughout for three women getting ready for a conference. The beds were a nice surprise. Queen memory foam/therapeutic feel. The beds are med firm with soft feel on top, but no sinking whatsoever. ❤️ Snacks, coffee and water available. Bathroom amenities if needed. The temp was set just right, no adjustment needed and usually one of us is cold while the other is more hot-natured.
The windows in the place allow for natural light in the morning. I am one who likes the room pitch black, and forgot to bring my sleeping mask :/ However, the sunrise and the natural light made everything feel cozy, bright and happy. :) I don’t get to see it often, so it didn’t bother me for one night.
We would love to stay again next year during our conference if there is availability. Host was fast in responding and available for anything we needed or questions we had. Area was safe, and quiet. Plus there is a diner across the street that smelled wonderful when you were outside :)
Def a 5-star experience!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,The owner has been extremely helpful! 2 of us rented the loft while we work a contract at the hospital. The hospital is walking distance from loft and very convenient. Our stay has been very comfortable!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome stay!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It's as promoted and reviewed by others. A great location with acres of space in the loft! We've already booked Shawn's place for our next trip to Seymour.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Another great stay! Already booked for our next trip, we are so happy to have found this gem!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is our second time staying here and both times have been great. It's a big open space, nice little kitchen, good location, and Shawn always makes sure you have all the little essentials you need, as well as little snacks and coffee."

2021-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,Hands down best Air bnb I've stayed in.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This loft apartment is as spacious as advertised and was thoroughly clean. The bed was so comfortable that my wife now thinks we need to buy a similar mattress for our bed at home. Shawn communicated well and let us know that we could contact him for any needs during our stay.
We used the apartment as a jumping-off point for a weekend getaway at Nashville and Brown County State Park during autumn leaf season. It's a great value for visitors who don't mind a 40 minute drive to Nashville."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Shawn’s place was clean and spacious. It was a great place to stay. I would recommend.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very spacious and clean! This space was perfect for our family in a very convenient location. We will definitely be returning when we are in town visiting family.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is awesome! Yes, it's just one room, but it's huge. Living room is separated from beds with a closet, the bathroom is humongous, big long vanity/and double sink in bathroom was roomy for all your personal items and perfect if you have a couple people traveling together."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Shawn was a great host. The loft is huge, and clean and private. I would gladly stay again!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Very Clean! Shawn made the process really easy.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, comfortable furniture, good condition. Plenty of hot water and towels and a well-stocked kitchen. Being across the street from Larrison's is definitely a plus. My only criticism, and I am nitpicking here, is that a few of the uprights on the outdoor stair bannister seemed a little loose. The stairs themselves are fairly new and sturdy, as are the rails, but the spindles did give me pause. Regardless, would definitely stay here again."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome stay! Clean, close to some delicious local food, and spacious. Would stay again."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb was absolutely fabulous: Clean, Easy Check-In, Plenty of room, etc. It has a nice large bathroom with double sinks, comfy beds, great kitchen, etc. Close to everything such as good shopping and restaurants.
A long-time friend and I took a Road Trip to see the Mellencamp mural. There is so much more to see and do in town! We took the Mellencamp driving tour. You may purchase a CD at the Visitor's Center, but check the hours before you go. We made it to town and they were to close in the next ten minutes. The young lady on duty waited for us and was so helpful!!!
We visited the music store next to the mural, purchased t-shirts and visited with the owner for quite some time. Everyone we met in Seymour was so helpful and nice!
We ate @ Vat & Barrel, a local brewery, where both owners visited with us and made us feel so welcome. We had an early brunch @ Larrison's Diner and the food was spot-on. If you like pizza, Seymour Brewing/Pizza Co. was excellent and we highly recommend for a late lunch or dinner.
We highly recommend this property and a visit to Seymour, IN! We had such a great stay!!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing deal, clean, spacious and right in the middle of downtown. This is a great deal."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay! It’s walkable distance to restaurants and cute little boutiques. We were attending a wedding at The Barn in North Vernon and this was about 15-20 min away. It’s very large a spacious and the king bed was SO comfy! Thanks Shawn!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I couldn't believe my eyes the first time I opened the door -- pics do not do it justice! Beautiful, spacious, convenient lodging! Lots of space to spread out in -- would be a great place to work from if I had to combine work with a trip to see family and friends! Would happily stay here again!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great place to stay in the heart of downtown Seymour, IN. Walking distance to just about every bar/restaurant in town. Very clean, spacious, and quiet. Definitely a value with a great host who is nearby if you ever need anything and communicates great!"

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you again for your awesome hospitality - this weekend was such a blast hanging with friends in Seymour and being right in the middle of town (great location BTW) and just having a beautiful and very large apartment to ourselves was the icing on the cake!
For the most part we were able to walk anywhere from the apt and when we wanted to just hang at the apt it was so nice to sit and watch a bit of Netflix...truly felt like home.
We are hoping to make it back in town sometime...we are definitely looking up Shawn once again.
Thank you!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This space was great! Beds were super comfy and it’s conveniently located. I would definitely stay again!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Roomy, quiet & convenient. The beds were super comfortable, and h u g e. We really enjoyed the record player & record collection, plus the Roku tv came in handy for my son to watch YouTube videos 😄. We didn't use the kitchen at all, but it was well equipped for cooking meals. The bathroom was ginormous and clean with much nicer towels than a typical hotel would have. Having the entire building to ourselves was nice, especially during these difficult times. I definitely recommend."

Mattresses, shower, and kitchen and living spaces were all incredible- we were very comfortable relaxing here in the evenings and greatly enjoyed our stay. Very spacious with delightful hospitable touches, like granola bars, coffee, and local information. The loft is well within walking distance of several great restaurants. Shawn was an amazing host and made sure that we had an enjoyable experience. Would definitely recommend!"
2020-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"If you have never stayed in a loft space, do give the “Downtown Seymour Loft” a try . And the fact that this space is right in the middle of a small, quintessential, historic Midwestern town instead of New York City makes it all the more amazing. You will have the space of at least four hotel rooms. Great beds, too!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The roomiest Air Bnb I have stayed in. The beds were super comfy and the location was so convenient to walk to restaurants and shops. I will definitely be back to explore more of Southern Indiana. Shawn was a great host that provided all we needed.

2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Shawn was an awesome communicator leading up to the stay and is so nice! He went above and beyond with recommendations once we shared that we were exploring the craft beer scene in his area. His place was also very welcoming complete with some breakfast snacks and coffee, records, and card decks to play. The beds were also super comfortable! 5 outta 5!"

This hidden gem is just lovely, and super convenient to everything.
Shawn was an attentive and communicative host; the space was super clean, and there were so many thoughtful extras: books and magazines ... bottled water, K-cups/creamer, snacks ... tons of fluffy towels and nicer-than-hotel-grade toiletries ... and the record player (my favorite part)!
Very highly recommended!"
2020-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great spot!
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The loft had the perfect accommodations for our group! The kitchen was well stocked and we appreciated the coffee & snacks left out.

And for breakfast we went to the place across the street which was great."
2019-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a wonderful place to stay in Seymour! Shawn was very nice, arranging the check in and out was easy. The place was very clean and comfortable! Having a kitchen, some extra space, and the other amenities helped a ton due to traveling with an infant. It is an excellent location to walk to dinner and breakfast. We really enjoyed putting a few albums on and unwinding from the long drive. The view of the park across the street was very pretty lit up for the holidays. Wish we could have stayed longer. We will definitely stay here again!"

The house was clean and comfortable. Bobbi added a lot of extra details from the popcorn machine, to the bird feeders, the lights, and all the cool little treasures you'll find along the way.
We'd love to come back."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Bobbi and Jeff place is amazing they made it so personable for our stay and had so many treats and goodies for the kids. All the amenities the kids and everyone loved.

My kids loved it!
Parents/Adults are also very happy with the bonfire, hot tub and well supplied kitchen!
Thank you for the thoughtful details. We will definitely recommend this getaway to friends."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Easiest five star ever! I cannot believe the experience we had at Bobbi’s place! Do your self a favor and just go here, you will never experience such hosting as you get with Bobbi and I know because I’ve been to a dozen air bnbs and have never come close to this type of treatment! The hosting alone was worth the trip but omg the place is beautiful to boot! Breathtaking views and so much to do, the place just felt like home!"

Thanks for sharing your great place!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is what I wish all Airbnb's felt like! It had the right touch of character while still feeling like a boutique unique hotel.

I can not wait to come back!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed at Austin and Kristy's cabin for our anniversary, and thoroughly enjoyed our time there! The cabin is charming and cozy, and everything was exactly as described. It is closer to the road than we expected, but the traffic was minimal. Austin came to meet us when we arrived and both he and Kristy responded super fast to any needs or questions we had! It was a relaxing place to come back to after a day of hiking in Clifty Falls State park. We really appreciated all the kitchen amenities, and the corn hole game on the porch livened up a rainy day! We would definitely come back again 😊"

Comfy couch, lots of kitchen amenities and lovely property - if only we had stayed here in a slightly warmer month so we could have made good use of the front porch and grill, it would have been perfect (not the property's fault of course). Will be back if we're in the area again!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The cabin was wonderful! It brings about the sense of peace that you'd want from staying in a cabin and it is just a short, and beautiful, 15 minute drive to many of the attractions the area has to offer.
The cabin has WiFi to support texting, calling, and streaming after a long day of activities. A wrap around porch, an outdoor grill, cornhole boards, and cows can also bring you entertainment throughout your stay.
Austin and Kristy nailed it with this cabin; you won't be disappointed if you book your stay here!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice cabin and only a short drive to Madison or Clifty Falls State Park. Very peaceful and perfect for our party of three.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin is a amazing place to stay! And the creek/river so close was a added bonus that really makes this place stand out.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,The cabin was great. We enjoyed being out of town but close enough to get to town in about 15 minutes for the Madison Ribberfest. Communication was good. Overall the cabin was very clean. We are “country folk” so we liked the rooster crowing in the morning & cows grazing in the backyard. The porch is GREAT! We will stay here again.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,I would give more stars if I could! The air b&b looked exactly like the photos and was definitely the cleanest b&b I’ve ever stayed in.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice cabin! Had a great time Madison out the shops and wineries!
2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay overall. However will cite these conditions that would have improved our stay. The cabin is not accessible for mobility challenged. Wood and stone steps with no rail.
I would have appreciated knowing before booking. A paved walkway to side of cabin would have been great help. A back step would be a great addition to your cabin. The rains made the getting from car to steps difficult to avoid the mud. We found large bugs in cabin each night of our stay. Not flying bugs but crawling type. Gaps between walls and flooring likely contributed to this problem."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super cute cabin! It wasn't as secluded as I imagined from the description but still off the road and very quiet! Everything was clean when we arrived and having the toiletries was so nice!
We enjoyed sitting out in the porch after a long day of hiking Clifty Falls! Highly recommend staying here!"

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Terrific experience at Stoney Creek Cabin: beautiful setting, sparkling clean and can’t beat the location. We took a few field trips (Clifty Falls, Switzerland County & historic downtown Madison) and didn’t even have the chance to take advantage of the property’s full amenities (corn hole and fire pit with wood included!). Gas grill was top notch too. We made warm memories just kicking back on the wrap around porch. Kind thanks for your hospitality, Kristy & Austin! Hope to visit again!"

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Incredible stay! The hosts were prompt in responding. The amenities are always a welcome perk to an Airbnb and this place was fully stocked. A little low on K-Cups but they were available- although I hadn’t been expecting them. I stayed there with my two brothers and slept on the couch and it was very comfortable. The water tastes good- for travelers wondering about water quality. Overall, the place was as described and perfect for a relaxing getaway."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,A beautiful cabin with lots to do. Super cozy and welcoming. Amazing hosts and memorable vacation. Close to town but secluded. Will absolutely be back!!!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Worked out great, comfy and cozy cabin in a great location, one of my favorite airbnb stays."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fantastic! What a wonderful trip. Take advantage of this cabin. Great location, super clean and totally awesome! Thanks to Kristy and Austin!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kristy and Austin’s place was a great place for a short family getaway! They were so hospitable and went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed for a few days of fun! We will be back :)
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Gorgeous home like be thrown into simpler time. Feels like you are away from it all but everything is close. Kristy is very communicative.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"The visual aesthetics alone make their place worth booking. Property is gorgeous and the newly built cabin is decorated beautifully. It was only two of us but the cabin can perfectly accommodate 4. We arrived at night so we weren’t aware of the creek until we heard it while sitting on the porch the next morning. It is on the other side of the barn; we encourage you to walk to property. Kristy and Austin checked in intermittently to make sure all was well, which was appreciated. Just a few minutes drive outside of downtown, which was pretty in itself. One of my favorite touches was the guest book, where past guests have noted where they came from and info about their stay in the air bnb. PS- hot tub in the works! Can’t wait to be back."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was just perfect. The location and proximity to town were great. The cabin was clean & cozy. Beds and pillows were super comfortable. Kristy & Austin are quick communicators and very accommodating. This is a hidden gem and I would highly recommend!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful new log house close to Historic Madison. The location provided a nice blend of being close to downtown Madison (and even closer to the hilltop business district) yet out in the country, away from it all. Kristy and Austin were great hosts. One thing to be aware of -- the two-lane road to get to the house is twisty with some sharp turns. So drive carefully!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,The cabin was splendid.....my wife thought of just staying permanently it felt so much like home.....Kristy and Austin were excellent to work with.....we enjoyed driving through backroads of Switzerland County and shopping in Madison....plus lots of coffee shops and the beautiful Ohio River
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Let’s start by saying I booked last minute and they was able to accommodate for me and my family. Their communication was everything and their cabin was absolutely beautiful and we was so comfortable and it was a much needed getaway and I highly recommend others staying there even if it’s to just get away from the everyday city life!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kristy and Austin have built a beautiful cabin. It's perfect for a weekend getaway. It has all the amenities and then some. It's a nice secluded location and still close to anything you'll need. We definitely plan on being back!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,The cabin was beautiful. The porch wrapped all the way around the cabin. It was definitely a good place to stay
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Can't say enough good things about the cabin, the owners and the fun things to do in Madison. We chose this location as a place to meet our daughter who lives in Upstate NY. With us coming from the TX panhandle, Madison was a 14 hr drive for us and a 10 hr drive for her. But we'd love to go back for the beauty, the attractions and the comfortable accomodation. Enjoyed antique shopping, touring the Lanier Mansion, Clifty State Park, Versailles State Park, and lots of game playing and homecooked meals in the cabin. Thank you Austin and Kristi! You have a true jewel in this cabin and your homestead!!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to get-away. Wish it had more hiking areas but the place is in great condition.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect cabin! Very nice and clean! 10/10
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Unbelievablygreat place to stay; quiet and remote yet just a few minutes from town.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Remote, but only a few minutes from town, this place is a hidden gem that I woukd recommend to anyone. You will not be disappointed."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Green Haven was meticulously decorated, comfortable, and welcoming! Darci was proactive in all the small details from the amenities to communicating entry into the home. The beds were comfortable, the shower was luxurious, and the atmosphere felt easily like a big city apartment."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Green Haven was a wonderful place to spend a weekend with the girls. No detail has gone overlooked. Darci has beautiful taste and all the small touches made it perfect. We enjoyed the outdoor patio. The beds were super comfy. Rain shower was amazing. Walking distance to good restaurants and some cute shops. Highly recommend!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Darci was awesome, helped with everything and left plenty of snacks! The kitchen is great with all the basic spices you would need to cook yourself. It’s brand new and smells like a new car.
Beds are super comfortable. Shower is amazing."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Darci's spacious apartment. We felt so at home while staying for a family gathering. Every room was sparkling clean, beautifully designed and thoughtfully decorated. We enjoyed the space and fun personal touches. We were able to cook, relax and enjoy our visit. Having traveled to many vacation homes I have to say this is one of the best! Communication and check-in was excellent as well. I look forward to visiting Darci's place again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing space in a great location—perfect spot for a fun Seymour stay!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Green Haven is such a great find! We were so impressed with the space in every way - it’s super cozy, beds are so comfy, the kitchen is incredibly well stocked with dishes and pots, the coffee bar is stellar, the desk area was great for one of us to catch up on work. There are tvs and games and great spaces for hanging out. The bathrooms felt spa like - even the towels were amazing! When we come to the area to visit family we will definitely choose Green Haven again. Darci is such a kind and friendly host with an incredible gift of design and hospitality!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything About The Green Haven Was Beautiful & Perfect! Everything Was Very Clean & Beautiful Just Like In The Pictures, also we were like an hour early and we were still able to check in earlier , but The Whole Place Was Fully Stocked Up Especially The Coffee Bar 😊 Also Thank you for The Pack n Play , if we ever go again We will Definitely Book Again ! Thank You !"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Green Haven was perfect! Darci is easy to communicate with and thought about everything that may be needed during our stay. We would love to stay here again when visiting family in Seymour!
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"This was my first time trying an AirBnB, and it was a fantastic experience! It was easy to find, and Darci was very helpful and attentive as a host. The house itself was so very charming, with unique details in every space."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I were in the Seymour area to visit nearby wineries. The trip was spontaneous and we did not make reservations prior to leaving home. We found out about Green Haven from a couple at one of the wineries and once we contacted Darci, everything went smoothly and we were able to get in right away. The place was fabulous! I don’t think Darci forgot one detail! Amenities and supplies were above and beyond what I have found at other places we have stayed. Decor was outstanding and it was very clean! We will recommend to our friends and family, if they need a place to stay in Seymour."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My parents stayed at The Green Haven while they were visiting us for Christmas. Here is what my mom wrote about Darci’s incredible Airbnb:
As soon as we entered greenhaven airbnb is was a magical place to be. Your attention to detail was spectacular in every room we entered. Thank you so much for making our holiday so special. You thought of everything and made us feel so welcome. We didn’t want to leave and we are so thankful for making our Christmas 2023 stay such a dream. We would love to come every year for Christmas. We would love to continue this tradition every year. Darci, your place is beautiful ❤️"
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"Loved it, super clean, host was very nice"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful place
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Green Haven was such a neat place to stay! We loved the modern decor, open space and balcony to enjoy our coffee. Best Airbnb I’ve stayed in and basically ever looked into staying. Will definitely stay again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The thought and love that has gone into Darci’s place is obvious from the moment we entered. It’s comfortable, beautiful, and immaculate. (Not to mention fun - our teens and tween loved everything from the coffee bar to the spiral stairs)! We came into town after dark, and as we parked on the street below, the lights in the apartment above were shining warmly and a Christmas tree was lit in the window. Everything about our experience communicated welcome.
Check in/out was simple, we felt safe and secure, and our only regret was that we were just there overnight. We would have loved to have had time to explore downtown and relax longer in this lovely space. As book lovers with a couple gluten free members, we were thrilled to see a bookstore with a gluten free cafe right across the street. Alas, both businesses are closed on Sundays, so we missed out on that, but we hope to be back to stay longer when we are traveling through again. Darci is friendly, accommodating, and responsive."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything was absolutely perfect!! Darci has thought of everything to make your stay enjoyable. We will definitely stay here again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed here for a weekend, and we loved the stay! It was super clean and inviting. The host thought of everything, from snacks to bathroom essentials. She was also very responsive when we had questions."
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,I highly recommend this place! I booked this for some friends and they just loved it. I will definitely recommend again and again!!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best air bnbs I’ve ever stayed at, hands down. Not only is Darci’s place trendy and beautiful (love all the plants and decor and the finishes) it is also amazingly welcoming and comfortable. I appreciate all the little details included - the toiletries for the “oops I forgot to pack that” instances, snacks in the kitchen, and that fully stocked coffee bar. Darci was responsive to my messages both before my trip and throughout my stay, giving me recommendations fitting to my interests. She’s an incredible host.
Darci’s place is a gem and was perfect for my long weekend trip to Seymour. I will definitely be staying here again. I couldn’t imagine staying any place better!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I have stayed and multiple Air BNB this was TOP 2 of all time!!
We Love the decor ❤ Thanks to the host very friendly"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Darci was a very nice and helpful host. Instructions were clear and easy to follow. The place was convenient. It was new and very nice. All of the furnishings were top of the line. We had everything we could have possibly needed.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Darci was beyond accommodating and kind, it felt like communicating with a friend! She is beyond considerate and helpful. The home is full of character, charm, and modern amenities, the ad is great but doesn't do this home justice! I think Darci thought of everything and this was by far the simplest checkout I've ever experienced at an AirBnb. If I'm ever needing to visit this area again, I would most definitely return, thank you for an incredible stay, Darci !"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here during the local Oktoberfest so the location was amazing. We were right in the action. When we didn't want to be in the action it was a quiet reprieve. We could people watch out the front, sit on the patio and listen to music, or watch TV and relax. Even if the festivities weren't going on there are many downtown spots to eat and a little park to go to within walking distance. I didn't want to leave!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I cannot say enough about how amazing this place is and how great the host was. So much thought was put into the design, and it was by far the best place we have ever stayed. The location is perfect, as there are so many shops downtown to walk through. Even if you don’t leave, there’s plenty to do here (you’ll want to call dibs on the couch)! We loved that there were games, a coffee bar, and the balcony/patio was so cozy!! We never even turned on the TV’s. Even if you don’t need a shower, take one anyway…that master bath is to die for! We are already planning our next stay! Darci, thank you for such an incredible experience! You are THEE BEST!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you are spending the weekend in Seymour, IN this is the place! Perfect for couples or families!! A little piece of “urban vibe”in Small Town USA!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Immaculate and gorgeous space! Darci was so nice and helpful, the apartment was beautiful, spotless, and was stocked for just about anything we could’ve needed! Can’t wait to stay again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Unwind Haven is exactly that, a perfect getaway to relax and just take in the peacefulness that surrounds the house. Plenty of space to relax whether at the fire pit or comfortably on the deck drinking coffee. Inside was beautiful, spacious and comfortable just like being in your own home, a very welcoming environment. Plenty of amenities to make your stay easy and stress free. My group was so comfortable relaxing and just seeing local sites that we wish we would have stayed longer. Barn cats were a plus and also very welcoming 🥰. We enjoyed every second and would definitely go back."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,So peaceful and beautifully decorated home. I stayed for 3 days and it was amazing. Lots of close by stores and all around convenient
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,Great place for our small group for the weekend
2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,It was a very unique place. Lugging a suitcase up the stairs was a little difficult. Had to find where light switches and outlets were. Mostly we were comfortable watching a movie and going to bed. Worked just fine for that!!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a comfortable, peaceful, and enjoyable stay. Melinda was an excellent host. We would definitely stay here again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Melinda’s place is a piece of HEAVEN!!! We have traveled a lot and stayed in a lot of Airbnb’s and Melinda’s has been one of our favorites. Super clean, different and peaceful.
The setting is beautiful. Super clean. Peaceful. Close to little nice towns to explore and enjoy nature.
We went there to see the eclipse, drove to Greensburg and spent the day.
Next day we explored different covered bridges around the area, went to Versailles Park for some hiking and went to Madison to eat and shop before heading to the airport.
PERFECT! PERFECT! PERFECT!!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I appreciated that the price was affordable despite the eclipse, we were in a unique space with everything we needed to cook. Quick response by text, got to see her artwork and meet some family. A great spot!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Had a great stay here as a stopover on a trip. The home is very comfortable and dog friendly. Beds are comfortable. It’s located not far from Madison which has awesome antique shopping and a great breakfast place- The Crêperie. Definitely recommend staying here!
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,Very comfortable and spacious for us 5 adults that were in town for the weekend.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Everything was so pretty and cozy. Melinda came right over when we had an issue with the heating unit at 10:00 Friday night. She was so friendly and helpful.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was a lovely and peaceful place to spend NYE!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was very easy to find. The rooms were spacious and the kitchen had full sized appliances which allowed to cook meals and snacks. Our host was very nice and responsive to questions.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice accommodations. The workmanship in this house is amazing. Melinda is a wonderful friendly person. Great stay.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The barn was clean and nicely decorated. The location in the middle of farm land would have been very quiet except for a dog on the premises that barked and whined from almost sun up to sun down. At least one small box of tissues would have been nice. Not sure where the strong smell of moth balls was coming from inside and not sure the reason. Overall would stay there again when in the area.
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"This was a great place to stay for our family reunion at Versailles State park. It was close enough that a quick run back was not a burden. Even though we didn’t camp with other family members this place allowed us comfort, close proximity, air conditioning, and private shower for the extended Holiday weekend— all while feeling like we were a part of the camping group. Everything was as expected and the stay was nice."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is just cool to look at . Everything was awesome . Great host and a nice place to stay .
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thia is an Awesome place . It's peaceful and quiet . Very comfortable awesome host . I like it so much I'mcoming back next week.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place. Perfect for our needs. Melinda was very responsive. Enjoyed our stay and will return the next time we’re in the area.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Melinda is about as nice a host as we’ve ever had. She went out of her way to make our stay as good as it could be.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,great place
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Melinda was an awesome communicator! Answered my questions and concerns quickly. You could smell the clean when you walked in. Definitely will be staying here again. It’s like a home away from home.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My brothers and I had a wonderful stay. The place was very quiet, relaxing and just perfect as a base for our motorcycle excursions. The front porch was great, as well as the kitchen. All of the furniture and sleeping accommodations were very comfortable. Melinda was super nice and helpful."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A cozy stay!
I only needed a place to sleep, but the cabin provided everything comfortably.
Getting there was fine and entering the barn was just as noted, no difficulties.
Kitchen was well stocked, including spices and various condiments, so you could cook whatever you needed.
The yard and outdoor spaces were lovely.
I felt safe and comfortable and would stay there again.
Thank you!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"five stars is not enough for the value of this place! this place is so homey and peaceful! it was a great little getaway for our family. we enjoyed the state park, canoeing, site seeing and swimming. there was a great little family restaurant we went to while there. overall she was great if you needed. anything and the place was very clean!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"It was perfect for 8 of us.
Host was friendly and accommodating"
2023-06-01,4,Group trip,"We stayed over a week.
Positives:
The place was beautiful
There was a fire pit that gave us opportunity to spend time outside.
We could bring 1 of our dogs
The outside porch had a Locked gate
There were plenty of pillows and blankets
There were starter items available such as trash bags, laundry detergent, and dishwashing detergent
Cooking ware was amazing and not perfect
There was a grill that we were able to use
The location was very close to the state park and amazing flea market
Opportunities for improvement:
Noisy at times due to nearby highway - More trees would help w/ sound and did not negatively impact stay.
We brought our dog because site said pet friendly. Unfortunately, a pet charge didn’t populate on the site when booking so did not know until arrival that bringing him required a charge. - but the charge was only $50 and issue was resolved quickly.
Overall - it was beautiful and amazing. Would definitely stay again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very comfortable and family friendly place. The linens and home are clean. It has a great open family/dining/kitchen area for eating together and lots of room to play games, visit, or watch a movie. Nice reading lamps in family area and private rooms. We look forward to another, longer visit.
This is a nice place to centrally stay between many areas to visit. It's in a great antiquing vicinity ... be sure to check out Madison and Seymour."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Melinda’s place is a gem in the heart of Ripley County, Indiana near Versailles. Check in was smooth. Her place was pristine, spacious, and had numerous amenities. It’s close to so many great local attractions and some great locally owned restaurants. It’s very scenic. You definitely feel as if your home. Melinda was very responsive to any questions we had and is a great host. We definitely will be back again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Barn was spacious and beautiful. The location is just far enough away from town to be peaceful and relaxing but not too far that you can’t get what you need from a store. Loved the location.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cozy cottage stay was very peaceful. It was spacious and had plenty of amenities. I loved having a washer and dryer! It is a short ride to town, stores, and MUTC. The host was super responsive and proactive, which came in handy when one of our group locked us out by accident while leaving for dinner. I would absolutely stay here again!"
2023-05-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"Melinda's place was beautiful and exactly what we expected for the location. It was located very close to the town of Versailles and the State Park, which was perfect for us. The beds were comfy and the kitchen was fully stocked. Unfortunately, there was a dog who was kept in a pen right beside the Airbnb that barked almost constantly. At first, we didn't mind, but then the barking seemed to get worse, and it really put a dent in our peaceful weekend. Our own dog seemed stressed about it and was anxious to leave the property. While the cabin was lovely, and in a good spot for us, we wouldn't choose to stay again."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Very nice. Place was very clean and as promised. Melinda’s communication was great. Would stay again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Clean and quiet. Perfect place fo a few days.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,We really enjoyed our stay at Melinda’s place. Grilling on the deck and listening to all the song birds made for very relaxing evenings. We will definitely book with Melinda again when we are in Indiana!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our visit to the barn! The home has a lot of the starter items you need like flour, sugar, salt, ketchup, etc. The area surrounding the barn was so peaceful. We enjoyed our mornings hiking in the nearby national parks and the evenings by the fire pit and playing in nature on the property. We even made a day trip to nearby Madison. The barn is beautiful and the property has two other historical buildings Melinda is fixing up. We can't wait to come back and see how wonderful it will be!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Ideal setup for traveler with dog. Really clean place and appliances were new or like new.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Melindas place was incredibly peaceful and quite possibly the cleanest accommodations ever. Everything was as described. We had a great stay and so grateful for such a lovely host!
2023-03-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"This is a quaint and comfortable stay. The town of our Versailles is nearby and is beautiful with cute places to stop on the Square. Madison is nearby and is a gorgeous town on the Ohio river.
My single complaint is that the Wi-Fi was down and I was not aware of that prior to coming. I had to use a hotspot to connect to the Internet to work. Unfortunately, cell service is not strong and so I could not maintain web conference calls in the Airbnb and ended up having to sit in my car at the Square where I had better service. It would have been helpful to know of this issue prior to the stay. I brought my puppy with me and did not bring his travel crate, as I was not expecting to be away from him, but did end up having to leave him to do a couple of work calls downtown."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very cozy, comfortable place to stay. Very clean and well maintained."
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great place for a weekend stay
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is a gem! My family and I loved it. Melinda was a wonderful host and left clear instructions, had great communication with us, and was very welcoming. She also left muffins and chocolate for us upon arriving. We were so touched and amazed. The place itself is so cozy and inviting and beautifully decorated. It had all the amenities of home. The cookware was top of the line. We loved cooking dinners and eating at the dining table each night. There were book and games to choose from. The beds were comfortable. The kitchen was well stocked. The bedrooms were adorable. It was so nice having a washer and dryer also to use. This place felt so welcoming and cozy. If you find yourself traveling in this area, give yourself a treat and stay here. You will feel right at home!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I loved all the little touches this place had to make you comfortable. The bedrooms were a great way to be together and have some space to ourselves ! I had a fresh blueberry muffin each morning left by the host ..yum! The shower with amazing water pressure and the tub with robes in the closet were the best way to relax! Would Definitely Recommend..Thanks for a great stay Melinda!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to stay
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Staying here was fantastic! Our group had a fun time together and the home was the perfect place to relax. The beds were so comfortable, everyone got an amazing nights sleep which isn’t typical when staying away from home. There was everything we needed, down to shampoo/conditioner and a hair dryer, iron, and laundry. We are so grateful to have had such a homey place to stay over our weekend trip for a wedding! Can’t be compared to a hotel!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,It's one of the best in the area. Extremely clean
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Great place! We hope to stay again soon.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was perfect for our family visit because of the location. This Airbnb had everything we needed. Very clean. Loved the patio area and wished we would have had time to use it. Would stay again for sure!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of my absolute favorite places to stay. Have been staying here for several years and always come back. Fantastic layout, great hosts, quiet, easy, and tons of kind and caring touches make it really enjoyable"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tranquil Terrace was the perfect house for our family get together. The house has a nice layout with plenty of sleeping options, to include air mattresses and toddler mattress. The house has everything you need, and the hosts left hand soap, shampoo, conditioner and body soap in both bathrooms—which rarely do we find in other rentals homes. They also had a first aid kit with band aids (which we needed to use). Also, the kitchen is well equipped to include spices and condiments. We ordered Walmart grocery delivery and had a BBQ one night and then cooked a Sunday brunch. They even had an indoor griddle that we used for pancakes! The most important part of the amenities was the basket of toddler toys that was a game changer for our 2 year old granddaughter. Plus books and games that all of us played every day and evening—unplugged family time! We also used the outdoor fire place which is beautiful. Hands down, the BEST rental we’ve had thru Airbnb! Thank you!"

Then have a fire in the outside fireplace after dinner and keep on talking!!! It had everything we needed and we especially liked the sleep number bed which we have at home.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Some girlfriends and I had a short weekend getaway and this home was a nice respite to return to. Close to the outlet mall and Nashville, IN which were places we visited. Michael’s instructions about getting into the home was clear and the process was flawless. There was a manual with helpful information as well and Michael was proactive with giving contact information if we had any issues (which we didn’t). The home was comfortable and had everything we needed. One of us drank coffee and she appreciated the kurig with pods (although she brought her own). The bedrooms allowed us each to have our own space. There was complete privacy in the back and having the sun stream in through the kitchen and living room was cozy on a chilly day. The property sits close to an air field but the small plane traffic was not bothersome. The guests in the front bedrooms had to contend with some street traffic but they were able to fall asleep quickly enough after a full day of excursions. Great stay"

I got in there a couple of times! The beds were super comfy and each bedroom has the cutest USB charging cube! Don't skip this home and its great host and hostess!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very lovely home!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Michael’s place was absolutely home away from home!! Our party consisted of 6 adults and a 4 year old. There was something for everyone. My husband enjoyed using the grill (and we enjoyed that he did too). The master bath was lovely. The open kitchen-dining-living area allowed us to share conversation easily. All of the beds provided a great night’s sleep. The upstairs bonus room was our granddaughter’s favorite place to be! She expended much time and energy going up and down the stairs and was delighted to do so!!
The many things that you take for granted at home were there, which also made it especially comfy and welcoming. There were plenty of linens and pillows. We used the sewing kit and the hot water bottle. The crock pot was a welcome sight. There was also that one drawer in the kitchen with a tape measure, matches, scissors, pencil sharpener and other odds and ends. (We used that too!!)
We will definitely look for Michael’s place in the future!!"

The upstairs playroom was very convenient as it allowed the early risers to keep her occupied without disturbing those who wanted a little more sleep time.
The provided supplies in the large, well stocked kitchen were much appreciated and utilized.
Our host was great at communicating throughout the process and provided us with timely updates and responses to our questions leading up to an easy check-in.

Our 3 kids wanted to move in forever! Beds were comfy and we loved the extra blankets, great heating and cooling. Plenty of room for having a couple of family guests over for dinner.

We mostly ate out, but i noticed the kitchen was well equipped and had everything needed to prepare a meal.
Only negative. The third bedroom had a daybed/trundle bed setup. Great for kids, but our group was middle to old age. Not very comfortable. I think two twin beds would have worked so well for our group.
We were aware of this set up going in to our weekend, but all other aspects of the house were perfect, so we made do."

Also loved the kid-friendly things -- high chair, potty seat, toys, games, baby gate, etc! Super handy.

The owners respond quickly whenever you communicate with them. The terrace was nice and it would have been fun sitting out there, but it was too hot outside to enjoy it. They even had some toys for our 3 and 1.5 year old to play with. In the future if we're ever in the area and need a place this will be one of the first ones we look for."

We loved making cappuccino/latte coffees every morning and enjoying each other's company in the large, open kitchen/living area space. The beds were SO comfortable. The communication with Michael and his daughter (who helps manage the home) was easy and helpful. This place made us feel right at home.

I absolutely recommend this place, and will be back if/when I need to stay near Columbus again. It was also 8-12 minutes to anything you could want and need - perfect location.

Every room was meticulously prepared, with thoughtful touches like tissue boxes conveniently placed throughout the house, ensuring that our needs were always met. The cleanliness of the house, along with the impeccable condition of the furniture and linens, truly exceeded our expectations.
One of the highlights of our stay was the well-equipped kitchen, which made preparing meals a breeze.
Additionally, having access to the garage was a fantastic convenience, especially when it came to packing and unpacking our belongings. It made the entire process so much smoother and more efficient.
Overall, our experience at Maleha's house was absolutely wonderful. We felt right at home from the moment we arrived, and we can't wait to ret"

They brought in some TV trays for us since I was concerned that the kitchen table wouldn't be large enough for an elaborate game (it was). I had asked if we needed to pick up creamer before arrival since many places provide the powdered stuff. They got us two types of CoffeMate creamer, a fresh bottle of 2% milk, orange juice and even FRESH apple fritters for the morning!
We were thrilled 😄!
The refrigerator was full of yogurts, fresh fruits, assorted canned drinks, and a little alcohol. The array of breakfast and snacks provided was impressive.
The bathroom had extra toothbrushes and toothpaste, soaps, shampoos, wet wipes...pretty much anything you might need.
Being a shutterbug, I decided to take a bunch of photos for them to add to their listing if they want.
We will definitely stay again!"

First stay we've had that provided toothbrush and toothpaste which is amazing because somehow someone always forgets it at home. Osgood is a small quiet town and it was a treat to stay in the town my mother in law was born and raised. We played the games that were provided and if we needed something the dollar store was in walking distance. We will be back, Johnathan had the best response when we asked about bringing our pets. He understood they were family too and now we have a home away from home 😍."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great spot to stay! We really enjoyed our time!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We stayed here for the weekend while we visited with my husband’s family to celebrate Thanksgiving. They live in Milan so Dilsboro was a great location for us. This house was stocked with EVERYTHING. I would describe this air bnb as better stocked with everything we needed better than our own home. XD This is a great place to stay with kids as the home is super kid friendly. There isn’t much for our kids to get into. Some air bnb properties have been stressful to bring our kids to with decor or a layout that tempts the kids into damaging items. They had a cute little table with toys for our kids and even left little dog bowls and food for our pets that we brought with us. We felt completely comfortable here. Our favorite family-friendly property we’ve stay so far. We will be back!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great clean place with everything you need. Host was very responsive and helpful to accommodate. Thanks again!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Jonathan was a great host and we will definitely stay here again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,It’s was a great place.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great host. house was great had everything we couldn't ever need or think of. for sure better then staying in hotel. Jonathan house went extra mile with having shampoos in the shower and other thing you are covered with Incase you forgot something on your trip.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was thee most thoughtfully stocked air bNb I’ve ever been to. Cereal, milk, coffee, toothbrushes still in the packaging in case you forgot yours, great selection of shampoos and soaps, can of cold brew, coke etc. just very considerate!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is the 2nd time Ihave stayed at Jonathan place as I was volunteering for a mountain bike festival at Versailles State Park (hassmerfestival) and the location was very close.
the use if the 2 garage is a big bonus since I could store 4 bicycles and truck inside.
the neighborhood is very quiet and neighbors are respectful.
this is my only choice to stay in this area!
Shopping:
The local meat market Reihls and deli had great ground chuck 80/20 and reasonable price.
Restaurants:
Highly recommend: 1.Crossroads in Versailles and get the tenderloin sandwich. Tenderloin breaded and as big as your head!
2. Wagners in Oldenberg IN. Fried chicken at its best! Fried in cast iron skillets and served family style. Don't expect quick meal as it takes time to get chicken like your grandmother used to make!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,I stayed for a couple of months while my new construction home was being completed. Osgood is a great little community. My dog and I enjoyed the Osgood Trails just a couple miles away and we ventured down to Versailles and Clifty Falls State Parks which are both just beautiful. The house is comfortable and in a nice neighborhood. Jonathan was a great host and I would stay here again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay if you have family around Versailles, Batesville, and Osgood. The yard and quiet road are perfect for pups. The Osgood trails and Versailles State Park are nearby, too. Communication was great! Plentiful amenities and big appreciation for the snacks and continental breakfast items!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We have never been to Osgood, we came for a wedding. Jon responded to my questions immediately when planning my trip. We were absolutely delighted with the house.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jonathan was very helpful and responsive. We were coming in late, and he prepared the futon and air mattress for us. That was one less thing to worry about after a long drive. We were glad there was food for breakfast as well. All in all, it was what I expected, and I was glad we were able to rest before we moved on in our travels."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jonathans place to stay was amazing. It was well kept and he even stocked it with some food for us to eat. He was very easy to work with and responsive to any qyestions we had. Staying there made our trip so much better. Also, he doesnt leave you with a chore list before you leave. Like all Airbnb's should be, he includes the complete cleaning in the price and cleaning fee.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Good house, incredible hospitality. Everything we could have wanted at our fingertips and more. Most generous host I've stayed with."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We stayed at Jonathan's rental house for 2 weeks while we were nearby for work. We had plenty of space to park our vehicle & use of the garage for extra storage. Jonathan had several breakfast & snack options in the kitchen like yogurt, bananas, coffee & creamer & treats. The house is in a small town just north of Versailles State Park. It was easy to drive to local restaurants & small grocery stores. The house was comfortable & had a nice back porch to relax on. When we forgot an item after check out, Jonathan knew exactly where it was & also found a shirt we left & had washed it for us! We were grateful for this rental option near our work & would stay again if in the area."

I really enjoyed my vacation!"

It will be our regular place to stay when visiting!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We are a family of 7 that travel full time for a living. We normally stay in our motorhome but it was in the shop so we gave airbnb a shot. We had a great experience would definitely stay again. Jonathan was friendly and the house had everything we needed!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful historic building and we will book again when we return to Seymour. A few great surprises like the hidden prize (no, I won't give you any clues). I wish that their coffee shop downstairs was in my neighborhood- I would be there every day. I only share the below cautions to prepare you and I encourage you not to let them turn you off. Great place and great people.
A few cautions.
1) Steep stairs, though even my stair-phobic wife made it with no problem.
2) Noisy trains overnight. I find the train noise soothing, but grew up with it. My family members who are less used to it found it bothersome.
3) Heat needs to be up a bit higher to get into the bedrooms. Leave the doors open for the best circulation."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome place! Would recommend to anyone coming to the beautiful scenic Seymour or music city as the locals call it. Super clean place and really neat location. Would stay again!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at this charming vintage spot located within downtown Seymour. And the coffee is great! I'd love to stay there again in the future.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We love the location of this Airbnb!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you find yourself in Seymour, Indiana —check out this little historic gem. Cool old building that has been kept up nicely while maintaining its charm. Clean. Quiet. Good coffee."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment above the coffee shop is great! It retains the character of the old building that it is in, while having modern appliances and all of the modern amenities. It is an AMAZING space! It was way larger than I expected, has good parking and easy access, and is in a great spot in downtown Seymour where it's only 5 minute's walk to a few good restaurants. The coffee shop below is also excellent. I can't recommend it enough!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice combo of trendy and timeless. Loved the small-town vibe of the street and coffee shop. Will be back!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"For those needing/wanting to stay right in town this is great. Walking distance to shops and a few good restaurants and above the coffee shop which has awesome staff and great beverages.
Be warned Seymour has a train track running through the middle of town and the train runs on schedule with horns blaring quite early.
The space Montika has created is beautiful and I enjoyed my restful evenings there. Thanks!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed here several times and always glad that I did
Montica has a beautiful place"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and I stayed here while visiting my brother in Seymour. We loved this space. It’s located right above the movie coffee shop in the heart of downtown Seymour. We loved waking up to the smell of coffee and popping down stairs for a complementary drink! The almond milk lattes are to die for . Montica was super sweet and helpful if we had any questions. We’ll absolutely look to stay here again next time we visit.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We are from Massachusetts. When we journey to the Midwest we are always charmed by the historic small towns and the friendliness of the residents. Seymour, Indiana is no exception.
Montica’s Air BandB is somewhat of a time travel…a late 1800s building, floors and windows that resonate with that era. Stand at the front windows and blur your vision a bit. Just like a movie that floats back in time, you will be transported as you imagine the turn of the century here. Sit in the living area and you are mid century modern. Prepare a meal in the kitchen, you are squarely in 2023.
This was the most spacious two bedroom we have seen in our travels. We will return and always feel at home.
Dint miss this opportunity if you are passing through."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was worth every penny. We felt at home in our own space with all the amenities.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a unique and beautiful apartment. It is very spacious, and well laid out. We were very comfortable and enjoyed hanging out in the main living area. They do have open stairs, but also provided a baby gate. We had our 3 little boys there and did find having our own gate with us as well (the apartment is vintage so the doorways were open to the hallway with the stairs.
It is right above their own coffee shop, and the drinks were great! They were very generous in offering free coffee the next morning. Cute little area, that felt safe, and seems very walkable. Parking was easy."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Montica was such a kind, thoughtful and responsive host!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the location of the apartment; restaurants were on the same block so we didn't have to drive anywhere. The apartment was spacious and nicely decorated. The noise was more of a concern than expected; in addition to the cafe and street noise, there was 4 am train that went by every morning."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"It’s even more beautiful than in the photos! Stayed here with a group of musicians and we had a wonderful experience. It’s private, spacious, and tastefully furnished. I truly hope we get to stay here again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The apartment over a coffee shop was just what we needed for our visit with our family. It was so nice to grab a coffee and some breakfast before going to see family. It is definitely an urban location. We loved the hustle and bustle of the mornings.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the best place to stay in Seymour, hands down! They offer free coffee from their shop downstairs and there’s enough to do around town on a summer Saturday to keep you busy for most of the day that’s within walking distance from the apartment. It was hard to leave this little gem!
They even have a super neat treasure hunt within the apartment when you get there 😉 you don’t want to miss this awesome stay!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect stay for our needs. Very walkable and quiet.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Airbnb above a coffee shop in downtown Seymour (the town where John Mellencamp is from). Parking is at the rear of the building in the back of a little square park between buildings. The little park has flowers and squirrels. You enter directly into the unit, but take a floor of steps to get to the second floor of the building where the rooms are. Note you do have to be able to walk up steps. Not a problem for us, but might be for some people. You then enter a long hallway that leads to the living room/kitchen. Along the hallway are the bathroom (there is only one), a small laundry area with a washer and dryer, and two bedrooms. In the bathroom is a walk in shower with great water pressure. We all absolutely loved the shower. Both bedrooms had beds with foam mattresses. The kitchen is a full kitchen with microwave, refrigerator/freezer, stove, oven, dishwasher. There is a bootlegger hidden panel in the floor of the kitchen/living room where you might find some liquor."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A cozy little space with a large living room and modern kitchen in which you can tell there is a rich history. It was a delightful stay with a warm and friendly greeting at the coffee shop below.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was exactly as described and was super clean! Montica was fantastic: when we first arrived we went to the wrong door (totally our mistake!) and Montica responded immediately to our call and got us right into the building. She also checked in on us while we were there just to make sure everything met our needs.
If you ever need a place to stay in Seymour; this place is perfect."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing place and well decorated. Everything we needed and very comfy. Montica was very kind and we loved her coffee shop!!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Montica's place was so stylish and open. We loved the historic feel with big windows and downtown vibes. The attention to detail and a few extras (snacks and coffee) were really appreciated. Initially, I was a little worried the coffee shop downstairs would be loud in the mornings but we could hardly hear it at all. In fact, the smell of coffee in the morning was wonderful! It was nice to hang out with the locals in the morning downstairs and get the 'inside scoop' on the area."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed at Jennifer’s home several times and always enjoy our stay. Her home is cute, clean, comfortable, close to a park and very convenient when we visit family.

The decor is inviting and my wife loved it from her first step inside. There were cards and board games to keep the kids from being bored as well as the park across the street for them to run.
Jennifer was quick to respond and very friendly. She truly went above and beyond to make our stay feel like a home away."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean, very roomy! Appreciate the extras!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is the second time my family and I have stayed in one of Jennifer's home. She has always been great with communicating and providing local activities and restaurants. Our family wiill continue to book with Jennifer whenever we're in town.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay for a few days while visting friends. Jenffier is very responsive and very helpful. Would definitely book this place again.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Jennifer was a great host and we loved our stay!! Everything was as described and the location was perfect! We stop in and out a lot during baseball season and plan to try and stay again in the future.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"After a 10 hour drive, this place was a much needed treat, we slept wonderfully! Clean, welcoming and comfortable (smooth sheets/comfy mattresses), PLUS it was family friendly with books and games available. Although we did not have children with us, it was a thoughtful provision. Wish we could have stayed longer but we arrived at night and left in the morning, no opportunity to explore. Best wishes to Jennifer -- keep up the great work, you're a fantastic hostess!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place for a small family or group of friends to gather together for a great price
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Needed it for one night and it was perfect. Cleaner than some hotels. Very cute and homey. Will definitely stay again if in the area.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for sharing your beautiful home. Everything was as advertised. We saw some local sites and ate at some great local restaurant, that were recommended. It was great to come back to a cozy home for the night. It was also extremely clean."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was perfect and easy to find. The garage was a huge bonus as it was snowing when we arrived. Kept me from having to clean the car off the next morning. We had to be up early to get back on the road so the garage alone was amazing. The house was super clean and kid friendly which my daughter loved!! If we are ever back in the area we will definitely be staying there again!! Jennifer's communication was impeccable and made the experience stress free. I can't say enough good things about Jennifer and her cozy little airbnb.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great time in the city. We were there for a conference and it was close to everything. Thank you!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was in town for a broomball tournament, and Jennifer's listing was positively perfect for my purposes.

For any folks traveling to the greater Columbus area, can't recommend highly enough!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Jennifer’s home was great! We appreciated how family friendly it was and all the conveniences. We will definitely start again!

The house had everything you would need, amenities, spare toothbrushes, bandaids, water filter, kitchen supplies, games etc. Check in was super easy. The house felt safe and secure and even had a noise maker for when you sleep! Will definitely be staying again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,great location
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"As soon as I walked in, I instantly felt at home"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful home in Columbus. Well-appointed and exceptionally cleaned and maintained. Jennifer's house is an excellent base for a stay in the the City. As an added bonus there's a garage for your car!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great location! Safe and quiet neighborhood while still close to many restaurants and shopping. Nice, comfortable stop on our travels."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer is a truly super host. She’s great at communicating, house is always spotless. She’s very committed to making sure her guests have a great experience. Best air b&b I’ve stayed at."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was a very clean, well-equipped, comfortable stay. Jennifer did an excellent job at communication and helping us to feel welcome."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"While visiting our friend, in columbus indiana, we decided to get an air bnb instead of a hotel. I'm glad we did. This was a really cute/cozy spot. Our host was very responsive, and getting in and out was very smooth and quick. Our stay was quick but very enjoyable and convenient for my wife and I. We highly recommend!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer is very responsive, takes pride in her house and is very dedicated to making sure her guests are comfortable and has a good experience. I stay frequently and it’s always a pleasure."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely love this cozy home and have stayed here several times now. We had a question for the host and she responded quickly. We also asked to extend our stay and received a quick response. We would recommend this place.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jennifer is an excellent host.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place!
2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,The house is rather basic but you get everything you need. You hear car noise in the early morning and the house could smell better but convenient for a short stay.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So clean, so convenient, so thoughtfully appointed! This was an A+ experience. Many rental spaces fail to strike the right balance between being well stocked with amenities and pleasing decorations and having sufficient space for the renters' ""stuff."" A kitchen shouldn't be so crammed with cooking/serving gear that there is no space for a renter's groceries, but neither should the cupboards and fridge be bare of helpful supplies. Jennifer's place was frankly perfect. It was cute, comfortable, and accommodating, offering thoughtful supplies and comforts but still leaving plenty of space to enable us to settle in and feel at home. The lighting was good, the beds and bedding comfy, the electric outlets convenient, the window treatments offering good privacy, and the overall feeling very safe and secure. Big thumbs up! Thank you, Jennifer!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family and I absolutely loved staying here! Plenty of games to play for family game night and toys to keep the kids entertained. It was super easy to check in and check in was also super flexible which allowed my family to check in as soon as we got into town so we didn't have to kill time til check in. Definitely will consider staying with Jennifer again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Jennifer’s place is always in top shape. Clean & comfortable.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The house rental is right across from a nice ball park. On the other side of the park is a paved path for walking and biking.
Jenni is very good with getting back to you about any need or question you may have.
The only thing that could be improved is the living room furniture. It isn’t very comfortable.
The home matches the description and photos."

There was plenty of space for our family to enjoy time together or get some time to themselves. Annette's home is also beautifully decorated, has a great kitchen and the beds were very comfy."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Annette was very friendly and easy to communicate, even in the weeks leading up to our stay. Once we were checked in, she was very easily reachable about any questions we had regarding the cabin or the area. There were even more furnishings and amenities than we realized once we got settled in. The cabin is beautiful down to every small detail and all of the windows as well as the setback into the woods give it a really isolated and relaxing feel to the environment. You feel as though you have the entire area to yourself. The creek directly behind the cabin is such a tranquil addition to the relaxation. Drinking coffee early in the morning on the beautiful balcony while listening to the water flow is an unrivaled experience. We stayed at Annette’s cabin while visiting family, and we will most definitely be looking to reserve it again on our next visit."

Annette was very easy for us to work with and very accomodating. The place had everything our crew of 8 guys needed. The deck was surely a big hit!

Kelly was very nice and easy to get along with. Check-in was very easy, and the home was exactly as she described.
We were a little thrown off by the fact that she actually lives there at first, but I'm really glad we decided to stay. Her home is decorated nicely, and it was so comfortable. Don't pass this one up!"

I would’ve stayed longer if I could but just passing through on a last minute cross country trip. I was traveling with my two dogs. Kelly goes above and beyond! She left treats out for them, a full water bowl, and toys! Her yard was PERFECT! Completely enclosed and private. I love the lights too! We got in at 2am and I didn’t worry about my dogs being wound up from the trip because they were able to run and get all their energy out before we climbed into bed. Room was perfect had everything you need. I think she lives there, but isn’t there when guests stay, and it’s actually nice because there’s a lot of things in the home that make it feel… well like home! I LOVED the decor especially the ones that have sayings from new girl & the office, so cute! Thank you again Kelly for sharing your home, it was perfect!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Poppy House, Kelly’s house, is a special place to stay, specifically because it is Kelly’s house. When you stay in a persons actual home you’ll find it to be more practical and comfortable, as this one is, because someone lives there. All the amenities needed are available. The backyard is lovely in the evening and after dark. If you are in Greensburg and need a home away from home you can find one here. Thanks for sharing!"
