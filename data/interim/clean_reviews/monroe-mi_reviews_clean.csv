2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a actually intended to stay at another airbnb but our reservation was canceled by the host at the last minute. This bungalow is perfect for a couple; it is cozy and pleasant to be in. Whoever decorated did a great job; it has the feel of a well appointed lakeside beach shack even though it is actually a few blocks from the beach and even though there probably isnt a square angle in the old place it feels right. The tub is very comfortable for soaking and the in-house conveniences like the keurig and the inexpensive but nonetheless tasty bottle of wine are great touches. I wouldnt hesitate to stay here again.

I would definitely recommend this place and will stay again!!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a relaxed and peaceful stay at Angela’s guest house on our way to northern Michigan. I would definitely stay here again. It was so peaceful and clean. Small but not crammed. The surroundings are beautiful and I would choose this over a hotel room any day. I also really liked the location. It’s out of town but within 10-15 minutes of many restaurant options and a golf course. Thanks for providing a pleasant place to stay.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The cottage was so nice with an amazing view of the field and birds. Modern decor. Homey. Comfortable. The bed was very soft (foam) and cozy. I would have preferred a harder bed, but it was still comfortable. It had all the kitchen stuff and there was plenty of room for all my belongings to have a home. I stayed for 28 days and I enjoyed having time alone, but if I needed anything, Angela was always accommodating. We had two great face to face chats and she was responsive via text anytime. She’s friendly and has a warm personality. I would definitely return!!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely perfect for a weekend getaway, super cozy and comfortable, extremely clean, very easy to find, it is a little far from any amenities but that’s the point! It’s super quiet and private, will be booking again in the future!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Angela provides a perfect and cozy retreat focused all around hygge (the Danish concept of cosiness, especially as it relates to one's home). She has much pride in her property that shows with the attention to detail. The word ""cleanliness"" does not do this beautiful flat any justice; the place was absolutely spotless and dust-free. She was so friendly (as well as Hank, her dog) and accommodating. The flat is attached to the main house, but you would never know. I felt a great sense of privacy and security while on the property. This place is a 'must' if you want a cozy retreat away from all the hustle and bustle. We only stayed for a weekend to visit family, but we definitely plan to return! Come get in tune with your own hygge! :)"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice small cottage close to the lake. Easy to find, and on a nice quiet street. Yard was very small with no privacy; we didn't sit outside so it didn't affect our weekend. Close to store and nice restaurants in town. Great for a couples getaway or small families.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is such a steal! It’s perfect for 2 people, or a small family. The living room is small but so comfortable. You can see the water from their place, so it’s a short walk to the park/beach area. It was the perfect spot to disconnect for a few days for some QT time. The drive in movies is fun and and only 10 minutes away."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"From check in to check out we had a great experience. Nice place, good location, and friendly and responsive hosts 👍"
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"After staying at a different location last year with this host, our expectations may have been a little high as we had such a wonderful experience then. This particular house did not fit what our family was looking for. There was very minimal outside space. And when we did use it, there are very close neighbors who were constantly watching us. We even garnered a noise complaint when we had 3 people over in addition to our 5 approved guests. We didn’t feel like we could use the fire pit at night as it would upset the backyard neighbor which yard was only separated from ours by a short 4 foot fence. This time of year was horrendous for the mayflies and with the dead fish, we didn’t spend anytime at the beach. The house itself was beautiful and still much better then staying at a hotel. This would be more suitable for an older couple or family who is in bed every night by 10. We are not a rowdy crowd, just wanted to enjoy a fire at night."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Had a great stay. Exactly as described. Would come back again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay just steps from Lake Erie!
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This cottage was pretty cool. There are always pros and cons to renting spaces like these, so we'll start with the pros:
Pros:
Quiet area, cottage was cozy with supplied laundry and dishwashing detergents, hand soaps and toiletries. Kitchen was updated, and the house had a cool patio.
Critiques:
Not much to do in Monroe at all, but that's not Rachel & Jeff's fault. The local beach was dirty and covered with dead fish and an awful smell. A tornado hit a week before, and we were not given notice of its impact until the day of check-in; thankfully the house was spared. Bathroom has visible mold stains on the baseboard. Kitchen is in desperate need of new pots, pans, and cooking utensils - not to mention eating utensils. Apparently it was Mayfly season, so that was a fun obstacle to deal with - again, not Rachel & Jeff's fault, but there was no mentioning of this until day of check-in (I should have done our due-diligence in researching this infestation)."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time at Rachel and Jeff’s cottage. Their communication was great, The house was squeaky clean and everything matched the description. We absolutely loved the 3 minute walk to the beach. It’s a great view. The only downfall was the may flys, but there’s not much you can do in the summer months. We would love to come back!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This little cottge was so cozy and welcoming! Our family enjoyed the short walk to the Erie shoreline as well as the wagon of ready-to-go beach supplies. You can see the lake just down the street. The house was clean, comfortable, and supplied with everything you'd need from shampoo to pancakes. Thanks for a great stop along our way through Michigan!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I love the place. I absolutely will be staying there again. It’s very clean and homey. Wish the backyard had a little bit more privacy, but it was a great stay."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Rachel & Jeff were very responsive and flexible. Unfortunately our original travel plans were derailed with the winter storm that hit the area at Christmas. We were able to adjust our stay easily. The location was perfect for us with the house being a central location (and even down the street) from where several family members live. They included special touches that truly made us feel at home during our stay. We hope to rent from them again soon!

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This cottage is so cute and cozy and exactly as described. We were the first guests to rent this property after it was remodeled. It is beautiful and perfect for our little family. It is fully equipped with everything we needed. We had to contact the host a couple of times while we visited and they got back to us quickly and were very attentive to our needs. We knew we were renting from super hosts so our expectations were high and they did not disappoint! We would highly recommend this place to anyone.
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed one night,The place was nice and I loved where it was located but I found Ticks in my bag after I left the air bnb I have no pets and I’m from the city there’s no possible way I could’ve had them and I know it’s a pet friendly place so might’ve been from a previous pet.

Surrounded by beautiful scenery, the location offered a tranquil atmosphere, perfect for relaxation. The cozy patio was a delightful spot to unwind, and being just a 5-minute walk from the beach added to the convenience. Overall, I highly recommend this Airbnb for its cleanliness, comfort, scenic surroundings, and proximity to the beach. A truly wonderful experience that I would eagerly revisit."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A peaceful night's rest in a welcoming home! Simply perfect.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This spot was an absolute GEM of a find!
This unique home is located within a block and a half or so of the pier, which also had a nice little park and a few little restaurants here and there. All of these were within walking distance.
Reyes allows pets, so we were able to bring our dog, which allowed my husband and I to take a very rare family vacation with all 3 of us :)
Luna Pier is a totally quaint and peaceful town, and this spot was an absolute bargain!
The house was very comfortable and felt like home. Everything was in great condition and very clean - but it's important to note that it wasn't so 'perfect' that I felt uneasy allowing my dog to feel at home too; it was a perfect blend of sterile and clean, while still feeling at ease and like you were in your own home.
We really loved our trip to Luna Pier, and will definitely be back!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Comfy home in a quiet location. New remodeling in the home mixes new conveniences with the beautify of classic construction.

I would highly recommend and would love to stay here again when back in the area."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at the house! We wanted a simple and relaxing atmosphere and that’s exactly what we got.

2024-01-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,It would have been nicer in the summer. The heat wouldn't keep the bathroom warm because no heat vents in the bathroom. so no showers. Have to be careful pitch black out there and flood lights were not working. Someone was suppose to come fix them but didn't and it was very icy out there and couldn't see. I ended up sick left a day early and she was nice enough to refund a day. Definitely summer would have been better to stay at Kaylas place.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Luna Pier! The house was perfect for our couples getaway. It is small but it was clean, super cute and felt cozy, comfortable and safe. It’s located on a small quiet street and has a nice big backyard. The golf cart was the best! We were able to drive it all around town. We drove it to the beach and to the little beach bar. The beach is on the smaller side and it got pretty crowded but there was plenty of room and it was so pretty and a lot of fun! The beach bar, Luna Pier Cafe is right across from the beach and has great food, live music and a fun atmosphere. Everyone was very nice and the host was responsive and friendly.

Bedding and beds were very comfortable and clean and the Wi-Fi worked great. The outdoor space was large to the side of the house; warm and inviting in the back. The community and locals are equally as inviting. We enjoyed the music if a local band playing at a bar/restaurant near the pier. After we checked out, we had a hearty breakfast at Gander’s …another gem in Luna Pier. Thank you for a lovely stay!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Took a quick trip here, and felt right at home. The place was lovely, and I appreciated the smallest of details involved to make it more like home.

If you are looking for a relaxing peaceful trip then this is the place for you.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Kayla's place was the PERFECT home away from home! The house was very clean and cool. when we entered, it was a breath of fresh air! The neighborhood is so peaceful and quiet. Everyone in the area was friendly, and the beach was AMAZING! Taking the golf cart down to the beach was great, plenty of room for my family of four. it's fully stocked with everything you need to cook and grill, which is nice. she has coolers in the garage, which definitely came in handy, and 2 beach bags.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family of 5 spent two nights here while visiting colleges in the Midwest. I liked the look of a “log cabin” after spending a few nights in a city and hoped it would be reasonably close to the water. Wow!!! This place was ON the water. I meant STEPS away. It was peaceful, beautiful, and just what we needed. The moonrise was breathtaking! We are already arranging our summer plans so that we can come back!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a charming quaint cabin! Everything we wanted and more. This is the kind of place you never want to leave. I definitively could see this being a permanent getaway for us. Perfect close to everything, all while feeling private. Quiet friendly neighborhood right on the water. Our host was informative while still giving us our space. We needed nothing while we were there. The kitchen has all the basic essentials so you only need to bring your food. The pool table, checker board, and darts kept us and the kids busy. Even in the cold sitting by the lake, watching the sunrise makes you feel like you're in a storybook. Seriously, leave your electronics at home they are not needed!!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Super cute cottage! Right on the water for beautiful sunsets and scenery. The pool table was super fun with the family. Beds were super comfy and we had plenty of space to spread out.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very cool cabin!
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rachel and Jeff's cabin is beautifully decorated, such attention to detail. It was a joy just to sit and enjoy the surroundings. The furniture was comfortable and cozy and we spent one evening enjoying TV together and chatting. Check in was the best I've ever had with Airbnb; door lock keypad worked easily. Two nice parking spots right in front of the cabin. Kitchen was well stocked, and we enjoyed preparing simple meals and eating them on the enclosed porch looking out over the water. The grill was easy to operate and worked well. It was great fun to have a pool table, darts and checkers; if we had had a rainy day there would have been plenty to do in the cabin. Fire ring outside was stocked with firewood and had 4 chairs in place around it. Rachel and Jeff also did an excellent job of labelling light switches, fan switches, etc.-made it easier to navigate a new environment. Even the drawers were labelled to let you know where extra linens and towels were stored."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We stayed a night at the cabin while visiting the Henry Ford museum and Greenfield village. Cabin was excellent and comfortable and would definitely stay again. Nice view of Lake Erie. Watched a movie after a long day of walking around the museum and it was very relaxing.
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great time at the cabin! Our only “complaint” is there is no insulation so it can get really hot during the heat of day.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved this place!
It’s a great weekend getaway!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot tucked on Erie, beautiful cabin with everything needed!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had such a great stay, our only regret was that we couldn’t stay longer! Even with less than ideal weather, the fireplaces and pool table kept us cozy and entertained! We definitely plan on coming back!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,We stayed here for a two day getaway. It was awesome! We were very happy with our stay. The cabin was a lot bigger then I thought it was going to be which was a bonus!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was super cute. Had all of the amenities you would need. The bed was super comfortable.
The location was easy to find and we grabbed a bite at one of the restaurants nearby.
Definitely get up and catch the sunrise, it was well worth it. Sat outside with a warm cup of coffee. Wish we had stayed longer."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect cozy cabin for two! Felt right at home upon walking in. Super quiet and felt private even though the neighbors are extremely close. The place was clean and stocked with comforts and conveniences, from various snacks in the kitchen, toiletries in the bathroom, cleaning supplies if needed, and blankets so soft I wanted to take them home. Everything is cozy cabin themed, and the view of the lake from the backyard is stunning. And the local restaurants are 10/10!! Would be thrilled to stay here again!
A few minor things to consider for your comfort and convenience:
- There's no traditional coffee maker, only K-cups.
- The toilet paper was very thin; bring your own or mention this upon reserving if you need something more substantial.
- We were gifted a bottle of wine for our romantic getaway. If the presence of alcohol is an issue for you, mention this when reserving."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place overall, certainly enjoyed playing pool. Easy check in and all. Only thing against might just be that there’s not much in walking distance, but the view was great!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Thank you to Rachel and Jeff for an amazing stay. It was very peaceful and exactly what we needed for a getaway. Being very close to the water was very serene and we would love to come back when it’s warmer. It rained a bit while we were there but they had a pool table and darts that kept us occupied. Really great stay!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved the view and to sound of the waves from back deck ! This house was great for our family of 5 ! We really appreciated the fully stocked kitchen for cooking and a grocery store not even ten minute down the road. Will absolutely stay here again if ever in the area in the future.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This cabin was absolutely perfect for our little weekend getaway! The location is gorgeous had everything you needed and then some. Perfect for relaxing and having a little fun on the pool table and darts 🎯
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"5 STARS!!! I fell in LOVE the moment I entered. Booking was a breeze, and communicating with the host was a pleasure. Checkin was very simple using a code provided. The neighborhood is very peaceful. The cabin was spotless. I loved the feel of this cabin. You would think that you are far up North. All the furniture was cozy and comfortable, including the bed! I slept well. This cabin feels spacious. You have several places to sit. I stayed up late playing pool. I love how easy the fireplace is to turn on...it set the mood while watching TV and drinking a glass of wine. The bathroom was neat and clean, and I loved the fact that makeup wipes were provided! The back porch was my favorite hangout spot because you can look out at the beautiful lake while eating or relaxing by the electric fireplace. Everything I needed was provided, such as toiletries and kitchen supplies and even snacks and a gift. I recommend this cabin. I'll be back soon! Thanks again for allowing me to stay!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a very big flood storm on our 2 day there and they checked in with us the entire time and came in person to relieve our anxiety about the storm they even offered us to stay at another one of their properties if we didn’t feel safe staying while it storm I would recommend this place for anyone and everyone who just wants a place to relax and spend time with the people staying with you.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing view of Lake Erie right in the backyard. Pictures don’t do the place justice! The cabin was beautiful and the pool table was a plus.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay was amazing! We had a family issue the morning of our checkout, and wouldn't have been able to check out in time. Jeff & Rachel were so helpful and understanding of our situation and accommodated for us! Amazing service, beautiful place, and responsive owners. 5/5"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I cannot say enough good things about Rachel and Jeff's cabin. It was beautiful, peaceful and just what my family needed to relax. The owners thought of every detail here and it shows. We loved every moment her and will be back again soon for sure. We just wish we would have stayed here longer."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay at Rachel and Jeff’s Airbnb was one of the best I’ve ever experienced! This waterfront cabin was very comfortable, well maintained, clean and provided so many nice touches from the stocked kitchen items/staples/appliances to the fresh and plentiful linens. It really had it all! The view of the lake was spectacular and the neighborhood very peaceful! We really enjoyed the games around the fireplaces in both main gathering rooms. I will definitely be back for another stay! Thank you Rachel and Jeff for being such great hosts!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay and had everything we needed. It's a great place to enjoy a beautiful view of the lake. The back of the house has a cozy space that is great for eating, playing a board game, or simply relaxing while look out at the lake. There is a pool table, a dart board, and conveniently located TVs for watching in the main room or even while resting in bed. The interior is decorated as a rustic log cabin with a canoe theme. This was a comfortable and cozy stay for two in the winter, but we're also looking forward to a reserving a future summer stay with our children to take full advantage of the lake. Rachel and Jeff provided clear instructions and even let us check in a little early. The price was good for all of this too. We highly recommend this place and plan to return in the future."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Rachel and Jeff blew our expectations away immediately when they had prepared a unique gift for us. We had mentioned this was our last getaway before our baby comes and they had bought and left us a gift for the baby. Beyond thoughtful.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice amenities, plenty of the everday stuff. Trash bags, paper towels, tp, etc. First place in a long time where it didnt feel like they were nickle and diming you. Had some issues with checki g in and the Hosts were super responsive and verty helpful. Thanks, we had a great time"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Rachel and Jeff’s place is awesome! Very unique very cool decor. There’s a great view of the water. Very beautiful and serene. Amazing place! We LOVED it here and we will definitely be back!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a lovely time at Parker’s Lakeside Oasis! The yard and surroundings were beautiful to wake up to and so tranquil. Falling asleep and waking up to the sound of the lake is a definite 10/10.
We enjoyed the Luna Pier Cafe, walked the pier/park and found that our two golden doodles were welcomed at most restaurants, and even businesses around town. The golf cart was a fun addition as well.
The property is very clean and updated! Lake houses tend to be old and can be worn by the elements but this space is just as pictured if not BETTER!
Lastly, Parker was a great host and was a FAST and great communicator. Thank you for letting us and our “kids” stay for a lovely Memorial Day weekend :) 🐾🩵🐩"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Parker was great, allowed us to check in early and check out late based on occupancy, this really helped with our flight times. Would definitely recommend staying here, the location was great, loved the local restaurant in Luna Pier, staff were very friendly, and the prices were great! I would say the home had a lot of character; and I like character! it is a perfect little lakeview cottage!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The host was very responsive and offered an early check - in. The place was very family friendly and perfect for what we needed. The views are great, and the house is very cute and well kept. Would love to visit again"
2024-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Parker and Lindsey are very thoughtful hosts. The views from the home are beautiful and we enjoyed our stay.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This Luna Pier property location is absolutely stunning! Its even better than the photos on the listing. We stayed a week at this property and it exceeded our expectations! Parker was an awesome host and quickly responded to every question I had. The kitchen/diner is lovely and he left us wine and there is truly a full coffee bar just like in the photo. The sofa is so comfortable and the beds/pillows/blankets are luxurious! We both slept very well in this house. Its a rather large home and that was really nice too. The neighborhood is lovely with so many birds around. Between the sounds of the birds and the water of the lake it will be tough to find a more relaxing spot to vacation. We ate in most days but also at the restaurants in town and liked them all. There are steep stairs to the 2nd floor however so those with mobility issues should be aware of that. All the bedrooms are on the 2nd floor. I highly recommend this property and host.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family and I has such a good trip to Michigan. I'm very pleased with the Airbnb we chose it made it all the more worth the trip! Such a lovely home and responsive owners! We are already planning another trip and we will be using this place again!

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house in Lina pier was just wonderful. Great location right on the lake. Quiet area right off the highway and close to everything. House was clean, very spacious and felt like home. We had a slight issue Friday but Parker was able to personally come by the house and see that it was fixed in a timely manner. We were so grateful to him. Would recommend this place any time of year even in the middle of winter. Can’t wait to come back next year."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our new favorite home away from home! I cant say enough about this place and the host Parker. We have stayed here twice and it always exceeds our expectations. Always clean and tons of space. Beautiful view. Parker is our favorite host so far (and we've had a lot) always quick to responding to any questions and concerns. Can't wait to go back!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The epsom salts in the bathroom with the deep bath tub were the perfect night time antidote for wet, cold December weather.
The view of a Lake Erie sunrise from the large lake side upstairs bedroom was a nice way to wake up
The open design on the first floor facilitated family gathering in evening"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Parker was a great host, this place was a perfect stay for a wedding in town, and the view was a wonderful touch. We had a great stay!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Parker was great to deal with. The space was calming and peaceful, with a small town vibe perfect for a family, a couple, or a quiet friend getaway. The atmosphere was homey. The space was much bigger than anticipated as a lake owner myself. Nothing but rave reviews from my mom, my sister, my nieces and I. We rode bikes to the lighthouse, drew in the sand on the beach, and explored the small town streets on the golf cart. The sunroom was great for card games and reading. Movie night was especially fun on the big comfy couch in the living room, fitting all five of us comfortably. The beds and pillows were so plush we slept like a log. Thank you for perfect fall getaway on the Great Lakes."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous home with amazing views! Very quiet area to relax. We went there for our anniversary and it was awesome! Couldn't have asked for a better anniversary.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The location is beautiful and the golf cart was great for exploring the immediate area. Luna pier is perfect for a relaxing getaway but also close enough to bigger towns for lots of activity options. We had a great time!
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"We love this house. Our second time staying here, and it was even better than the first trip. Hosts are very responsive, the house is so clean, and location is close to town. We will definitely be back!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our first trip to Luna Pier. The house was perfect for a much needed girls weekend. We loved the fire pit, complimentary bottle of wine, game night, golf cart, and views. Parker responded quickly to questions and made sure we had everything we needed. I highly recommend this serene oasis and am grateful for a wonderful experience."
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Relaxing home, beautiful lake views. Would stay again."

As hosts Parker and Lindsay were amazing! Left us a bottle of wine, had a fully stocked coffee bar, and were super helpful and kind as soon as we booked the Airbnb. If and when we go back to Michigan we would love to stay here again. Thank you so much!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mike and Lindsay’s place was perfect for our weekend getaway. It was a cute little cottage and close walk to Lake Erie. They were quick to respond when there was an issue with the entry code. Would stay again!

The mattress was so comfortable. There was plenty of towels including some for the beach. Lindsay and Mike were the perfect host. They were quick to respond, always friendly and they had extras at the house in case you forgot something. I was so happy to see the extra toothbrushs because I left mine at home. I would definitely stay here again!!"

Thank you so much!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,My husband and I came to Michigan last minute for an urgent family matter. Lindsay was incredibly responsive and helpful. She helped alleviate a lot of stress by being easy to work with. The place matched the description and had all the little necessities you would want at an Airbnb. I can’t say enough about how nice of an experience it was for us.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay at Mike and Lindsey’s place. It was clean, newly remodeled and perfect for our family. The fenced in backyard is perfect when traveling with pets. The neighborhood is nice and quiet. We would absolutely stay again, when in the area."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"My girlfriend and I felt very at home. the yard was well fenced for the dogs and the surrounding neighborhood was very private and quiet. There were some initial issues with the temperature in the house and shampoo and conditioner being available however those issues were resolved quickly by the host. The house does not have any AC, a fan was provided and that made a big difference, but I could see that being an issue moving farther into the summer."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,beautiful clean home
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"There was a storm the day before and power was out for 2 days . They were very kind to work with us to get our money back , because we could not stay.

Returned it immediately and called the company for us .

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our home was on the market, and finding a place that welcomed our furry companion seemed impossible for a short-term stay. Thankfully, we stumbled upon this gem. Although our rental dates shifted a few times, Renee and Bonnie were incredibly understanding and accommodating. Selling our home was less stressful knowing we had a comfortable place to stay in the interim. The house exuded a perfect country charm and came fully equipped with amenities, including a washer and dryer—a delightful bonus! With clean sheets and warm comforters awaiting us after three days of non-stop moving, we couldn’t have asked for more. JJ, our beloved fur baby, reveled in the spacious yard. The hosts’ patience, understanding, and prompt communication throughout the entire process were commendable. In essence, the home was cozy and exceeded our expectations."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I was looking for peace and quiet while I finalize wedding plans. I needed the break from the busy St Pete, FL. I love the country charm. There was plenty of TV time. The kitchen had everything you needed to do a complete meal. Everything worked as it was supposed to."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Check in was easy with the keypad lock. Location was awesome being in an area with large 1+ acre home plots very private but within 10 minutes to known stores and restaurants.
Homes appliances, and installed equipment were found to be working normally, with cabinets and pantry containing cooking and eating utensils along with condiments should you run short or need a little in a pinch
Hosts were super responsive, friendly and easy to communicate with wouldn't hesitate to stay again highly recommend."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This house had all the necessary basics, was clean, comfortable, and spacious. It had a large backyard for my pup to roam (on leash, as it isn’t fenced in). We swam in Lake Erie and walked the trail at Sterling State Park, visited Calder Dairy and Farm, and had a bonfire with s’mores and popcorn during our stay. We had a pleasant time, and would stay here again if ever looking to come back to the area."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,adorable little farm house! we felt right at home our host was responsive and even reached out before we arrived to warn us of som flooding in the area. peaceful and relaxing. Close to a lot of things to do yet far enough away to truly relax.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay, it was great to look out at nature at every window.
The only thing I would add is a door to be able to close off the basement if you want to keep pets or small kids upstairs.
Even though in the country it’s close to stores and restaurants."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Our 2nd time staying here. Such a peaceful and relaxing country setting. Connie communicated great and we didn't need to reach out for anything.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,My dogs loved the backyard and the house was clutter free and spacious! At night it can be harder to find the house but that’s to be expected in a neighborhood where the houses are not on top of eachother!

We enjoyed our stay - thank you!"
2022-12-01,3.0,Stayed about a week,"Old, dusty and dry. Needs many updates. Cooking pans look like something from a college dorm. Location is okay. For the price point it was adequate nothing more. Needs some serious maintenance, updated furniture. The couch arm closest to the kitchen is missing half the padding. The throw pillows smelled funky."

2022-10-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"The place was fine for an overnight stay and the listing is accurate. We appreciated the privacy and size of the lot for our dog to play outside safely. It's an old house so our expectations were realistic, however we didn't feel it was as clean or put together as it could have been for the price and rural location. no problems communicating with Connie and she was flexible with a slightly early check in."

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I got exactly what I expected from my stay here. A quiet and cozy rural getaway that still had the necessary amenities for a traveler in the 21st century. Connie was very prompt with communication and helpful when I had a few questions during the stay itself. My only disappointment is that the heat would default to 75 degrees after a while and it's not an easy system to change the setting. Otherwise, my boyfriend and I had everything we needed for our stay and enjoyed every minute of it! Definitely recommend to other travelers."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was very easy to find, very quiet, and peaceful nights. I enjoyed my stay in this house. The beds were very comfortable and had all the touches of home.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Quiet country setting. Much more pleasant than a noisy hotel. Plenty of yard to walk our dogs.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Very cozy and quiet area. There are takeout and grocery <10-15 min of driving. It’s only an hour drive to Detroitor Ann Arbor. Twenty min to the beach. Best for couples
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little house in a quiet country setting. Fantastic communication
2021-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice country living. Quiet and peaceful.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"As guests that also manage several Air bnb properties we were VERY impressed with this Farm house. The space was very clean and felt comfortable. The host are very thoughtful, keeping water in the fridge and breakfast snacks provided on the counter. Definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in the area!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice location! Highly recommend
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great alternative to a Detroit Hotel. Nice Rural setting after driving through the big city traffic.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great place, peace and quiet, I will stay again"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfy home with easy access to surrounding cities. Lovely large yard and pretty much everything you need for a nice stay. Surprisingly loud for a quiet neighborhood due to train running often nearby. Was pleasantly surprised with many unexpected little amenities! Regarding some earlier reviews, the house definitely has wifi now and it works reliably."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place for the money. Definitely would recommend.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was very comfy and everything I expected highly recommend it
2021-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The yard is not fenced but is huge and is great for a dog to explore that doesn't run off. Loved the old farmhouse feel with the modern updates. We felt very comfortable and safe in this house. It is a little noisy with cars on the road a lot and the train running often. Connie was very responsive to messages. Would definitely stay here again.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This was the perfect place for us as it was clean and cozy. It is a very rural area which provided a peaceful atmosphere. There is no wifi but we survived! Unplugged and recharged!
2021-01-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"This is quiet country stay in an older home. Home is clean and has a full kitchen stocked with the necessary cooking tools, utensils, plates and glasses. Close to a small town with just enough amenities. Close to highways, located between Detroit and Toledo, for easy traveling to other destinations. I did not check out travel destinations, but I'm sure there's lot to do in the area. The only thing lacking is wifi."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great, homey place to stay in Monroe!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Group trip,nice place to stay for a fishing trip. country feel and friendly neighbors
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved the location of this home. Lisa was a great host. She checked in on us several times to make sure everything was perfect for us. Highly recommend to anyone coming to this area.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We were in the area for a fishing trip. House worked out great. Plenty of room for parking out truck/boat. Plenty of space in the house and clean. I would stay here again.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable and cozy. Best host ever. So friendly, welcoming and easy to work with. We will be back."
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The rental has a very homey vibe. The neighborhood is quiet and it isn't far into Monroe. We had a great visit with family in the area.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Home was located in a great spot for our purposes. Planty of room to back in a 20ft boat of a road which isnt busy! House is outside of town to avoid the hussel and bussel of busy streets and if you like busy streets and traffic thats only about 10-15 minutes away. If your an outdoorsman most big boat launches are only 20 minutes away. Place is quiet and secure to drop your boat for the afternoon and head elsewhere with no worries about something happening to boat. Hopefully works out again in the future to stay for long weekends!
Lisa was a great host and always checked in via text/app to make sure we had what we needed! She went above and beyond."
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,An older well loved home with unique decorative touches. Had soft and amazing blankets. Loved the kennel provided and outside lead for dog.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Stayed at Lisa's from a Thursday check-in to a Sunday check out. Lisa was GREAT at communicating and very accommodating. The home was clean and cozy with lots of decorations and things for us to use. This was a lovely get away during a work event over the weekend for the six of us. She was especially wonderful that the dog we were bringing needed a certain type of crate, and she generously made a special trip to drop off the extra one she had instead of us needing to bring one. Very happy with our stay here. Hope to stay there again if we ever make another long trip to Monroe! Lisa is wonderful and you can tell this home is a cherished part of her family. Thank you again, Lisa!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,The toilet was amazing. It had a heated seat!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We were there for a girls weekend for a dog show and fell in love with the place. We all said “let’s go home to grandmas house”. Everything was perfect. Comfortable and definitely clean. Lisa goes out of her way to make you feel comfortable and at home. We definitely be back next year!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay at Lisa's place. There was plenty of room for the family, and we had everything we needed."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Lisa was very friendly and communicated very promptly with us our stay. would definitely book again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Ok, so I know this is two reviews in a row, but I had an emergency come up which I had to book this again last minute. Lisa worked with me above and beyond what any AirBNB host should or normally would in terms of the last minute planning and adjusting a check out time for myself and my dog. I will say it again, this is a very nice AirBNB and she is the best host on here!!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is the best AirBNB I have ever stayed in!! This is one of the cutest houses ever and is very very homey. There is a lot of room, it is clean, and it has everything you need. Lisa is above and beyond a great host. This would be a great location for a family on a vacation as you have Ann Arbor, Detroit, and Toledo all within close range and there is a lot of room at this house...both inside and in the yard. It would also be a good rental for a work group for a retreat or if your traveling with a team on a business trip. No matter whatever reason you decide to stay Lisa will accommodate you!
As a side note, there are large open fields to the East and West of the house, so you get the most beautiful sunrises and sunsets ever!! If you find yourself traveling in SE Michigan you should book this house!!!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved the view of the water
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely incredible view!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a wonderful lakehouse!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at May’s home with a wonderful experience for me it was my first time to the lake and I will definitely back again. The house is very accommodating, clean and absolutely beautiful. The view of the lake as soon as you pull up to the house and from the sunroom and bedroom was a plus to watch the sunrise while laying in bed it was amazing, thank you again, and I will definitely be back"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our little getaway together at Mays!
Thank you for having us."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a beautiful place!! Me & my boyfriend just needed a place to get away for an evening and we WILL be back!! the view of the lake from the bed room was stunning! Thank you Mays🫶🏻
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Thanks for another great stay!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful little cottage right on the lake. Very comfortable and peaceful place. We enjoyed watching the ducks and even saw a golden eagle. Remember to bring shampoo and body wash.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I fell in love with this place! Quiet neighborhood. Would highly recommend booking a stay here.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"beautiful view of the lake, and adorable homey bedrooms ☺️"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I was looking for a place on the Lake. It was a girls getaway with my bestie. We brought my Yorkie. place was exactly like the picture. enjoyed the sunrises and views of the lake. we went for walks and enjoyed the peaceful neighborhood. Will definitely put them on the list to visit again.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This lake house is exactly what we were looking for! It was peaceful with a retro vibe and the views of the water were second to none. The home is cozy and clean. We didn't use the kitchen but it was cute and clean. This is the perfect place to stay while passing through town for a night or two. Great place if you are looking for a quiet getaway on the water! We will definitely stay here again.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great Host. Will stay again when weather gets better.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had such a great one night stay & hope to come back again to stay longer! It was cool & rainy but still perfect. Such an amazing view and the waves crashing made us keep the music off:) Our doodles felt right at home and had just as much fun as us! There is even a little marina close by with great coffee!I would highly recommend this stay to anyone who wants to get away for a peaceful & cozy retreat!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"we had an amazing, relaxing time. we will be back! thank you mays! that view is everything!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful views. Very nice little cabin for a lake getaway. Host was very useful and proactive.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed at Mays place one night this weekend and wish it could have been more. It was a cute, cozy, very relaxing beach vibe house with great views from the windows which was nice It was cold during our visit so we couldn't spend a whole lot of time outside but were still able to enjoy the outside from the comfort of the house. We are looking forward to definitely going back when it is nicer weather and hopefully stay for a longer visit. Thanks again Mays, you have a great home."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There is a lovely feel to Mays' place. It is decorated tastefully and not too ""busy."" Enjoyed being right on the lake even though it was winter and pretty cold. The heat indoors was fine! Beautiful sunrise. Not tiny, not huge, plenty of room for our needs. Would love to go in the summer too. Great place to relax. Thank you!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,amazing views
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This was a wonderful experience and I will definitely consider it for future stays.
The trip was short so enjoying the patio & area amenities was not possible. Beds were comfortable and living space plentiful.
Here are my downsides:
1) We arrived after dark & there was no outdoor lighting (that we could find) so locating a house number, lock box location, and edges of back patio challenging.
2) locating light switches was a challenge
3) TV needs an antennae for local broadcast.
To rent such a comfortable space from a marvelous host was truly a pleasure."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great location and lovely place to stay.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We have stayed at this location multiple times. Mays is a gracious host and the view of the lake is beautiful beyond words. Her cozy lil' beach house is the perfect getaway. Very clean, quaint little place, and Mays goes above and beyond to make sure you are comfortable."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"great place and great views, have stayed two times now and would again!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This a super cute space and Mays is great at communicating.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Definitely an amazing stay, and amazing views that are unbeaten, only stayed one night but felt right at home. Host was very communicative and not to mention I had my dog and she allowed him as well. will be staying again for sure."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Can’t wait to come back this summer. Great Lake house
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Rented for a few days to celebrate my daughter’s birthday. Amazing view of the lake. The sunrise in the mornings was amazing.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"stayed in town to visit a friend, overall place was what we needed. beds were comfortable and couch was nice and big. a little dated, but was okay!"
2023-11-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Nice to be by water. Loved hearing the waves,"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house was fantastic!! Very relaxing, great decor, and the lake is the best part. We loved out stay and would recommend to anyone else!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The view from the deck and proximity to the lake was exactly what we were looking for on our girls weekend! I can’t even believe how quickly the host responded to our questions. Highly recommend!
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"decent stay, just a Lil dated"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean and comfy! Loved the view💕 we only got to stay one night but I would definitely go back if opportunity arises.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Mays was incredible! Losing the reservation due to a goof up on my part, Mays worked with AirBNB together, going above and beyond to resolve the issue. we ended up staying at this beautiful little seaside cottage, and couldn't be more thankful! Quite the perfect getaway. She was very fast, responsive and accomodating. I would recommend staying with Mays to anyone!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Mays was incredibly sweet and accommodating! My goof up screwed up my reservation, and Mays worked with AirBnB to go above and beyond to work this out, allowing our family to stay at her beautiful little lakefront seahouse. She is a trustworthy, gracious host. I highly recommend!!!"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful location on the very western shore of Lake Erie so no huge waves and got to see the sun rise over a great lake for the first time from the master bedroom. The building is on the older side with a few quirks but nothing too hard to overcome as the heat worked fine and the wife, babies and pooch enjoyed the decor and surroundings. Could use some exterior lighting but arrived before sunset and part of the road was closed so had to reroute around the construction, though this was the theme of my 2,600 mile road trip. Close enough to explore Detroit or do a morning crossing over the Ambassador bridge to explore Canada. Very convenient to I75 as well without being so close to be loud along with the town of Monroe a few miles away for decent eats and historic war of 1812 sites. Would recommend to anyone seeking a peaceful stay with a great view."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved it! BEAUTIFUL VIEWS! Very clean home. Would definitely stay again.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I can't believe this little oasis is less than 20 minutes from my home. Warm, rustic Lake Erie vibe. We had a delightful time and hope to return to this lakeside gem soon."
2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,The house was very clean but could use some TLC and repairs. However the view of the lake made up for it. Very quiet neighborhood and a great place to walk our dog.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mays was a wonderful host. Beautiful, peaceful waterfront cottage right on Lake Erie. East logistics and overall nice stay. Hope to be back again to enjoy the house and Lake Erie."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Staying at Mays place was very peaceful for a nice weekend. We went over a holiday weekend and it was still peaceful. We enjoyed our stay & will be back if we’re ever in the area.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The cabin was better than expected! My dog and I came here to get a couple days of solitude and this place was the perfect destination.
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place overall! Lots of cob webs and some furniture was broken.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent location!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a amazing stay at Mays place. Previous reviews and pictures are accurate. The place is a work in progress as far as fit and finish. Its a Lake Cabin and the view more than makes up for the old houses personality. We tried the Grey Heron as recommended for dinner and the view and the food was great. We also had lunch at the Monroe Diner and they have a amazing Senior menu for $10. each. We can not wait to return. Thanks.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was adorable and really fun. The sun room was really nice to sit in and read with a great view of the lake. The neighbor did stand in the empty lot next door while we were swimming, but he didn’t approach us or talk to us. Mays have great instructions and was very communicative. Overall, I would definitely stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved watching the storm roll in off of the lake. We were also able to watch a meteor shower from the deck, it was incredible! Great location!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The true Beach House !
2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"May was super friendly and always responded quickly. She messaged us to welcome us, as well as to see if we enjoyed the stay.
This little shack is exactly that.. a little shack. Which is perfect for 2 people going on a low key weekend trip.
The property was on the lake (which was beautiful), however, I feel the need to clarify that behind the house/deck is a cement wall with about a foot or 2 of sand/rocks before you hit the water. Not a bad thing, just not what we expected.
The home definitely needs some maintenance. There were missing door handles, a hole in the living room floor, etc. Lots of jerry-rigging going on here.
For the price I paid? Perfect location, size, and amenities. I would definitely return for another random weekend get away."
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice location. Kitsch but charming bungalow. Kitchen could be a bit better equipped. There are many water snakes of good size that live right along the lake's edge. They are neither dangerous nor a bother, but if you're like me you might want to find somewhere else to wade in the water."
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Mays wasn't bad, however there were bacteria and algae warnings for the water so we were unable to use the local beach or the water behind the house. We also unfortunately were told the rental was not ready in time and had to wait an additional 4 hours to check in which was most of the daylight for our first day there."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Right on the water, who could ask for more! It was great."
2023-07-01,2.0,Stayed with a pet,The host was responsive and helpful. The place was clean. There were several areas that were in disrepair or completely unsafe. No outdoor lighting to illuminate areas with no rails where a person could fall off the deck. There is no easy access to the water. The yard is overgrown with weeds and invasive ivy. We left after the first night. The host was quick to facilitate a refund and pleasant to deal with.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow, what an amazing view to wake up to. The house was really cute. Definitely giving beach house rustic vibes. Restaurants and dispensaries are nearby but not too close to kill the amazing peaceful surroundings. I am definitely coming back in the fall. The only odd thing was that there were a few neighborhood folks meandering (in the daytime only) on the empty lot next to the house. It felt like they were checking us out or seeing what we were doing, but once they realized that we were literally taking in the lake and not having a wild party, they moved on. No issues at all."
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Not what we expected. Needs some upkeep but is reflected in the price.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was absolutely perfect for our stay between the clean floors and the beautiful views it was spectacular. your cottage on the water is very nice and the deck, the seawall and everything was just perfect, It would of been nice to have a grill to cook out but we ended up at the quarry restaurant and I highly recommend it. It would also be nice if you could provide a list of local restaurants for people who come there I really wanted to try the Huron restaurant for their mac & cheese. Take note anyone else coming to this location during the month of June. The mayflies are pretty bad. We were very blessed with no bug issues since it was the end of the mayflies season."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The interior of the home was exactly how it was described. To no fault of Mays, the fishflies around the home were very extreme, but I do understand that they often come with the lake view scene. Once it started raining, there were significantly less fishflies and we were able to sit outside and enjoy the view after that. There were some stains on the curtains; however, the kitchen was stocked with what we needed, the interior was cozy, and we loved that we were able to bring our fur baby along."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The perfect place to relax and decompress! The view is amazing !
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The house is adorable. It's clean and nicely decorated and has a welcome homey feel. The ambiance of the location can't be beat. The kitchen has the basics, but not much extra, so be sure to bring your own coffee and such. All in all this is a great find and I will definitely stay here again in the future."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We will definitely be returning. I recommend using the double doors in the gathering area due to the bugs somehow making their way in the couple times I used the bedroom doors.
Bring your own folding chairs if you have more than 1 person, to sit and enjoy the water. We loved watching the sailboats go by. It was peaceful listening to the waves crash at night. While we were there we visited Luna pier beach which was nice and clean (no dogs allowed on beach or pier) and we also visited the Toledo zoo."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a pretty good stay. Unfortunately, we picked a week that rained a lot, so we spent a lot of time inside. The place was pretty clean and comfy, so we felt right at home. The shared beach had water snakes, so we were unable to swim much. There were also a lot of bugs, but that’s to be expected on the lake. Overall, we had a nice time and really enjoyed the places to eat nearby."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,It was very relaxing 😎
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice stay overall.
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,The view was worth it. The nearby beach was so full of dead fish washed up you couldn't handle being down there :( Seen ants in the bedroom and a lot of dead bugs? not sure what kind they were. but I guess better dead than alive hahahaha. We had a good time.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Lovely spot on the water! Easy access off I-75 but in a very charming and quiet neighborhood. House was pet friendly, which we liked since we were traveling with our dog. Comfortable bed, we slept fine with the window air unit and fan (it was in the 80’s outdoors). Gorgeous deck facing the lake, we brought our own chairs and enjoyed the view! Two great restaurants right down the road (seafood and pizza). Overall, a wonderful stay. Thank you!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had a great time, beautiful views😍"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved everything about our stay. The check in was easy and our host was willing to help with anything we might need, which there was nothing we needed. We’d definitely stay there again."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Adorable little water cottage! The view from the deck was amazing! I Will definitely stay again.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We started out our Great Lakes road-trip here and it was perfect! The lake was a little rough when we checked in but by the next morning it had calmed and we got to see a beautiful sunrise. The house was clean and welcoming. Our two pups loved sitting at the back door and staring out over the lake. They were a little weary of going potty by the house since there wasn’t much grass but there is a lot across the street with a note from a neighbor to pick up after your pets if you use it. Overall, we had a good nights stay here!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Had an amazing relaxing time. Caught some pretty big catfish out of the lake as well. Definitely coming back soon!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice and peaceful lake house.
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Enjoyed our stay. It was well worth the money! The privacy and location cannot be beat. Things I wish I would’ve known before - 1) no central air. Only 1 window air in back bedroom. Thankfully it didn’t get super warm when there. The breeze from lake was enough during our stay 2) no outside furniture as displayed in picture 3) yard has zero grass but tons of overgrown ivy-like growth 4) yard has random trash (cardboard boxes, charcoal and the bag ripped open, broken chair) 5) empty lot next door is full of broken glass
Even with all listed above - I do NOT regret staying here!! I’m not too bothered by that type of stuff but I know a lot of others would be. Just wanted to give a heads up to other renters.
Guarantee that this stay is much better priced and quality than 95% of hotels! Definitely planning to stay again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,this place is really starting to feel like a home away from home for myself and my girlfriend. can't wait to visit again.
2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"the house and space was clean and there was plenty of extra towels and blankets, and wash cloths., however the queen size beds mattress was broke down in the middle and you had to try to climb out of bed in the morning, also the sliding door facing east had no room darkening curtains, only sheer, and the morning sunrise completely filled the bedroom at 6:00am. the door in the bathroom where the extra towels were stored had a broken hinge, and the board walk exiting the back of the house toward the drive way had loose boards so you had to be careful not to trip on it. there was no railing around the deck on the lake side, which caused us a concern about accidentally falling off. overall it wasn't a bad place but we won't staying their again , not a good value."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Cozy place with a great view!!
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I liked being on the water, the neighborhood was cute and quiet. But the couch had rips and holes in the upholstery, the kitchen table was broken and the hot water for a shower lasted about 5 minutes. We Airbnb quite a bit for weekend getaways and have stayed in nicer/newer/cleaner places for the same price or less. Just needs maintenance and some updating to be worth the price."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved it! Beautiful view, clean and comfortable! We will be back!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This property was incredible!
We came on a rather dreary day so we were not able to enjoy the beach, but luckily the bright, welcoming interior was more than enough to elevate our mood! This location was really cute and the airbnb is decorated with lots of love and style.
The host was kind and attentive. We had absolutely everything we needed.
Thank you for a lovely trip!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time at Mays' place on the water. The sunrises were breathtaking and it was great to fall asleep and wake up to the sound of the water. The house felt bigger than I expected it to be, and while it's not large, there was plenty of room for the four of us. It was a great break from the cramped hotel rooms we had been in on our trip. The neighborhood was very quiet and the house was easy to find. We would definitely stay here again."
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The view from the deck was worth staying here and will make us return. The place was open, decorated well, and made you feel at home on the comfy couch with a nice tv. We felt very safe and secure with the locks and location. The mattress could be updated for a more restful sleep. We would stay here again and had a great time!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Cute place right in the water!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and well decorated. The second bedroom was a little musty and definitely need more privacy, maybe better curtains. Other than that it was exactly what we were expecting and we loved every minute. Absolutely worth the price."
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Decent for a nights stay. View is best part. Would stay again overnight
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,As advertised--no complaints. Right on the water.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our third time staying at this little gem and it never disappoints. Thanks to Mays for being such a great host.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place with nice views highly recommend!!
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Love the little lake house cottage. The water was so nice and the neighborhood was very nice. We had a great time.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed my stay! Will definitely be back.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We loved taking our dogs to the lake 🖤
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Absolutely amazing and the home itself was amazing. My favorite part is the rotary phone ha. Was perfect for what I needed it for. Will return again.
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great weekend getaway. Cottage could use some updating, but nothing the view doesn't make up for!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing beautiful place with great views. The host was responsive and the place was clean and cozy!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a gem!!! Fantastic place, will definitely return. The home was cozy and had an amazing view!! I really loved staying here. The host was great and everything was as expected!! A+++++ 💎💎💎💎💎"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place never disappoints! Such a cool home right on the lake, was even cooler this time because the lake was frozen over! Something if you haven’t experienced, you should!!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice and peaceful. Met all our expectations and we would stay again
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"old cottage on the lake, the view is beautiful. makes a great getaway."
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This home was easy to find and conveniently located to downtown Monroe. The livingroom and one of the bedrooms have great views of the lake. We only stayed one night and we enjoyed our stay in many ways, but it is an older home and we were not impressed with the landlord special renovations done. The additions added are not even with the house and we tripped over them many times, which was a bit of a pain as one of the guests has one-leg. It The french doors in the bedroom that open to the lake had very sketchy locks, were very loose, and could easily be broken into. The heat worked very well. The house was clean. Basically it was fine. It was a decent place and location to stay for the night/weekend."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lucky to have found this place. Beautiful view. Visited in the winter, but I’m sure it’s even more beautiful in the summer."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Not a bad place, however it is on lake Erie so the views aren't going to be that exceptional"
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Home was lovely and cozy. We were bummed that the lake was frozen though, something to keep in mind/ask about for winter months."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The pictures don’t the view justice. The sunrise in the morning overlooking the lake is just beautiful!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,our second trip here was just as wonderful as our first. we love this place and will be back again soon.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,we enjoyed our stay. may was helpful and available
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We just stayed for a night but the place is really nice to relax a bit and wake up with a stunning view!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Thank you for sharing your one of a kind cottage on the lake! Perfect spot to hang our hat while visiting family in the area. Great sunrise, quiet and Cute neighborhood to walk the dogs. We’ll be back!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a great time here …the morning sunrises were absolutely beautiful..Definitely will be back here soon ..
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"BEAUTIFUL PLACE! A must stay! The host was very accommodating and responded to messages quickly and very understanding. The perfect place to get away and not need to leave to go anywhere. But if you needed to leave, everything is within ten mins. The water is such a great view from inside the home as well as outside. The home layout is amazing and clean. We will definitely be back to enjoy every season if we can. Thank you so much for providing us such a great experience!!!!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Just what I was looking for
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice view. would love to come back
!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect location and quiet street
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time, I’m glad I didn’t let the negative statements in some reviews affect my decision to book. The view was beautiful, the cottage is homey, and we were close to stores and restaurants."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect spot for a romantic getaway. The back deck overlooking the lake is beautiful!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We stayed as a family of four very comfortably here. The sunset and sunrise were superb! The walkout is rocky so be aware. The home was cute and quirky. Mays was very responsive to messages! Thanks!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great view. Felt like home! Nice to have all the small things (like throw blankets and seasoning) to make it feel comfortable. 5 star stay!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Mary’s place was really cool right on the water and was exactly what we we looking for. Will definitely look for her listing if we stay in the area again.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was cozy, clean and comfortable. Great host, great location! We'll be back soon!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Just wow!! Magnificent view of Lake Erie. Home was just as described. The home is a good vibe. I really enjoyed my stay and I can’t wait to book again :)
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"View is great. Especially in the morning and you can see the stars pretty well on clear nights. House is cozy and has all the subscription sites (Netflix, Hulu, HBO). Great for a night in. Just pick up food on your way because door dash doesn't deliver to the area. Kitchen was well stocked though if you need to cook and there's a small bbq grill and fire pit in the back."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a nice stay in this quaint, yet beautiful cottage on the lake! Neat decor and great vibes!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was as listed and the location was perfect for us. The view was hard to beat for sure! Dont forget to bring your own coffee! I didn't see we needed to and we ended up having to go out, but it is in the listing to bring your own food products. The floors are a little rough as stated in other reviews I read about the place, but it didn't impact our stay, was really not a big deal as others have made it out to be... and I would definitely stay here again. Great host communication also!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great quick stay with an amazing view of water. Host was very accommodating.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful small home on the lake. Great location & very nice hosts. We will be back.
2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"View was beautiful but I found the house to be dirty. A lot of spiderwebs and kitchen cabinet pulls were dirty to the touch. Also, make sure you get a code upon booking. You’ll need it to unlock the lock box"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay; beautiful view. Host is very responsive.
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The location is great, and the deck out back is beautiful. The house is bigger in person than what I expected from the photos. There are plenty of restaurants within 10 minutes as well. Really a great value."
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Things we liked….sitting on the deck with the lake taking in the view, the furniture and decor, the quiet neighborhood, easy parking, and the price of the stay considering you are right next to the lake.
Things that need improvement….clean the windows so if it’s too windy to sit outside you can see the view clearly, more working lamps in the open plan room because it was rather dark, and something to stop the bathroom door and front door from sticking. It was loud and annoying to have to bang the door shut.
This place is made of wood so you can hear EVERYTHING. Bear this in mind if traveling with a friend or other couple!!
Despite all of the things listed to improve, I would come back because you can’t beat sitting on the deck and watching a Bald Eagle fly past while listening to the waves lap the rocks below."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,it was so beautiful! my mother and i had a little girls trip here and loved it. we got to witness the last supermoon of the year while there. i recommend staying here! the host was also super sweet and great with communicating
2022-08-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"The view is incredible looking straight out. Looking to the left there are two huge smokestacks (coal-fired power plant) constantly pumping out pollution and if you're unfamiliar with the area as we were it's worth noting that it's very industrial. The house is quirky and needs work but that didn't bother us much. The main problem we had was that we came for the water and hoped to be swimming, renting jet skis, etc. but there were harmful algal blooms that made it unsafe to enter the water. If we had known this we would have canceled our trip. It was a huge letdown, but we decided to make the best of it and found a nice place to kayak on the Huron River where the water was clean. If you plan to be in the water, beware, this appears to be a regular issue in the summer. We learned that each year the water is tested from Memorial Day through Labor Day with results posted weekly online."
2022-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Sitting on the deck was an awesome experience. The cottage’s uneven floors were a constant fall risk for me. Overall not quite as advertised
2022-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,It’s a cute place but needs a little TLC.
2022-07-01,3.0,Stayed one night,It should be advertised as a cabin which would reduce the complaints in the reviews. Otherwise very nice.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a fantastic time! The living space was wonderful and the location gave us plenty of things to do during our stay. The back patio was absolutely beautiful at sunrise.
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Fantastic view!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place has so much character and we enjoyed the patio the most! It was the best sunrise views and we loved how quiet the neighborhood was!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very cute place to stay! The back deck is right on the lake it's so neat and relaxing. The neighborhood is safe and quiet!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What an awesome view ... No kidding ... The Morning Sunrises were just incredible!!! And the host's responsiveness was exceptional!! We really enjoyed our stay on Lake Erie ... if you want to wake up with the Sun ... this is the place for you!!
2022-06-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a new host who needs to address some health and safety issues. The view is very nice.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful views, nice neighborhood and everyone is very friendly!"
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Great spot for a weekend getaway!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,wonderful cozy place to really relax
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great views right on the lake
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One of my favourite airbnbs by far; the place was well decorated, in a safe and queit neighborhood, and the view was absolutely stunning. The host was very quick to respond and was very polite. I read previous reviews mentioning an ant problem, but I hadn't come across anything and the place was spotless. I'd definitely recommend booking Mays place, but keep in mind that it can get very hot indoors."
2022-05-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wouldn’t recommend this AirBnB in its current state. I was immediately drawn to this house because it’s deck being right on the water. That was by far the nicest thing about this house. Other than that, the interior left much to be desired. There were some visually unappealing things, like holes in the ceiling, paint slapped on to most surfaces (including door knobs and cabinet pulls), and a broken sink drain. There were also some hazards as well. The transitions between different floors were at such varying degrees of heights (sometimes with subfloor showing) that it became very much a trip hazard. Also the doors from the bedroom that directly access the deck aren’t even attached to a track at the bottom.
In addition to the visual and structural issues with the house, it just didn’t feel clean. Cabinets and doorknobs just kind of felt sticky and there was a lot of buildup on the shower track.
I know these are small details but when you add them up it made our stay less comfortable. I know this is a relatively cheap AirBNB so I get the lure. And it IS in a nice location on the water, just be warned it may not be worth it—especially for an extended stay."
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Cute cottage in a great location. Everything was as advertised. Nice place to sit outside and watch the birds. Lots of eagle activity during our stay.
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Breathtaking view, on Lake Erie"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was perfect, we loved, it was so nice and cozy, the lake view was beautiful, I would stay here again, I also would recommend a stay here to anyone...Thank You for letting us stay here, We loved it!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Such a cute little cottage on the water! It was clean and the beds were very comfortable. Our dogs loved being able to lay out on the back patio and watch the water. Definitely would recommend
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Awesome place!
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything is as advertised .
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Mays was a pleasant, prompt and welcoming host for my Magnificent Mothers day weekend.
What a Cozy Rustic Lakefront with the most amazing sunrise. Hearing the waves crashing was such a peaceful feeling. Convenient and close to the freeway. Friendly neighborhood and very quiet. Even a small park in walking distance for lil ones to play.
Only suggestion bring ant spray just in case any creepy crawlers want to invade your space:)
Grab your groceries, cocktails, a good book and relax on the deck this is a view you would not want to miss!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was exactly what my bestie and I needed for a moms getaway weekend! Close to everything you need, quiet neighborhood with lovely views! Will return!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Spectacular little lake house. A perfect getaway with just the noise of the water rushing through the rocky shore. Pure tranquility while laying back on the patio or better yet, laying in the bedroom with the double doors opened!
Highly recommended."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our time at the house, pictures really do not do the view from the master bedroom justice. Location is perfect- easy drive down to Toledo, easy drive into town, close to food and stores. Super easy check in, comfortable master bed, good water pressure in the shower!"
2022-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was fine, except for the giant ants everywhere in the house. Literally everywhere."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Home is beautiful and the views are amazing! We rented this home because we came to Toledo for a concert. Once we got to the house we didn’t want to leave. Hosts have a beautiful place and we were thankful to be able to enjoy it for a bit.
2022-04-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"This rustic little cottage has some charming little touches that have been added to update it, but as the saying goes ""you can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig"" comes to mind. I think with a little more work, this would be a nice little place by the lake, but as is right now, I don't think I'd stay again or recommend. In some earlier reviews, people complained about weak floor boards which we didn't find a problem with. My problem as a senior citizen is that they cut out about 4 layers of old flooring to get down to the original hardwood floors in the living/dining area which has left a raw edge of sawed off flooring about an inch high in all the doorways leading to adjoining rooms to catch your toe on and is a tripping hazard. They do make trim to help with this. Secondly, the mattress in the main bedroom had a dip in the middle that was so bad that my husband finally went in and slept in the 2nd bedroom. Their solution was a foam pad on top, which didn't help. The 2nd night I slept in the 2nd bedroom and it was so hard that I ended up sleeping on the sofa. Other things of concern: a sliver of peeled up wood on the 2nd bedroom door that I caught my arm on; no plug in the bathroom for a hair dryer etc., a poorly stocked kitchen if you are planning on cooking, just a few bare essentials; only gravel outdoors around the house with things like old boards with nails sticking up that could have been stepped on by either us or our dog (grass would have been nice for our pet and I do understand that it's spring and not yard work season); our dogs ball rolled under the tv stand and when I got it out it was covered in dust, as in a big ball of fur; practically no lighting in the living room so I had to get a flashlight out of the car to read my book; the paint job in the bedrooms was really poor, done by someone who doesn't know how to paint. I think if you're visiting when the weather is nice enough to go outside and don't plan on cooking, you would find this place okay. But for approximately the same price, we could have stayed at the Marriot Townplace Suites and had a good bed to sleep in. In my opinion, the price is to high for what you get."
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect get away from the city!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great house right on Lake Erie. We went in April because we were going Walleye fishing, so the house worked out great for our purpose."
2022-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The view from this home is incredible! There’s nothing quite like watching the sun rise over the lake, and the view from the master bedroom is wonderful. The home itself is a little run down and unfortunately we ran in to some cleanliness issues during our stay. The linens felt dirty and dusty, the towels were covered in lint. There was only one trash bag for our entire 3 night stay. We found articles of clothing left behind from previous guests and the couch cushions are hiding lots of crumbs and trash from previous guests as well. There are ants too. Every day we were swatting them off our bodies and belongings and it really dampened what would have been an otherwise lovely trip. I would recommend this home to anyone looking for a beautiful view as long as bugs and dust don’t bother you too much!"
2022-04-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"There's no doubt that this Airbnb's location on the water is AWESOME. And many of the details are adorable (as you can see in the photos). That said, the property itself could use some TLC. I would recommend you bring slippers so that you can both accommodate the owner's request to take off your shoes and protect your feet. Also, the kitchen is very small and supplies limited so plan accordingly."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was very nice and conveniently located. Great view!
2022-03-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"The living room was really cozy! But we ended up sleeping on the couch because there was a large draft from the double doors in the queen size mattress room. It was REALLY cold in there. We were also hoping for a little bit of a beach but there was just the concrete pad.
Overall glad to stayed here over a hotel, but there were a few issues."
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Few things about this place. The location is absolutely perfect! I mean perfect. The host messaged me back in a timely manner. The view! I mean wow when you wake up and see that view. So now onto the house. It needs WORK! I mean some serious work. The floor is done for. A bunch of places feel very unsafe and then where you walk into one of the rooms it is a solid edge that is at least 4in high. Very easy to trip over. If they would fix these issues the house would be amazing!
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,The home is uniquely decorated. The lake view is what you are paying for . The bed was comfortable and the home was toasty warm. Plenty of space to relax for a weekend getaway if you are visiting the area. Be aware that the beach is down the street though. Only rock and concrete out back.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"place is a quiet, clean, spacious and calming place. The view is the best...❤"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This AirBnb rental was exactly as described and was perfect for an early spring retreat. I was in the area, partly, to view migrating waterfowl at Magee Marsh and Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge which were a short drive (45 minutes) away. I actually had better luck with waterfowl just watching from the patio and sliding glass doors of the rental - thousands of birds were moving through along the shore during the days, even during the last rainy, blustery one. Perfect artist's retreat, my other main use - the ""bar"" in the sun room made a perfect workspace with a view of the lake. The main bedroom was nice with its sliding glass door. A little drafty when the wind was blowing, but easily remedied by good placement of the curtains. It's likely a little chilly in there in the winter. All in all, I'd definitely return to this rental. Mays was attentive to my questions and responded quickly. I decided to stay an extra day at the last minute and Mays made it easy to work out."
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cute and quaint cottage with an amazing waterfront view was the perfect place to get away for my Birthday weekend. The home was VERY clean which made relaxing very easy for my highly germaphobic self. Linens and towels smelled freshly laundered and all surfaces were free from dust and such.
The big red sectional was beyond comfortable and you may just find yourself falling asleep on it and having the best nap ever. The beds and pillows are also very comfortable and My Husband and I both slept like babies. The shower was hot and had good water pressure.
The host was very friendly and quick to respond to any questions we had. We would defiantly stay here again. Hopefully the next time it will not rain the entire time so we can walk the neighborhood and enjoy the beach. Thankfully the house was so cozy we were OK with being stuck inside all weekend."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is great! If you're wanting to relax and enjoy the beautiful sunrise/sunset I would recommend this stay 100%.
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Rustic little cottage with stunning views of the lake. Pics are accurate. It was cozy and warm. Beds were comfortable.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great and relaxing
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,amazing place could not ask for a better host and a better location absolutely amazing would highly recommend 👌
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Absolutely loved the house. The view is amazing! Thanks for letting us stay
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Exactly as described in the posting, with an absolutely great view of the lake. Communication with Mays and check-in/out was easy. A very comfortable little lake house.
Another reviewer recommended bring binoculars for bird watching, and I'm glad we did -- got to enjoy a bald eagle on the ice almost directly in front of the bedroom window.
As one reviewer wrote, there are problems with a few of the floor boards -- some of them felt like they were close to breaking. We learned to step around them, which was fine, but it could be an issue for someone else.
Overall a great stay."
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful location on the lake for sunrises and moon-rises. It was perfect for our quick stopover in the area.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a cute, simple house that was perfect for us and our dogs while we were in the area for work.
Staying on the lake in the winter is definitely worth experiencing!
Downtown Monroe is a short drive away and we didn’t mind being out of town. Very cute town, good places to eat.
Mays is a very responsive host and we are delighted she shared her space with us!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful weekend stay at this quaint little gem on the lake, and we were lucky enough to catch a beautiful sunrise Saturday despite some cloud cover. The views from the bedroom and the sun porch can’t be beat. We enjoyed looking out onto the frozen lake with coffee in the morning, and champagne in the evening. If you’re like me and enjoy observing wildlife in any season - I recommend bringing along some binoculars - as we watched several bald eagles on the ice in the morning hours. The red leather sectional is insanely comfy and perfect for lazy lounging in the afternoon. The water pressure is amazing, and the hot water is HOT. All in all, the Good Vibes neon sign calls out the energy of this place perfectly, and we absolutely loved our time spent here. Communications with the host were prompt and pleasant, and I’d definitely come back again."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very nice and cozy property!! Well maintained and all the amenities.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice and cozy, great place to stay!"
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed staying in this lake house cabin recently. You can see the sunrise from the master bedroom!
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Cute place nestled right on the lakeshore. We had a peaceful quiet evening. Great communication with host. We had a nice stay.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved our stay here! We definitely plan to visit again here at Mays in the summer! Can’t wait to come back!!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is so cute. We went in the dead of winter, and nonetheless is was just as beautiful and relaxing. Absolutely would recommend for a girls or couples trip!"
2022-01-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"First off, what a view! The view of the lake is absolutely spectacular, especially the sunrise! Simply stunning.

The hosts are also super nice and their communication was wonderful. We had an issue with the WiFi not working and had to text them, they responded right away and had the issue resolved in 15 minutes.

There were some issues however. I don't want to talk down the place at all, it has an opportunity to be great, but there are some safety concerns that would need addressed before we could ever stay again.

The house is in a state of disrepair. It looks like they were attempting some renovations but didn't finish them. The flooring was the worst part. The floor boards are dry rotted. We found 5 different rotted floor boards by stepping thru them. Our ankles would go into the floor. Very unsafe. We had to walk very carefully and mark the bad spots with socks and articles of clothing. There were also multiple levels of the floor. Some were about an inch higher than other parts, and the areas were dangerous. Many had splinters sticking out of them. There was also a hole in the ground that went all the way through to the basement, and it was covered with a small piece of cardboard with a brick covering it. A bedroom door had no seal, and cold air was flowing in through the crack and a hole drilled in the door.

Overall, we would love to stay again once the repairs were completed, as we did enjoy the view and the host."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,It was the perfect place for a little getaway. Waking up to the view of Lake Erie was amazing. The place had great energy and was nice and warm. My whole experience was lovely! Definitely would go back.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was an amazing experience!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The view is amazing! The house is cute and comfortable!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I (and our doggo!) had a lovely time at this beautiful lake house. The decor and amenities are really on point! The lake view was gorgeous! We stayed here in January when everything was very cold and frozen, but still so cozy in the house. We awoke one morning to a glorious sunrise and the sounds of Lake Erie's waves cracking the frozen lake into ice shards that shined like glass in the sunrise. We'd definitely recommend utilizing the deck to its fullest potential by catching both the sunsets, AND the sunrises 😍 It was really lovely!"

Really enjoyed our stay! Thanks, Michael!"

Very attentive with any questions we had.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for two couples as each floor has its own bedroom and sitting area allowing for privacy under the same roof. Beautiful space and wonderful host.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our visit to Michael's place. It was a beautiful place with great surroundings. Michael was an amazing host and kept us updated every step of the way. The upstairs apartment definitely kept us on our toes. We knew it was upstairs we just didn't account for all the times we would go up and down them so the host kept our cardio good too ! No but seriously fabulous place for a fabulous weekend with the girls.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,An amazing apartment with great views. Mike is great to work with
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The environment was clean, quiet nice he had everything set up and ready to go for us. The home is lovely felt peaceful and calm. I will definitely be going back and staying at his Airbnb.. he was a great host."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Had a great stay at the mini mansion. Clean linens. Lots of stairs inside and outside but nothing to prevent an able-bodied person to traverse. We loved our meal at Chateau Louise and had wonderful walks on the pier and the public beach. Luna Pier is an evolving area and it’s good to see some life being breathed into the area with summer concerts and full restaurants.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay. Very private. Already booked in Sept!!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first time utilizing Air B&B and We planned a nearby getaway to celebrate our 18th wedding anniversary. We love the town of Luna pier, it is such a peaceful and beautiful little beach town to escape to for the weekend. The place was amazing, I loved the vibe of the house and the outdoor patio/space and the beautiful surroundings was an added bonus along with the bathroom w/jacuzzi tub. We brought our bikes to cruise around the area and had an amazing time. The host had clear instructions on how to check in and it was so easy. He was also kind enough to leave us a bottle of wine for our anniversary. Thank you!! We had no reason to contact the host during our stay because everything was already set up for us. We couldn’t have been happier with our stay and appreciate you letting us enjoy your beautiful home. We would definitely recommend and would love to stay again since it’s so close by. Thank you Mike!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Staying here was quiet and peaceful and would do it again in the future.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a fun, quirky apartment in Luna Pier. The memory foam bed in the master bedroom is super comfortable, the kitchen is well-stocked for basic cooking, and the views of the lake are lovely. It is Lake Erie, so if you know, you know what that can smell like sometimes. But it's a mostly quiet neighborhood, easy parking in the driveway, and a fun little getaway spot. The one annoying thing is that the neighbor across the street has a talking security camera that goes off constantly saying, ""Hi! You are being recorded."" It's a little creepy but eventually fades into the background noise. Best of all is the range of bird life taking advantage of the canal and the lake -- wake up in the spring to a cacophony of birdsong. A quaint visit for a couple days, for sure."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved this place!! Was a last minute trip and he responded very fast! Very clean and clear instructions. Forsure staying again.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Michael was very accommodating, communicated quickly with our last minute rental request, and had clear instructions for checking in.

Pluses: The mattresses rock!
TVs, good. Full Kitchen, nice.
Clean, safe area, close to everything in town.
Minuses: wireless didnt work. No response on inquiring on how to get it running.
The bushes drag on the side of your car when you leave the parking area. Cannot move away from them due to the building's wall.
All in all, pretty decent value for the $."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Kristin was my main contact. She was great to work with and very understanding. My husband and son were the ones living there for 2.5 months for work.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"So rarely in life does something you buy, rent or use provide 100% of what was promised. This was probably the best Airbnb for price/quality I’ve ever stayed at."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our stay at Derrick’s beautiful home. It provided the perfect getaway for our anniversary. The view of the lake was amazing.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Derrick was really sweet from the start, super responsive, he made sure we were updated on anything, from check in to restaurants, extra blankets & so on. There were games inside, tv with tons of movie apps, books, a beautiful view, and of course the awesome game room in the garage. Before check out he communicated that we could stay longer at check out time for no additional cost as he had no other guests coming. The children loved it. Me & the kids were extremely comfortable as if we were home. The little one even asked, “is this our new house” 🥰We will for sure be back in the warmer months to check out the water. It’s hosts like this that make air bnb worth it! Thanks again Derrick!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Eventho it was the exact opposite time of year for a lake house stay, Derrick’s home made us forget how cold it was outside! The garage game room kept us busy for most of the evening, but when we retreated to the house the cozy fireplace was the perfect backdrop for a couple of card games before bed. I am always worried about running into problems with the lockbox, but Derrick’s instructions were thorough and we got in without a hitch. Will certainly return!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"This home is very cozy, relaxing front yard water setting. Has a wooden swing and fire pit near the water.
I grew up in this neighborhood, and love the area. I was lucky I got to Lookout across the water every morning and see my parents home across the lake.
The smart TV with different options for viewing was great. The weather was beautiful.
The game room in the garage was great for us to hang out and relax. Pool table and ping pong with three additional couches to relax on. With music.

His home was clean, well cared for, and full of surprising little extras. We spent alot of time playing in the game room - so many options! We never got around to getting the kayaks out - we'll have to do that the next time. We loved having our morning coffee/tea on the swing that sits on the waters edge. This is just an all around great little place"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Although we had to leave early because of a storm, Derricks place was incredible! Everything was so clean and the game room just made it so much better!!! I would rate 10/10. Derrick was very responsive and when the storm happened he came right over. He also made sure to refund the 1 night we didn’t stay because of the storm immediately! If you’re looking for a quiet affordable getaway, I would recommend this place in heart beat! The house is very homey and incredibly clean! One thing that was unexpected was the bidet but no complaints there! It’s very apparent he takes pride and care into his home. 10/10"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Derrick’s place was a perfect oasis! Kayaking off the dock was amazing. We spent the morning drinking coffee on the swing by the inlet. We slept in the smaller bedroom because the view was amazing but both bedrooms had plenty of space for what we were there for. The bed was super comfortable. We will definitely be back. We have stayed in about five locations in that little inlet area, and this one is definitely at the top of our list!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Derrick’s place was exactly as listed. It’s a cute place right on the inlet to Lake Erie.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My daughter, grandsons and I spent 9 days at Derrick's property and we had a wonderful time . We frequently travel to Toledo but have always stayed in a hotel. On this vacation we wanted to experience the lake with easy access to the city. This location was perfect for us. The lake was serene and peaceful but close enough to the highway that we could quickly be on our way. The house had everything that we needed - washing machine/dryer, fully stocked kitchen for cooking, towels, blankets, etc. The piano room was absolutely beautiful and was wonderful for sitting and watching the lake wake up. The boys didn’t fish often but caught fish when they did. The beds were comfortable and the ceiling fans in each room were a welcome addition. Derrick was helpful throughout the process and answered any questions we had about the property. We had a jam packed vacation and our only regret was that we didn’t get to spend as much time at the property as we would have liked to. Awesome!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed here two nights with my wife, her twin sister, and her brother in law. The house is well done in every way.
We were able to fish a short walk away, on the property. There’s a bait shop very nearby.
There’s a game room with pool, ping-pong and darts.
Communication from our host Was perfect. The location was perfect. The building was perfect. We had a great two days!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Derrick was an excellent host. I had to call him a couple of times asking where something was. He always responded quickly and was super polite. The funny thing is, every question I asked was on an INFORMATION SHEET he left in the kitchen. Totally my fault!....."

2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home. Clean with great decor. Enjoyed the hammock and swing overlooking the lake and the kayaks. There is also a fire pit and fireplace we enjoyed!
Only downside was ants in kitchen, laundry area, and dining area. Host was very responsive as soon as we let him know. He came over immediately, laid out traps, and let us stay for extended check out the following day. Very kind and gracious. Also, the garage game room smells like smoke, so not ideal for young children. I wish there were a way to open the garage door to air it out. Not such a big deal but worth noting for those with young kids. Otherwise, a wonderful stay!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Loved the game room area !! The house was nice and the beds were comfortable. Derrick was very responsive and helpful.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Derrick is a wonderful host.
We had a wonderful time at his property. It's the perfect lakefront gateway. The views are lovely. Highly recommend. We didn't use the game room, but we did look at it and we surprised by how large it is. All in all, the home had everything we needed and we will definitely be back. Thank you for everything!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The 3 of us had a great time. The place and surroundings were peaceful. The house was wonderfully decorated. I loved all the plants and the decor. It was a perfect getaway for a couple of days. The game room was very fun. Everything was supplied and as listed. There were even search suppressors in the rooms which were very convenient. An extra nice touch. Thank you for a wonderful getaway.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"First time staying with Derrick, great price, great location, super clean, tons of activities. Will definitely stay again!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely amazing place by the lake. Found our new place we will stay when we’re up that way
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was great!
We had to get our car towed Friday night BUT Derrick kindly brought a care package for us! It was ingredients and marg mix for dinner since we couldn't make it to the Mexican Restaurant we were heading to. So so kind! Very grateful for our experience.
He also offered for us to stay a little later on Sunday, but our car was ready so we didn't need to.
Would highly recommend this stay for any getaway!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful time. The house was perfect, felt just like home. We couldn’t have been happier! And oh the view! Cant wait to come back!"
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"First off, the good- the location and general property is absolutely stunning. The pictures in the listing do not do the community or area justice. The surrounding water is gorgeous, there's places to sit on the deck and enjoy nature, and even a swing. Derrick was also very communicative when we had issues and responded very quickly. The furniture is comfortable for tall people and people of size.
Some not so good- Derrick did give a warning earlier in the day, prior to check in time, that there was potentially some bad weather happening. However, he did not check in on the property prior to us checking in resulting in our arrival being incredibly difficult. There was flash flooding all over the property and gale-force winds- we were unable to navigate into the gate and home easily due to the flooding. We were also unable to utilize the game room because of the flooding. Additionally- it is bare minimum were not many towels /extra linens; no tin foil or parchment paper for cooking."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay! Derrick was communicative, and his place had everything we needed to feel right at home. Our only complaint would be that we couldn't stay longer!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family had such a great time at Derricks listing. We brought in the new year in his game room garage and the kids had a blast with everything there is to do. Inside was comfortable and cozy had extra throw blankets included for a good movie night. Additional board games inside and the best views of the lake. We even watched a firework display on the river !!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Derrick was an incredible host and I have few, if any, complaints. His home was clean, comfortable, and created an atmosphere to feel like a home away from home. Derrick was very responsive to questions and was always very kind in his communications. My family and I stayed for two nights and we had a great time in all that we did (however, it is winter so we weren't able to enjoy the lake). It was very close to the Ohio border which provided a lovely location to feel safe in our travels to the Toledo area. Overall, should we go back for a stay in the area, we would happily rent from Derrick again!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"WOW! If you have the chance, this is a gem of a place. We can't wait to come back. The design and furnishing of Derrick's place is top notch - we couldn't have asked for a better experience. The entire place is furnished incredibly. Couches are super comfy, extra blankets, stocked in every way you could possibly think of. The game room is awesome - we can't wait to come back in the summer. The swinging bench near the water was our favorite part.
Barr's Public House has so great food about 25 minutes away. Smokehouse 734 is about 12 minutes away and is another fantastic choice (quite possibly the best fries I've ever had). Derrick's placed is stocked with games and truly is a fantastic escape. So clean, so cozy.
Like I said, we can't wait to come back!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We hand an amazing time! The kayaks and game room were so much fun! A much needed little get-away for the family with beautiful scenery. Very clean and and SUPER considerate with all of the items stocked in the house. Thanks again Derrick.

Thank you for sharing your home."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Special family memories made at this little slice of heaven! Location was wonderful and the bird watching was outstanding.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean and updated cottage. Perfect for a calming and restful vacation.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Awesome spot!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage is in a perfect location, on a beautiful tributary of Lake Erie. It was a perfect size for me and my friend. It is literally just over the Ohio state line, so we spent some time in Toledo eating lunch at Fowl and Fodder one day and dinner at The Real Seafoood the next! We kayaked, we had breakfast at the table on the deck or at the cute little table in the piano room, with the beautiful peaceful quiet water as the back drop. We sat and had lots of girl talk on the cute swing right on the edge of the water. The beds in both bedrooms were so very comfortable, the bathroom and kitchen were pretty and well equipped, he has everything you could possibly need in that kitchen! We didn't really use the game room, but it looked very cool with lots of games, a TV, pool/ping pong table, gigantic jenga game and lots of comfy seating. Derrick's communication was awesome, he was very responsive! We would definitely return for our next girls getaway trip!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely wonderful stay. Was able to connect with a friend in a cute, swank, clean, romantic and scenic place and I cannot recommend this location enough."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great spot on the water. Perfect spot for a getaway, but also only 15-20 minutes to Toledo attractions"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We spent one night in Derrick’s house. Everything is lovely, clean, well equipped. Communication is great and our host was very helpful. Great barbecue, access to the river, gaming room great ! Do not hesitate to go."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you aren't sure whether or not to book, BOOK IT. The price is right and the place is PERFECT. We came for a long weekend get away without our little ones, and immediately felt relaxed when we arrived. Water views from nearly every window, the lake is a stone's throw from the back porch, the game room can keep anyone - kid or kid at heart - entertained for hours if the weather isn't perfect, and the kitchen is fully equipped for a frozen pizza or 4 course meal (think Air Fryer, Crock Pot, Meat Thermometer, all the utensils, cookie sheets, Pyrex, knives that actually cut, etc.). There is a washer/dryer if necessary - it was nice to knock out our laundry before returning home. There is a bait shop less than a mile down the road, Kroger is about 10 minutes, and Pavlo's Brewery was a nice mini-date for some local beer and food truck fare (ManhattanStreet Food Truck). There are fish everywhere - while we threw plastics, topwater, etc., we had the most luck with just a bobber and a worm. Fish from the dock or from a kayak. Beautiful lily pads a short paddle away as well. We will be back!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What an excellent little place and a great host in Derrick! We’re already talking about going back because one day just wasn’t enough to take it all in. Comfortable and clean. The bird watching was amazing… actually had a bald eagle fly over as we sat on the swing and sipped our morning coffee! We’ll be back :)

2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Derrick is an amazing host. The house was wonderful and exactly as described. Everything was so clean and check in and out were very easy. We were there celebrating a bachelorette weekend and it was the perfect relaxing weekend we were looking for. The location is fabulous on the water. And all the amenities included everything we needed and more. We especially loved the finished garage space with games and a space for our party activities!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Derek is by far the best host I have ever encountered with Airbnb. He is extremely prompt and attentive…super easy to communicate with
We stayed at his place for almost a month!!
While we were there he would message me asking if he could come and mow the lawn! He wanted to make sure we had fresh cut grass while we were there!! how awesome is that!
When I couldn’t find the towells or pans he brought over a whole set of new wash cloths and new pans!
The only reason I gave three stars for cleanliness is because the refrigerator, oven and kitchen utility drawer needed a good cleaning. I’m sure it was just a simple oversight of the cleaning crew. And I KNOW Derrick will have it spotless for the next guests!
You will not be disappointed staying here. The neighbors were super kind..pointing out what local restaurants were good etc…there is a Meijer store only about 7 mi items away which is super convenient
The place is super cute!!!"

Conveniently located within minutes of stores, gas and a variety of restaurants in the greater Toledo area. Great place to stay!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice place just a little heads up, the gameroom isn't a basement or room in the house. It's the garage which can tend to be a little chilly in the colder months! amazing views and awesome place though!"

2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute little house off of the water. Very clean, perfect size for 2-4 people maybe. If your scared of spiders I wouldn’t leave the house at night. The kayaks were a cool plus, one is a sit on top and one is sit in. Had a good time."

2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,We hit a snag & Derrick went above and beyond to help us out.
,,,"If I was driving for twelve hours, wanted to stop, and this was the only place for another twelve hours—I’d keep driving. Absolutely filthy. A lot of the reviews say “don’t know what the other reviewers are talking about” to the few other negative reviews. Maybe it depends on when they decide to clean it, between how many visits, etc. all I can say is here’s my experience:
We walked in for a romantic anniversary trip. It was a hot day, there was no AC advertised but two window units were in, which is nice and all. Amazingly enough though: not a single fan in the whole house. Who doesn’t have AC without a fan ? The window AC’s weren’t cooling the house, so we tried opening the windows as the sun went down. The screen door was broken—wouldn’t close. Which in the prime of bug season in June means it was useless unless we wanted thousand of fish flies in.
The place was dirty. Dusty, full of cobwebs, fridge left with specks of dirt. Above the stove the cabinet had griddle in it—burnt crumbs that attract bugs. Ants dotted the window over the sink, looking for food.
The bed in the room that doesn’t overlook the lake was an absolute joke. Spring boards you could feel, no cushion. I laid down on it and laughed.
The red leather couch everyone said was so comfy is peeling. You can feel the spine of the couch from how worn down it is. I quite literally couldn’t get comfy on the couch over a few hours.
We went outside, bug spray and ready, to have a glass of wine on the deck chairs while looking at the water. The whole reason we came here. We discovered the chairs to be covered in bird poop and cobwebs. So we couldn’t do what the main purpose of our visit was. Heading back in we discovered the master bedroom doors didn’t have a handle on the outside…
The shower head was like a power washer. Hadn’t been replaced in what seems like twenty years. Such a simple, easy repair. We also found an old used up soap bar in the shower, the shower rack was dirty, and an old used shampoo bottle. Filthy shower overall.
As we went to lay down for the night, we discovered hundreds of bugs swarming in our room due to the master doors not sealing properly. As we tried to sleep in the house with no AC, no fans, bugs sneaking in despite us barely walking outside once, and the inability to use screen doors—we were boiling. We couldn’t stay the night. We decided it would be safer and better to drive back to our home up north and call it quits.
It was very sad, I was looking forward to this trip for a while. I wish we would’ve listened to the negative reviews. The host claims to fix things from those reviews—not to what I saw.
When I brought all of this to the host’s attention she said: “it’s not advertised as a resort”, and I think that mentality clearly shows her attitude on the subject. It’s not a resort, so be prepared for dirt, grime, disrepair, and unsafe conditions overall.
Long story short if you’re skipping through my detailed review: this place is in disrepair, the host refuses to care or fix things. Don’t be lured in by the decor. It’s dirty, bug ridden, and broken. Mays doesn’t care to fix it, it’s not a resort !"
