It was a comfortable stay, and super affordable. Thanks, Michael. We'll stay here again if we get back this way, and recommend to all our friends."

I stayed here for just under a week with 3 co-workers. We could not have been happier.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would recommend Ryan’s place. It is conveniently located—off a major road, but on a quiet street—and offered accessibility to the surrounding area. The house was as described and pictured. The house consists of two units. The other unit was occupied both nights of our stay, but we only knew this because we there was another vehicle in the driveway (it easily fits two truck/SUVs side by side). The unit was clean, not cluttered, but had all necessities. Although we didn’t eat in, the kitchen was well-appointed and had a full sized stove and refrigerator.
Ryan was a responsive host and his check-in instructions were simple. Thank you for sharing your property with us."

Unique decor consisting of a bear theme throughout is clever and tastefully done. There are even bears on the ceiling fan pulls! Floor, walls, switches, outlets, appliances and bathroom fixtures along with most furniture appear brand new. The existing woodwork is original (and older) but freshly painted.
Easy off-street parking in a long paved driveway in front of a two car garage. Spacious yard with a large deck complete with a Weber gas grill and plenty of comfortable seating is shared with the other unit though we only saw that person for a brief moment. One TV hanging on the wall in the living room but we didn't switch it on nor did we use the WiFi. Two bedrooms are set up identically with 1 queen bed each and plenty of closet space but no dressers.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We stayed in half of Ryan’s duplex. He communicated promptly and was able to let us check-in a bit early so we could get ready for the wedding we were attending.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a fantastic AirBNB, best in Etown. The bathroom and appliances are all upgraded, most everything was new and tied together with a cohesive interior design bear theme. Modern back porch. The downstairs laundry and exercise room was very clean, as well as the whole unit. Motion activated touchless trashcan felt sanitary. Overall, the unit was very clean and there was a HEPA air filter. While the memory foam beds were softer than I’m use to, I ended up sleeping very well and looked forward to getting a good nights rest. High tech dimmer switches and outlets with USB switches were really cool. Blazing fast internet. No disruptive noise from the other duplex unit late at night.
Minor downsides: hazy plastic cups and shopping bag used as bathroom trash bag.
Overall, highly recommended"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you want cute and comfy, this is it. When you walk in the door, you’re met with chic bear soul. My favorite coffee and hot cocoa was the first thing I noticed. The Love sac and couch were incredibly comfortable and so were the beds. I adored the Sherpa comforters. It was like sleeping in a cloud. Also, the bear art around the house themed to WWII was a unique touch and very welcomed. That LED light above the couch is a very nice touch!
Can’t wait to sleep here again."

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Awesome place! Ryan was very responsive and his place is new, modern, well arranged and the area is quiet.

Close to I65, we stayed there as a middle stop on a trip to FL and it was a very quiet and relaxing spot to crash for the night. Ryan is super prompt with communication. The home is a few houses up from a busy street, but there’s plenty of room in the shared yard and deck space. Overall would highly recommend!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Tracey’s place is a nice getaway from the hustle and bustle of the city. The surroundings were picturesque and the place itself felt like a home away from home
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent little cabin just right for what we needed. Was in town for the Derby so no need for extravagant housing. Location was nice and quiet with minimal noise. Peaceful sleeping and safe environment. Would definitely recommend it to anyone staying in the area. I would give it 10 stars if I could.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This place was great and had everything we needed.

Loved the Roku TV with numerous shows to watch and free Netflix. Has a carport which we appreciated."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Private and unique, great for a cozy night in!"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Cute place, perfect for what we needed. It was very close to the highway/town yet it felt secluded.
I do wish that I had realized that the property right next to it was also an Airbnb. They are located very close to each other and we could hear the neighbors talking/music even though they weren't being extra loud. Other than that, a few areas could use a deep cleaning. A few drawers were dirty on the inside, the freezer could be wiped out, and we had to wash every dish we used.
Overall, nothing major and I would stay here again, but wanted to point out a few things that could be improved."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I love her properties, she has every style and taste you could ask for."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my favorite stay so far! Very cozy! Great for two people! Will definitely be staying here again in the future!

I really appreciated Tracey's arrival instructions so we knew right where to go. She also provided a few waters, fun snacks, and the use of Netflix! A fun surprise!
I will definitely be back to stay in her cool place and enjoy the sites of Elizabethtown a bit more!
Thank you for sharing your sweet cabin! 🤩"
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really wanted to give this place more praise. It's in a convenient spot and has a nice hammock outside. However, I just can't give it 5 stars. My partner and I think it needs a little more of a human touch to make it a place we would come back to. And as other reviews said, the bed is pretty uncomfortable.
I did appreciate the quick response we received and the open communication with the host!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Tracey was an excellent host and very responsive when I had questions. This place was quaint and quiet, which is a plus for me.

The cabin was very close to all the distilleries we wanted to visit and there were several good restaurants in the small towns we were near. We had a small small issue with a circuit breaker that blew and so I called up the landlord and she told me exactly how to fix it and it was no problem. Places really clean modern bathrooms even had a foosball and a Pac-Man game. It was very relaxing very fun we hope to come back soon.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"  This was our first time ever staying at an Airbnb and Tracey was absolutely amazing. She answered all our questions and was absolutely tremendous.
  Her cabin is an absolute delight. It is hard to believe that her cute little cabin is so close to the city and yet it is so quiet and peaceful. Also the area is absolutely beautiful with the leaves starting to change. It rained a bit while we were there and it was so relaxing. We came to Kentucky for a wedding but we could never have expected such comfortable and enjoyable accommodations. 
  I would also highly recommend this for a nice couples’ quiet getaway: away from the busy day-to-day life.
  Whatever your Airbnb needs, this cabin is perfect for a quiet and romantic adventure or just a safe and quiet place to sleep while you spend your days exploring the area."

LOVE THIS PLACE AND HOST"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I have stayed at AirBNB`s all over the world. This one is by far one of the best!! Tracey did an outstanding job from the time I booked, her response was instant. She was helpful and the place was updated super clean with all the extras (a lot of Airbnbs dont have). Like detergent, paper towels, she even had snacks out. Outside was well maintained, landscaping looked great and the Hammock was a really nice added bonus. There is even a PacMan machine in the house. She is awesome and it is a direct reflection on how she maintains her property inside and out!!! Every time I come back to the area I will check to see if this Airbnb is available before I look anywhere else."

We will definitely be back !"
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super easy check in and very peaceful surroundings.
We loved the hammock and fire pit. It was just far enough off the main road for it to be extremely peaceful.
The bed is extremely firm, so if you’re used to a softer bed, consider bringing a topper.
There are not many spices/ things to cook with (such as pan spray or a lighter for the fire outside.) We did have to purchase seasonings and sugar.
The place was overall clean, but when walking around, our feet turned black and needed a good scrubbing.
It really felt like home with the amount of towels and the setup of the bathroom with the washing machine and dryer.
I will definitely be staying here again when I come to visit my bf who is stationed at Fort Knox."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I had a very peaceful and comfortable stay at the cabin. The fire pit is conveniently located not far from the door. Firewood was provided but I had to search for kindling to get it started so be mindful of that or maybe bring a fire starter log. Inside the cabin was spotless! The living area and bed were very comfortable and the kitchen is well-equipped! I would definitely stay there again.

The cabin is in a fairly quiet area but close to any amenities you might be looking for, even the best automatic car wash I've ever been to! Thank you Tracey for an excellent place to spend a few days!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"For our spur of the moment getaway night this was absolutely perfect. She made self check in easy and the place was SPOTLESS! We ate dinner in the city about 10 minutes away, came back lit a fire and didn’t hear or see another person the rest of the night. Which was exactly what we were looking for. Thanks again!"
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,A quiet quaint spot to hold up for the night while passing through. The place was super clean. Tracey was responsive. Overall a very good experience.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really nice place for one or two people to stay.
The kitchen was ready to use with updated coffee maker, all the appliances looked new.
The whole place looked like it was renovated."
2023-03-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"I loved everything about this one night stay, except the actual sleeping part. The bathroom was spotless; I have never seen a cleaner shower/tub area! Sparkling white. The studio apartment seemed like a cute little remodeled garage, and had everything one would need for an overnight stay, even a laundry washer/dryer. Very trendy!
The only negative is the sleeping area. The bed is placed just inches away from the air/heater, which is the hotel-style which is pretty much level on the wall with your face. The mattress was stiff and felt very clinical. Add to this the sheets weren't cozy, but instead that odd plastic-y light fabric that slides all over the place and doesn't stay in place. I used the throw blanket from the couch for cozy warmth, and in the middle of the night I ended up unplugging the heater to prevent it from blowing loudly in my face. My husband gave up on the bed and slept on the couch with no blankets. We both had a very restless and uncomfortable night."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a clean and cozy cabin. The host was very helpful in directions to get there. Made for a very nice night getaway. Would love to stay again in the future.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,One of my all time favorite locations yet. The host was so helpful and proactive to ensure my stay was the best possible. I make many trips to Kentucky… Moving forward I’ll ensure to stay here! I felt right at home!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this cozy little cabin. It was everything we were looking for and a bit more.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent peaceful cabin. Very clean and well decorated with newer appliances. It really felt like home. The wood ready to be lit in the fire pit was a nice and thoughtful touch. My wife and I enjoyed sitting and enjoying the stars while sitting by the warm fire.
Tracey is very responsive and helpful. We wouldn’t think about staying anywhere else if we are in the area. Well done!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a true treasure off the beaten path. The one room cabin felt like a vacation- with the games offered and the fire pit available.
It is within 5 mins of stores and restaurants.
The bed is beyond comfortable and the couch is made to lounge. The kitchen is easy to cook in with the basic items, and the bathroom even has a washer and dryer.
This clean and quite option is on we hope we can truly visit again.
Tracey is a great host that responds quickly and gives you all the information you need prior."

Owners communicated to us ahead of time exactly how to get there and gave us the code. Extremely easy to checkin in. We parked right outside the door. The Airbnb is one room except for the bathroom, but it just made it easy to watch tv from the couch or the bed. My husband enjoyed the Pac-Man game. Everything felt new, clean, homey, and we enjoyed the snacks and bottled water. We had a wonderful stay! Highly recommend this place!"

The neighborhood is quiet and provided a great restful place for us in between games and at the end of the day. We were about 10 minutes or so from the park, from downtown, and from other restaurant and commercial areas.
The place was spotless, with comfortable beds and a sectional couch. All the technology, including the keyless entry, worked perfectly, and Ryan provided clear and easy instructions for all of them before our arrival.
No doubt in my mind we will book this place again when we return next year."

Our journey began on April 19th, and we’ve exclusively chosen Ryan’s exceptional accommodations, with the only exceptions being Derby, PGA, and Memorial Day weekend.
Ryan’s Elizabethtown properties have surpassed our expectations. The space is generous, offering ample room and beds for just the two of us. The cleanliness is unparalleled, reminiscent of a hospital’s standards. Moreover, the amenities provided23 are top-notch—our clothes have never been happier, thanks to the upscale w/d facilties. The
For those who appreciate themed accommodations, the aviation-themed property is a standout. It’s replete w/thoughtful touches & details that truly enhance the experience. What’s advertised is exactly what you receive, yet the reality is even more impressive.

The decision to explore NW Kentucky due to my husband's job at @the Blue Oval was greatly enhanced by the comfort & security of Ryan’s accommodations. The meticulous attn to cleanliness & details along with w/the provision of top-tier amenities made our stay particularly enjoyable. Feeling like we won the KY Airbnb lottery 😉🙃🌟in Elizabethtown.

A few things to let other travelers know:
1-there isn't a walkway down to the entrance, but the grass was well maintained, so it wasn't difficult to get to.
2-if you sleep in the main room, there is a small device on ceiling that will light up throughout night (I believe it's for the internet). It didn't bother us, but I know some people may need pitch black to sleep."

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We used Ryan's space as a launching pad to attend a meeting locally. It is a very nicely furnished and finished basement apartment. It is comfortable and quiet, in a very safe neighborhood, one of the best in the area. I was able to run out for a quick supper at a local place, there are tons of options within a couple of minutes.
The space features a well furnished small kitchen that most any meal could be prepared in. The bathroom was more than adequate.
We found the space to be immaculately clean.
The private entrance is in the rear of the residence, accessed from about a 50' walk through the lawn, down a small slope, there is a nice view of the back yard from the bedroom.
Three nicely furnished beds are available. No complaint there.
Ryan as a host is excellent. He was super responsive and helpful.
This space is another example of why this industry is so successful. The stay is as much fun as the trip. Great job Ryan."

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Luved everything about this booking. Y'all would be so happy with Ryan as a host & the place was ""home away from home"". We had a long drive down from Ontario & Ryan was so accommodating with our late arrival (even offered to pick up food we may need & took a look at our truck's wiper that wasn't working). The fire on this cold Southern night topped of a great stay. We now know where to book when we travel through the area again ... Elizabethtown is a great destination, very close to the I 65 too!
Paula & CJ :)"

Very nice place to overnight on our trip down south."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
This home is one of the gems that are located in a lovely neighborhood just outside of everything.
We stayed for a football tournament and it took us approximately 11 to 13 minutes to be at the field daily depending on the traffic.
The home is clean and full of light. The beds are comfortable and the sheets are 5 star worthy! They spared no expenses when it comes to technology. From the television remote to the bathroom mirror, and the push button lights, the kids were intrigued. The fireplace was an added bonus as were the usb charging ports.
Ryan is the kind of host that you wish all hosts were. From timely responses to accommodating needs, Ryan was the full package."

2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location was great and the rental was well furnished. The hosts were responsive and accommodating. The only negative feedback is there is no lighting or walk way to the rental which makes it easy to slip or trip on the grass leading to the property, especially at night. Also, I know we were in someone's home but we kept being woken up from stomping and furniture moving around early in the morning. We are on vacation from California so being woken up at 7 is like 4 a.m. for us. It was a nice stay but could have been better."

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Ryan is simply the best. He takes pride in providing a clean and well appointed home away from home. This was our second stay for a baseball tournament and won’t go anywhere else. He checks in to make sure we have everything we need and even provided us a nice big bag of ice for our cooler because he knew we would be back and forth to the fields. There are three very comfortable beds and a great cozy couch to watch your favorite shows. WiFi was excellent as well. I would recommend to anyone.

I also note that we stayed here for a basketball tournament in Louisville.

Neither of us had been to Elizabethtown; we chose this downtown loft and were extremely pleased!!

We will absolutely be back soon!!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Just being honest, I live in this town. My husband and I decided to rent this as a last min date night-for a change of scenery, chance to hang out down town, walk around and without the drive home;-)
If you aren't a local. Let me tell you. Around the square is definitely the best area! There are lots of neat shops, great restaurants, a bar (Even a speak easy bar - SO neat!). All is within walking distance ( Only a 2 min walk to all of that!!!)
We were off the main road, which is what we wanted, but still right in the middle of it all! There is a neat balcony we enjoyed doing some people watching on while still being down a quiet side street ;-)
This place was extremely clean, beautifully decorated and well stocked! With my experience with Airbnb's I definitely took note of the full size shampoo and conditioner. That was a major plus in my eyes!
If you are from out of town? Take my advice from a local...This is a great area of town, it's clean and it's beautiful. It's a win!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Wonderful, beautifully appointed, modern, cozy (yet sizable) apartment. It’s hard to imagine how we could have liked the space more. Beautiful hardwood floors, nice linens, good lighting— and even had a washer and dryer. We were there over the holidays visiting family and I cooked multiple meals to take to friends’ gatherings (and the kitchen had everything I needed!). Every morning we’d grab coffee at the downstairs coffee shop and, in the evening, we walked to dinner at one of the nearby restaurants (which were both excellent). And, if we wanted an evening cocktail, we were right across the street from a fantastic bourbon bar. Definitely one of our favorite air bnb spots and we hope to return!"

The premises were immaculate and aesthetically pleasing. It was nice to have a washer and dryer in the unit, even though we didn’t use them.
There were some issues with the lock initially, but that was ONLY because the area had wind damage, and power was out. However, the hosts quickly responded to the issue, and we resolved it.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the space and the location. Plenty of good walking options for dining-in or carry- out. The loft was spacious, clean, and very comfortable. A stay is no good in my estimation if at the end of a long day the bed and bedding is not up to snuff. No disappointment on that end , with comfy pillows and coverlet. The outdoor seating area out a set of doors off the lviing room led to a spacious porch, which provided a nice spot to sit, enjoy the sun and take in the surrounding downtown historic district. We were amazed at all the quaint shops, as well as coffee shop, which was right next door. The loft was super quiet and the HVAC system worked like a dream with an easy to use dial setting. The kitchen was stocked with every amenitiy once could think of. The owners even had a bag of ice for our use and chilled beer mugs in the freezer. We were especially happy to find a set of high end Samsung washer/dryer combo with detergent provided. The beautifully tiled shower had luxurious soaps, etc. and the water pressure in the shower and sink were excellent. Todd & Tyler were very easy to communicate with and provided every detail necessary to find the loft, as well as how to check-in seamlessly. My husband and I have friends in the area and plan to visit again in the future. We would definitely book another stay."

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed here over Easter weekend and can't wait to book again! I grew up in Etown and my family still lives there. I decided to see what Airbnb had to offer in Etown for a last minute visit (assuming I wouldn't find much) and I was shocked that this beautiful loft was downtown. The downtown area is now bustling with shops and restaurants and it was just the little weekend gateway we needed! Todd & Tyler reached out SO quickly with confirmation and details on the stay (and I booked the morning of)! The loft has high ceilings and exposed brick throughout, with a full kitchen, bath and large bedroom. My favorite part was the walk out balcony, perfect for morning coffee. The walkability was something I also really loved. We never moved the car once we got there. We walked down to Flywheel Brewing Saturday afternoon, then walked to JR Neighbors that night and to Bourbon Barrel Tavern for a drink after. The loft also sits on top of Vibe Coffee, a great local coffee shop that also has food. If you're looking to visit Etown for even just one night, I can't imagine a better place to stay! We're already planning our next visit!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Everything was perfect. A great location with easy walk to restaurants and nightlife. We will be back.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Been staying with Todd and Tyler on a monthly basis for 18months when I come for business. That should suffice as a recommendation. Everything you need is in the apartment to make 5 days away from home as easy as possible
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely perfect way to enjoy the small town feel. Convenient to everything E-Town's square has to offer. Beautiful, quaint spot, and the hospitality and communication from Todd & Tyler was excellent. For sure would book again."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful loft, super clean and great location!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect stay at Todd & Tyler's historic loft with modern updates. The location is ideal, right off the central circle in Elizabethtown's quaint downtown area where there are numerous restaurants, bars, and shops to enjoy (we particularly loved J.R. Neighbors). The loft sits above a wonderful coffee shop, which makes for a little bit of noise starting in the morning but nothing bothersome by any means -- we kind of liked the dull hum of activity coming from below. Parking was easy, check-in and check-out were made very simple, and the communication from Todd & Tyler was perfect (thorough without being overwhelming). The loft, itself, is beautiful, open, and well-stocked with all the primary amenities you could need. Great living area and kitchen, comfortable bed, modern bathroom -- checked every box we were hoping for and matched exactly the description in the listing, and did so in style.
If you're visiting the Bourbon Trail, in town for a soccer tournament, or just passing through the area, I would highly recommend Todd & Tyler's loft over nearby hotels or other available accommodations. We will absolutely look to stay there again next time we're in Elizabethtown."

His home provides great space for a large group. Would stay here again for certain on our next visit to Fort Knox. Go ARMY🪖
