2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"When we travel to Rockford, we always stay at Beth and Ruben's home. I hope that it speaks for itself that this last stay was our fifth time staying in this house. It feels like our home away from home. The house sleeps our family of three comfortably and has enough space to accommodate the family visits of those we're in Rockford to see. Beth is extremely responsive and it's been nice to see the improvements they've made to the house over the years we've been staying here."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Charming and cozy bungalow. The home was clean, the beds were comfortable, and the neighborhood was quiet (despite proximity to a busier street). I stayed during July, and the multiple window air conditioning units (in each bedroom and living and dining areas) kept the home a comfortable temperature. The highlights of the home for me personally were the sun rooms on the front and back of the house and the piano (complete with a bench full of sheet music!) Beth and Ruben were extremely quick to respond to all communications. If I need a place to stay in Rockford in the future, I would stay here again."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Ruben and Beth have provided the best spot for any traveler. I wish we had found this spot when our now adult kids were young.

Will point people in their direction!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed for one night to rest from driving, and it was just what we needed. The breakfast options were so wonderful helping us not have to worry about what is for breakfast before hitting the road again!

We were so appreciative of the eggs and english muffins left for us in the fridge, as well as the tea, coffee, and instant oatmeal left for our use.

The Bungalow is loaded with games, DVDs, quiet places and a cozy living area. The beds were clean and very comfortable. I could go on about the Bungalow and how cozy and comfortable it was, using more than the space allowed. I need to tell you about the best part of this amazing place.
Ruben and Beth!!!
These two are the most genuine people you would meet.
We had a couple of questions and that were very happy to help and answer any questions we had. They made the stay even better. If you are looking for a place to stay in Rockford, this is it. Money well spent. Thank you again guys.
If we come back to Rockford I will be making reservations with you.

The home is warm and inviting and our children love to take a try at playing the piano in the sitting room. Highly recommend.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We visited Ruben and Beth's bungalow for just a single night, during a visit to see Rockford family. Most of our time was spent bopping around to relatives' homes, and we only spent a brief amount of time in the bungalow, using it as a base camp of sorts. And this is our biggest regret - what a lovely place! The front sunroom alone was worth the visit. The whole place was decked out with fun, interesting, tasteful decor. The kitchen was well-stocked, and there were several nice touches like board games and DVDs - all of it neatly organized. For the time we were there, my son spent much of it at the piano, which was enjoyable for both him and me. We will definitely be choosing Ruben and Beth's place again for future visits - hopefully, being able to stay a bit longer."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ruben and Beth‚Äô‚Äôs Airbnb is wonderful! The moment we walked in the house we instantly felt at home and cozy. It was a wonderful space to be able to come together with family.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is awesome in every way possible it‚Äôs truly a rare find and the location is great. Night time is so quiet you don‚Äôt have to worry about busy streets and they have plenty of games to keep you and kids entertained.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay in Rockford; good value for money and great communication beforehand. Check in was easy and place was clean.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Ruben and Beth‚Äôs place is great! Our family of 4 was very comfortable there and we loved the small touches Ruben and Beth thought of. It was great to have breakfast ingredients already in the refrigerator when we arrived, and our family enjoyed the selection of board games for a fun, relaxing evening. Ruben and Beth were great communicators as well. They responded thoroughly and quickly to any questions we had. Strongly recommended!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Beth and Ruben were tremendous to work with. They helped any time we needed it and responded quickly to messages. The house was cleaned up before we got there and they came during our stay (while we were out of town) to clean up as well. The price is a bit high for the neighborhood, but you do get a lot of space, multiple rooms/spaces to hang out in, a small yard and a fully stocked kitchen. Overall a great stay!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ruben and Beth‚Äôs place is immaculate and they responded to any questions immediately. It was so wonderful that they left English muffins and eggs in the refrigerator as well as really good coffee too. Everything was spotless and could not have been nicer. I highly recommend their home and I hope you enjoy it.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying here feels like coming home. Nicely stocked kitchen with special touches like fresh eggs and English muffins. Two sunny sunrooms, a nice dining area and two comfortable beds. Quiet neighborhood with the sound of trains in the distance. Hosts are very accessible and warm. A great deal overall. Comfortable for my 94 year old mom, my husband and I. We have stayed here whenever we come to town."

2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,If I could give Ruben and Beth 6 stars I would. Their home was beautiful and had such a home/ cozy vibe. They went above and beyond for us. We truly appreciate their kindness and their willingness to work with us.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful house, great hosts! Would absolutely stay here again!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"The care and attention to detail that Beth and Ruben put into this classic craftsman bungalow made it a cozy home away from home. It was the most thoroughly stocked kitchen I‚Äôve seen in an AirB&B in years.
Everything was clean, organized, and easy to find, from coffee to extra linens to local recommendations. Even the piano was in tune!
The decor was fun and playful, and it was great to see the local area represented in different ways all over the home. The next time I‚Äôm in Rockford this will be the first place I check for availability!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was great and convenient. Hosts were very wonderful to communicate with.

2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our second time staying with Ruben and Beth and it was just as pleasant as the first time. They kindly set up a pack n play for my daughter as we were arriving late, and had a high chair out for meals. Highly recommend them to other guests."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The bungalow is a unique stay in Rockford - from the Arts & Crafts decor to the amenities the hosts Beth and Ruben offer. The location, set in a quiet neighborhood, is a convenient drive to any section of the city. Beth and Ruben are truly Superhosts. Although I would love to keep their place a secret just for us (!), I highly recommend The Bungalow to anyone wishing a comfortable and enjoyable stay! Do not pass up this opportunity."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was ideal for what I needed. Communication was clear. Hosts were readily available if need be.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A fantastic place. Great hosts, flexible, and very easy to work with. The house was everything I'd hoped for and a bit more. It has a really nice feel to it, very easy to feel at home there and I will stay here on my next visit if it's available."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was an AWESOMTASTIC experience! Would stay again 100%
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was our second stay at Beth and Ruben's place. This is a charming older home with great personal touches. We highly recommend it!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was our second stay for our family of 5. We love having this cozy home-away-from-home as an option when we are visiting Rockford! Ruben and Beth are very accommodating and truly go the extra mile.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Everything was easy, from check in to check out. They had a 30 page book of attractions and restaurants on the kitchen table, with a hand written note and a bottle of wine in the fridge.
Thankfully they had shower supplies, and hygiene items for us to use since we forgot ours.
We really enjoyed the bungalow, very spacious and private residence that was away from busy roads and sounds of the city. A perfect place to spend the holidays being focused on the ones you love."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Very cute place. Thoughtful handwritten note and breakfast and a bottle of wine available in the fridge! Bed wasn‚Äôt very comfortable but it was just one night.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Great Airbnb! Check-in was easy and the place was clean, kitchen was stocked and the hosts were quick to respond. I would definitely stay here again!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay!!!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,Really enjoyed our stay- the house is so well stocked! it‚Äôs a really pleasant home and we felt totally welcome and the hosts were very responsive and proactive. Great stay
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a lovely, warm, cozy home that feels like a warm hug. Walking distance to a grocery store and drug store (10-15 minutes). Charming 1930s style shabby chic decor, eggs, coffee and tea provided, lots of streaming options. Very nice. We would definitely stay again.
Quick notes for light sleepers or those with disabilities: There are occasional train horns at night, and the very occasional hot rodder on a nearby street, though the house itself is on a quiet neighborhood intersection. As this is a well-loved and historic home, there are old home noises: creaky floors, some banging in the water pipes, and a microwave that mimics a fire alarm when it‚Äôs done ;) There are five total steps from sidewalk to front door, and the toilet seat is a few inches lower than standard toilets, which can be tough for those with knee issues. If you‚Äôre fully mobile and don‚Äôt mind a bit of very occasional noise at night, this is an absolutely lovely option!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This bungalow could not offer more charm, amenities or comfort. Everything has been considered and our stay was brilliant. The house offers an opportunity to relax and unwind in several areas, a super fully equipped kitchen, and the hosts offer much appreciated essentials to welcome you to the stay. The location of the house is suitable to quickly access any area of Rockford and is in a well established neighbourhood. Highly, highly recommended."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Fabulous family-friendly place! We brought our 8-month old and we had everything we needed for a really comfortable stay. Ruben and Beth were also great about leaving some kitchen essentials to cover breakfast and plenty of information on things to do in Rockford!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,very accommodating. the provided breakfast foods was very appreciated.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beth and Ruben‚Äôs cozy and charming Bungalow is our favorite place to stay when we are in the area. It is like a home away from home because of all the thoughtful touches:
- fresh eggs and English muffins in the fridge
- selection of tea and coffee
- cocoa, oatmeal and popcorn for those moments when you need
- comfy furnishings, comfy pillows and beds, and plenty of soft blankets to choose from(!)
- whimsical and beautiful artwork (related to one of the owners)
- sunny front porch and serene - cozy back porch views (plug in the twinkly lights for a nice evening experience)!
I could go on‚Äî but instead it‚Äôs best to experience it for yourself‚Ä¶!
Thank you again, Beth and Ruben, for another memorable time at ‚ÄúThe Bungalow‚Äù!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was such a lovely and happy place to stay with good energy.
One of the very few places Id stay again.
This house had everything my 4 small kids and I needed to spend 2 nights here. We had enough dishes and utensils to make breakfast, lunch and dinners. We appreciated the free & clear soap and laundry detergents.
We liked the room darkening curtains in the bedroom , the high chair and the general coziness of the house.
The water sucks in Rockford (Smells
Like sewage and chlorine mixed together if that is possible lol) but a water purifier pitcher was provided.
I loved the real plants.
Did not like the spring mattresses on my joints. A futon mattress was available so I slept on that on the floor and the kids used the beds.
Everything was extremely clean!
We took a walk around the block. I was a little disappointed with the neighborhood. Besides on their street and in front of their house , It seemed like there was garbage , broken glass and dog poop everywhere but I also understand that Ruben and Beth are not in charge of what others do.
I‚Äôd absolutely live here if I enjoyed the city more."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"So clean, easy check in, and so nice to have breakfast there for the morning! We will definitely book this lovely house again."

2021-08-01,2,Stayed with kids,IMO: 1) Not a safe neighborhood. 2) Rodent infestation (food items had been chewed into and many rodent droppings found). 3) Loud bass music from cars. 4) Some animal was seen flying around in the basement. 5) Basement had a strong mildew smell. 6) House was decorated nicely. 7) Many things that a guest would need were provided.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family had a wonderful time staying for a month in this lovely home.

Did I mention the pyramid of board games and decks of cards? There was also a bottle of wine in the refrigerator (although we left it for the next guest) which was very thoughtful. Had a wonderful stay!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beth and Rubens home is truly a home away from home!

Perhaps the best aspect of this house was the hosts. They were incredibly helpful, kind, and with very clear communication. The check out instructions were simple. I have stayed at many Air BnBs and this was by far the simplest and easiest check out!
We had a super blast. I would certainly stay again if the opportunity arose! Do hesitate to book."

2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Where do I start, the place was absolutely AMAZING!! You would think we were in a much bigger city New York, Chicago, Dallas Texas. The general feel you get when you come to the house was pleasant and very inviting. Tom did a fantastic job keeping in contact with me 8 days prior to us even getting there. The indoor swimming pool the jacuzzi was a blast. The price we paid to stay here was well worth the value of the home, plus Tom allowed us to check out at 3:00 p.m. which don't often happen with a house of this magnitude. I would advise anyone looking for a great neighborhood an awesome house and a very trustworthy host to rent Tom's place immediately. Thanks again Tom, we will be back soon.

2023-04-01,5,Group trip,We went there as a group it was absolutely amazing swimming pool is fantastic and we had incredible time Thank you very much
2024-06-01,2,Stayed one night,"Unit is nice and comfortable. Location was good as far as proximity to local events that were going on. Only reason for the low rating is bc I think the host is aware (based on prior reviews at the very least) and others should be aware that this place has potential for more than just ""noise late"" which is whats stated in the description. There was a straight up club/bar party with loud music playing on the patio directly outside the bedroom & living room windows all night long and a food truck serving the party until sometime after 215 am when we finally packed our things and drove home without any sleep. Very frustrating that the host clearly states a zero tolerance policy for partying multiple times before check-in, yet has no problem being vague in the listing about the noise issue, and subjecting guests to no sleep and partying into the wee hours of the morning."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Paul's place is uniquely located above one of the top restaurants in downtown Rockford, Illinois. I was recently home to attend my daughter's graduation from Northern Illinois University. The centralized location was con convenient for me and my husband as well as family wanting to connect during our stay. as a visually impaired guest, I had some unique challenges with my initial access to the property of which Paul was immediately responsive during an after hours check in. he was also proactive and ensuring that no unauthorized vehicles or parked in the parking spaces allotted for my family. I definitely plan on staying here again. Paul is an awesome host and the design and art decor are beautiful, . The description of the property does not serve it justice Not to mention you can find anything you want to eat in this downtown area. That is a top priority, for a self proclaimed foodie"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Paul‚Äôs place was so cozy and clean. I was in town for a procedure and can‚Äôt wait to go back and explore a bit. Would most definitely stay here again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful place. So convenient exceptionally clean with everything you could possibly need.
What my husband and I loved the most what was how they stayed true to some of the original aesthetics of the building with all of the modern conveniences of today.
Our only regret was not being able to make time to dine at Abreo below. The restaurant menu looked amazing and it was the restaurant itself was so cute.
Great instructions and communication throughout. I would not hesitate to book here again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,great place to stay! Highly recommend!! only a few minutes drive from the BMO Center which was why we rented. Def worth the money!!

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great apartment and area of town! If you haven‚Äôt been to Rockford this is where you want to be. Would definitely choose Paul‚Äôs place again.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place is just as described. Clean, contemporary, comfy. Slept like a baby in the bed. Note any comments/reviews about the restaurant downstairs, if you go to bed early or are a light sleeper. It was no problem for us but keep in mind for you. We didn‚Äôt get the chance to try Abreo but hope to in the future. There IS a private patio that isn‚Äôt depicted in photos. I can imagine it‚Äôs a fun lil spot in warmer months.
Thanks for a wonderful stay!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved this Airbnb! The location is great in the downtown area. Great food within walking distance. The airbnb was beautiful and well kept. The host was very responsive to questions I had. I will definitely be booking again!

This year while visiting my parents, I decided to try Jackson's Retreat. It's an awesome space, well furnished, comfortable and has everything you'd need in an AirBNB. I didn't realize their was a private roof deck which was a nice surprise. Paul and Karen are great hosts, quick to respond and really stand out above the other AirBNB hosts I've interacted with. I grew up in the neighborhood and never imagined there were Rockford apartments like this one. Truly a gem!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was amazing will definitely be back everything was as it said it would be. Paul was super responsive stayed at one of his previous Airbnb‚Äôs. That was also incredibly nice. Love the bars and restaurants around there and write downstairs is one of the best places to eat and hang out in Rockford, definitely recommend this place.

So we found Paul‚Äôs place for a great price and it was within walking distance of The Standard. The place was amazing! Great art, super clean, and even provided snacks and drinks. Not to mention, that shower was so relaxing. I could‚Äôve stayed in there the entire day. Would definitely come back again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Love the place. Thanks again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I spent the night before and of our wedding at this Airbnb and LOVED it. The space was functional, airy and cozy. The back patio was so cute and private. There was so much space to move and enjoy our stay in Rockford. I loved the lighting in the apartment and the proximity to all that downtown has to offer. The hosts are incredible, we couldn‚Äôt recommend this place enough!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a great stay!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was one of the best places we have stayed at in Rockford. The location is excellent and easy to find parking. I thought it was very cool to be right above Abreo but still felt like we had privacy. The inside was modern, clean and felt like our home in the city. The shower was relaxing, and the bed had a comfortable foam mattress. Highly recommend this place."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The best spot downtown! Amazing location with cool vibes and unique space. If staying the weekend, it does get a bit loud from the office having a good ole time, something to keep in mind."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Paul‚Äôs place was amazing it looked just like the pictures. The private patio was awesome and the shower was amazing. I was visiting my son that attends the local college if available I will make his my home away from home.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay with easy access to the best food in Rockford. Would choose to stay again!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Thanks for a wonderful stay! We had a delicious meal at Abreo and then went right upstairs for a cocktail and relaxing.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great Place!! Fun, Quirky, Clean & Shower was amazing, walking distance to shops, live music, the river & the market. We had a great night as we passed through town. Rented scooters with our daughter, did a walk, shopping, and ate a great dinner. Awesome unique food at the recommended restaurant downstairs. Pricy but worth it. The specialty drinks were also amazing! The 10% off at the restaurant always helps entice you to try it and we were glad we did :)
Downside is it gets loud at night! Very loud. I'm not sure if it turns into a dance club or what, but there was a ton of noise, loud music & people on the sidewalk right below the window. It did say that when we booked, so we were not upset about it, but it was louder than I thought it would be.
Beds & bedding were ok. Also used the pullout couch, it was pretty rough, but great for kids!
Great stay. We would stay again and eat again for sure!"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Location short walking distance to the sports factory and many eateries. Everything was as described in the listing. Read the reviews for more details on the surrounding establishments. If you are lucky to be there on Fridays, the city market was fun to walk around and hang out. Nice added touch of bevies in mini fridge and snackies. Loved the layout of the place and the bathroom/back area made it extra private and NICE! Alexa assist was nice to play some music while hanging out. Abreo was quality food/cocktails/service. Highly recommend."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay! Paul was a great host and the place was lovely
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This was our second time staying at Paul‚Äôs place. It has a great location and the amenities are top notch (especially the patio!!).

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Jackson‚Äôs place is magical. We had a 22 person 7-course dinner on the rooftop deck and it went off without a hitch. Abreo is INCREDIBLE and being able to enjoy high end food outside in a private space with our guests was great! The shower/bathroom is JAW DROPPING!

We were able to see the fireworks on the 4th without having to deal with the crowd. We just stepped right out of the front door to enjoy the 4th of July parade. The shower is awesome as well. I would stay again just for that. There was also a fan! My husband and I are fan sleepers, and we left ours at home. I was headed to Target when I noticed one in the closet. Our host was very responsive. We had a few questions, and they were answered quickly. We will definitely stay again."

The outside patio was perfect for me to sit right my wedding vows .
I appreciate you letting me use your space to get ready at my wedding day .
The only issue I had was a shower, but I figured it out. I just couldn‚Äôt figure out the temperature setting.
Was a beautiful spot. Thank you again.
Would highly recommend if you‚Äôre looking for a cute little spot downtown area ."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Paul‚Äôs Airbnb was clean, full of great artwork, and had everything we needed for a great week. Perfect location close to everything. Swanky shower, comfortable living space. I wished I could stay longer."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Fantastic place to stay in downtown Rockford. The place had excellent amenities you would not get staying at a local hotel. The shower was five stars with its upgrades and 5 shower heads. We love that it was dog friendly too. I can‚Äôt wait to come back and stay to take advantage of the discount at the fantastic restaurant below.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I had a wonderful time at Paul's gorgeous loft home! The photos were beautiful, but we were blown away when we arrived and saw how big and beautifully decorated it was. The space had everything we needed for relaxing and some remote work. And the private deck with twinkle lights was the perfect way to spend an evening with a glass of wine. The loft is located above the restaurant, Abreo, which we highly recommend. The food was divine. And head a couple of doors down to Social Urban Bar for excellent cocktails and a cozy vibe. The location was great for walking to places in town, and only a few minutes drive from the riverfront walking path, which is also very lovely. We loved our time at Paul's place!"

2023-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"Super clean, easy check in, close parking, loved the space. The only issue was the internet connection was poor, we tried to watch a movie and it took forever to load and kept freezing. We gave up on watching a movie. Also shower was amazing but like owner states hot water does not last long with all shower heads on."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I have two toddlers at home and took a chance on our first airbnb to have a day date where we could take a nap and dine in peace.
My husband and I couldn‚Äôt believe how cool and trendy the space was and we truly felt as though we were in the city. The Swissotel in Chicago is my favorite place to stay and not only did this room have those vibes, but the bed was absolutely insanely comfortable. Perfect place to catch up on some Zzz‚Äôs and feel human again.
They were extremely understanding about our late check in time due to the fact that we didn‚Äôt want to be away from our little ones at night. Can‚Äôt wait to come back again next year! Thank you!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A very welcoming and warm atmosphere. Clean and very spacious, plus gorgeous sunlight throughout the whole apartment. Highly recommended if you‚Äôre looking for a relaxing getaway."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Paul‚Äôs place was incredible. It was very clean and very comfortable. The location was ideal for any activities you want to do in Rockford and close to amazing restaurants (check out Abreo downstairs), shops, and bars. I would definitely stay again!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,amazing place to stay
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The pet inclusion sold us as we have 2 yellow labs. Wonderful ambiance, art, bed, private patio, & shower! We didn't have the opportunity to use the gas stove, but will in the future! Great place, wonderful host!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Paul‚Äôs place was great ‚Äî clean, unique, walkable, so much more. It was an easy process to check-in and check-out, and was nice they had parking for you if needed. It was relatively quiet and peaceful, and had a cool eclectic feel to the space! Highly recommend going to Abreo downstairs, a fine dining restaurant, as it had incredible food and was convenient as it was right below the space. Also, there is a really great private patio, which isn‚Äôt on any of the photos and was such a nice surprise! Highly recommend staying here if and when you‚Äôre in Rockford."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was the perfect home-away-from home and work-from-home space for our week in Rockford. Spacious, clean, comfortable, easy and full of natural light. And, our meal at Abreo was delightful."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This Air bnb location is a great spot to have walkable access to a lot of the better restaurants and state streets bars and shops in Rockford. The loft is spacious and the setup is pretty stylish and cozy. The decked out shower is a big plus! Would definitely return
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay! The layout is great, and the vibe is super cozy and luxurious. Definitely took advantage of Abreo downstairs. Everything was easy to find, and the location is great in proximity to dining, coffee, and shopping. We're from the area and needed a temporary place to stay prior to closing on our home- I'll be recommending Paul's place to anyone who visits from out of town."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place for our team to use for Stroll on State.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,One of the best airbnbs I‚Äôve ever stayed at! The place was exactly as described and the food at Abreo was amazing. So convenient that it‚Äôs right downstairs. Would love to stay again :-)
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I spent a weekend here since it was close to our theater. Paul's place was absolutely beautiful and we felt right at home. He made sure everything was very usable and even left us a nice little care package. There were little places that were close to walk too which helped a lot with finding food. I wish we would have taken advantage of the restaurant below. Time just wasn't on our side though! I would highly recommend this place to any friends, and I know for a fact if I am ever in the area again I will be looking to book here again!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Stayed an extra night cause it was so perfect. Location. Layout. Restaurant below. All was well.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Everything was PERFECT! Beautiful apartment and very well kept. Plus, the shower was absolutely amazing! Our dog was very happy to just be able to come with us so thank you for that!
I would have loved to try the Resturant downstairs! It looked and smelled amazing but we didn‚Äôt plan on our schedule before the concert we were going to so we didn‚Äôt have much time! We will be back if we return the Rockford! THANK YOU PAUL!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved it! I hope to be able to stay here again! The shower was incredible üòç

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The host is great, the vibe and layout is perfect! Will definitely book again"
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is really a great re-imaging of the upper floor of an old building in downtown Rockford. The private entrance off the sidewalk was great. The modern style of the space and how it's appointed are a nice mix of vintage and new.
Don't count on the parking space provided as someone else is apparently using it too, street parking is fine just pay attention to the signs.
The Friday night we spent there was almost unbearable as a DJ was allowed to set up in the alley on the other side of the wall blasting away while a food truck and bar truck served a loud crowd until almost 1am. All those things are cool, but not for that long right outside the window.
Overall, a great location and amenities, just know what you're getting into in Rockford."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is so funky and fun. Perfect for a little getaway. Thoughtful touches like snacks and cold drinks in the fridge. Shower was amazing. And the bed was super comfy. Would highly recommend!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Things were great.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is a great location right on State Street. We walked down to the river to a brewery for supper and down the street for coffee the next morning. The space is decorated with clean lines, sharp features and cool accent colors. Everything was very clean and efficient. Highly recommend."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was my second time staying and would definitely come back and stay again! Nice and cozy right in the middle of downtown, only downside (which is a given), is that it gets a little noisy on the weekends with people out and about! But it was great overall!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean and comfortable space for a weekend getaway. We really enjoy our stay here and would definitely come back again!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had an awesome stay with Paul, he was very responsive, kind and welcoming! The space was right in the heart of Rockford with great restaurants and shops to explore. The loft was clean, beautiful, and spacious. Our only wish is that we had more time and could‚Äôve eaten at Abreo!
Will definitely stay here again if we come through Rockford!"
2022-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"Fun area was lots to do. The shower and unit were great. There was, however, an event going on outside til very late at night which kept us awake. Be aware that this is a possibility."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great spot in downtown Rockford above a tasty restaurant.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is the coolest! The apartment is expertly decorated with all of the amenities you would need. Be forewarned, this is an older building located in a hopping part of town. The evenings can be lively, which could be a problem for light sleepers. But if you are looking for a spot with character and life, this is the place for you!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Paul was awesome. It was incredibly hot outside and he came over and installed an extra air conditioner in the unit for us. Great communicator and host as always!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Jackson's is a stylish, spacious and very cool space in which to spend time in downtown Rockford. It's located on an eclectic downtown block on E. State Street, close to some great little boutique shops, bars and restaurants - Abreo right underneath is a great place for dinner, and J & K's Lounge only a couple of doors down is a great bar which hosts live bands, comedy, games nights and karaoke throughout the week.
The space itself is a large loft apartment, easily accessible with keypad door entry to a staircase that takes you directly up to the apartment (no corridors or lobbys to negotiate, very handy). Inside it's a large open plan living room and kitchen, with tasteful decor and some great (and varied!) artwork hanging on the walls.
A sliding door leads to a cosy and decent-sized bedroom with a closet and dressing table space behind. The main bathroom is a joy to behold with a large and modern walk-in shower with multiple shower heads and a digital temperature control. There is also an enclosed deck area which is a great place to chill out in the evenings.
The living room has plenty of comfortable seating and a large Roku-equipped TV. There's also a similar TV in the bedroom and a space heater if you get cold. The main temperature control is a digital system and was easily controlled.
The kitchen has a basic set of utensils and cutlery, enough to making cooking at home a possibility should you want to. There is short-term on-street parking right outside and a lot in the back as well.
Paul is fantastic at communicating to explain the check-in process and other info about the apartment. He was also very responsive to any queries we had during our stay. A nice little touch is that he offers a discount on the bill if you eat downstairs at Abreo - again, we highly recommend that you try it out!
Final recommendation - if you're in town when the nearby West Side Show Room has a show on, we urge you to check it out - they stage bold, brave and highly laudable productions and are a credit to Rockford. Go check them out at wssr.org
All in all we had a great time at Jackson's Urban Retreat. Thank you Paul!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is an amazing spot. It is very clean and well taken care of. Paul was incredibly good about getting back to me, he was also very patient. And you will love the patio!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The cutest bnb with the best shower! Cute area of town with things to do walking distance. Would definitely stay here again! Again, the best shower."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fantastic Stay!!
Paul's place is everything you could ask for and more. You are right by many restaurants within walking distance. The home is absolutely beautiful, bed is very comfy, rate is very reasonable, amazing shower, big kitchen, wifi, free parking... the list goes on!
If you're looking for somewhere to stay in Rockford, look no further! Paul's place is PERFECT!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for a competition our daughter was involved in over a weekend in April 2022. Communication with Paul was great from the start. Before even confirming the stay he gave us a heads-up regarding a late night event at the restaurant downstairs which might have made it difficult to sleep. We greatly appreciated his concern and decided to stay anyway. The event did not really make it difficult to sleep but we did hear the music.
The apartment was clean when we checked-in. The layout was perfect for our needs for the weekend. This was our first time spending any time in downtown Rockford and If we ever have to do it again, staying here will be our first choice. Also make sure you stop in to Abreo for dinner and/drinks, it is well worth it."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The home was spacious, clean and comfortable for at least the two of us! The shower is very nice and we thoroughly enjoyed this feature! Pictures are accurate and the patio is such a nice space (wish we got to use it) too! Echo Dot with Alexa feature was extremely handy as well, and enjoyed cooking a meal while jamming out! Overall, wonderful space and would recommend and stay again!"

This is the perfect spot to stay at. No need to think about it. Location. Aesthetic. Amenities. Book and see for yourself!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Paul was prompt in responding to all messages. The apartment was prefectly located with plenty of shops and resturants within walking distance. It was very cleanily , spacious and had a great deck but the shower had to be the best feature! The restaurant below is a must have I ordered the bone in ribeye with mashed potatos and cheese curds and it was by far the best meal I've ever had anyone who stays at this Airb&b and doesn't stop in for a bite to eat will definitely be missing out!"

They brought blankets to my room upon request. The shower was amazing! If you‚Äôre looking for an adult getaway this is the one!!!"
2021-11-01,3,Stayed one night,"Was a great space, with some problems. It‚Äôs not advertised that the restaurant below turns into a club at night, the you can hear distinct conversations through the floor until 2:00am. Not sure what happened with the water heater because we only had cold water to shower with."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,What a great place look forward to staying again. Thank You Very Much
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great

2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a pretty dope place to stay!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The loft was fantastic. The shower alone is worth the experience. The place was clean and very comforting. The fridge had extra water and sodas which was a lifesaver. Could hear the sounds from the surrounding establishments but nothing too loud. Would definitely go back and recommend it!

2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Roomy loft. Located above the restaurant. No restaurant noise but it is located on the major street in Rockford so there is street noise. Great 5 headed shower. 2 TVs-living room and bedroom. Nice small kitchen
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect. I stay at Airbnb's all the time for work and this is one of my favorites. Often the pictures don't match, but in this case, they do. There are good coffee shops, bars, restaurants - all within a couple of blocks."

2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely loved our stay! Awesome loft with an incredible bathroom. Great communication. Would definitely recommend.
2021-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"This loft was a very stylish and welcoming environment, and we greatly enjoyed our time! We very much appreciated the full-pot coffee maker (as so many Airbnb‚Äôs have switched to keurigs), and LOVED reading out on the private deck. Parking behind the building was easy and made access to the loft quick and convenient.
For future guests, it is important to note that there will be noise from the restaurant below as well as loud music from the nightclub across the alley until around 2am. If you love the night life and getting out and about, this is a great place for you. But it is not going to be quiet at night. It was very quiet as we slept in in the morning."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, easy parking, and stylish! I booked Paul‚Äôs retreat for a night while I was in town for a wedding, and it did not disappoint. Abreo, the restaurant below, will deliver to your door if you call down. Also check out the huge shower in the listing‚Äôs pictures - it was a real treat. I would book this place again in a heartbeat."

The River, restaurants, bars, coffee shops etc. City Market is just a few blocks away and we really enjoyed it!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This loft was surprisingly quiet given its location! It was clean and well-stocked, so it suited our short stay perfectly! Parking was a little unclear at first, but we figured it out eventually. A pleasant stay for any traveler(s)!"

2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a beautiful and amazing space to spend the night. Communication was great and all the pictures where true to the loft.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Molly has been more than accommodating. She has made sure my family has had a smooth transition into our forever home. Her communication is awesome and has been a blessing!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The home was beautiful. She had a lot of little extras, not required, but very much appreciated. I would highly recommend this home and hostess to anyone"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We booked Molly's lovely cottage for my new in-laws t stay at while in town for our wedding. It was the ideal location (only 7 minutes from our own place) and she thought of everything! The home was stocked with odds and ends like coffee, throw blankets, and board games. We were nervous about booking a place because my FIL doesn't get around the best and Molly was extremely communicative BEFORE we even booked to ensure her cottage would be a good fit. Thank you so much for helping us host the family Molly!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cute home and location! Flexible with time and check out

2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Molly's cottage was perfect for our family to spend a long weekend together! The cottage is as the pictures show, very clean & comfortable."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Molly is a great host! Her place was amazing! Exactly what we needed for our stay in Rockford. The home was so clean and I love the guest manual that not only included Wi-Fi, check in/ out instructions, but also included area information like restaurants, walking trails and things to do and see. What an added touch. I did a lot of cooking while there, and brought most of my own cookware ( everything but the kitchen sink). But, I really didn‚Äôt need to. Everything was provided. And The beds! Oh so comfortable! We truly enjoyed our stay and can‚Äôt wait to stay there again."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This Storybook Cottage was a beautiful place to stay while visiting Rockford. Perfectly located in Loves Park near Anderson Gardens we were able to get to all areas of the city quickly. The house was so beautiful. It was clean and quaint. It accommodated my family in such a more peaceful place and I am so glad we stayed here rather than a hotel. In the winter the snow turns this cottage into a fairy tale. The homeowner is extremely personable and made this stay so easy with great instructions and stellar communication!!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice cottage. Comfortable stay. Responsive and helpful host. Very good experience overall.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was neat and tidy and exactly like the pictures. Beds were comfortable and towels were plush. The kitchen had all the necessities however we didn't cook. She left a basket of snacks and K-cups for coffee. Bathroom had shampoo, conditioner and body wash which you don't always find and hate to pack. Molly gave us some restaurant recommendations and the house was ideally located for our needs. If we are ever in the area again, I'd definitely return! Thanks again!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Storybook Cottage is fantastic! Molly has taken care of every amenity that a guest could possibly need. A big reason why I‚Äôd like to stay in an Airbnb it‚Äôs so that we can cook for ourselves. By far the kitchen set up is the best Airbnb kitchen I have ever stayed in because there is every utensil and appliance that one would need to really cook like you are at home. Also, I really loved the bathroom design and the overall design of this sweet house.
We would definitely stay here again.
Thank you Molly for being such a excellent host!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,A little gem in a great location in Rockford!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Incredibly comfortable and convenient home in Rockford. We were in town visiting family for a week and it was the perfect spot for us. Molly is a wonderful host.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"It‚Äôs a beautiful old stone cottage that has all new appliances, furnishings, VERY clean, and has tasteful decor.
The house was well stocked with linens, cleaning supplies, bathroom and kitchen amenities.
Walking distance from the river and a beautiful walking path. Great neighborhood, we felt very safe at all times.
Molly was a fabulous host, always responsive with advice about restaurants, things to do, etc. We loved our visit and will definitely stay here again. Thanks, Molly!!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Molly was an excellent hostess and this was the perfect home for our stay in the area! It was so charming, extremely clean, comfortable beds and had all of the amenities we needed and more. They had wonderful touches like night lights and small fans available to use, high quality towels and coffee and snacks. Molly was quick to answer questions and provided clear check in and check out instructions. We loved this home and will be back!"
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,"We LOVED our stay in Molly's Storybook Cottage in Loves Park! The cottage is absolutely darling, VERY clean and in a wonderful location very close to a bike path along the Rock River and only 4 minutes away from the beautiful Nicholas Conservatory. When I was choosing an Airbnb for our stay my sister-in-law kept nixing my ideas as she felt the areas I was choosing were not in the safest neighborhoods in Rockford. When I came upon Molly's darling cottage she gave the green light and I can verify that we all felt very safe there. We were able to enjoy walks in the neighborhood and along the nearby bike path and truly enjoyed our stay there. Molly is an exceptionally gracious host and was quick to respond to any of my messages with excellent recommendations and help. She also ordered a new blender, with next day shipping, when we discovered the blender wasn't working. Sincerely, Molly was one of the best hosts I have had the pleasure of interacting with. Thank you Molly for a wonderful stay!"

2024-04-01,4,Group trip,"House was clean, nice, and peaceful. My only issue was no tv for the two nights I stayed there this includes antenna tv. I thought the host did an excellent job until this issue took place. There was contact but I was just told that xfinity was working on the problem. However, overall I still will say that that my stay was good. We were there for a funeral and she was accommodating to my family and I . I did appreciate that."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Quiet neighborhood,the house have all what you need and smell clean when we first get in to the house.

2024-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Gilma is a great host! She was extremely responsive and accommodating during our stay! The place was great for exactly what we needed. It‚Äôs in a great location. Peaceful but plenty of stores and quick restaurants nearby. The backyard bonfire was a plus. We loved all of the windows and fresh air and light coming through the house. For the price we paid this was a great steal. Thank you, Gilma!"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,Was perfect for our friends getaway weekend. Comfortable slept 6 adults and 1 child. Enough space for us not to be on top of each other. Had extra bedding accessable if needed. Definitely got a lot of use out of the ping pong table and card table area.

2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"The house was clean and spacious enough for all of us, yet still had a cozy at home feel. Compared to other rentals we have stayed at, this house was pretty well stocked. There were a variety of spices to use, plenty of dishes, silverware, and pans in the cabinets. The beds were very comfortable, and the house was pretty centrally located. We enjoyed the stay and appreciate the ease of check-in/out. Gilma was quick to respond and very pleasant to work with."
2023-04-01,3,Stayed with kids,"This house met basic needs. Sparse dishes and utensils. Dishwasher was hard to close. Lots of spices and oils which is nice. The house is very basic and is rough around the edges. The bed was very comfortable but the pillows were awful, they are like a family members that we know who have pillows that are 40 years old. There were a couple of blankets to use on the couches which were very nice.
The outdoor chairs are cracked. Gilma was very responsive and allowed us to check in a couple of hours early.
This is bare bones, the cleaning was obvious as the smell was very strong. Meets basic needs."

We had four adults and 3 small children and there was plenty of room for all of us! This was an overall great experience."
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,love the house can'twait to comeback
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"Thank you for giving my family such a positive first time experience. I knew it would be great, but they all thought it a terrible idea... Nope, it was perfect for my adult kids to be able to gather and just sit around together. A hotel would have allowed too much separation time."
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,Gilma - Thank you. We really enjoyed our stay. We had 6 adults and we were able to eat together and enjoy watching TV with plenty of room. The kitchen was well stocked and we found everything we needed to make a nice breakfast on Sunday. Due to our plans we were not at the house long enough to enjoy the firepit in the backyard as we had planned. The house was clean and the neighborhood was quiet. Everyone said they slept comfortably and there was plenty of hot water and pressure for showers. We look forward to returning the next time we have a family gathering in Rockford.
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,It was a great stay!
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"Gilma's place was immaculately clean and easily accommodated my wife and two other couples for our trip to Rockford. There is a nice foosbal and ping pong table in the basement, otherwise I would say it was a very comfy, no frills stay. Check in was super easy, and checkout is straightforward as well. All the water pressure, heat, air, etc was working great, and we were all very comfortable for the duration.
We visited the Alpine View Restaurant for breakfast nearby and really liked that. We weren't sure if the tap water was safe to drink (we thought it tasted bad) so bought water bottles at a nearby gas station; no Brita or filter in the fridge."
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"Great place, clean and close to everything. Great host as well."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place and kids loved the basement game room!

Well stocked kitchen (utensils, pots and pans, plates, flatware, etc.); even had basic amenities like butter, coffee (my personal requirement) and sugar & seasonings. The entire house is very spacious! The upstairs and basement handled our group of 5 Easily. Downstairs there was a card table, ping pong table, Fooseball, bathroom and laundry rooms. Our only regret was not being able to enjoy that because of our busy schedule this weekend.
Host was professional, and very friendly and understanding (late check in and 'late entries' to the event we attended). Very prompt with check in and check out procedures. Instructions were super easy."

2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cute ranch house. clean, comfy beds in quiet neighborhood. Plenty of space and the game room was fun too. Would stay here again. : )"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Gilma's house was perfect for our needs. There were five adults and 3 kids under age 5 in our group. Gilma's was one of the few places in Rockford large enough to accommodate all of us for a decent price. It was bigger than I expected, which was a nice surprise!
The nice bonus was the pingpong and fussball tables downstairs. We put the kids to bed and enjoyed pingpong tournaments without waking the little ones up.
If you're staying here with a tiny one (like us), bring a safety gate to put across the doorway leading to the stairs down to the lower level. Or push the love seat across the doorway, which is what we did.
I was also pleasantly surprised at the nice surrounding neighborhood. We felt safe. The house is also close enough to lots of things. We got groceries delivered easily via Instacart and then visited lots of local parks, the Nicholas Conservatory, the Discovery Center, and other close places.
Two thumbs up for Gilma's Airbnb. We all said the house was a home run and we'll be back!"

2021-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,Home has a lot of room for a comfortable stay. Stocked with everything we needed. House looked clean but felt a little dusty. A few toys rolled under the bed and it isn‚Äôt very clean under them. No smoking home but there is some type of smoky/dingy smell in the bedrooms. Overall it met our needs for a short visit.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is very nice and a great location from everything

2021-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,"My family and I stayed here for 3 days. It was a nice and quiet neighborhood, good location, house was bigger than expected. We loved the fuse-ball table and ping pong table in the basement. House was spacious. However, house was A little bit dusty, and beds comfy but the pillows were HORRIBLE (way too soft-left with neck and back pain), grass was unkept and be careful on the walk way leading up to the house-I almost broke my neck because the concrete has shifted leaving a giant crack/piece sticking up that you can easily trip over. Some of the rooms in the basement should probably have locks in case you have small children- one of the rooms was unfinished or something and does not seem to have much use. Overall stay was nice and just what we needed while in town and definitely would stay again. Thank you!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful nice cozy home a place u must stay in while in town

I definitely recommend this place for any type of small group gathering, you'd have a blast! :)"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I had a wonderful trip! The house and amenities are amazing. We didn‚Äôt even need to leave other than the store. We had four kids ages 8-3 yrs and they had a blast between the pool and the arcade room and never once said they were bored! Us adults enjoyed these items as well, and the set up was perfect for our two families. The living room was perfect for movie nights, and there were even sweet treats left for us. The kitchen was fully stocked, including trash bags. The best part was there was no to do list prior to leaving. The few times I had to contact Philip for any questions, he was quick to reply and help. This was by far my best Airbnb experience, and one of my favorite family vacations. We will definitely be renting from him again."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"If I could give this place more than 5 stars, I would. It honestly deserves it. Enough space for our whole group and more than enough entertainment to keep us happy. Great outdoor spaces to hangout at on the grounds and a quiet neighborhood to relax in."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I can‚Äôt say enough about how great this place and Philip are. Checkin was so easy and we were welcomed with wine, water and soda in the fridge, snacks for movie viewing and chocolates by all the beds.

We can‚Äôt wait to plan our next visit üòÅ"

The house is unbelievable and you‚Äôre located right on a beautiful course that is very reasonably priced. The arcade kept my group entertained for HOURS. Will absolutely be staying here again. No need to leave the house except for golfing. Thanks again Philip!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Are you kidding! Our family of 8 had a blast throughout our week stay. We kept busy every minute, including the rainy days. Big fans of the pool and huge living room. There was something to do for everyone. Definitely a home to unplug at and enjoy the peace and quiet.
Extremely clean, comfortable, and roomy home.
Might have made the mistake of having this be our first Airbnb experience because Phil has set our standards pretty high. Tough to beat this!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough about this place! My teenagers, husband and I had a blast! We never even left but for the grocery store.

We appreciated the well stocked kitchen, roomy accommodations, pool, game room, and hot tub.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our stay was awesome. The house was beautiful and so clean and well furnished. So relaxing and the grandkids (and adults) had a wonderful time swimming and playing all the video games! We watched cartoons and movies on the 85 inch tv in the morning and at night. We would definitely like to return next summer. We appreciated the quick communication and all the extra special touches! Thank you!
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,We've rented many houses over the years and I have to say that this one was IMMACULATE. Everything literally sparkled! The arcade was a lot of fun and all of the games worked properly. The pool and hot tub were clean and properly maintained.

Tons of video games for those of us that remember the 80's. Several little covered areas that provided places for our guys to talk about games and strategy in private. Quiet neighborhood and our guys are known for making a little noise. No complaints. We would repeat again if in Rockford for an event!!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Location worked great for our group of 4 adults and 3 toddlers. We were in town for a wedding and it was only a few mins to downtown. The crib in the master was really convenient and there were even a few kid‚Äôs toys. The neighborhood was quiet and felt safe enough.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great value! Minh was very quick with his responses and was able to accommodate my family on short notice for a funeral. The place has all the basics. Newly freshened up with fixtures, doors, paint, etc. There are street lights that are pretty bright through the blinds in the bedrooms (if you're light sensitive bring your eye masks) but it's a quiet neighborhood. We walked to The Norwegian for breakfast both days."

All instructions very clear, host SUPER responsive, with so much room for activities! I wish I had my whole family there as I didn't get to enjoy as much of the home as I would have liked. Glad I found this one and will definitely stay again when in Rockford. Any chance the host could own a few places in other cities I visit? CUZ they rock!"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Great host. Everything set up for a comfortable family stay. Very convenient location for area and amenities. Would highly recommend to anyone heading to Rockford.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Stayed here for a quick overnight trip! It was very much a blast from the past. Playing Hungry Hungry Hippo and watching VHS tapes brought back my childhood. Such a cool place to stay. Karen and Paul are super friendly and were always quick with responses!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This retro themed apartment was the perfect place to stay while visiting Rockford! And the restaurant Paul owns, Abreo, was wonderful, and just steps away from the apartment. Great food and great service!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I would definitely stay here again! So nostalgic playing VHS‚Äôs. The location is great. Restaurants, book stores, resale shops, parks, murals all within walking distance. We came for the Anderson garden and that was just a short drive."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Recommend
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was perfect for my son and I who were in town for his basketball tournament. We could walk to the gym. Great places nearby to eat and the apartment was great. Paul was very responsive and we would definitely stay here again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location love the movies. Great to watch ET Ferris Bueller‚Äòs Day off and taxi driver. It‚Äôs been a while since I had to rewind tapes, but it was amazing nostalgic great space love the food next-door."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Thanks
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came to Rockford for an Ice Hogs game. We loved staying at Paul's apartment. It was convenient, clean, and so much better than staying in a hotel like we have previously done. It was fun to look at the old magazines, too! We'll be back and we'll definitely stay here again."
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Paul‚Äôs place was great for a quick weekend trip to Rockford for a wedding. There was plenty to do around the Airbnb such as restaurants, shops and things to see."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Enjoyed our stay, had fun playing Atari, watching VHS throwbacks, and playing Hungry Hippos, lol. Oh yeah, thanks for the soda and goodies, especially the candy cigarettes!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place to remember the old days.
Highly recommend."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely LOVED our time here üòç It was recommended to us by someone that had already stayed there but we ended up going for it because of the retro vibes and because it is close to Abreo (a phenomenal restaurant that the host owns).
Host was very responsive and kind, and the space is VERY clean and cozy.
We ate at Abreo and absolutely ADORED it! We will crave that food for weeks to come! The food, the service, the atmosphere, EVERYTHING!
We will definitely be back!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was great! Everything went smoothly, and the place had everything we could need!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a fun time at Paul‚Äôs place. It was like staying in a little time capsule. I particularly enjoyed flipping through the 80s magazines and learned a few new things about microwave cooking! The place was clean, comfortable, had off street parking, and was close to everything we wanted to do while in Rockford. Highly recommend!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We needed a place to stay for one night to attend a concert at the theater. The apartment was neat & clean. It is also walking distance to the theater, restaurants, coffee shops and bars. There is only one hotel in the downtown area and it was way too expensive. This rental was the perfect alternative."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Fun place to stay! Lots of games to play, clean, cozy, and the host left a gift basket of candy/popcorn. The host provided clear instructions to find the place, park, and check in. Would stay again!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice and clean place, and friendly hosts."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"My wife and I picked Paul's place mostly due to price and location. Lots of walkable places to go and price was great for a short weekend in Rockford. The place was clean and exactly as described. Love the retro touches, we played Connect 4 and watched Taxi Driver on VHS. Paul recommends you visit Abreo during your stay, which right around the corner and I highly suggest you take his advice. The place was amazing! We loved the atmosphere, cocktails, and the food. Would definitely stay here again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,My girlfriend and I had a great time here. The place was beautiful and it brought back many great memories with the old games and movies. Private parking was a huge bonus to the location. I highly recommend this to anyone who plans on staying in the area!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to spend the evening. Filled with retro treats, games, and movies to bring you back!"
2023-10-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"I'll start by saying that the host, Paul, was very responsive! The space itself looks as described on the profile. It met our needs, however, we did have a few issues.
First, the address given to us after booking was not the exact address that shows at the entrance door so that created some confusion when we tried to initially get into the building. We also had issues getting inside a second time when the keypad stopped working. The host addressed both issues within minutes of us contacting him which was great.
When we got into the unit, the entire space was very cold. The heat was not on which was surprising since it is fall and chilly. Luckily, we found a space heater, however, we had to move it according to what room we were in to stay warm.
The shower labels are incorrect (hot label was cold water, and cold label was hot water), and at some point the bathroom light switches stopped working. The fridge also ended up freezing our food.
Other than that, convenient location!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Clean place. Great price.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was so comfortable and fun! Loved the closeness to all the things to do downtown.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful time staying in Rockford. This place was located perfectly to stores and entertainment. The place was spotless and the bed was amazingly firm. I can‚Äôt wait to bring my daughter next time - she would love the retro games!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is creatively designed and well-thought out! It was fun to see all they added to the space and had there to play with in terms of games and videos etc. it was wonderful and unique! Lots around and a discount to a restaurant nearby!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great stay! Easy check in and great communication from Paul.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Paul‚Äôs Retro apartment was so cute and fun! I enjoyed reminiscing and remembering the retro games, magazines, and princess telephone! We had everything we needed and the apartment was absolutely pristine as far as cleanliness."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, charming space, great communication from owner. The restaurant next door is a must, the food is excellent and the atmosphere is great. Amazing patio space in the back. Highly recommended."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Was a great stay overall! Paul was always very responsive and helpful, and was also flexible when we needed to add a day! The apartment was nice and clean! The building itself was very quiet, but there is quite a bit of noise from the street. Would definitely recommend if looking for a place to stay close to downtown!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We stayed in Rockford for my boyfriends birthday. I had asked him if he would prefer a day of luxury or experience. He picked experience! We loved the air bnb and all of the throwbacks. We had dinner at a local brewery on the river and ended the night playing games and watching The Sandlot on VHS. It was definitely an experience that we‚Äôll remember!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,The place was great - on the backside of the small downtown of Rockford. Everything was clean and well organized. Loved the nostalgia and enjoyed an old VHS!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute space, and the host was very helpful."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This stay was pretty amazing! The only joke I would leave is that it's not super wheelchair accessible if that is a need of yours.
2023-07-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Nice apartment, but didn‚Äôt communicate that I couldn‚Äôt extend my stay until it was too late. 3 star for poor communication and customer inconvenience. Otherwise, nice place."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Highly recommend this airbnb! Great central location in Rockford and the host is very accommodating
2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"Such a fun apartment in a great location! We loved be able to walk to all of the shops and restaurants. The only drawback to the location is the traffic noise was pretty loud. We enjoyed our stay though, and would book again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"excellent place, the service is very good. I recommend it."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a great stay! I really loved the 80‚Äôs nostalgia decor.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Just in town overnight, nice place, wish we had more time to take more advantage of the apartment and location, thanks!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Super fun stay ü§©
2023-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,I enjoyed the retro style theme. It‚Äôs located in a nice part of downtown. There are a lot of amenities within walking distance. They are very responsive hosts and I recommend not to overlook this fine establishment.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"First and foremost Paul was an amazing host! He was very flexible with our check in as we were a couple states away. Place looked exactly like the pictures. Only 2 downfalls, and 1 is just a personal preference. Firstly, it is very close to downtown so there is quite a bit of traffic in the area. It is also located near a firehouse ( I think) so I heard sirens constantly! This was a bit of an annoyance. With it being close to downtown, we also experienced a lot of people walking down the street shouting. Again nothing on the host, that is just life. Secondly, again just my preference, I felt a little uneasy having the same passcode on both doors. I think they should be different numbers. The camera at the top of the stairs helped ease my mind a little, but I felt uneasy leaving anything valuable in the room when we left. Please keep in mind we are country folk. Our nearest neighbor is almost a half mile away. Host was great, attitude of locals not so much."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay bigger than expected
2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great long stay would recommend for people looking for good food and nightlife within walking distance
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is exactly as described. I‚Äôd recommend it to other people.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great apartment and service, thanks Paul!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cool little Airbnb with neat vibes. Close to lots of fun. Paul was super responsive and helpful.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pros:
We were easily able to locate the building and the designated parking lot. When I entered the space, the 80s retro decor was exciting and the space felt cozy. We played some of the board games available and the Atari. The kitchen was adequately stocked. The bed was comfortable. The Airbnb is very close to many restaurants, shops, and not too far from downtown Rockford!
Cons:
Electric keypad to enter the building didn't work 3 times. Luckily Paul's restaurant is nearby and was able to get in contact with him to resolve the issue, and get a copy of the keys in case the power to the keypad went out again! The building is located near a busy intersection so it got a bit noisy at times. Stairs entering may be steeper for some.
*If you're able to, I would suggest getting a copy of the keys just in case (we stayed over new years weekend. When we came back around 1 am, the keypad wasn't working, thankfully we had a key!)
Overall, we had a great stay at this Airbnb and recommend it!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"The retro look and feel were fantastic, location was superb and walking distance from the best restaurants in town. Inside was clean, warm, and comfortable. Great place!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super cute apartment in a great location! Walkable to restaurants and coffee shops, and the apartment had everything we needed for a cozy night. We loved the character and attention to detail as well!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend staying here if you want a place close to downtown. We were able to walk everywhere, and it was the perfect spot. The unit itself was perfect for our weekend getaway. Had so much fun with all the vintage touches!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place. Decor and games were on brand for the theme. The location was central and easy to get to. We‚Äôre not used to city traffic so the cars were a bit loud for the kiddos going to sleep. We overall a nice place with a fun atmosphere. We‚Äôd return!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place to stay if you are wanting to be walking distance to a ton of food and drink options. Great location, great price, great vibe."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Paul was a great host and the Airbnb was in a great location in Rockford. He was very communicative and even left us some local beers to enjoy at the Airbnb. I‚Äôd definitely stay here again!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Just as pictured with a few nice welcoming surprises. Parking was easy and the area felt safe at night walking my dog. The bed was comfy and AC worked well. Excellent restaurant and nightlife within a short walk and a convenient drive for a lot of what Rockford has to offer. The host was quick to respond and clearly takes pride in their place. There are some steep steps leading up to the condo, but this was not a problem in my case. I would stay here again if every in town and available."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,sweet little place
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"super cute airbnb, great spot and very clean. would recommend!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Paul's place is a great place to stay. It was clean, has convenient and safe location and had some really nice touches for the theme. Would absolutely stay again. Also allowed our two fur kids to stay which is much appreciated!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb was great! We wanted a great location and walkability in Rockford - and we got just that. Charming apartment, very clean, and comfortable bed. I would recommend staying here."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stop for the night. Cool retro pad!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This airbnb is fantastic. The space is clean with great amenities. The ""retro"" theme has a lot of attention to detail and is really fun. And you are only a few steps away from a lot of fun places to go in Rockford. Check-in is easy and the door code/lock system works really well. The hosts are quick to respond. Would stay again and definitely recommend."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I stayed here for 6 weeks while on a clinical rotation and it worked out perfectly for me! Paul was always very quick with responses whenever I had questions about anything or needed help with something! There are a whole strip of restaurants / things to do in walking distance from the air bnb. My favorites were Abreo (you get 10% off for your stay and they also gave me a free bottle of champagne!), Thai sisters cafe, and Daniel‚Äôs chocolate! I also loved that we were right above a little book store and crystal shop that I stopped in very frequently. The area is safe and the people are super nice! If you‚Äôre looking for a place to stay in Rockford, even long term, I definitely recommend."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location. Apartment was super clean and well appointed. Hosts Paul and Karen are very attentive and communicated details about check in, etc perfectly. All details about the apartment listed on the site are very accurate. Will definitely return for another stay."
2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very responsive, hospitable and detailed hosts. The apartment itself was clean and close to restaurants/bars. I would book a stay here again as the hosts really do care about your satisfaction during your stay!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great
2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb is close to everything- downtown is steps away, and you‚Äôre close to all of Rockford‚Äôs best restaurants! My partner and I did not take advantage of all the amenities (such as the VCR movies), but we had so much fun playing the board games and Atari that were available to us.
One problem that my partner and I both had were the fact that there are stairs upon entering the apartment. Not sure if we both skimmed over this in the listing or if this wasn‚Äôt made clear- but I have a disability so this was a bit of a challenge for me. However, after a couple times going up and down these stairs- we got used to it.
Checking in was a breeze! I will note that it was a bit difficult for Uber‚Äôs and Lyft‚Äôs to figure out where to drop me off, but that‚Äôs only if you don‚Äôt drive.
Cleanliness was good. Upon arriving there were a few stains on the bed, however I was able to spot clean and did not want to cause any fuss over some stains that were probably due to color transfer in the wash.
Things I wish the Airbnb had: more things in the fridge. Upon arriving, there were two water bottles and two cola drinks. I‚Äôve stayed in Airbnb‚Äôs with my family that had fully stocked fridges and cabinets with basic meals like oatmeal, cereal, some fruit, just basic food necessities. Didn‚Äôt bother me too much since I know every Airbnb is different.
The Wi-Fi was great, and so was the Atari! We spent quite a lot of time playing Pac-Man. We enjoyed the smart tv quite a lot!!
Thank you once again, Paul and Karen!
-Olga and Brandon"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a great Airbnb right in the downtown area. Walkable to lots of great restaurants and shops, there is so much to do in this space. The apartment was beautiful and clean. It is definitely a gem in the city. We stopped into Social Urban on our way to a concert; couldn't have been a more perfect stop for drinks and charcuterie."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location and huge space! Paul‚Äôs listings were all great, and he was around to take care of any issues. I was in Rockford for work, but would definitely come back and stay here for a food /fun/ friends wknd!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice place!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to use as home base for exploring Rockford. Enjoyed hanging out in inviting, eclectic space."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay! The plus was the Christmas light display across the street that my daughter loved to see from the upper-level loft. My husband and I appreciated the simplicity of the decor and the games were a huge addition. We didn't get to take advantage of Abreo Restaurant but we definitely will next time
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Good place!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome place
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as described. Responsive host and spotlessly clean. Great natural light from the big front windows and a skylight with a dedicated bedroom that is snug and well appointed. Good sheets, pillows.
The area is walkable with a variety of restaurants. We would stay here again in a moment."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean. Very spacious. It was a great experience. We loved it.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice place
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect location to stay with a lot of great local restaurants! The host was very responsive and the place looks exactly like the photos. 10/10 would definitely stay again.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Would stay again!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great place. Clean, big space."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous loft in downtown Rockford and bonus that it‚Äôs located above Abreo, a fantastic restaurant. I didn‚Äôt walk around downtown in the evenings on the advice of locals, but Paul‚Äôs place felt very secure. An enormous space for one person and very comfortable bed. Great stay!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cool space, fun art, and clean. It's a great location for walking to Rockford downtown events and local shops. Owners were great and the hospitality at the downstairs restaurants to the Airbnb guests was the cherry on top of the stay. Five stars for value...with a caveat. The owners price was a good value. The Air B & B fees almost cost the owner a star."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Me and my girlfriend came to RockFord for a show. Thus Airbnb location was in the perfect location as it was a 4 minute drive to the venue and an added bonus was that the apt was on top of Abreo! A definite plus! The layout was very cool and clean, we really digged the loft atmosphere of the apt, and the old school video game console was extremely cool! Only downside was the cleaning cost of $85 that was included with the initial fees, at $110 per night for the airbnb the fees eclipsed the initial fee. Other than that we loved it!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very comfortable, modern space. Appreciated the appliances available. Took advantage of arcade & slot machines. Decor was what made the place stand out before we booked. Happy to find that it was clean and well stocked. No issues at all and would stay again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place! Stayed for a wedding in the area since there aren‚Äôt many hotels. Worth the price!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From the moment you walk in, this place has good vibes. I don't really know how to explain it but you feel welcome in the loft. Maybe its because it's neat, maybe it's because the bed is comfortable, or maybe because I really liked the arcade cabinet, either way I would recommend staying here."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay. Everything about our stay was amazing. Thanks for being a great host.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious apartment right in the heart of downtown. We had a great time checking out the city and all the activities within walking distance, which were surprisingly a lot. Parking was easy and traveling into or out of the area was too."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great apartment and a lot of room. Very much a home feel.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a beautiful place to stay.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family stayed at Paul's place on a Sunday/Monday and greatly enjoyed our stay. The bed and couch bed were very comfy, and the bedding was high quality and cozy. We had everything we needed in the kitchen to make a meal one night, which was very convenient. The downtown Rockford location is perfect. The apartment is light and bright and clean as can be. Paul and his team were great to communicate with, check in and out were simple. We especially loved the arcade-style multigame. All 3 of us played and had a ton of fun. The apartment is very quiet. It's a great spot!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Well Designed AirBnB in a great location
Paul/Karen were accommodating and great at communicating in a timely fashion.
The family collectively thought that these were the items that stuck out the most about the location:
Loved the Decor - shabby chic furniture, mid-centry modern design, board games, arcade machine, and wall art.
Overall flow, Layout, Fung Shui - Open design in the common room was large enough that we were able to play different games in parallel and still interact with each other.
Proximity/Options for Dining - Native to the area and moved to MA last year. That being said, I have yet to find any restaurants in MA that can hold a candle to the culinary gems in Rockford."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stayed for one night. Easy access, clean and well thought out. Thanks!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had our wedding in rockford and stayed at this airbnb to prepare and to be close to family. The apartment is really cool. The arcade machine was a huge hit! It is right downtown rockford which can get weird at night but no one messed with our cars or stuff. Loved the place!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The space was super clean and trendy. I enjoyed my time here. I chose this place because of location, so my friends and I could take advantage of the restaurants that were close. However I was the only one that ended up making the trip. So I didn‚Äôt get to enjoy it like I wanted. The space is nice and fun! I would definitely stay again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My girlfriend and I had an amazing stay at Paul‚Äôs loft. It was very clean and roomy and had everything we needed for our last couple of days before we would fly back to the Netherlands. The neighborhood is nice and we loved drinking beers and cocktails at Prairie Brewery at the riverfront. Excellent place!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome spot. Everything is in walking distance!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Definitely Will stay again
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The loft was great. Very well appointed with all that you need.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place to stay for the locations within walking distance and the great amenities. Everything that was listed was there and more! I felt safe with the security measures despite it being in a busy part of town. I would definitely suggest this for anyone looking to stay in the area!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of our favorite stays so far with Airbnb, the location and space were beautiful, spacious, and super cozy! There's an arcade console, slot machine, Nespresso maker, lot's of books and board games, great art, and ornamental steel fixtures, so that was all an added bonus. Bedroom and bathroom were neat and comfortable. Abreo directly below, was one of the best meals I've ever had and we're already dying to go back to Social for more midnight milk and cookies as well as the rest of the menu! This is the perfect place to stay in downtown rockford if you're looking for a night out or just staying in and ordering take out. We look forward to coming back very soon! A few friends have stayed here previously and all loved it as well. We can not recommend this place more! Thanks again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place & host‚Ä¶ will stay here again.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Franklin‚Äôs place was perfect for our stay in Rockford. It was so clean and spacious! I would definitely stay there again.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Easy to access and good location. Walking distance to a few restaurants and bars. Got a little loud at night being on a busy street but the bedroom is back from the street and didn‚Äôt prevent sleep.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Excellent stay at this Airbnb, location was perfect- heart of downtown- central location made it easy to walk to local shops, restaurants and coffee shops. Rockford has a lot to offer-plenty of sight seeing opportunities: museums, gardens, historical preservations.
Paul ensured the Airbnb was meticulously clean and well-maintained, definitely felt like a true home environment, high quality linens and towels, comfortable furniture, modern/contemporary pop artwork, real tropical plants, a thoughtful wide array of books, natural lighting, a huge open space- very aesthetically pleasing. The kitchen area is very modern and simplistically chic: an amazing island to accommodate culinary delights, lots of counter space and quality cooking utensils-overall a very cozy and comfortable experience, my six year old son especially appreciated the retro arcade. Would definitely recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking to stay in Rockford- you won‚Äôt be disappointed!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice hipster loft: very 'design', rustic with clean lines, exposed brick, high ceilings, industrial, dark graffiti-style art. Beautiful bathroom, I thought. Upstairs in a downtown area. There's a working old-school video game machine on which you can play games from the 80's. The bedroom is nice too. All in all a good experience."
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at Paul's place was great! The space was beautiful and spacious and a great location.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved staying at Paul‚Äôs loft downtown Rockford. We chose the place simply off of the vibe we got from the pictures in the posting. The art throughout the loft, that island and of course the throwback arcade!! As soon as we walked in the vibe was set. We loved the location and convenience of having restaurants/bars and coffee shops at a short walking distance. So much good food at a short distance. We also received a 10% discount while enjoying dinner at Abreo (downstairs from the Airbnb) and the food there was absolutely amazing!!!! The ONLY thing that would‚Äôve made an extended stay better would‚Äôve been a washer and dryer and full size stove. They do have a 2 burner electric stove to plug in but honestly with so much good food around we hardly cooked. Thank you for an amazing stay and great experience.
Due note that due to the location of being downtown and around bars it can be noisy at night especially on the weekends but that‚Äôs also part of the downtown experience."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, artwork all around,
lots of good restaurants and they even give you a discount at the restaurant below the apartment. Host was extremely fast to respond when I had accidentally left a bag. Great stay"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very beautiful, open loft design. I enjoyed staying here."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you don‚Äôt know Paul personally you‚Äôre missing out. Here‚Äôs a guy who loves Rockford and wants other people to love it too. One of us lived in Rockford for 30 years, the other one was visiting for the first time and it could NOT have been a better way to introduce the particular charm of downtown. Location is perfect, parking is a breeze, apartment itself is beyond awesome. We walked into a clean, spacious, comfortable, and incredibly unique space just like Rockford itself and had so much fun even just for one night. If this listing pops up for you- TAKE IT. Don‚Äôt second guess it. You‚Äôll be well taken care of by people who have repped local love since the beginning & they deserve your business more than you know."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,love the place it was closed to the hospital were I was able to go and see my mom I would definitely recommend for ppl to stay there
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean, beautiful, and felt like home. Most of Rockfords Airbnbs are over priced but this one was Worth every dollar."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,great stay for my family!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Paul communicated clearly and quickly. His place was clean and well decorated.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect place. Perfect location. Perfect host.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"4 people checking in for 1 night over the weekend. Aesthetic, spacious loft which felt much bigger than the photos and great location (so much within walking distance). Very detailed text and photo instructions making check-in/check-out/parking a breeze. Loved that there were some snacks and drinks provided! With the full kitchen we opted to cook together in the space but found it lacked a few items that would have made it easier. Listing said there was a microwave but there was not. We also reached out to host after checking in for more information on an item but didn't hear back for hours. Host said they were working at the time so I imagine this won't be a regular issue. We knew there would be noise so we made use of the arcade/slot machine/Roku at night but the space below didn't seem as vibrant as others had described while we were there. Overall we enjoyed the space and would consider staying again!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great roomy 1 Bedroom that was well appointed with everything or anything you might need. Very well decorated loft space with ability to cook or go out to restaurants and bars within walking distance. Only improvement would be identifying the entrance doors with a picture and/or the address on the door
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"While in town for my dad having surgery, Paul's place was a comfy respite after a long day. We really enjoyed the easy check-in, TVs with all the streaming services, local restaurants and bars, and plenty of linens and self care items. We will definitely be back again!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place was amazing. I will always book with Paul when I'm in Rockford.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay at Paul‚Äôs place! Clear instructions for entry, clean space, beautifully decorated, and had a lot of nice amenities! We enjoyed playing the vintage arcade game and lounging on the couch in the nicely decorated space! Despite there being a restaurant below, we didn‚Äôt hear any noise at night! The place was relaxing, homey, and the hosts were very responsive! Would definitely stay again if we are in the area!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The loft was clean and comfortable. We loved the modern and urban chic art and furnishings. We thought it looked better than the pictures. Also we appreciate the thoughtful touches like the welcome basket, Nespresso machine, video arcade and drinks in the fridge. Other reviews mentioned the noise from below, which is true on Saturday, but it was mostly quiet during the week. The noise and music didn't bother us too much. We would definitely stay again."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I chose Franklin because it was the only AirBnb in downtown and it looked cool. If I'm going to rent someone's space as opposed to a hotel I look for a unique experience and Franklin fit the bill. In spite of the Arctic Vortex we were able to find food, take short walks and just enjoy the ambience of a Christmas display across the street. We ate dinner at Irish Rose, brunch at Abreo's Christmas Eve, which was fabulous. Loved the decor, the food, the drinks and the staff. Had a pizza delivered Christmas Eve. On Christmas we braved the cold and walked across the river and saw the downtown. Drove through the light display at Sinnissippi Gardens and walked through the lights around the Conservatory. Back to the loft...I loved that the space itself said everything, minimalist but with dramatic art making a splash. We had everything we needed. One suggestion might be a microwave, although the toaster/baking/convection oven would fit the bill for most people."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really cool space-was very happy to have been recommended to stay here because of the ample amount of space, amazing bathroom and great location."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Was looking for a place close to downtown restaurants. This listing is upstairs from one, can't get closer than that!! GREAT place ... clean, comfortable, open & spacious. Arcade games were a pleasant surprise and fun for all. Host was super responsive and helpful. I would HIGHLY recommend this beautiful loft in Rockford."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriend and I stayed in Paul's loft while back in IL visiting family. I grew up in Rockford and could haven't imagined there were spaces like Paul's! The loft is amazing, more space than you'll need and tastefully decorated. It had all the necessary amenities (and more). Paul left us snacks, coffee and soda which was a nice touch. After being surrounded by family for a few days, we spent a night in just lounging and it was super comfortable. Communication was clear and check-in was a piece of cake (keypads on both doors). Paul touched base with us and always quick to respond pre-trip and during our stay. Location was perfect and there was a block party one afternoon which was fun. I scoured AirBNB for a place in Rockford before booking Pauls and I have to say, this loft can't be beat."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Very responsive and accommodating!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a top notch and chill space! Paul was swift in his responses and saved my behind when I mistakenly booked only one night instead of two.
If my travels bring me back to Rockford, this will be the first place I stay!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Spacious is an understatement. Scrupulously clean and spectacular hip loft apartment with everything you would want or need. The latest appliances and gadgets and a most responsive host. Could have stayed a month.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location in Rockford. Spacious and super clean!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Paul‚Äôs place was in an amazing location, super cozy and clean, and easy to check in/out. Would definitely recommend!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The loft was very spacious, clean and well prepared. We enjoyed having the big kitchen to cook in & the cozy set up for movie watching. The place was probably one of the cleanest air bnbs I‚Äôve ever stayed in which was much appreciated. Paul was very quick to respond to any issues and helpful the entire time. It is a cool location with lots of restaurant options nearby. Would stay again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Check in was a breeze, accommodations were clean & comfortable, and communication was prompt. We had a great stay!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great Place
Great Location
Great Host
Had a wonderful short stay"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This is an amazing loft in the heart of downtown. Plenty of amazing restaurants within walking distance. Even with the nearby bars it was quiet in the Airbnb.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved the aesthetic of the loft and the location as well. Honestly did not want to leave. Very clean and homey
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A must stay if you are going to Rockford
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, clean and super comfortable. Wish we could have stayed longer. Great hosts with fast and helpful communication. Can‚Äôt wait until our next stay."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for letting us use your space! We‚Äôll be back in April!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great space in a great location! The home is beautifully decorated and very clean.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful, albeit brief, two-day stay. Everything is exactly as stated and pictured. Exceptionally clean, well organized and included a lot of very thoughtful amenities!
Check-in and parking were effortless, and the restaurant located below the Loft apartment was delicious. Everything was outstanding.
Very much looking forward to returning, and staying longer next time!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"A really cool place to stay. Spacious, clean, and cozy. Highly recommend visiting Abreo below for a meal and drink; it was delicious! And playing some street fighter on the arcade machine after dinner was a lovely way to end our day! So fun."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a fun place to stay. Everything was perfect! Would love to stay here again.
2022-08-01,3,Stayed one night,"The loft is beautifully decorated and has everything you would need. It was impeccably clean. The space was open and had fun things like games and books. The location is great for accessing Rockford but please note that the restaurant below turns into a nightclub after 10pm and the music reverberates and is extremely loud and physically felt via vibrations in the loft until 1:30am on a Friday night. If you‚Äôre out and about until late maybe this won‚Äôt bother you. We came into town after a long drive at around 11pm and walked through the sidewalk in front of the club with a large crowd outside to access the entry to the loft. The music is not only heard but felt within the space, particularly in the bedroom. Of course I expected normal city noise like talking or cars outside, but the nightclub music was beyond anything I have experienced and I lived in NYC for two years. Maybe on a weeknight it is better. We woke up Saturday morning and it was peaceful and enjoyable. Paul was easy to communicate with throughout. I will also echo what another guest said about not being able to lock the space as there is another residence that shares the same locked entry and you don‚Äôt have a key for your door. You can of course lock the space when you are inside but just note that when leaving if staying for more than one night."
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place. You feel like you are staying in an art gallery. The bed was very comfortable.
2022-07-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"This is a really great and cool loft apartment with an industrial modern/MCM aesthetic, a slot machine, a real full-size arcade game, and great screen print art throughout. Good air conditioning throughout.I loved staying here and would stay here again. The location is great, right in the heart of everything, and was peaceful and quiet except for one night when the club next-door played dance music with a strong bass into the night. Occupants should note that although there is a secure lock from the outside to get into the apartment building, there was no lock on the front door of this unit so should take your belongings with you when you leave the unit. I didn‚Äôt have anything I needed to take with me everywhere except my wallet and cell phone, but if you were someone who would like to leave your laptop or something I can see where that might be a concern. Hopefully the owners will put a lock on the door. There was a major negative during my stay but it did not have to do with the unit itself, it was that the Wi-Fi went out and they were unable to resolve it. This seems like an unusual problem for them and I‚Äôm sure it was just a one off. In order to stay there again I would ask them what their plan was if the Wi-Fi went out, other than that I really highly recommend this place as being beautiful aesthetically and in a great location. The only reason this place did not get an excellent rating is because the Wi-Fi did significantly impact my stay as a required it for some work I had to get done and would‚Äôve liked to have streamed TV shows in the evenings.. my AT&T telephone plan didn‚Äôt have the greatest signal there so it wasn‚Äôt a good alternative.
All things said and done, I will definitely try to stay there again when I go back to Rockford."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a fabulous place! Loved the bed, sitting area, patio and bathroom! The shower was fantastic! Really fabulous after a day of hiking at the state park! I had a small issue checking in. But it all ended in my favor! Paul was super quick to communicate and help me! I would go back!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The location of Paul's place is ideal for spending time in downtown Rockford, which is what we were looking for - Within walking distance to restaurants and nightlife activities. Paul was very responsive and had helpful suggestions. We will look into staying here again, when we come back to visit friends. Thanks Paul !"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Airbnb was as advertised. It was clean, spacious and comfortable. The downtown area has plenty of restaurants within walking distance."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Very cool space in an excellent location. Really enjoyed the arcade games!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was the ultimate place for a business travel stay! We loved the 10% off at abreo and the location that was walking distance to everything downtown. Super clean, extremely comfortable bed and great amenities."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Would definitely recommend this space!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you‚Äôre ever in the Rockford area and you need an AirBnb, look no further than Jacksons Retreat! Everything from cleanliness, prime location, to the actual space itself is top tier, especially for the price! You won‚Äôt regret staying here!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Was exactly what were looking for, very spacious, great location, was comfortable, and safe. Would definitely recommend and would absolutely book again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. Carol is a very welcoming host and goes above and beyond to make sure you have a comfortable stay. Location is private and serene - plenty of space. Perfect for our UHaul truck moving cross country to park and feel secure about our belongings. Would recommend!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"WOW‚Äîwhat an amazing place!! Carol and Steve were the perfect hosts, and they have such a remarkable gift of hospitality‚Äîthe best we've ever experienced. Their love and attention to all the details created such a warm and inviting atmosphere. My husband, daughter, and I stayed for two nights and couldn't be happier with our stay. The farmhouse is beautifully decorated, peaceful, and serene. We felt such peace and tranquility--a haven to escape to amid our busy schedules. Being in the middle of the country surrounded by open land, horses, and paddocks was a sanctuary for our souls. We are so happy to have found this treasure and look forward to returning again soon!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Always an excellent experience.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent stay as always!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We only stayed one night, but we will not soon forget this Airbnb. Carol's place was cute, comfortable and included all the amenities of home. But we really, really liked the surroundings.
Even though Carol's place is only a few minutes off the interstate, you find yourself in a beautiful and peaceful rural setting. We had one of the most peaceful and relaxing evenings we've had in a long time."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Carol‚Äôs place was a perfect getaway for us during our softball tourney weekend. It was relaxing and spacious for our family of 3 and our dog. Carol went above and beyond with her homemade treats and breakfast ready for us! It was a great value and we would definitely stay here again if we are in the area! The horses and property are very peaceful!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We stay at Carol's on our way back and forth to Florida with horses. Always a great stop on our journey.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Steve and Carol were very welcoming and a pleasure to talk with. Accommodations were very comfortable and the kitchen was well equipped with thoughtful snacks and breakfast. We will happily stay at their place again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful facility for horses and the Airbnb was very clean, nicely decorated and well organized. We will definitely stay at Carol‚Äôs again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Thank you for making our stay feel like home. From all the dog friendly amenities as well beautiful accommodations, we will definitely stay again!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"A perfect place to rest and do your activities , Carol and her husband are very kind in showing off their beautiful horses"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Carol is a great Host! She was quick to respond to our questions. Lovely apartment and setting. Thank you so much!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a lovely place to stay --clean, comfortable, and welcoming. Although just a few miles off the highway, the place is located on a rural road and very quiet. We apprecited the well-stocked kitchen and fresh raisin bread. Carol and Steve have an exception Airbnb."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,A beautiful place to stay! The pictures don't do justice of how nice a place this was to relax and visit. It is in a great location to get to several places of interest and Steve and Carol both treat you like old friends if you have time to visit with them. Their farm and the Cherry Valley area are very clean and nice to visit.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Carol and Steve were great hosts, there place was beautiful and peaceful. The apartment was pet friendly and very well stocked. we would definitely stay here again when in the area."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful stay at Carol‚Äôs place visiting family for Easter. A lovely place and very clean and accommodating. We appreciate that we could bring our dog and there were extra touches for our dog. If you get a chance to stay here, get up early in the morning and you‚Äôll see how peaceful it is to stay there."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful little bnb. Really enjoyed our stay. Highly recommend!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Carol communicates very well and has a beautiful little place that is comfortable and well laid out. Check in and out was easy.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place. Peaceful and lovely surroundings.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Neat, clean, well appointed, great quiet location. Hosts are wonderful, lots of nice touches you don‚Äôt get elsewhere. Very highly recommended!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Excellent stay! Easy to find in a nice rural setting. The nearby small quant village of Cherry Valley has an excellent Italian restaurant and coffee shop. We would return.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Always enjoy this lovely, peaceful space. Carol is a wonderful host - such thoughtful touches! Looking forward my next stay‚Ä¶"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Carol's place was top notch! I needed a pet friendly location to stop in for the night on a long drive and Carol's home was easy to get to with beautiful farm surroundings. I immediately felt right at home with my pup and was sad I couldn't hang out for a few days instead of just an evening. The space was cozy with every amenity a traveler could need (private space with private entry, washer/dryer, linens, coffee, easy parking, comfortable bed, cozy lighting and furnishings, toiletries, etc.), including dinner and breakfast! We also received a farm tour on the morning we were leaving and were delighted to have time to get to know Carol and her beautiful horses. Anytime I pass through this area, I'd happily return to Carol's lovely farm home!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lovely country B&B! Comfortable, quiet, and has everything you‚Äôll need. Carol left homemade soup, fresh bread, dessert and some other staples. Even had dog bowls and treats for our pup. It was clean and cozy. This is going to be our new go-to when we need a place to stop for the night on our long drive back home to visit family."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a brief stay at Carol's apartment on the Victory Reigns Ranch, and it was perfect for us and our dog! A super-quiet setting close to anything we could possibly need. And we didn't need anything -- Carol offers snacks, breakfast, and even an extra toothbrush! We will look here first for our future visits to the area."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely loved this place, it was so cozy and comfortable. A small retreat from our long road trip. I am beyond sad I didn‚Äôt realize there was sausage and gravy already made in the fridge because I would‚Äôve had that for breakfast but the homemade cookies were delicious and Salamones Italian was just beyond words. We were so comfortable here and we absolutely would recommend to stay."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Carol and Steve always make guests feel right at home. They are especially attentive to our daughter with special needs (and is recovering from a back surgery) by making sure she gets to see the horses on site. This time a bonus getting to feed them! Can't say enough about this place and the hosts!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful stay! The hosts were so sweet and the place was nice and cozy. Exactly what I needed.

I also really liked that the breakfast already being available for us and we just had to warm it up. That was very convenient. The bed was super comfy also. I wish I could have stayed longer than the one night.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful and peaceful setting, perfect as a quiet place to rest after driving all day in the middle of a road trip. Appreciate that it was dog-friendly! Carol and Steve were also so kind to mail us back a charger we accidentally left in the unit."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay at Carol and Steve's place. It was clean and spacious, with many nice amenities to make for a very comfortable stay. We were especially grateful for those nice touches -- like snacks and drinks -- after a long day of driving. The ranch is beautiful and it was a delight to visit with the horses in the evening at the fence, and then again in the morning to hear more about their stories while Carol tended to them. My cats, fianc√©, and I felt welcomed to the space and we all slept hard in the quiet, rural location. Highly recommend!"

Lots of extra little touches that really made us feel welcome. Our dogs were right at home! We also rented a stall for our goats and felt very comfortable leaving them in the barn for the night. It was well lit, had water available, and was clearly well taken care of. Breakfast was lovely, Steve and Carol were great, I Recommend for sure!"

We will be back."

Exceptional stay. It was my second time."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a lovely place! Very welcoming, cozy and spacious apartment in a beautiful setting. Fully furnished, including a kitchen with everything you need to make complete meals.

Bonus points for being dog friendly with extra touches to make my pup feel special. Can‚Äôt wait to stay there again!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely perfect
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A special place! Beautiful ranch setting that I wish we could have enjoyed more than the rainy weather allowed. Such thoughtful extras with the dog bed, bowls and towel. And, treats for us, too. Much more than we expected! It was a warm, clean and comfortable place to spend a rainy night and after a long drive. The decor was well done with attention paid to the little touches. Wonderful kitchen with all the conveniences we needed."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay was wonderful! We stayed overnight on our road trip from WV to MN. We were pleasantly surprised and thoroughly enjoyed the homemade breads and gobbled them up. It was nice to not have to think about breakfast the next morning.
Steve was able to provide us good recommendations for dinner and helped us get our truck and car hauling trailer turned around for the next day. Our dogs loved running around the spacious unit and jumping around in the snow. We were cozy warm all night.
We would definitely stay here again."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If there could be Super Duper Hosts on Airbnb, Steve and Carol would fall into that category. Their place is a pet-friendly, amazingly clean, cozy, and nicely furnished oasis. I felt completely welcomed from the moment I walked in. Steve and Carol also had set out little surprise treats that honestly made my day. So thoughtful. Their hospitality made me (and my cats) feel right at home! I can‚Äôt thank them enough!! -Jennifer, Jim, and Hazel"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"LOVE this Airbnb - peaceful setting with great amenities PLUS great, responsive hosts. We plan to return often."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The home was fantastic! Close to everything we needed. Great views too. Very clean and treats for our dog. The breakfast was amazing, everything fresh. Dinner at host recommended local Italian restaurant was a treat for us. Yum to everything!!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Amazing about sums it up. The place was extremely clean and beautifully decorated. The rooms were spacious and the layout was nice. The apartment was very welcoming. There was fresh bread and cookies waiting for us. Carol was very friendly and even prepared a scrumptious breakfast casserole for us, along with fresh fruit. The owners went over and above! I highly recommend this site to anyone going to the Rockford, Illinois area."
2023-01-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Carol was a sweet as ever! We were about to get into the place with ease and had a delicious egg bake for breakfast the next day. There were even doggie treats for my pup Timber! We felt very comfortable there and it was clean!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We‚Äôve stayed here several times and will definitely return! LOVE the views and proximity to our family for extended visits. Carol and Steve are wonderful hosts - we especially enjoyed the tasteful decorations for the holidays - and, as always, yummy breakfast items to enjoy. If you are looking for solitude in a beautiful setting, this is it."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay immensely. The place was clean, spacious and comfortable and even decorated for Christmas, a nice welcoming touch. She also left us some yummy food and treats. Even met the horses. The location is itself very rural but not far out of Rockford. Makes for the best of both worlds."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great quiet place and hospitable hosts
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was amazing! One of my favorite airbnbs by far. It was so cozy, comfortable, and felt like home. Carol was extremely responsive and had so many small details-she had fresh bread on the counter, water in the fridge, and treats for our pup. We loved this place and would stay again anytime!"
2022-12-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Extremely clean. Furniture is cute but not comfortable in the least. View out of all windows is not of the barn and horse area as implied by the prominent ‚Äòheadline‚Äô photo. Instead view is of road and fields which are perfectly fine views but not what was expected. Welcoming touches provided by host is not enough to make up for sagging mattress and other furniture, or the inoperable tv in the bedroom or minuscule shower that has good water pressure but only fits you if you are well under 6‚Äô tall. If the hosts solve these issues and tell you more clearly that the apartment is attached to the main house, it would be a spotless and good and quiet choice."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is one of the best AirBnb's we have ever stayed in. Is just outside town on a paved road. The guest quarters are an apartment attached to the host's house. The hosts went over and above to provide more than what is typically available, such as fresh food, so that guests don't have to turn around and run into town for supplies to make it through the next morning. There is a stackable washer and dryer that we used while we made our own dinner and played a board game from the closet. We have driven through this area before, so we know there are lots of good restaurants available, especially the Italian one in Cherry Valley. The owners welcome dogs, cats, and horses, and provided food and water dishes and treats for dogs. If you bring dogs, be aware that the hosts have 3 dogs that run loose and the guest house is right by the road without a fenced yard. I would highly recommend this Airbnb to 1-3 people with pets or horses, and who enjoy a quiet rural setting."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The property is beautiful on a scenic road just a few minutes from town. It was so welcoming of the hosts to have the lights on and food in the refrigerator and pantry when I arrived. Parking was a few steps from the door. The apartment was very clean and comfortable. The hosts are so nice and thoughtful. I enjoyed my stay and I‚Äôve reserved it again!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Carols place was perfect! So cozy, and clean!! We always struggle to find pet friendly homes that are also not covered in dog hair, and Carols place exceeded expectations. There were snacks waiting for us and a delicious breakfast that were such a kind touch. We will absolutely stay again when doing our long road trips through the area."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Carol was a great host. Everything was very clean and neat. She was very thoughtful in having snacks available, even for my dog!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean, hospitable, lovely place to stay. I was delighted to be hosted here with my beagle. We had a perfect night‚Äôs rest and Carol (and Steve) we‚Äôre so helpful and friendly. The lights and heat were welcoming as I arrived on a chilly Fall night.
I hope to stay here again in the near future:)"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed here overnight during our cross-country move. We have 3 dogs, and finding accommodations when traveling so far with this many pets is not easy. We were thrilled to find Carol‚Äôs space for this reason alone, but I must say it truly exceeded our expectations! There were so many nice touches (snacks in the pantry, breakfast items ready to go in the morning) and the place was so clean! If we ever find ourselves traveling through here again, this is definitely where we would choose to stay."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Staying at Carol and Steve's Airbnb was wonderful. I had yummy chocolate muffins waiting for me and a refrigerator and cupboards full of all kinds of core essentials. The place feels all brand new with soft yummy towels and linens. Super comfortable and wonderful hosts. I would stay again in a heartbeat.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great B&B! Beautifully decorated and clean! Enjoyed my week there with my furry companions! Thanks Carol and Steve for allowing pets! Would definitely come back if in the area.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Carol's ranch is in a beautiful natural setting with views of field and stream in all directions. If you're up early, you can catch a sunrise from the sofa. The living space is very comfortable and spacious and the kitchen is well-stocked with staples, seasoning, and even baked goods upon arrival. I hope to be back!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We only stayed for one night, but wished we could stay longer.

It‚Äôs a healing experience for those in need!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Pheonmenal. One of the best airbnbs I have stayed in. Loved the dog treats and provided breakfast. interior is clean and modern. What I would want in my own home. Would give 6 stars if I could. Wish we stayed longer. Only thing I can think of is that I wasnt aware of much to do in Rockford. We were just passing through and needed somewhere to stay.

We very much enjoyed our stay and will recommend to anyone we can!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,What a wonderful place with wonderful hosts. Excellent communication. So clean it can only be described as immaculate. The sincerity truly shows with how kindly they stock the kitchen and that was greatly appreciated after such a long trip. Bed was comfortable and smelled so good. It was also nice actually having large fluffy towels for once in an air bnb. Amazing place. Also set on a beatiful road which was great to walk our dogs.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super comfy place and being away from town was nice. Lots of easy hiking within a few minutes drive as well. So dog friendly that water and food bowls are out and waiting!
I have one suggestion if you book this place. Throw some butter in a pan and toast one of Carol's home made muffins. If baked goods could be laced with crack and love then I assume this is what it would taste like."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful stay and loved meeting the horses! Feel so blessed to have rested our heads for the night here!

While we shared one door with the main home it was not a bother and any noise heard was never very early morning or late evening.
We had our cat with us and we really appreciated that there were no little places she could hide in/get stuck in.
This stay could not have been any better, it was very thoughtful and welcoming. We would love to stay again!"

2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"We had a pleasant stay and were thankful it was available on such short notice! The home was older and a little smaller than expected. Intriguing nooks and crannies throughout the home, fun for some but a little creepy for others. Being so close to Cherry Vale mall was a plus! Overall a peaceful home. My wife's favorite part was sitting in the enclosed back porch in the morning, drinking coffee and watching the squirrels. :)"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This house was great and everything was like the listing. I didn‚Äôt have to communicate much, as everything was clear and concise. Mattias was a great host and I‚Äôd definitely stay again if in the area."

2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Really enjoyed our stay here! Would def return!
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"Mattias was a wonderful host, location of the airbnb was easy to find and conveniently located to everything around like restaurants and grocery stores. Place was spotless and cozy, however in certain bedrooms and the basement it was cold. Space heaters didn‚Äôt really do much to warm up the rooms. Would definitely recommend this for a summer or fall house as it would remain cool but during the winter I found it just a little bit too cold. If you do go in winter make sure to pack in some thick socks or slippers and a jacket if you want to play in the basement but it definitely was a lovely stay."
2024-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,Can‚Äôt wait to go back

The house was no more than 10 minutes to the venue or anything else we found to do in the area. House was spotless, the games in the basement were great to keep the kids occupied. Beds were very comfortable, plenty of room for our group of six to sleep and enjoy the house without being on top of each other. We would stay here again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice place to stay. Beautiful yard. Nice cozy home l.
2023-12-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"This space was wonderful for our family weekend away. Plenty of room for adults, kids, and pets and everyone could have their own room. It was nice to have the solarium and basement for the kids to play!"

Beds were comfortable, bedding was clean, and bathrooms were well maintained. There's plenty of seating in the living room for watching movies, with cozy blankets galore.

2023-09-01,3,Group trip,.
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Vgood
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful home
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great stay. The place was clean and weel furnished. The host had good communication.
2023-08-01,3,Group trip,"This stay was quite disappointing and was not worth the price we paid. ü•µüòî
Despite being advertised as having central air conditioning, we walked in and the reality was far from it. The interior was uncomfortably hot at 80 degrees upon arrival - it took over 8 hours for the air conditioning to make any noticeable difference which dramatically impacted our one-night stay.
The game room was cool but was extremely damp and had a musty basement odor. I slipped playing ping pong on the wet floor.
Lack of cleanliness; stained carpet, sheets, and towels. We even found leftover food under the couch. The sunroom area smelled worse and was even hotter. Seemed like they pocketed the cleaning fee instead of hiring a professional.
Windows were challenging or impossible to lock, which raised security concerns.
Overall this spot has potential but falls short without the comfort details air bnbs usually have at this price point."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Mattias was a wonderful host and the house was perfect for our family with small kids. Loved the playroom and basement with all sorts of games. Super easy to get in, was flexible with check in times and was exactly what we needed for the weekend."

2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,Great communication & location. Skeeball was fun for the kids.
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Small, but clean. Has what you need."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Stayed here for one night , it was so beautiful I regret not booking for more days definitely booking again for future needs. Everything was as said amazing house."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was just like the pictures and felt at home while there. It was a really cool surprise to see wild rabbits, wild turkeys, and even deer come through the property. My kids loved the game room and even spent a night having competition and bonding over games. Mattias‚Äôs was awesome and quick to respond."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Warm and cozy! Check in was very easy and the host is quick to respond to messages. Many restaurants and stores in the local area. Highly recommend!
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Mattias has a beautiful house with plenty of accommodation and amenities. Bad timing with a heat wave meant the semi-functional A/C didn‚Äôt quite cut it to make our stay perfectly comfortable, but Mattias was very responsive and helpful."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Rockford is a great area to explore, lots of food and activities to do. Game room was great. The house is well equipped with essentials."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay! The house was really nice and just what we were looking for in a quiet neighborhood and pretty setting in the trees. House had great spaces with comfortable accommodations and everyone especially enjoyed the game room. Mattias was quick to respond and really helpful and accommodating, and the guide book was full of local recommendations. We would stay there again!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Mattias home was very beautiful & comfortable. Great communicator with everything I had questions about! I never felt so at home üòå very peaceful stay! Highly recommended if your looking to stay In Rockford ILL
2023-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The house was clean. It had a beautiful yard with a cute swing. I appreciated the play room and game room for the kids. The host was responsive when we had issues getting into the door and when I contacted them about how hot it was in the house. My family had a good time together and we had no issues with the house except how hot it was. The air does work but I think maybe the vents might be too small or the unit not large enough for the home. We bought air mattresses and fans and slept in the basement (except mom she stayed on the main floor). The host also provided coffee pods for the Keurig which we also appreciated. They had all the dishes we needed and cooking supplies. The host worked with me in check in and check out time as well and that was greatly appreciated. It was private but also just a short drive to the store or restaurants. I would stay again (during a cooler time of yearüòä). Overall, my family enjoyed their time together and it was in a safe area which was important."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Matthias was an absolutely amazing host. Our home was hit by a tornado, so we needed a quick place to stay! He was beyond accommodating and always quick to respond when needed. I can‚Äôt thank him enough for being so supportive and understanding of our situation! He gave me a peace of mind! Thank you!!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful place , communication was amazing. They are super helpful & super nice !
Helped with whatever we needed !! & made sure our stay was amazing . Would definitely recommend!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Couldn't be happier with our stay, the whole family enjoyed the game room (skee-ball was the favorite). The kids area by the kitchen was also perfect for the little ones. Was able to work remotely for part of our stay at the workstation and had no connection difficulties as there is high-speed internet throughout the house. Also appreciated the home gym. We will definitely be booking this place again the next time we‚Äôre in town!"
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"This place is absolutely stunning! It had more room than we expected, and easily fit everyone in our group. The beds were super comfortable and the hosts were very responsive to any questions we had. The games room was definitely a highlight - skeeball, ping pong, and even an arcade machine, which everyone loved. Fast internet too, even with a bunch of devices connected and streaming different videos. We'll be coming back soon and highly recommend it to anyone who is traveling to Rockford!"
