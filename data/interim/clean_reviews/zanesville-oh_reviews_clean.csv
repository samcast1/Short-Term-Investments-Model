2023-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The house is very clean and cozy. Checkin was seamless. We never contacted the local host, but had clear instructions on how to do so. A few important house items were missing—propane and something to scrub dishes with, but they can be worked around, obviously. The basement games were a big plus with our 10yr old. We will definitely return on future visits."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Our second stay here was as great as the first. Huge kudos to the property owner for being so incredibly accommodating. We also mentioned a few safety improvements after our stay last year, and all of them were addressed right away and ready for our stay this year. For a more detailed review, check out our review from 2021. We will be back again!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great house on a nice piece of land. Driveway is somewhat steep and gravel. Motorcycles beware! Ample parking area and great porches to hang out on. Fire pit is pretty cool as well.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Airbnb was exactly as advertised! Nice clean remote and comfy, I would book again!"

2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay! Thanks
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, comfortable, and clean home! The property was gorgeous with the fresh snow. Everyone enjoyed playing foosball and the other games at the house. Much better than staying in a hotel. It felt like being at home. We’ll definitely rent again when coming to Zanesville."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The host went above and beyond to make sure checking in and getting onto the property was a breeze, even with heavy snow falling. Excellent stay and communication, will definitely return."
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,
2021-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This Airbnb home was ideal for our family trip. There was ample space to spread out inside and to play outside. We stayed at the end of November, so when it snowed there was play space for kids inside. The home was well accomodated for preparing meals and doing laundry as needed. We'll definately consider coming back here again when we need another home away from home stay in the Zanesville/Dresden area."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Fabulous house and a great stay! Everything we needed and more. The owners were incredibly friendly, responsive, and accommodating, and they truly did a nice job renovating. I especially appreciated the minimalistic decor since we were traveling with a toddler. The split level design with a side entry into the basement area was incredibly convenient for us to come in and drop our gear and muddy shoes and had plenty of storage and space to spread out. Good water pressure in the showers. Washer and dryer available. Comfortable beds. Warm, clean, comfortable carpet. Linens and towels available, but perhaps bring your own blanket and extra pillows. I picked up a blanket at Walmart in town. Be aware if you're sensitive to dry heat from forced air, you may want to bring a humidifier. Luckily we had one that we shared with our toddler, but you could also pick one up at Walmart. Lovely yard and fire pit. Great midwestern sunset skies. If you've never been to Zanesville, keep in mind this is a remote area, so although convenience stores like Walmart and restaurants are within driving distance (about 15-20 min), you can't just run down to the corner store if you need something quick, so gather what you need in town while you're there. Also there is no cell service at the house, but great WiFi so that your phone will work fine once you connect. We brought two baby gates for the stairs. It would be great if the owner could invest in a couple inexpensive ones so that guests don't have to travel with them. A minor safety concern was addressed with the owner, and he responded promptly to address it right away. Also, many thanks to the owner for offering us an early check-in which helped us to flex our travel plans to best suit our toddler on a long drive. Wish we could have stayed longer, but we will be back next year!"
2021-10-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Upon first arrival, we were provided the incorrect code. Thankfully, I was able to get in touch with the on-site contact to get the correct code. It was gauge inconvenience and I had no cell service at the house. When we finally got in, it was not clean. It’s surprising that it wasn’t clean since check-in was at 1 and we got in at 5. We got ahold of the host and explained our issue. The host did make it right. They drove down cleaned and made the beds within 1-1 1/2 hours cleaning. They did provide plastic plates/bowls/cups for our stay. That was a nice touch so we didn’t have to clean anything. However, none of the heavy bedding was cleaned and on the bed. Very disappointing to deal with this during a pandemic."
2021-10-01,4,Group trip,Great spot
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a great property for our girls weekend retreat! We really enjoyed the cleanliness of the property and watching the sun on the trees and the bluebirds and bunnies from the front porch.
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,"The best Airbnb we have stayed in yet! This house was beautiful and so was the land behind it. Fully stocked on necessities, cleaning products, towels, etc. Even had air hockey, foos ball, corn hole, and more. 10/10. Will be back next year!"
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,"clean, accurate description, would definitely stay again"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is a fabulous house !!!
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,Great stay on a newly renovated home. Loved the outdoor country feel and location!
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,Great place! Very happy with my weekend experience
2021-07-01,4,Group trip,"Cute house in the woods. This house was as described, clean and cute. Lots of bunnies and birds around the house and saw all sorts of wildlife on the drive there, deer, fox, raccoons, etc. It is definitely out in the woods on gravel drive with few houses around so while it’s quiet it is definitely outside of the suburbs and a bit of a hike to town so bring what you need like coffee/creamer etc. My only concern which others should be aware of is a slight smell of cigarette smoke. I assume this is from previous owners so in the walls of the house and certainly not on any bedding or furniture, as I said it’s very clean, but it is there for those of us who are sensitive to smells be aware. My dad could not smell it but me and my sister who have mild allergies did notice it. Otherwise all was as stated, we never needed to bother the manager. No cable but access to all apps with a Smart TV and WiFi worked fine. Gameroom in basement was fun and great for kids. Tip: Donald’s Donuts was great stop for breakfast."
2021-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Awesome location! Enjoyed the views and seclusion. Layout is a challenge for anyone not able to do stairs easily no bathrooms on the main floor. Minimalist decor was nice and uncluttered. Watch for the nightly visits by the raccoons!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The property is very remote and quiet. We really enjoyed the big yard and fire pit. The house is finished well and had plenty of room for us to sleep. What a relaxing time!
2021-04-01,5,Group trip,"Exactly as advertised! Perfect get away spot, secluded property with a fire pit (not sure if the fire pit was listed). The house was very clean and the communication between the rental company was great. We will definitelybe going back sometime!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home that is tucked away from the hustle and bustle of city life. We will definitely be back for our next fishing trip.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow! This was a beautiful house and at a wonderful location too. Compact house with full of all amenities you can think of and even more. Loved the cleanliness and little details make the feel of house very urban. We all loved it, specially the available foosball and other games. Beautiful patio and lots of sun. Very well maintained property. Host Raymond was super-responsive and accommodating too. Will definitely come back."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very clean. Had everything we needed and more. We would definitely stay again when in town.
2021-03-01,5,Group trip,Perfect cozy hideaway to unwind at after a long day of hiking.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very clean and comfortable home. Plenty of space for our family. Very kid friendly! Would highly recommend it. Close to amenities while still be in the country and having some space to yourself. Owner was very quick to reply with questions or concerns we had.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved how this place was a bit more secluded, it made for a quiet experience. The place was clean and our kids enjoyed the Fussball table and we liked having access to a washer/dryer during our stay. We were there with lots of snow/ice, we would love to see it in the summer. Communication was great via text and Raymond was very accommodating to any needs/questions we had. I suggest bringing your own food to cook in the kitchen. Downtown and grocery stores were about 19 minutes away and easy to find. I would recommend staying here if you are looking for a getaway or staying in the area. 5 ⭐️’s!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Would highly recommend!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was a perfect home for our holiday getaway. Since we have young kids, we loved that the house was tidy and free of unnecessary clutter and furniture. It was extremely clean and the owners supplied all the essentials + more. The home is located on the outskirts of the city and is a perfect getaway from the hustle and bustle of city life. We were extremely pleased with our stay and would rebook in a heartbeat! I would recommend this home to anyone looking for a place to stay in this area."
2020-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was great. Very clean. If you’re looking for a place to get away from people, this is a great spot. No neighbors could be seen, only heard a distant lawnmower. We appreciated the personal touches. We even enjoyed sitting out on the back deck watching the family of blue jays that were hanging out in the yard. Would definitely stay here again."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"The Kabin was such a nice, relaxing place to stay after a busy day of The Wilds and running around. We had everything we needed and then some. Our trip was very low key and the Kabin fit the vibe entirely. If I'm ever in the area again, I would definitely check Mark's availability."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Interesting place, great host!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was the most unique stay we have ever experienced.... In addition to being one of the most peaceful and comfortable stays, it was inviting and thoughtfully decorated as well. The outdoor setting was also a big bonus.
My wife and I would love a return visit anytime we are in the area."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fantastic spot, really recommend it."
2024-06-01,3,Stayed with kids,"This silo is clean, spacious and a short drive to the Columbus Zoo and The Wilds. A very unique experience staying in a structure that housed grain in a beautiful outdoor setting. However, it was difficult to rest peacefully at night with only the two french doors as a possible escape in the event of fire. Having just experienced a house fire in our family and being accompanied on this trip by a lifetime firefighter we were concerned with the lack of windows in the silo, especially to provide an escape from the second floor. After a search we were only able to locate one smoke detector on the first floor. Windows and additional smoke detectors would make this stay fantastic."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This property was amazingly unique!! I was on the phone with my husband when he arrived and he just kept saying wow, how cool, this place rocks!! It was a convenient stopover from the interstate he was traveling. He loved it! As antique fanatics, we so appreciate the repurposing of a symbol of American farmland."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,very clean and peaceful
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"As my boyfriend said this place is ""cute as a button"". It's quiet, immaculate, and so much bigger than you think! So peaceful just sitting on the porch listening to the birds. I loved it so much I want one! Would definitely stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"uniquely contemporary for the unusual agricultural vernacular architecture. very comfortable beds. pristinely clean. being located in a remote country setting, it is very quiet and restful. highly recommended!"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Neat experience staying in a converted silo. Enjoyed the peace and quiet that Mark's place provided.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Definitely would stay again. Loved the decor inside and the quiet atmosphere outside. The little stream and waterfall were an extra bonus. We didn’t get use the grill or fire pit. Weran out of time but it was neat that they were available. Really cool way to reuse a grain silo. Very clean and well stocked. Thanks for the great weekend.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,we had a great time in the silo looking forward to next visit
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful home, beautiful surroundings. I throughly enjoyed the stay. The home was cozy yet felt spacious. While the yard and surrounding nature created a beautiful morning walk. Would definitely stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We sure enjoyed our stay here! my boys had a great time playing outside, and each had so much space inside.
If we find ourselves in need of a getaway, we'll definitely be back!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mark’s place was one of the coolest airbnbs we have ever stayed at. Everything was neat and clean. We were in the area for our son to attend Donnie Morans driving school. The Silo is very private and just all around a super neat place to stay! If we are ever back in the area we will definitely stay again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,What a unique and wonderful experience staying here! It was a stopover for us on our way from Indianapolis to Pittsburgh. Great directions and rural feel but just outside Zanesville so it was easy to pop into town for supper!

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Was a great find, we stayed for the night during a college visit. Cabin was great, super clean and spacious. Communication was fantastic from the booking all through the stay. Perfect instructions and directions. Pictures do no justice for the scenery and views simply beautiful setting. Would highly recommend. We had gotten stuck in the snow on a hill and Mark was willing to come out and help get us moved. Truly super helpful and accomodating."
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very neat grain bin turned into house. Everything you need from the kitchen to washing your clothes before you leave. Within 15 mins or less to get groceries or to go shopping.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Unique, well-stocked and super clean! A wonderful Airbnb that we’d definitely stay at again if we are in the area!!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Felt like home!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My 80 yr old mom, my sister, and I enjoyed our first Wild Women Weekend at Mark & Deb's amazing converted silo. It was the perfect spot to reconnect, share meals, laugh, love, and regenerate. The Airbnb description was spot on. The Silo was unique and well-designed. I highly recommend this location if you need a spot to just ""be"" and find a connection to nature. Thank you Mark and Deb for this life-giving experience."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Totally enjoyed our stay. Probably would have better at the current price since so much is closed in the winter.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place! It is such a neat and different Airbnb. Hosts were great to work with and had wonderful communication. We arrived to Christmas lights on the outside and a Christmas tree lit up on the inside. Made it feel like home and feel very welcoming. We hope to return the next time we're in Zanesville.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying in the silo is always wonderful. It's quiet and when it rains, the sound of rain is soothing. It is always clean and ready for the next guest. They are very responsive hosts as well."
2023-12-01,4,Stayed one night,"Place is just as described—we did have a little trouble seeing it in the dark as it is a little bit downhill and off the road and it’s very dark.
Well-stocked, clean, and quiet.
We had no cell service there and Wi-Fi was adequate for browsing.
This is perfect if you’re trying to unplug and have quiet. State park is right out of the backyard and very easy access"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,We stayed one night en route to Louisville. We had everything we needed and much more than I even expected. The cabin was clean and comfortable and very unique. We loved the serenity of the location even though it was only a few minutes off the highway. We will definitely stay again if we are in the area. Mark was very helpful and responded to all my questions immediately. Great place to stay!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our overnight stay in the silo house, it looks much bigger once you're inside, we were quite impressed with everything! Only regret is that we didn't book 2 nights instead of just one!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great, cozy place to stay. Very clean and spacious. Highly recommended."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We spent a night in the Silo and had a great time. What a unique space! The instructions were super clear and the silo was pristine. Loved the upstairs lounge, and the stocked fridge! I am definitely coming back here next year, it's worth the trip just for this hidden gem. Thank you Mark and Deb!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Attended an art retreat at Girl Upcycled Studio in downtown Zanesville and it is the perfect place for some of us to stay. This was our second year and look forward to come back next year.
Mark and Debbi are great hosts. Thank you once again for making our stay great!
Judy Hogan"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mark gave me great instructions to find the place. I couldn`t ask for a better stay. He was helpful and reaponsive to my questions. I would definintly recomend and stay again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything we could have needed! Loved our stay. My only issue was the internet which they mentioned was Hughes Net. This was a personal thing and I thought I could work a bit, but service was very slow BUT not their fault. Just saying this with the world of remote working, to let others know. Plan to come and check out from Wi-Fi and enjoy the fresh air and the company with you. Would totally come back when I can leave the work laptop behind."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay! Super spacious and cozy at the same time.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This has been one of the coolest places I have had the pleasure of staying. So innovative and it has SO much room. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here. It was also so close to the legend valley Venue to Lost Lands. I would definitely stay here again given the opportunity! Thanks again Mark and Deb
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay. The only thing was with 4 of use staying there was enough towels and wash cloths for 2 days, but other then that the place was amazing.. I will be spreading the word about the place."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place. Will be coming back
The location is peaceful and very beautiful."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was skeptical about staying in a silo, but I was very pleasantly surprised. The place was very clean and cozy. I really enjoyed the fire pit and the front porch. I will stay here again for another trip to Nethers Farm."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Totally Awesome silo,"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Unique space- so fun to stay in and I was pleasantly surprised with how nice the interior was! My kids enjoyed the fun game room area upstairs.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,So peaceful and beautiful! We will stay again! The host was very responsive as we were just going through Ohio! I wish we could have stayed longer!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We love staying here and will stay as much as possible.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This converted silo is truly unique. If you're looking for a quiet, peaceful, well-appointed place away from it all, this is it. Plenty of space indoors and out for our family of four. We enjoyed the foosball and pool tables. Mark is an excellent host who communicates everything clearly and is very responsive."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We are repeat visitors and LOVE this spot! It is EVERYTHING we need when we visit Ohio and relatives close by. We appreciate Mark’s attention to detail for his guests. The location is so pleasant and peaceful! We even saw a piebald deer in front of the cabin…. a first for us!
Many thanks for sharing your terrific space with us!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Silo! This was our second time there; a one-night stopover on our way back home. Was a delight -- again! Comfortable beds, well-stocked kitchen, comfy hang out areas. Thank you Mark & Debbie, for providing such a unique and creative place!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mark's Unique Kabin is exactly that, unique! Whether your party is large or small, likes nature or would rather shop & see the sites, you will be comfortable and have fun! The cabin is quiet, spacious, clean, & well stocked (from bedding to spices & cooking staples, to dishes & cookware, to info on local eateries, stores, & sites). Mark was very helpful and quick to respond to our questions. A few 'extras' we enjoyed were the pool table, the fire ring (Bring wood if you want to use it!), and gas grill. For nature lovers, you are practically in Dillon State Park. A barred owl sat right above us one night - very cool! Zanesville and Newark offer many sites & shops.
2 things to know - if you have more than 2 vehicles, there is not a lot of parking space. If you have small children, next to the parking area, there is a drop off in the woods to a creek below - very pretty, but be cautious.
My husband & I had a wonderful time & hope to return!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a great place! So creative! Silo living at its finest!
We even got a chance to chat with Mark on the phone; he was very helpful and suggested many local restaurants. Just what we needed for an overnight stay.
We’ll be back soon!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was amazing what you see is what you get! Would never in a million years think the inside of a grain silo would look as amazing as this! Mark was awesome me and 3 co workers stayed for out of town felt at home at the house if needed anything which didn’t or when he questsion mark was fast to reply plan to rent it again next week something it doesn’t show in photos and should is has washer and dryer also to use while their
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and comfortable. Beautiful setting and house was decorated beautifully. Lots of room to spread out. Highly recommend.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay at Mark's cabin. The house is very unique and our son loved the experience of sleeping in a silo! The house was perfect for our four night stay and convenient to The Wilds and Dillon State Park!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What is beautiful cabin and location. Very quiet and peaceful. My boys and I traveled down to the cabin on motorcycles to enjoy the twisting roads and was pleasantly surprised by how nice this unique cabin truly was. Everything was clean and amazingly decorated. We totally enjoyed the evenings sitting on the porch, everything that was needed was there.
Mark stopped by one evening to introduce himself and check that we were comfortable and not in need of anything, i really enjoyed meeting him and we all chatted for about a half hour.
If you’re looking for a beautiful and peaceful place to stay, I would highly recommend Marks cabin, he and his wife put a lot of time and work into this unique cabin, and it shows.
Many thanks to Mark and Deb for allowing to share their cabin"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Cool place! Directions were great and the place had everything we needed.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,the pictures don't do it justice. this place is amazing. bigger and better than we thought. I will definitely stay here again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at the Unique Cabin , very quiet and serene . Maybe have a couple lanterns or extra flashlights in case of more black outs ! Thank you for having us"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Charming place! Very clean. Well remodeled and we had a nice time enjoying the front porch.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The silo was a very unique stay
It’s very comfortable inside and a great place to relax
Location is perfect … easy to get to places of interest in 20 minutes"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,I would highly suggest staying here. It was perfect!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is awesome may I add very beautiful inside. A very unique place to stay. will be renting again in the future.
2023-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Owners were fantastic, house was fantastic. I was notified a couple days before we arrived that the house was on a well. We had solid water pressure Friday night, Saturday and Sunday was a struggle. Saturday morning we had no water for most of the day, contacted Mark, we advised where the reset was for the well tank. Had to hit the reset every time we used the restroom, at times had to wait to use the restroom because there was no water. Only 2 times during the weekend I was able to get the water pressure to the 50 psi Mark recommended, both times was at 3am. Most of the time the psi was around 30, but it did not last long. Couldn’t really shower so we let our wives take showers. Mark told us about a cabin they have not too far from the house that has a shower, my brother in law tried it but for the amount of money paid, no one should have had to walk to a cabin to shower."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect place for our stay after visiting the Wilds. It was so much bigger than we anticipated! Such a cool place. We will be back.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Well stocked, we enjoyed the game room. Comfortable beds, easy to adjust temperature. The location is very nice and quiet. When you stay in a silo, remember you won’t generally have windows. The doors on the bottom floor let good in light in, however. I would recommend!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The quietness and fresh air, combined with the uniqueness of the converted silo and all its amenities, proved to be just what we wanted and needed! With plenty of outdoor activities around, you could spend all day outside; or, if the weather doesn't cooperate, you could spend all day inside playing games or just relaxing. Win, win!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved staying in this unique place! It was very quiet and peaceful. The kitchen was well stocked. The whole place was immaculate! The cabin was bigger than it looked in pics! Our boys thought it was a super cool place as well. Beds were comfortable and there was plenty of space! Would def recommend!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We cannot say enough good things about the atmosphere, spacious rooms, cleanliness, peacefulness, and character of this unique Kabin. This was a 3 generation overnight stay and everyone was impressed with the accommodations. Pool table, foosball, fire pit, made the stay enjoyable."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a very nice space. And fun! My family enjoyed the foosball table especially, and everything we needed was readily available, no need to ask questions which was nice. I did have a rough night sleeping becuase the upstairs of the cabin was uncomfortably hot. The ventilation didnt seem to wprk as well up there. But the space was clean and quiet and quirky. We had fun."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,A very unique experience. Thoughtful design and helpful amenities that made for an enjoyable stay.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was absolutely beautiful. very clean and fresh smelling . we are from NY and my boyfriends sons live in Ohio they come out for a cookout and enjoyed the fire pit. The big boys really enjoyed the pool table. The place is actually a lot bigger than it looks. We were absolutely amazed on the whole concept of a grain bin turned into such a beautiful place. We would definitely stay again. Thank u for letting us share your beautiful place with us
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,My son and I stayed in marks cabin for a mini golf trip. Place is amazing Short drive to virtues GC and very close to eaglesticks GC. We enjoyed relaxing on front porch and then siting by the fire when it got chilly. Excellent accommodations inside & out. Already planning another stay.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I LOVED IT!! My dad loved it and my son loved it. My dad never experienced airbnb Vs hotel before and he will never chose hotel again when he visits Ohio. My son loved running up and down the hills. Truly wish we had more time to use the grill and light a fire and explore the woods. Definitely a treat and an awesome find. Will try to book every year on our way to the jubilee. But hopefully with a few days before hand.
Also, try la cabana tacos. The alligator taco is the best I ever had. And the y bridge brewery was great for some fruity beers. So many other places to visit while around."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean and tidy, it felt like a brand new house! Well built and appointed, hominess in every nook and cranny. Thank you!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Adorable cabin! Super spacious and had lots to do. Location was peaceful and beautiful. Host had lots of recommendations. Would gladly stay again
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Excellent place to stay for our purpose, and for an excellent price!!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"There are not enough words, or space, to adequately capture how great our stay was at Mark and Deb's Unique Kabin in the Woods. I specifically chose this place because of the connection to farming. We were amazed at the transformation of the corn bin into a stunningly beautiful home. They have created a peaceful, welcoming haven that provides everything you could possibly want for a truly memorable stay. We were only able to stay one night but the nearby town of Zanesville satisfied both the history buff and outdoor explorer parts of our souls. We would stay at Unique Kabin in the Woods again in a heart beat!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect place to stay at with all the amenities we needed, and very comfortable. The only criticism I have is against myself, for not staying longer! Nice quiet surroundings close to nature, and great story to tell our friends that we slept in a corn crib :-)"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Truly a great space in a beautiful location with loads of great personal touches that make a stay extra special with lots of snacks, spices, condiments, soaps, and shampoos, etc, etc. The building is such a cool conversation piece but the inside is, as others have said, incredibly spacious on each floor. The price is pretty unmatched for a huge, 3-bedroom, extra-well cared for space."
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very creative guest house. Loved the concept for the most part, although I was not aware that I would have zero cell service. I'm sure this is due to the nature of the structure. It is very rural, as Mark describes. Very quiet!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was great one of the best I ever been in
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Came here for my birthday and it was peaceful and quiet... Mark was really nice and responded quickly.... I love the pool table and the yard... will definitely come back

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"mark and his wife are amazing people, very easy to get along with. their home was spot on for anyone who wants to get away from the city life. the home had plenty of space! they was amazing hosts. I enjoyed the history of the home and how it became about. will definitely book here again! 10/10 I recommend"

Built in a corn crib, this peaceful round/octagonal home was unexpectedly spacious with 3 bedrooms, 2 baths, a large kitchen/living room and a fun upstairs playroom with pool table and foosball. We asked to stay overnight at the last minute and Mark was very accommodating. The home is immaculate, comfy and quite unique. I highly recommend this fun place to stay!"

They've done a great job truly making it a living space...once inside you'd never know it wasn't a regular cabin! We really enjoyed our stay. There are nice restaurants nearby and plenty of kitchen stuff to cook if you stay in! More than enough space to spread out and relax!

Mark is great host!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,We stayed at the place just to have a girls night away from home. Everything was perfect. It was actually larger than we had expected it to be. We loved the experience of staying in the corn crib!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,We would definitely stay here again every time we come down!
2022-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Lost the use of water for half a day. Had to use a off site laundry /shower location which was an inconvenience. Owner states that house will have city water hooked up soon. Once city water is hooked up then place would be great for 3-4 people. Very quiet place. Great place if you like the country
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What an amazing place to stay. The uniqueness of how they turned this corn crib into something so beautiful is remarkable. Thank you for such an enjoyable weekend.

We enjoyed our stay and plan to stay there again in the future."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I had a great time at this Cabin. It’s very unique and well configured inside! We enjoyed playing pool and foosball upstairs.

Can't say enough wonderful things about this property. It was immaculate, well stocked with necessary items, and very roomy. Coming from a farming family, I was curious then pleasantly surprised to see what a grain bin can be turned into! Would never have imagined it. We hope to be able to return with another couple in the future. Thank you and it was nice to meet both of you. God bless you both."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Two nights of campfires help ed us to relax and talk about our ride. No lack of things to talk about. Plenty of restaurants within 15 minutes.

The beds are very comfortable with great linens and blankets. The bathroom was fully stocked and the towels were great. Plenty for everyone. The shower was nice and hot with great pressure. It is a very serene area. But, you are still close enough to Zanesville for shopping or restaurants. This was a perfect girls' weekend!!! I have added this place to my favorites!!!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,The Silo is a very special place and we loved our one night stay. It is extremely comfortable and well furnished with a gorgeous cow hide rug. We spent part of our evening on the front porch listening to cicadas buzzing. It doesn't get much better than this. Mark and his wife did an amazing job rescuing this piece of rural agricultural archeology and it's worth a visit.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Super neat place to stay. It was perfect for what we wanted Mark made everything super easy. Thanks

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,we loved the Silo. would recommend it to anyone.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a unique place and would highly recommend if you like a country setting.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a cool experience! The grain silo would be great for a larger group…so much space for just the two of us. Everything was as expected. It’s remote, but not too far from activities. You’ll have plenty of privacy. We were on a long road trip, and enjoyed the down time, movie night and full size laundry. Wouldn’t hesitate to book again!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The remodeled silo one of the coolest places we've rented in our travels. It was much larger inside than anticipated especially the game room upstairs that our boys enjoyed. The house was fully equipped to stay a weekend or a month. Mark and his wife were great with communication and responses when needed. The area is so peaceful. My kids and I took a short hike and ran into Mark who was a plethora of information with the history of the surrounding area and his family's acreage. This is a definite spot to stay, highly recommend."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay in the Unique
Kabin in the woods. On the road driving to
the cabin we saw about 6 deer just
roaming, so beautiful! It was an easy
check-in, the house was clean &
surprisingly spacious. We will for sure
remember the experience of spending our
time in a silo. Thanks Mark"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed two nights in this lovely silo converted into a living space, it was great! Clean, super spacious with all the conveniences of home. They have 2 bedrooms downstairs with full/queen beds & full bathroom. Upstairs there is a game room also another full bath & bedroom with bunk beds. It was quiet, out of town wildlife (we saw deer when driving in & the next morning as we were sitting on the front porch a big beautiful doe was frolicking in a hayfield right in front of us). Loved!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mark and Deb are great hosts and are very attentive to your requests and available if you need them for anything. The silo was spotless and very comfortable. You’ll be very surprised when you walk in for the first time and experience the spaciousness! The area is very peaceful yet close to restaurants and shopping if you need supplies. Check out Dillon State Park nearby when you visit.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Hidden gem - Extremely private and secluded. Great place for a short weekend away!

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was unique, clean, had all the conveniences of home, and was peaceful. The deck was nice to sip coffee, which was provided, and enjoy listening to the birds sing and the sound of the creek. The kitchen was well stocked with all needed items to cook and prepare food, including an outdoor gas grill. The place was spacious and also had a fun game room and kids bunk beds. There were steps that led to the creek below and Deb informed me of some hiking on the property. It was a nice relaxing stay within 15 minutes of Zanesville and nearby to Dillon State park and Blackhand Gorge nature preserve"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such an amazing find out in the country but close enough to everything! It really felt like a home away from home and had everything you could need for your trip. We will definitely be coming back when visiting family.

Mark was so easy to work with, the beds and the sitting area were comfortable and the kitchen was stacked with the cooking essentials. I have stayed at a lot of Airbnb's and this place is by far my favorite."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,So much room. Feels like your miles away yet downtown is minutes away. 3 decent size bedrooms. 2 full bathrooms. Also a huge game area. Living room is big too. I can’t believe all the room. The pictures are deceiving. It’s way bigger than it looks. Hiking down to the creek was a challenge but well worth it.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,What a unique experience staying at this cabin!! Having been raised on a farm this cabin was great!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I loved staying at Chelsea and Travis’s. The space is so cozy and the bed is the most comfortable I’ve ever slept in. Chelsea and Travis are amazing hosts, always accommodating, always responsive, always kind. I would recommend their space to anyone needing accommodations in the area. I will book again if I need a place to stay again. 5 stars all the way!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,Chelsea and Travis are awesome hosts and I have stayed in Airbnbs in 28 different states and their place is easily top 3 on my list. The cat and dog are awesome door greeters as well! I look forward to coming back. 🙌🏾
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Travis and Chelsea’s is always clean, cozy, and welcoming. I’m never disappointed when staying in their space. I highly recommend!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We had a week at this magical place with Chelsea and Travis.The suite was excellent. Everything fit.
The surroundings are very good. There is the old town with arts and bars. I can recommend the accommodation to everyone, both hosts simply great people. The German Shepherd Dog is a well behaved dog. Super. We are definitely coming back. The privacy is also guaranteed in the house of Chelsea and Travis. We will miss it.Thank you greetings from Germany."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"a fantastic value for what I got. everything was immaculate. everyone and everything was just plain cool on steroids, including the great German Shepherd. if my wife and I are anywhere near there in the future I'm definitely going to bring her. thanks for being super hosts"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Chelsea and Travis are really nice and great ! It was my first AirBnB and I’m not complaining one bit. They made the stay very comfortable. They’re also great at conversation! Their dog Doc is a very well trained mannered dog. He will be your best friend haha. But overall this stay was perfect and I definitely recommend them! I will for sure be checking in with them again during my next visit
2023-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"A nice, quiet apartment conveniently located. Hosts friendly, helpful and not intrusive. Doc is a wonderful host dog."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second time staying at Chelsea and Travis’s place. This is such a great place for me to stay while in town visiting my family. I will look for their place first when staying in town. Their space is so cozy and welcoming, you will not be disappointed!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very nice place. I was just in and out but the restaurant they recommended was perfect. The place is historic and decorated well. Check in was seamless and the house dog is very cool. Only thing negative is it’s close to the tracks and trains come through pretty early. Didn’t really bother me but may disturb sleep if you’re not use to it. All in all, it’s a lot of space and privacy if you’re staying awhile.
Super nice hosts"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,These guys were awesome hosts and their dog was an awesome perk to the experience!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Chelsea and Travis’s space is so cozy and welcoming! Having the private kitchenette and bathroom was so nice. I will definitely stay again next time I am in town.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,Cute apartment in a larger house in downtown Zanesville. I had a nice stay while working at the hospital in town. There’s a sweet and friendly dog who lives in the house.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable and scrupulously clean. I look forward to staying with Chelsea and Travis again!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Chelsea and Travis's place was cozy and comfortable. Zanesville is my hometown and I left it in 1980 so I knew that part of town. I was amazed at how beautiful this older house, probably built in the 1800s, is. They have furnished it very nicely, the bed was comfortable, a microwave and upscale mini fridge with freezer was provided, good wifi, and I had everything that I needed."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great spot to stay.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a very stylish, comfortable and overall beautiful, neat apartment. We liked the location and the welcome and kindness of the hosts, Chelsea and Travis.
We only could stay overnight, but had dinner at the Old Market House restaurant (the grilled artichokes were exquisite, and the interior decor amazing).
Also, with the house being in the arts district, there's plenty to see in the area. Next time we'll visit the historic area, across the bridge.
Overall a lovely stay and interesting surroundings."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I highly recommend this downtown Zanesville historic home. Chelsea and Travis have set up a beautiful apartment for airbnb. They were great hosts. Their dog is very sweet and makes the home feel very safe; he is extremely well-trained and behaves perfectly.
The apartment IS upstairs and for old people like me the steps are a little daunting. But I would stay there again in a heartbeat. I think the apartment is extraordinarily nice, and was a nice surprise to find in Zanesville Ohio."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,I was close to work and had fabulous hosts. What more could I have asked for.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a great place to stay! A very clean room with a Kitchenette, living room area, private bathroom, and separate bedroom, it was very spacious. Very comfortable bed, we honestly never say that, and it felt homey. We would definitely stay there again!!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Chelsea greeted me at the door upon my arrival. She gave me a tour of the unit. This was a great location close to my travel assignment.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kate was super quick to respond , made sure we had everything we needed ! Place was very cozy , comfortable , and was the cleanest place I have stayed !! We will be back next year for our event !! This was our home a way from home .. and it truly felt like that !! This is a must stay if your looking for a place .. you can not get better than this !!
Kate ‘s place is cute , modern , cozy .. and close to everything .. very happy with our stay !!
Thank you for providing a great place for us !"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"i really liked how much parking space there was. make sure to use the driveway to the right of the space, we tried the left driveway and our car (which is very low to the ground) scraped on it."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place!!! The mattress is super comfy, everything is clean and tastefully decorated, and the parking area in the back is very spacious…plenty of room to turn your car around so you don’t have to back into the street when you leave."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay! The house was very open and spacious. We had a few drop in visitors and there was room for everyone to see and visit together. The house had mostly everything that we could want/need during stay. Only had to message the host once (user error with thermostat), and he responded very quickly. If I had to give one suggestion- it would be to stock the kitchen with a few more essentials- a can opener, mixing bowls, large frying pan, etc. But other than that, it was perfect! Every room was stocked with comfortable bedding, towels, lots of storage. We hope to stay again during the summer weather to take advantage of the pool/outdoors!"
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"Absolutely squeaky clean! Plenty of parking, beautiful views of the river. Very comfortable for our family get together, nice open plan so we could all enjoy each other’s company while playing games, eating, and playing ping pong ( we had a “competitive “ tournament!)."
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Perfect location for my group. We enjoyed the big living room with plenty of space to stretch out. We’ll be back next year!
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"We enjoyed our stay and highly recommend this home to families, friends, and groups visiting the area!!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Awesome house, Great host. Nice quiet neighborhood"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"This house is a peaceful sanctuary. The neighborhood is small and quiet. The location feels like the country, but restaurants, grocery and gas are 10 minutes away. The house was really clean. The space is huge and everyone can spread out. There is plenty of parking for 6+ cars on the driveway. The pictures are spot-on. Kevin and Chalom are communicative and really put an effort into making you feel welcome to the property. If you need to be in the Zanesville area with a large family, this is your spot. Everyone in our family wants to stay here again if we visit Ohio."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Very clean with extra amenities. Kevin had helpful instructions for the house and good recommendations for the area. Would stay again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,The location was great for us. The house was the perfect size and very clean. We appreciated the clear and reasonable expectations and rules.
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,Nice weekend stay for the family.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family and I had a wonderful time we enjoyed the pool. The garage was full of things to do for the kids and myself the bedrooms were comfortable. I brought along some bicycles and my kids rode them down the private road. It was a wonderful vacation for myself and my family.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house was IMMACULATE when we arrived. Peaceful riverside location with a pool (pool is bigger than what the picture shows). Kevin and Chalom are amazing hosts. Chalom was responsive and helpful when I had trouble with the door (no problem with the door, I’m just a big dummy lol) and Kevin dropped by (communication sent ahead of time) and cleaned up the pool and even helped us navigate the TV. The garage/mancave was fun with the ping pong table and foosball. Only thing i can point out is the water pressure in the master bathroom shower was a bit weak, but that was minor compared to the excellent overall experience. Highly recommended if you will be in that area. I will definitely rebook here when I am back in the area."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a great place to stay! My husband fished while me and the kids swam! We enjoyed all the amenities and will definitely be back!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, easy self check in, nice little home to stay in! It was super quiet and peaceful for our stay! And the washer and dryer was such a nice feature!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Travis's home in Zanesville was a great little home for my business colleague and I to stay at during a quick visit to the area. The home was easy to find and had everything we needed, with the simplicity of staying in a home rather than a hotel.
We primarily used the place to sleep/rest but it had all the amenities that we needed. Its in a nice quiet area, and photos were exactly like the place.
I would recommend and stay at this home again in the future."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This house is in a great location and is close to everything Zanesville has to offer!
2024-03-01,4,Stayed one night,Overalll a nice place. The house was vey conveniently located to amenities.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice place.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home was very comfortable and welcoming. Very well equipped kitchen with all the little things I don't think about until I need them (oil, spices...).
The neighborhood was nice and felt very safe. Travis was easy to get in touch with and very willing to help.
I highly recommend and would definitely stay here again when I'm in town."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great space! Clear and clean. Easy to access most of what Zanesville offers. A fantastic space for our family of three to visit family.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super clean! We enjoyed our time. Will definitely stay again when we come back into town!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our family of four thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Kate's home! We have a 5 year old and a 2 year old and it was plenty of space for all of us. The home smelled clean and fresh upon arrival. The coded lock on the front door was a very cool touch and easy to use. The two bedrooms were perfect for our needs. Laundry is onsite and in the basement. Speaking of the basement, those traveling with little ones should know the stairway leading to the basement does not have a door and the steps are pretty steep. We were able to build a make-shift barrier to keep the little guy from taking a tumble. If we stay here again, we will bring a baby gate with us. Galley-style kitchen would be great to cook meals for an individual or a family and the kitchen appliances were fantastic. The bathroom was nicely updated and clean. We will gladly stay here again should the opportunity arise! Thank you Kate for a lovely stay!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The home was very cozy and close to the hospital. We booked last minute and the host responded quickly and was able to assist us so we could be in town to watch our grandson be born.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location in Zanesville. Place was clean, easy to access, and accommodations were comfortable. Host was responsive and friendly. Look forward to staying again!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was perfect for what we needed.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,sweet cozy little spot
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our group loved this place! We walked in and felt right at home. The couch was very comfortable and the kitchen was nice and clean. The bathroom had consistent warm water and was also very comfortable. The neighbour hood felt safe and peaceful.
Kate is beyond amazing. She accommodated our group when we had last minute change in numbers. She got us more than enough linen. Everything worked perfectly and she gave clear check-in and check-out instructions.
If you’re looking for a flawless and stress -free stay, you will not be disappointed! We also enjoyed the convenience of gas stations, Italian restaurants, and even a Walmart nearby."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,We were very impressed with our stay at this property. It was spotless and well-appointed and was everything that my family was hoping for! Kate was very communicative and gave clear instructions which was appreciated. We loved our stay and hope to be back!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My family had a wonderful stay at Kate’s house. It was clean, comfortable, quiet, and stocked with everything we needed plus more! It was unexpected and helpful to have extras like rubbing alcohol under the bathroom sink, a few zip lock storage bags in the kitchen & plenty of coffee pods that lasted our entire stay. The couch was wide enough for one of our kids to comfortably sleep on, since they are at an age where they’d rather not share a double bed if given the choice.
Kate is very communicative & truly is a “super host” in my book! Several houses in the area lost power for a short period of time one morning. Kate, without prompting, immediately messaged with information and updates about what was happening and when it would be restored.
Having been an Airbnb host myself, none of Katie’s extras were overlooked or taken for granted. I would absolutely recommend her house to others."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was the second time I've stayed in Kate's home. I came to town on business and Kate's place is comfortable,clean and in a very convenient location. I will definitely stay at Kate's again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Kate’s house was beautifully decorated, updated and clean. Kate went out of her way to help accommodate our toddler with a bed rail. We really appreciate her help and quick responses. We will definitely visit again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our first visit to this house was so positive that we knew if we returned to town we'd try to stay at Kate's again. We did and we're so glad we came back. The house is such a comfortable home and we felt right at home. Kate has thought of everything and has added it to the house for her guest's use. From the kitchen to the bathroom and then both bedrooms, you feel like you are at your own house. A bonus is an additional TV in one of the bedrooms along with the one in the living room. This home is located on a very quiet street with plenty of driveway parking and within minutes to everything you would need...stores, farmers markets, hospital, restaurants, downtown, the interstate, movie theater, etc... Kate responds within minutes of being contacted and so helpful. She even gifted us with a very generous surprise. Thank you Kate!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We stayed two months and two weeks at this home. We loved the quite neighborhood, nice neighbors and closeness to shopping etc. Kate is a wonderful host who reacted to any concerns within minutes. Her home was very updated, clean and comfortable. The reason for staying so long was due to getting our new home built in the area. Thank you Kate for the wonderful amazing stay. You have a gem."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kate offered a beautiful and welcoming place to stay that I would recommend to anyone looking to travel in the Zanesville area.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing place to stay! Thank you!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,10/10 Best airbnb we have stayed at. By far the most clean one for sure. Would definitely recommend Kate as a host.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay and excellent hosts! Love the renovations, thoughtful touches (notebook to leave notes about our stay, Apple TV, towels, paper products, plenty of outlets/charging stations, etc.). We stay in the area often to visit family and will definitely book again! Host was great and made it clear that she was readily available if needed (but we didn’t need her - everything was perfect!)."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came in for the Christmas weekend and Kate's place was an oasis after a long day traveling. Unfortunately the weather was pretty awful, but the house was cozy and warm. It is very well decorated, clean and welcoming. Safe nice little neighborhood. We would book again."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is located in a very safe location of Zanesville and with easy navigation to stores, the mall, hospital, restaurants and quick access to Interstate 70. About 45 minutes drive from Columbus airport. Kate was helpful when I asked for assistance in operating the Apple TV since I had no clue. I only knew how to work a TV with channels and a basic remote control. Very quick to respond and I appreciated that. The kitchen is very well stocked with all appliances. We baked Christmas cookies. A mixer, all the bowls and bake-ware we needed to help with this chore were available in the cupboards. Very nicely updated home, clean and comfortable. Although the house is in town surrounded by neighbors, the deer roamed in the backyard in the morning. They felt safer here than the woods, maybe because of deer hunting season. Would definitely stay here again. Highly recommend."

Tom’s Ice Cream Bowl, a classic sandwich and ice cream shop, great sundaes. Muddy Misers Restaurant, on the river, good food and drinks. Winerak store has great selection of beer, wine, meat and specialty groceries. Weasel Boy brewery, excellent local beer and limited local food menu."

My only problem was that the listing said there would be a pack and play, and baby gate. I didn't pack ours because of this. We looked everywhere and there wasn't either, so my husband had to run and buy both from the nearby Walmart. Would absolutely give this place/experience 5 stars if it weren't for this minor hiccup. I still highly recommend!"

2022-11-01,4,Stayed one night,"Entering the house thru the side door of the garage then in the basement, up the very narrow stairs into the house. The basement door leads into a bedroom. That part was weird but once you are in the house, it was clean. Lots of instructions which is helpful. Zach thought of a lot of little extras like toothpaste, female pads, hair dryer, special dark color washcloths for taking makeup off and a basket of treats. Zach also had waters in the refrigerator for us as well as a variety of coffee, tea and hot chocolate for the keurig. The house is right next to a road so you do hear cars driving past but it wasn’t too bad. The beds were very comfortable. Both bedrooms had ceiling fans which was nice. Zach’s house was much better than staying in a hotel while traveling to see family."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,This was the perfect stay on the way to visit family. The house was very warm and inviting like a home away from home. Perfect amount of room for my family of 3. Just wish we could’ve stayed longer. Great instructions and easy to follow.

We stayed for two nights for a wedding down the road at Weatherington Woods, which was so conveniently only 10 minutes away. It’s within walking distance of the delicious Adornetto’s pizza where the rehearsal dinner was, which was a happy surprise! The house was clean, bright, and exactly what we needed. Zach was responsive and friendly and even offered us early checkin and late checkout without us even asking, which was so appreciated. The bride and groom even stayed with us the night before to get some rest away from the hustle and bustle of rehearsing!
We LOVED the complimentary snack tray and the little deck in the back yard was my favorite spot to relax. We will definitely be back again if we ever need to stay out in Zanesville again."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My son, daughter and I came from out of town for my mother's funeral service. We were so glad to find this charming house and stay there instead of a hotel. It was easy to see that great care had been taken to choose the furnishings, a mix of modern and vintage items. We had every thing we needed and greatly appreciated the tray with snacks, oatmeal etc. Also the Keurig selections were good as well because we really didn't have time to go shop and pick up these sorts of things. The location was very good as well. A HUGE thank you for making this available in Zanesville!"

The home was centrally located in town and gave easy access to restaurants and stores. We will book again next time we are visiting family."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great value for your money. Host was great at communicating and answering questions. Place was clean and comfortable !

It was great to have pancake mix and snacks provided snce it was too late to go to a store.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was absolutely amazing it had everything you may have needed. I ask Zack if there were wine glasses in the house and he made sure there was. He was very fast at responding when I had questions. Very great host will be back if I'm back in the area.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I wish I could give this 10 stars. The house was absolutely perfect. VERY clean. Up to date. Plenty of towels and the pillows and beds were really comfortable. Fantastic location near everything yet quiet because its on a side street. The fire pit was nice (even though we didn't get to use it) and even stocked with wood! Zach was awesome, he truly cares about his guests. I cannot say enough good things about our experience. Do not hesitate to book this house, you will love it!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay in this adorable place was perfect! The home is very clean, it is located in a perfect/convenient location, and the owners are great to work with!

2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"Truly beautiful home! The place was set up impeccably - very clean, very comfortable, beautifully furnished. Loved the back patio with the bar chairs and wooden table - lovely spot to eat outdoors!

Great location with many shops and diners within 5 minutes drive. Zach was very responsive and communicates effectively. Overall highly recommend!"

The host was very communicative and provided very clear directions for everything. We loved all the amenities provided and there were lots of things that other places don’t usually have like lots of cookware, spices, bathroom supplies, plenty of blankets, pillows and towels if needed.

She went out of her way to fulfill our request for an early check in. One can definitely tell Kellie is genuine & truly cares about her guests, making certain her guests feel right at home. If you need a place to stay while visiting Zanesville I highly recommend Riverview Cottage."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We spent a couple of nights at the Riverview Cottage and thoroughly enjoyed our time there! The cottage was perfectly clean and comfortable. Kellie was an excellent hostess, very friendly, helpful and generous-- a true Superhost! Who knew there was so much to do in Zanesville, Ohio?? Kellie had a terrific list of really fun and interesting places to visit in her guidebook. We hit lots of them. We loved having our coffee on the big, private deck and a nice campfire in the side yard fire pit. This is absolutely the most comfortable Airbnb we've stayed at so far!! A real gem!"

It was very close to where we wanted to be (near family) but also happens to be close to a lot of the main shopping and food attractions of Zanesville, yet it does not feel that way. The house is lovely and clean, and has everything you need without feeling cluttered. Phillip communicates in a very timely manner, clearly and concisely. The home is accessible via stairs or a brick-walkway with a steep-ish incline, so keep that in mind when booking, for persons that this might be a challenge for. My husband and son played cornhole and my husband photographed birds in the yard on a sunny, quiet morning. We have family in the area, so it felt like staying with family, in a way. It is quintessential Zanesville, with all its country beauty and charm. We loved our stay."
