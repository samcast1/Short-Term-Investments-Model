2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful little home away from home! The model for what an Airbnb experience should be, in my opinion. Thank you for another lovely stay, Lisa!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had just two of us for a girls weekend. The cabin was a perfect size for us! It is so quiet and peaceful, but close to restaurants and shopping! Location is close enough to get out and enjoy Nisswa, Pequot Lakes, even Cross Lake and far enough that you feel like you are in the middle of the woods! The cabin is equip with everything you need. We will definitely be back!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lisa was a very proactive host and the space was very cozy and perfectly described. Would be more than happy to stay here again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot a couple minutes from downtown Pequot and 371. Really quiet spot tucked back in the woods. If you‚Äôre staying for a while you‚Äôll have to plan on laundry services off site. If you‚Äôre on a budget the Legion in town is the place to go for decent food at a real good price. If you want something trendy Lucky‚Äôs is the place to go. Best breakfast was up 371 in Jenkins at A-Pine Family Restaurant.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,was an awesome get away after the day at the racetrack
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very positive experience. And dogs were super cute and well-trained. :)
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at Lisa's Airbnb at Pequot Lakes. We were not able to take advantage of all the area had to offer because of our commitments while we were there; but Lisa had many suggestions and information about all types of things to do close by.
The cottage was very comfortable, and had everything we needed to have an enjoyable stay. Lisa was great at communicating/responding to texts, and even left lights on for us when we ended up arriving later than we had originally planned. We lived in the country in a wooded area for many years before moving to ""suburbia"" in a big city; so the area was nostalgic and a welcome change for us for the time we were there. We would highly recommend this Airbnb cottage for anyone traveling to this area, and we would not hesitate to stay here again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a peaceful cute spot! Lisa was a fantastic, proactive and friendly host. We had a very relaxing weekend and enjoyed the cozy cabin vibes. Highly recommend!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a very lovely AirBnB. Very quiet and cozy. The electric fireplace is an extra nice touch. I would definitely stay here again!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Lovely little cabin amidst the trees. We enjoyed reading and board game with the fire. Plenty of lovely hiking options very close by, antique shops, picnic shops, etc. They had a binder of great info; we used the restaurant list the most. It definitely is going on it visit again list!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wow! This is the coziest cabin in the woods I‚Äôve ever been to. So cute inside, better than the pictures. Quiet and peaceful. It was beyond clean. So spotless, smelled good, comfortable. The bedding was perfectly clean (and I am picky ). We drive a big pickup truck and there was a big enough parking area and room to turn the truck around (it‚Äôs a dually, so you can imagine.)
Lisa is a great host. She really went above and beyond with her communication. Check out the book on the counter‚Ä¶she has bios of her dogs! Sweet and humorous. Being dog people, we loved that so much.
Thanks Lisa for a wonderful stay."

She provided a great list of local places to check out and things to do and was very helpful in providing extra driving directions to make sure that I found the place easily. It was the perfect home-away-from-home that I was looking for, and I'm excited to stay again!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay at Lisa's guest cottage! It was great to go ""up north"" for a relaxing weekend and get away from the cities for a while. My husband loved the cozy atmosphere of the cottage. Our dog loved laying in front of the warm fireplace. I loved the value and the amenities. The area was scenic and peaceful with lots of woods nearby.
We had a great weekend hiking at nearby parks, hanging out at the cottage and reading and playing games. We cooked most of our meals in the kitchen, but ordered from Tasty Pizza North one evening. I highly recommend it, especially if you like your pizza cut in squares! :)
The cottage was comfortable and just the right size. Lisa was great to communicate with and had clear instructions for check-in, check-out, etc. I appreciated all of the tourism brochures to learn more about what the area has to offer. We would enjoy coming back again sometime."
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Lisa was a great host! Very responsive when we had questions. Roku needed an update and she help with that. We thought we were locked out one day and she assisted with that as well. Great location in the heart of the BLA. Dog friendly and good recommendations for dining options.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Can‚Äôt say enough about how perfect this was for what we needed! Adorable cabin, and so dog friendly that we are now RUINED I‚Äôm sure for places that say ‚Äúdog friendly‚Äù üòä Even pooper scoopers outside and bowls inside.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Lisa was a great host. Her cottage was a very cute little place. She responded quickly to my messages. We brought our dog and he was able to checkout the yard. Lisa has 3 dogs and we‚Äôre all well behaved. There was a great reference book for information on the area. We would highly recommend.
Thank you!

2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa was great to work with; very laid-back , easy-going, and accommodating! We loved the little cottage. The tuck-and-groove pine walls / ceiling is perfect for the setting. The price is commensurate with the furnishings and amenities - which was perfect for us - but do keep that in mind (because I know that some people are really picky, thinking that every piece of furniture should be perfect, etc... etc...)"

I needed a getaway weekend to recharge before starting my final semester of school. This weekend was a gift from my Mom. Lisa was very nice, touched base, but also respected my privacy.
Her coffee shop recommendation was spot on! Lakes Latte was a cool place with great coffee! I found a snowshoeing trail at Fritz Loven Park, about 8 miles away. It was great exercise for both me and my dog! The dog park in town was a bonus as well.

It‚Äôs more like a house, but the walls and ceilings were made from a beautiful pine so it felt homey and cabin-y. Everything you‚Äôd need to prepare meals was there, as well as extra blankets and pillows. The bed was nice and comfy, and we really enjoyed the ceiling fan in the bedroom. The window air conditioner did an amazing job of keeping the entire place cool in the 90 degree heat when we were there. The pictures don‚Äôt do this place justice. The location was perfect as it was close to Nisswa and Pequot Lakes, as well as Baxter and Brainerd. We had family staying on a lake in the area, so it was convenient for us to gather every day. Lisa was a great hostess and communication was prompt. We couldn‚Äôt think of one thing to improve our stay at her place. Her home is nearby, but we had 100% privacy the entire time. Thank you, for everything, Lisa!"

We could tell a lot of effort and thought was put into the space. It really gave us something to look forward to during a time when we really have to be careful about what we do, as far as safe, recreational activities. We watched movies, snuggled, played games and made yummy food. The perfect space for what we were looking for."

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa's guest home is the perfect size and location for a weekend getaway. The place is very clean, quiet, well stocked, and dog friendly. Lisa is a very nice host and easy to get in touch with. We were able to access everything within a 10 minute drive. We checked out downtown for some coffee, Breezy Point for it's winter trails, and Nisswa for dinner and a night out. Overall, we had a nice stay and a fun time exploring the area."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice small cabin! We came up to relax, cook and cross country ski and it was perfect for that. The kitchen was very nicely stocked with a variety of different pots and pans, much better than most airbnbs tend to be. The gas fireplace was a very cozy touch for warming up after skiing! Would recommend staying here!"

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A comfy little cabin that was nicely laid out and great for a couple or small family. It was closer to the hosts main house than I realized, and although we rarely saw them we did hear her dogs barking occasionally. All in all a nice little stay for a more than reasonable price near a scenic little town."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice, cozy getaway. We enjoyed the privacy and beauty of the outdoors."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A cute place with all the necessities + some ""bonus"" amenities at a fantastic value. My girlfriend and I especially enjoyed walking around Pequot Lakes' Main Street area - specifically, we can't recommend MN Trading Co highly enough!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Shops and restaurants very close. Also a great place to use as a base to be able to explore other great small towns. Would be perfect for a couples' get away.

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a wonderful time at this cabin. So quiet and clean! Had everything I needed . Close enough to walk to town and my dog enjoyed the space too! Trails are close by so no need to drive. Would definitely stay here again!!

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute cabin, just right for the two of us. We came to relax and bike on the Paul Bunyan Trail (less than 1/2 mile away) and accomplished both goals. The cabin is near the owner's house, and not far from the highway, but the intervening woods removed any distractions - very private. Watch carefully for the Patriot Place road - we missed it the first time. Very convenient to shopping at Pequot Lakes (1/2 mile), Nisswa (7 miles) and the A-Pine restaurant at Jenkins (2 miles). We loved our stay and will be back."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The best part was that we were able to bring our dog with for our weekend get away. The cabin was just perfect, clean, comfortable, fantastic location. I would definitely recommend!"

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were in the area to kayak for a couple days and this was a great location to stay for us and our dog. This is on the edge of town. It was quiet and we had our privacy. Lisa came out when we arrived and let us know we could let her know if we had any questions. We brought food and found the kitchen stocked with pots, plates, toaster, etc.
We walked our dog into town and felt safe. The paved bike/running trail is less than a mile away. Many options for kayaking within 45 minutes.
Would definitely stay again if in the area."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Second time around in better weather! Felt like a second home for us to get away. It‚Äôs conveniently tucked away from town noise but close enough that we can grab a few forgotten groceries! Will definitely be back again!

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved Lisa's cottage and would love to return. We used the cottage as a quiet spot to recover from busy family get togethers and it was perfect. We like quiet, private and comfortable and it was all of those. Lisa is very organized and responsive to questions so we had no issues at all. The cottage has comforts like a fan in case you sleep with the noise, nice knives, a stocked game cabinet and even a popcorn machine with popcorn kernels. Good memories were made at the cottage in Pequot Lakes."

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This cabin was great! Lisa let us check in a bit early and everything in the cabin was spotless. Great value. Close to Poquet Lakes and Nisswa. The cabin is close to the main house but feels very secluded and private. You have your own patio area. Its so nice to have someone that welcomes dogs. I really appreciated her welcome packet that introduced us to her dogs and also gave information about the surrounding area. Really enjoyed our stay. Lisa was readily available for the few queations we had.
Thank you!!"
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very close to downtown Pequot Lakes but feels remote. Perfect spot for 2 people to stay. We had no issues or concerns with our trip and would stay here again.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"WOW!!! This is the best Airbnb I‚Äôve stayed in hands down. The place was spotless! The kitchen had everything you could need. The decor was so perfect and cute! The cottage does sit close to the main house, but the porch faces completely away and is so private. We had so much privacy and felt like we were alone. There are very cute and nice dogs that say hi to you sometimes, but they stay away from your area. And the welcome booklet gives there names and pictures! Super sweet.
The location was perfect. We were a couple blocks away from Main Street. The bars were nice and the locals are really friendly.
We will ABSOLUTELY be staying here again! It was exactly the kind of place we wanted l for our atv riding weekend!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very neat, and private. It is in a good location accessible to many fun activities as well as food and shopping. Very comfortable bed too!"

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, as described and everything was in working order. Regular communication through text. Even though the cabin was close to the house property we had plenty of privacy. We were so busy we didn‚Äôt get to us the grill or fire pit... next trip!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful cabin. Beats a resort any day if private is what you‚Äôre looking for. Lakes and shopping all close by. Great walking trails, too."

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lisa's cottage is absolutely perfect! We couldn't have been more pleased with our experience. Loved all the little extra touches, and her welcome pamphlet filled with info about the area and introduction to her pups was adorable! Everything you could ever need and more! Definitely beats staying at a hotel. Extremely comfortable and pleasant experience. Thanks again Lisa, our family looks forward to visiting again soon!"

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa's place was perfect for a quiet getaway for my wife and I. The kitchen is well stocks with everything you need.
The gas fireplace/stove was a nice cozy touch with the cool days and nights. Lisa has a nice list of local attractions and eating places.
It is conveniently located near Pequot Lake which is a charming town with nice shops etc.
I highly recommend Lisa's place if you want to relax and get away from the business of life."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lisa was a welcoming host and made check-in very easy. The cabin is well-equipped in the kitchen and throughout. It rained most of the time we were there, but we did sneak in a firepit fire during a lull. Both the firepit and grill would be such assets in nicer weather. It felt like we were at the ""family cabin"" that so many Minnesotans seem to have."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Comfy Cabin close to all things touristy üëçüèº
2021-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,cute cabin close to town

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice 1 bedroom cottage on Lisa‚Äôs property. Very cozy place, all the cooking utensils and gadgets one could ever need. 1/2 mile from ‚Äúdowntown‚Äù and super easy to get around. So glad she welcomed our dog, and her pups were very friendly and polite! Although the cottage is close by to her house, privacy was never an issue and we felt isolated during our entire stay. Hope to come back to enjoy the summer activities in the area!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a wonderful little spot off the beaten path. Very clean, very well stocked, and very nice host. We had no issues at all and the value was spectacular! We loved the privacy provided. Thanks so much!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cottage from Lisa is everything you would expect from the description. The location of the cottage is near the local towns but far enough to not hear any traffic or other noises. Lisa's dog are very welcoming and friendly. Lisa was available if we needed anything. The interior of the cottage is spacious and just the right size. The kitchen was very well stocked and allowed us to enjoy the home cooked meals we had planned including the use of the bbq grill. Lisa is another great example of an AirBnb Super Host. Thank You Lisa.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable & comfy little cabin! It‚Äôs close enough to a couple little stores for any forgotten necessities but far enough that you feel like you‚Äôre away from it all. The furnace will make you want to snuggle up for days while watching TV marathons. The weather wasn‚Äôt too good for us but we definitely wanted to take advantage of the trails nearby. The kitchen has everything you need, including sharp knives. I‚Äôm a chef & it‚Äôs majorly exciting when knives in someone else‚Äôs kitchen work. Lisa let us do our thing but was there if we had any questions! Her informational booklet was helpful & cute."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is cozy and great in so many ways. Lisa response and hospitality was amazing she made sure we were okay and ask us if we needed anything. The bathroom and kitchen and bedroom was clean and neat. I recommend this place for anyone who wants to feel safe and have no worries about anything because Lisa will provide with answers.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa was a fantastic host. She let us change our reservation dates with no issues at the last minute, gave us detailed directions on how to find the cottage (would be a little tricky without those), was very quick to respond to questions and made sure we were as comfortable as possible. Her cottage is within minutes of a ton of lakes and fun places to visit. Great value, great accommodations and great location with a great host!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This cozy cottage is perfect & in a great location! Everything worked great and it was super clean. Would definitely stay here again!
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice!
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The pictures of this location don't do it justice. Very nice cabin that was easy to find and centrally located!
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice spot up north for a quick weekend getaway during the winter. The fireplace was an awesome touch for cozying up during such a cold spell.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay at the cabin! Gas fire place/stove made the place. Well stocked kitchen, lots of extra bedding and cozy blankets. Insanely strong water pressure. Walkable to the small town. A 10 min drive from a bigger town with more shops, restaurants, brewery and more."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for a couple ! Absolutely perfect !
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a lovely weekend getaway at Lisa's cabin. The cabin is private while also being a short drive into town. It was comfortable and Lisa was a considerate host.

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My family of 4 had the best time at this real treat of a cabin. We automatically felt comfy and cozy entering the cabin. The decor was modern yet comfy and still had a cabin vibe. It‚Äôs better than your average cabin rental bc you can tell everything was meticulously thought out. The beds were comfy, Water pressure good, games/balls/sand toys for my kids, no stinky carpet, super clean, nice kitchen stuff, coffee pods and new kureg, big fluffy towels, popcorn my kids loved to eat each night, dvd player and lots of red box in the area.
The host, Shara was very friendly and helpful with the whole process.
The little association had very friendly people staying there. You can tell they take pride in the area‚Ä¶ keeping it clean and well maintained. We loved the sandy beach and can‚Äôt wait to come back when the water and weather is warmer.
Thanks to Shara for letting us borrow this slice of heaven."

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,awesome
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place for me to stay! Spent the weekend at Brainerd International Raceway and needed a warm, cozy place to sleep for the night. Check-in was easy, space was exactly as described, and host was responsive. Would definitely stay again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect apartment for my visit to BIR. I was driving and instructing at the track and needed a clean and comfortable place to stay. Rick‚Äôs place was great for what I needed. Will look to stay there again in the future.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good location, easy to come and go, had everything I needed, clean.... would stay again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was perfectly located for my trip to Brainerd as I was relocating my son to CLC for college. The owners were very communicative and were also helpful in finding dining options as we came in late and I need gluten free. (try Slice on Oak if you‚Äôre hungry for pizza..it was so good!) The Studio is quaint and had everything I needed for my stay. It is on a Main Street with a fair amount of activity, so if you‚Äôre used to country living (like I am) bring something to drown out the noise of the busy street. The neighbors were friendly and I plan on rebooking for future visits to watch my son play basketballüòé Thank You for your hospitality and for having me at your place!! Go Raiders üòéüèÄ‚õπÔ∏è"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great centrally located place in Brainerd. I stayed here and biked at Cuyuna. Easy drive to the trailhead.
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was as described. Provide parking on site and easy to locate when driving.
Rick was responsive with any questions and provided all the necessary details for our stay. Recommend for future stays in the area."
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Rick and his team were very responsive. We had asked for an early check in, and they quickly agreed. When we arrived at the Airbnb, it very clearly had not been cleaned. We communicated this with them, and they were very responsive and accommodating to us. They got us another place to stay and cleaned the original Airbnb. All in all, it was a rough start to the trip, but in the end, I was very satisfied with how the team handled the issues that arose and their professionalism along the way! Thank you"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place and a great Host I would definitely stay there again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Easy self check-in. Simple studio. Was great for us, we were in town for a wedding. Shower is small and there was no shower soap. Had to use pump hand soap. Otherwise nice place."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our expectations were definitely met. Cute, small place. Perfect for our needs. We were in the area for a family get together and only needed a place to sleep and shower. (The shower is quite small, but sufficient.)"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Will stay again next time I‚Äôm in town visiting!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great host, super responsive and helpful. The location is clean and convenient. It snowed a lot while I was staying there but the driveway and steps were cleaned every morning which made life so much easier for me."
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,When we arrived we had a hard time getting in with the code. Note: That was on us because we didn‚Äôt read the instructions carefully.ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è We called Rick and he walked us through it.üòâ He was very patient with us.üòâ
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rick and his co-host Christy were so responsive. I had a few issues with the place and they responded very quickly. It's a cute little studio. A bit overpriced in my opinion for what you're getting. Very busy street and a dog that barks all day outside (not good for a nurse working midnights). The decor and the layout was super cute. If you are a big person be prepared to have ZERO room to move in the shower. For such a tiny space, they have really done a lot with it. Comfy bed, nice TV. Probably perfect for someone who is staying busy and just needing a place to sleep and eat. They could definitely hire better cleaners. Overall though, very cute place and AMAZING hosts!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed our stay in Brainerd, would recommend!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The studio is nicely renovated, and they did a good job making it comfortable. The neighborhood and surrounding homes are a bit unkempt, which I understand isn‚Äôt in there control. I felt safe, there wasn‚Äôt many people around but also kept to myself.
Easy to find and binder had wonderful restaurants recommended.
I would stay again."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paul was a wonderful host! He made us feel right at home. He went above and beyond with every little detail. He gave us wonderful local recommendations. We loved fishing from his dock, we took our boat out for some top water and caught several bass. So fun as the lake was clear so you could see them snag the bait."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Words are hard to find when describing this place. It was so wonderful, beautiful, and peaceful. A slice of heaven, really! There is no doubt this is where I will stay whenever I'm in the area! Paul is so sweet and accommodating and the space is perfection!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Boathouse was wonderful! Right on the water and simple amenities. The ""outhouse"" bathroom gave it a little campy feel, but had everything we needed. Paul was extremely friendly and even gave us a ride in the golf cart to make sure we got to the boathouse. looking forward to our next visit."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Paul was incredibly gracious and had much hospitality. He even made us some breakfast which was unexpected and well cherished.
The boathouse was super cute and adorable. Had every part full of thoughtful decorative touches.
The location was incredible and the views from the window of the boat house offer incredibly private and remote feelings.
The location was near Brainerd and there were many things to do that were close.
Great price as well."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time staying in Paul's boathouse. Very clean and right on the water. Peaceful location and beautiful sunsets. Also close to Paradise Bar and Dennis Drummond Winery both of which we had visited before and returned to again this time. Bathroom situation was a bit of a hassle after dark and in the middle of the night, but Paul provided a nice lantern which helped. Bed was comfortable, and linens and towels were good quality. He had a large pitcher of filtered water in the frig which was very nice, especially given the boathouse has no running water. AC worked great. We enjoyed ourselves and hope to return again next year. Thanks Paul!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing spot right on a beautiful lake. Comfy bed. Watched an eagle while enjoying coffee on the dock the morning I was leaving.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I booked Paul‚Äôs place after my wife and I had stayed there for my in-laws. They loved that the place was clean and smaller for just the two of them. They also liked that there was multiple places to go for food that were close by. Paul‚Äôs personable personality and helpfulness was also amazing!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a lovely place, will 100% be back. The host was so amazing and very accommodating making sure we have everything and gave us amazing recommendations to places near by. It was so clean and very cozy, we were sad to be checking out."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Paul was a wonderful host, he goes above and beyond to make you feel welcome. If you need anything, just ask. We felt right at home and everything was just as described. Walking to the bathroom was not a big deal. In fact at night you can see the clear sky and all those stars. It was very peaceful and comfortable at The Boathouse, very beautiful. Docking a boat is easy and there are fish in that lake. Sunsets are Amazing! Close enough to town, but far enough away to enjoy the quiet. We definitely plan to return and stay again. Thanks again Paul!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Definitely a quiet and relaxing place, Paul was a very attentive and friendly person. I am sure we will return to this place again and again you see since it generated a lot of peace and comfort for us."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This location is very peaceful. When I was there, I was able to keep the windows open, and I could hear the lake lapping at the shore while I napped. The sunsets were really great, too--just like Paul's photos. It is a great place to stay."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful and clean accommodation right on the water. Wonderful host made sure we were well taken care of during our stay. Would come back!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was our 3rd time staying. It‚Äôs always perfect. Paul has truly considered every detail. Can‚Äôt wait for our early fall visit!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The photos posted do not do this property justice! This had to be the most beautiful and peaceful place we have ever stayed at. Waking up to the view of the lake through the massive window was one of the most beautiful views we‚Äôve ever had. The neighbours were quiet and respectful. The property was immaculate on the inside and out. The walk to the bathroom and shower area was a non issue.
Paul was such a great host he gave us all the information we needed about the property and the surrounding area, including restaurant recommendations. Paul really cares about your stay and is there to accommodate any needs or requests you may have. We would rate our stay 15 out of 5 !
Highly recommend you take advantage of watching the sunsets!"

‚ÄúRIGHT ON THE WATER‚Äù is not an exaggeration and the views are wonderful!
Paul‚Äôs place is roomy, orderly and has everything you need. Getting to the separate modern and pristine) bathroom was mildly inconvenient at first, but once I got used to it I was fine.
I highly recommend staying here. And Paul is very helpful and friendly!
Did I mention the peace and quiet?"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Paul's place was better than advertised. He was super helpful and yet did not hover. The space was larger than I expected, and the view was magnificent. The bed was very comfortable,and I slept like a baby. The detached bathroom was just perfect, and the short distance to get to it was very manageable. I loved staying here, and my only regret was that I couldn't stay longer."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Paul was an absolutely amazing host - super responsive, extremely warm and friendly, knew everything about the area, and gave great recommendations! The place was beautiful and view of the sunset was stunning! Would definitely revisit!"

It is squeaky clean, and has all the necessary amenities ‚Äî filtered water, high thread count linen, comfortable pillows and bed! And on top of all this, Paul‚Äôs a very friendly and charming host.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The boathouse made for a perfect lake getaway at an affordable price. Our boat was docked about 20 feet from our bed and the very clean bathroom was just a short walk. It was like glamping on steroids! Paul (and neighbors) were very welcoming. We'll be back.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paul's boathouse was an incredible experience for my boyfriend and I to celebrate our one year! The Boathouse was simple, but had all the amenities needed for a peaceful getaway. The view from the Boathouse is an incredible lake view, that is a perfect place to watch the sunset over the lake, and also get the full lake experience. Paul was also an amazing host. A perfect mix of welcoming, but also gives you your space. He was also just a text or phone call away if anything was needed (which was rare, as the Boathouse was stocked with everything you could need). We are definitely making this a tradition, and cannot wait to venture up to the Boathouse again for another incredible trip. Thanks Paul!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Paul is a great host. We immediately felt comfortable and spent a quiet night in his beautiful accommodation. Can only recommend it.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My 2 night stay at the Boathouse was the best! I needed a place alone to reflect on recent losses in my life so with the beautiful view of the lake, the calming sound of the lapping water on the shore, the great sunset, it was perfect therapy for me. It was so cozy with the great bed and comfy couch & the fridge, microwave & coffee/coffee maker was all I needed for what I brought in my small cooler for my stay. Paul was attentive but gave me my space. He was friendly and I felt comfortable instantly. I‚Äôll be coming back soon!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Paul‚Äôs boathouse was a great place to stay for my wife and I. I would highly recommend this site for a quick weekend getaway. The host is a 10 out of 10 and the area surrounding are all great folks!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sooooo cute! Bigger than I imagined, comfy and great view. Warm day and the air conditioning definitely kept up. Great bed and appreciated the fridge, microwave and coffee maker. The bathroom is just up the way, and the shower was warm - towels were nice, too.
Paul was communicative but kept his space. Would definitely visit again if in the area."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paul‚Äôs boathouse is a place I visit every year. It‚Äôs beautiful, comfortable and a great oasis away from home. It can be a quiet stay away or you can venture to lake side bars or into Brainerd and Nisswa for local fun. Paul is easy to communicate with, super accommodating, and friendly. He wants your stay to be perfect! I will continue to make this a yearly trip and have established a great friendship with Paul!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Paul was a wonderful host. The setting on the lake is directly at the edge of the shore, providing a relaxing stay. Many zen moments sitting at the shoreline. It was so peaceful, we decided to dine on the dock rather than drive to a restaurant."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hospitality!!! Paul was on the property to greet us and took our things in a golf cart to the door of the boat house. He then showed me how everything worked. When my friend arrived, he took her things by golf cart too!!! In the golf cart, he gave us a shirt tour of the area and some history. There was cold filtered water in the small refrigerator. Paul‚Äôs place was spotless. The bed was very comfortable and you could look out right onto the lake"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful location right on the shore of South Long Lake near Brainerd, complete with a dock and Adirondack chairs. Gorgeous view out onto the lake for sunsets. Paul is a gracious host. Would stay here again, perfect base camp for exploring the area!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"During our visit to the Brainerd area for a wedding, Paul proved to be an exceptional host. His hospitality surpassed all expectations, as he consistently displayed remarkable kindness throughout our stay. With a little one, we needed a cozy and convenient place to accommodate our family, and Paul's residence exceeded our expectations.
One minor aspect worth noting is that the bathroom is located uphill. However, Paul's thoughtfulness mitigated any inconvenience associated with the uphill journey. He provided clear directions and made sure that accessing the bathroom was a breeze.
His genuine kindness and willingness to go the extra mile transformed a simple accommodation into an unforgettable getaway. We wholeheartedly recommend Paul as an exceptional host to anyone visiting the Brainerd area. Not to mention, our baby first started crawling here. Now it will always be a special place."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a beautiful experience here! Paul was super friendly and he helped us bring our luggage to the boathouse. He also gave us a tour of the neighborhood on his golf cart which was wonderful because it made me feel at home. Everything in the boat house was very clean and comfortable.
The view from the window was amazing! I love how I can see the lake from bed. I watched the lake throughout the day and ended my night with the moon reflecting its light on the lake, stars in the sky, and the enchanting sounds of loons. It was such a magical experience. I can‚Äôt wait to book my next stay!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything from booking to check out was outstanding. Paul was very responsive and kind. Beautiful setting, clean spaces with everything needed for the weekend. I‚Äôll book again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paul's Boathouse is an amazing special place for a wonderful vacation. Right at lake front of a beautiful lake. Nice and peaceful garden surrounding the boathouse. Looking out of the window one has the feeling to be on a boat. Every night you can enjoy a beautiful sunset. The boadhouse/ cabin is very clean and Paul is an absolut excellent host. Very nice, wants you to be happy and anything you may need, Paul is there for you to help. I enjoyed 4 nights/ 5 days at the lake and I enjoyed every minute. Dear Paul, Thank you so much!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Paul was very responsive and communicated well with our changing check-in time. He was waiting for us with his golf cart when we got there and took our luggage down for us. üòÉ Cute room! Paul had two chairs out for us to enjoy the sunset. And the sound of the water lapping on the shore in the morning was lovely. Would stay again here when we come back to the area. Paul is a great host!!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"So grateful for this fun, memorable place to stay! Paul was a great host and went above and beyond! Brought our bags to the Boat House and back to our car in his golf cart, communicated quickly with everything we needed to know, and gave us recommendations we took advantage of. Loved staying right on the lake! It was simple, beautiful, and a perfect place for my husband and I to stay for the weekend. Thanks Paul!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A MUST STAY!!! If you are in the Brainerd/Baxter/Mille Lacs area, and are looking for a clean, quiet, BEAUTIFUL place to stay, look no further. A great location, quiet area, and amazing host. Paul is so kind and thoughtful, the place is SPOTLESS, and the bed and views are not to be beat! The photos don't do the place justice. Spacious cabin, just enough amenities, and a quick drive into town if you are needing anything. Wonderful place, I will be back next year!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Paul was very friendly and helpful! Everything was extremely clean. Hoping to come back next year!

The BIAT HOUSE is not to be missed."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Booked same day and it was extremely easy. The views on the drive up alone were worth it but man! This place is so cute, clean, comfortable and the views of the lake are breath taking. Paul made us feel welcome and we definitely will be back in the summer to take advantage of the water! ‚ù§Ô∏è A must stay and the price is unbeatable."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was amazing! The views were so restful and beautiful. The boathouse was very comfortable and so very CLEAN! We really appreciated the cleanliness of both the bathroom and boathouse. The easy walk to the bathroom was no problem. Finally, the bed was VERY comfortable! Oh, and Paul is so easy to work with. He responds quickly with an questions and is very accommodating. (He even hauls your items to the boathouse with his golf cart.)It was a great place to unwind and relax. We would definitely return if we were in the area again!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This boathouse is the best AirBNB I have stayed at and Paul is the perfect host. Some of the many pluses are a stunning view (especially at sunset), comfy bed with 100% cotton sheets (sheet snob over here) and high end pillows and a well-appointed bathhouse. This place is immaculate and it was obvious it had been cleaned top to bottom before my arrival. It felt like a brand new unit. Paul was extremely friendly and I felt very safe here as a solo traveler. It‚Äôs obvious Paul loves welcoming people to this AirBNB and by the time you leave, it almost feels like you‚Äôve made a new friend. I‚Äôm a bit of an introvert and I could have chatted with Paul for hours. Don‚Äôt hesitate, book this boathouse!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great weekend at the boathouse! Very clean, comfortable and bigger than the pictures make it look. What a view of the lake! Paul was very helpful. We would love to stay again."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My stay at Paul‚Äôs boathouse was great. Very good communication, great check-in (he drove me and my luggage with his golf caddy to the boathouse) and room tour. He asked after check in if everything was good via Airbnb messenger. Can highly recommend this place and host."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We truly had a genuinely relaxing weekend! Paul's place is exactly what you see, but only better! You get that full up-north cabin feel with the cedar tongue and groove wall to ceiling interior, picture window over-looking the lake. The sun sets were stunning, seemed to last forever. You felt like you were all alone! The bed was amazing, we did bring our own pillows just to add to Paul's. The cabin was extremely clean and had that new feel to it like we were the first guests to stay there. The furniture was perfect and in like new condition. We loved the big TV. I would recommend bringing your personal Roku or Smart stick for Netflix, ect. Worked great as Paul provides Internet . Also, didn't mind at all the short walk to the perfectly clean and convenient out house. Paul was a great host! We definitely will be back. Thanks Again"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place to stay!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is perfect for an escape! Right on the lake with a beautiful view from the dock or the window. Very clean and full of all the essentials. Would stay again!

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice cozy boat house with a beautiful view. Paul was a great host! We will plan to stay here again!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I don‚Äôt know which is more of a gem üíé the Boat House or the host (Paul).
The Boat House: Straight out of a Terri Redlin painting. The pictures don‚Äôt do this slice of heaven justice it is absolutely perfect- immaculate and the bed is so comfortable. Sleep with the windows open to listen to the Loons call and the water hit the rocks. Relax in the Adirondack chairs and watch the most incredible sunset. My only recommendation would be stay more than one night.
The host, Paul, one of the nicest people you‚Äôll meet. You can tell he truly enjoys having guests. Communication was above and beyond.
I‚Äôll definitely be back!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is an absolute gem of a spot and a perfectly intimate and beautiful setting. We enjoyed cocktails on the dock and dinner sitting on the Adirondack chairs under the tree on the lawn while watching the sunset across the lake. The views from everywhere are just gorgeous and the inside of the boathouse is so charming and quaint. This is a very special setting and a 'one of a kind' type of getaway experience.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The BEST host ever ! And the house was spectacular , small , but beautifully remodeled and spotless clean !"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful night right on the lake- beautiful view, lovely room. Slept great, and had great communication with Paul.
Remember, the bathroom is a separate building, so plan for a dash in the night- Paul provides a lantern!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay at the boat house! Stayed for 2 nights and enjoyed the coziness. For next time it may be helpful to have a place where we could have kept our clothes (small nightstand) and some sort of way to have a nice cup of coffee first thing in the morning. Paul, thanks for helping us get our belongings down the hill with your golf cart and being such a great host. We will definitely stay again! üòÅ"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful little spot on the lake.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely little cabin! Out the main windows is nothing but Long Lake, on cooler days the breeze is so nice. On hot days there is a terrific air conditioner and the view is still lovely. The cabin is bigger than it looks inside. Paul and his (close) neighbors are very friendly and helpful.
One thing is that the bathroom, the only water source, is farther away than it looks and up a hill, it‚Äôs a hike.
I am a swimmer so I‚Äôll review the lake as well for other swimmers. We came late July so the weeds were very high and constant for about 200 yards off-shore. But not super thick or impassable and then the water is fine. Very calm in terms of traffic, esp. non-weekend, and, though very populated, the shore is tree-lined and pretty, and the sunsets are stunning. They can also be enjoyed from shore!
The price is great and affordable. My dear friend and I had a wonderful time."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful in every way. Thank you Paul üåÖ
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Paul‚Äôs boathouse was the perfect place to rest on my last night in the Brainerd area after a long weekend of running and hiking. It‚Äôs very clean and well kept and the bed is comfortable. It was nice to watch the sunset on the lake and fall asleep to the loons calling! Paul was very nice and helpful with the check in process as well.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great Lakeside accommodations. Beautiful Sunsets. Will stay longer next time. Host Paul is very thoughtful about making sure his tenants are happy.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay went very smoothly, the location is beautiful and it‚Äôs about 15 mins from brainerd/Baxter which has all your needs! Paul was very nice and helpful üòä"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Paul's Boathouse Cabin is absolutely the most perfect getaway.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous boathouse with a beautiful view. Process and communication was excellent. Clean and comfortable. Paul (owner) was available as needed for all our needs. We had a gorgeous view of an evening lightening storm and a rainbow sunrise. The sunsets are stunning. We definitely plan to return next year.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Stay was excellent! Nice place to enjoy sunset and get out of city life.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Clean room right on the lake! Paul was very friendly and he communicated well. If I‚Äôm in the area again I will definitely book here.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay! Great communication with host and Paul always made sure we had everything we needed. Hoping to make it back again sometime.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Paul is kind, a great communicator, and this little boathouse is just fantastic. If you have anything to do in this area and need a place to stay, look no further"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paul is an amazing host. Very friendly and willing to talk about what‚Äôs around the area for food and attractions. The boathouse itself is right on the water. It‚Äôs clean, cozy, comfortable, and exactly as described. I would definitely come back for a longer stay. Thanks Paul!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I cannot say enough about this amazing little gem! Paul was the most welcoming host, and the boat house is one of the most unique places we have stayed."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,All as expected.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our time at The Boathouse!! Paul is a great host and really makes sure you have everything you need and that your stay is comfortable. This was our first time staying and we are already talking of coming back! The spot is PERFECT! Listening the loons and the waves lapping the shores as you fall asleep is something that never gets old. Oh and the view from The Boathouse is beautiful! Perfect to watch the sun set also! We brought our boat and spent a lot of time out fishing. It was so nice to come back to a clean, comfy place after being out in the sun all day! Definitely a place we want to visit again!!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I‚Äôm a repeat stayer with Paul at the Boathouse. Whether it‚Äôs for a weekend of solitude or a girls weekend, it‚Äôs always guaranteed to be exactly what I need. Beautiful views, very clean, and an extremely friendly host, makes for a perfect getaway!!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"WOW!!!! INCREDIBLE stay! INCREDIBLE HOST!! what a hidden gem of a unique, relaxing getaway. Paul was the most kind, fun and accommodating host. He keeps the place very clean..it is well cared-for. Bed and pillows are super comfy and the private bathroom is so cute! You will not be disappointed in your stay here. 5 stars aren't enough! :) Paul made great recommendations for places around the area and was more than hospitable! Great stay overall... we look forward to coming to visit again in the future!!! Thanks Paul!!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If the sound of a lake lapping right outside your window bothers you, or the call of loons or beautiful sunset across a lake is irritating, then don't come here. If a friendly, attentive host isn't your thing then forget about this place. However, if you like a bit of adventure (the modern bathroom is separate from the boathouse), and no stores or restaurants next door, and no traffic, except the boats on the lake, then, this is the place for you. We just wish our schedule had allowed us to enjoy more time enjoying the beautiful setting."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paul was an exceptionally attentive host responding promptly to texts, providing recommendations, and when we provided feedback that it would be nice to have a shelf in the bathroom, he sent us a photo a couple hours after our departure of the new one he'd installed. The place is truly a hidden gem - right at the water's edge with lots of windows to take in the beautiful views, and we always left one cracked open to hear the waves. Everything was impeccably clean and well done. One thing to note - the TV does not seem to have wifi, so don't count on streaming from your phone without a Chromecast or the like. Thanks for exactly the getaway we needed Paul! - Ethan"

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paul is the ‚Äúhostess with the mostest‚Äù! This beautiful boathouse is the perfect getaway! I traveled alone and was a little nervous and Paul made me feel instantly comfortable and took amazing care of me without getting in my way of my escape! Absolutely beautiful view, extremely clean, and a comfortable bed. Couldn‚Äôt have asked for more! You won‚Äôt go wrong booking at Paul‚Äôs boathouse!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a cute, clean, little house in a great, quiet location. Our trip was super relaxing and a well needed getaway from the city.
Paul was warm and thoughtful throughout our stay. Highly recommend."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Paul went Above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable and knowledgeable of the Brainerd area! His property is beautiful and peaceful! Would recommend his boathouse again and again! ‚ù§Ô∏è
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a wonderful place! 10/10 would recommend this place to anyone. Beautiful place & views.
Paul is a wonderful host and we would love to go back."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Paul‚Äôs place was perfect and exactly as we hoped!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We‚Äôve stayed here multiple times and is one of our favorite AirBnbs in the area. It‚Äôs close to both Brainard-Baxter and the Cuyuna Lakes mountain biking trails. Beautiful view of the lake from the boat house. Host is very friendly and accommodating. Highly recommend!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Paul was a superb host and extremely helpful with every aspect of my stay. The boathouse was exceptionally clean and inviting. I couldn't have asked for a better first Airbnb experience.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Expect great hospitality, charm, and the unusual practice of walking outside to go to the bathroom! It‚Äôs a quiet lake. we were bothered by a very unusual/rare/not seen before swarms of mayflies. Couldn't be helped but made lounging outside impossible for us. But the coziness of the boathouse made our stay very enjoyable."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Boat House was my very first stay with Airbnb, and boy, Paul hit it out of the park! Wonderful customer service, communication and considerate Captain of the Boat House.
The location is so very scenic, do make sure you can arrive there prior to sunset (as the other reviews indicate) the views are breath taking. After sunset, the stars really pop. Take a moment to relax on the dock stargazing.
Both the Boat House and the bathroom/shower accommodations were immaculate, there is a hill between the two locations so take that into consideration if there are any mobility concerns.
I would absolutely stay here again."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you enjoy a wonderfully unique getaway, you‚Äôl love Paul‚Äôs Boat House.
The Five Star Privy adds to the fun and adventure.
Very Clean. And staying on a Lake was never more true. Sipping coffee while waving to the passing early morning kayaker has made Paul‚Äôs Boat House one of our most enjoyable AIRBNB Experiences.
And Paul is a super hospitable Host.
Five Stars all the way."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at The Boathouse! Paul was a wonderful host. He had everything ready for us, gave wonderful restaurant recommendations, and even helped us load our things in and out. It was perfect!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful studio bedroom right on the lake. Perfect for couple looking to spend time up north. Right near the Paul Bunyan state bike trail. Had the perfect weekend!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Expect to enjoy a quiet stay and if you love Sunset like the host-Paul will let you know Sunset time. Paul is so welcoming and accommodating. When I book the Boat House a thunderstorm was not on my radar. In the middle of the night, holding up to put on ""raincoat"" to walk to the outhouse toilet is quite an adventure. If you have a personal portable toilet or urinal, it would come handy for a rainy night, otherwise the well equipped outhouse was fine."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable accomodations, just as described.
It is beautiful sitting at the lakeshore.
Paul is great with communication and makes his guests feel very welcome.
I would definitely stay here again."

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paul is fantastic! Not only does he have a great sense of humor, but his property is gorgeous. The boat house is small, but if you‚Äôre looking to get away w/ your significant other and be right next to the water, this is a no brainer!
There‚Äôs an excellent private spot to sit right next to the dock as well. Kayaking was a blast & the sunsets are amazing!. I highly recommend & we will definitely be back next summer.
It was an excellent Labor Day weekend!
(Just make sure to run the hot water for a few minutes before you‚Äôre ready to get in the shower) hahA
Great shower, great water pressure.
I just had to find one minor complaint Paul! hA
5 stars all around."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paul‚Äôs listing is exactly as posted. Sparkling clean, very comfortable, and beautifully located.
Paul runs a kind, accommodating, and helpful business; He himself is a fantastic person from the get-go‚Ä¶warm, friendly, and genuinely invested in providing a wonderful stay.
We‚Äôd absolutely book here again!"

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved staying here, wish we could have stayed longer! Paul was so welcoming, took us to and from the air bnb in a golf cart. The bed was really comfortable and the view was amazing! Highly, highly recommended! Thanks so much!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Staying at this boathouse was the highlight of our summer! It was such a unique experience. Paul was an absolute delight! The place was clean and spacious. The view outside the window was beautiful (especially at sunset). Easy drive to Brainerd and Gull Lake from here. I would highly recommend it!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Paul is an amazing host, the accommodations were lovely, and this was the best night of sleep I've had in a long time. (So much so that I asked him what kind of mattress it was - it was perfect for me!) Paul was so thoughtful and kind, and truly made us feel like we were family or friends coming to stay. That is an incredible gift that is rare to find in this world! He helped us settle in and then took us on a golf cart tour of the area, which was as fun as it was informative. The boat house had everything we needed, and the view was spectacular. The absolute quiet beauty of the early morning at the lake was simply incredible. I would consider myself lucky to stay here again in the future!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Fabulous place to stay! Beautiful right on the lake.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed the boathouse. Paul is a great host and being on the water was great, especially viewing sunsets over the lake in the evening. We happened to stay during a very windy stretch of days, but still got out on the lake with our kayaks. If you need a peaceful and fun little getaway, this is it."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paul is a fantastic host. He is friendly and welcoming. Paul escorted us to the boat house with our bags and gave use tour of everything. Perfect place for quiet, beautiful respite"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paul was an amazing host! Easy to communicate with and when we arrived, he was waiting for us in his golf cart and helped us haul our bags down to the boathouse. He also took us for a ride around the neighborhood and showed us around. Very friendly and anything we needed, he told us to just let him know. The boathouse itself was perfect! Very clean and cozy. Had a nice mini fridge/freezer to put some food in and also had a microwave. We brought a streaming stick to plug into the TV and it worked perfectly! Had a brand new AC unit put in, very quiet and was really nice to have, even though it wasn't too hot when we stayed. Paul also helped us bring our items back to the vehicle when we left as well. Would highly recommend staying here and will most likely be back! Thanks Paul!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a great place! Everything you need for a nice atay. Super comfy, super clean and THE best view imaginable!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Boathouse is just a wonderful place to do your own thing! We Kayaked for a water adventure and scootered for a land adventure! Both were so beautiful to view! Paul is a super great host, the Boathouse was cozy and clean, the bed is very comfortable! The ""wall of window"" lets you view the lake, a beautiful sunset, and fall asleep to the sound of Loons, it just can't get any better than the Boathouse! This was our 2nd visit, we will be back in 2022!!!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Paul is an exceptional host. We had a great time and enjoyed a spectacular sunset from perfect chairs.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Paul was great in every aspect of our stay! His little Boat House is ""a Little Slice of Heaven""! We will definitely be coming back. The Boat House is clean & fresh.....one of the most important parts of making a stay enjoyable. The lake is beautiful....hearing the Loons was icing on the cake! Can't wait to return!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Paul will make your stay whatever you want it to be. He's super friendly and will help out wherever he can. The location is lovely, and offers some stellar views of the lake. You'll have a great time!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Paul was very hospitable and welcoming to us from the moment of arrival. He helped us move our luggage from the front to the back of the lake house. He constantly is wanting to make the guests as comfortable as possible.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time up at Paul's. It's so cozy and cute; it was exactly what we needed after all the covid stuff... Whew! And Paul? He's just a gem! I feel like if a jolly gnome was in person form, he'd be a lot like Paul. He reminds me of a good humored, part of the family type from up North. My family is from Northern MN and he is just a cheery Santa version of them. It wasn't too much tho either, it was welcoming. It felt like the comfort of going home, but not having 100 activities to do (which I miss now, bc those days are gone).
I loved hearing the loons morning and night there. That place is a lil slice of paradise. I would highly recommend!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,MN lake stays don't get any better than this! We brought our kayaks and launched from right under our boathouse window. We spent hours exploring the lake and a shallow marsh area that was brimming with wildlife. At night we left the windows open and drifted to sleep with the lake breeze and gentle waves hitting the rocks below. We were so lucky at dusk to hear the soft and beautiful call of a resident Loon (the MN state bird). Paul was a very gracious and helpful host that takes great pride in his property. The boathouse and bath house were absolutely immaculate and perfect for a long weekend stay. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and can't wait to return. Thank you again Paul for sharing a little bit of your paradise with us!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were greeted right away and given a tour of the place! This made us feel extremely welcomed and the property is so well taken care of!
We brought our paddleboard for the day and streaming stick to watch a movie at night!
The evening sunset was a must see!! We would have loved to stay an extra night but thankful for the time we got and may have to return in the fall or next summer."

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Paul‚Äôs boathouse was amazing. It is a great place to go to get away from the city and just take some time away. It‚Äôs a beautiful place and the view is even better.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I absolutely loved our stay here! It was the perfect getaway for us. The view of the lake out the big window right by the bed just can‚Äôt be beat. Paul is a great host who communicates well and made sure we had everything we needed. Definitely go on a welcome to the area golf cart ride with Paul if you‚Äôre able! The bed was very comfortable as were the pillows that he provides. Lots of things to do nearby or just spend your time on the lake. Neighbors were very friendly and welcoming. We will definitely be coming back to The Boathouse again!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Be sure to make it there in time for the stunning sunset!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was great!!!!

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paul is very easy to work with prior to and during our stay . Looking forward to another stay in the boathouse in the future. The view and calming effects of the water lapping on the shore, along with the song of loons was so delightful"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great time at the boathouse. Most picturesque sunsets by the lake and a the great host made this stay wonderful!

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great hosting location next to lake. Very cozy
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The boathouse was a great little getaway for my wife and I! The water is the perfect temp this time of year. We tied our tube up to his new dock and floated most of the day, otherwise Whipple Beach is a quick trip for a good swimming area! The chairs Paul provides is a perfect area to watch the sunset. Paul was an amazing host and made sure we had everything we needed! We will definitely be back!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Paul was by far the best host we have ever had at any of our air bnb‚Äôs. He was more than kind when greeting us and making sure we knew how everything worked and made sure we were comfortable. the room was perfect for my boyfriend and I with a beautiful view. Highly recommend hanging out for sunset as it is perfect from inside the room. thanks again Paul for the wonderful stay!

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Paul's boat house just happened to be available a few days prior to our stay. my wife and I found it very nice, neat, clean and comfortable.

I'd recommend this place for a nice getaway."

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"110% recommend staying here!! Paul was fantastic. He answered all questions promptly before my arrival and met me up in the driveway when I arrived. He helped me get my stuff down to the boat house using a golf cart (and also broughtmy stuff up at the end of my stay). The boat house was exactly as the pictures and description say. It was lovely and just what I wanted! And the view of the lake is gorgeous! Paul offered help and checked on me during my stay, but also didn't intrude. I appreciated that because I was traveling solo and just wanted a few days of peace and tranquillity. That's exactly what I got at the boat house! I felt safe and the place was spotless. Highly recommend for solo travelers or couples. Thanks Paul!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Boathouse is the perfect place for kayaking, peace, quiet, and relaxation. Paul is a fantastic host, he will help you with anything you need.

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paul was a GREAT host! He was so welcoming, accommodating and made our weekend stay exactly what we needed. He was so thoughtful with his checking in when we crossed paths and enjoyed his company even while we sat watching the sun set! Will certainly find a reason to go back and stay in the tiny boathouse again! So glad we stumbled across this place- we simply needed out of town and wanted to kayak. Was a great time kayaking from Lower Long Lake go Upper Long Lake and enjoyed lunch at Paradise Resort Bar and Grill! Highly recommend staying here!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely spot to take a load off right at the lake! The place is beautiful and private. Be prepared to make a trip outside to get to the bathroom/shower since there is no water in the boathouse. The host does a great job walking you through everything and provides a lantern for trips to the commode after dark. Paul was very hospitable even though my arrival was much later than planned!

I can‚Äôt wait to come back next summer!!!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Paul was a great host. Very helpful and accommodating. He has a gorgeous boat house that looks out to a lake. The room is spacious and perfect for a weekend getaway. The bathroom is a short walk from the boat house but we didn't mind at all. Close to Brainerd. We enjoyed staying there!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The boat house is such an unique peaceful place to stay. Paul keeps the boat house and surrounding area immaculately clean. The sunset from the dock will take your breath away. The neighbors house and surrounding houses are close but you still feel very secluded and private. Great local food and the local waitress at the Paradise Resort and Bar up the road told of us a private sand bar for swimming where we felt like the only two people on the planet. If you need a break from the city that‚Äôs only 2 hours away where you can feel transported to your own beautiful part of the world, Paul‚Äôs boat house is it. Paul is also so kind and welcoming. We can‚Äôt wait to come back."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Quaint cabin feel, very homey and peaceful! Beautiful sunsets and comfortable queen size bed üòä"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Is exactly as described ! Perfect for a 1-2 person get away that's far enough from the cities but not to far up north! Absolutely loved it.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a place, amazing host, super clean and we can't wait to come back. From the moment Paul greeted us till the time we left we had an awesome time. Simply perfect is the best description of our experience with Paul and the boat house. Thank you"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay at Paul‚Äôs place was THE BEST. Paul is so welcoming and such a great host. He showed us around the neighborhood on his golf cart right when we got there, which was so much fun! He had lots of great local tips and the boat house itself was 10/10. Hard to beat that view and hearing loons all night. We‚Äôll be back for sure, and plan to stay longer next time!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host. Great little private cabin to stay at while exploring the Brainerd lakes area.

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing location and views to die for! I can't recommend Paul's place highy enough. Just two hours north of MSP, Paul's place offers a genuine Up North experience. Clean, well-appointed and with a friendly host, if you're coming to North Central MN you'll be hard pressed to find a better place to two people to stay."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The boat house was very clean and comfortable. The view was beautiful. Paul was welcoming and helpful. We will definitely be back.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay. Paul is a wonderful, awesome host. The boathouse and location are excellent."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Paul‚Äôs place has to be the best deal in Up North Minnesota! The walk from the cabin that almost floats over the water, to the beautiful bathroom across the grass, reminds you that you are at the lake and it‚Äôs time to unwind. After we checked in, we decided to hit up the resort bar and patio. Just one of Pauls recommendations, just a minute or two away. The cold beers, bloody Mary and great burgers were everything we needed and more. It was great bar food. The lake view from the little boathouse pagoda is unmatched. Watching the sun set directly across the lake, from the warm cement ledge on the shore, felt like northwestern Italy. Also I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a lot of you out there that could learn something from a conversation with Paul.
Only stayed a night and it may have been the best part of our week long trip.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Used the house while in town for a dance competition. worked really well to be only a 3 minute drive to the dance location with such an early morning.
House had everything we needed for a comfortable stay, especially being so close to shopping and dining in historic downtown.
You could tell it had been recently updated, but kept it's original charm."

It has been awhile since I have left a place and have the ‚Äúwant‚Äù to go back. It has great space, well decorated and a wonderful place to create memories! this place will be a yearly tradition! Highly recommend with a super fast response rate from Lukas!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We‚Äôve been visiting the Nisswa area for over a decade and are so excited to discover this gem for our family of four. Peaceful getaway with tons of space and activities for the kids. We love the clear water and sandy shoreline, room to run around in the grass and have bonfires. The private Pickleball court and basketball hoop felt like a resort, and the views from inside with the vaulted ceilings are breathtaking. Sunsets are a 10 out of 10 on Loon Lake. Proximity to both Nisswa and Pequot Lakes were a great daytime visit and lunch getaway. Lukas is prompt in his communication and clear in his instructions. Pine Peak Retreat will be a regular stay for us!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our family of 5 had such a memorable weekend; from kayaking to pickleball to bonfires there was never time to be bored! The cabin felt very private, yet it was only 8 minutes from all the action in Nisswa. We got coffee and scones from Stonehouse based on Lukas's recommendation, and it didn't disappoint! There was a grocery store nearby in Pequot Lakes that had everything we forgot back in the Cities. The lake never felt busy and the sandy beach was great for the kids, all the water toys like kayaks and a canoe kept us busy on the shore. And at night the HUGE bonfire pit was clutch. The home was spacious and clean, and the kitchen had everything we needed. The sheets were so comfy, the loft was huge and the kids ran around when it rained. Lukas was quick to respond to our questions and check-in was super easy. Overall this was a gem, we'll be back!!!!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect place for me and my husband to get a weekend away from the chaos of jobs and 5 kids.
I lost count of how many times he looked around throughout the weekend and said ‚Äúgood pick honey‚Äù
It was secluded enough to feel away from everyone but a good driving distance for any tasty restaurants or stores you may need.
The house was calming and clean, with great acoustics for guitar playing !
We would love to stay here again!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We are SO thrilled to have found this place! We take trips to the Brainerd/Baxter/Nisswa area at least once per summer and this is a new spot to us - tbh I loved everything about the listing & the reviews but would have skipped right past it on photos alone. If you're considering staying here, DO IT!! Everything is so well appointed and comfortable - we walked in and were blown away by how well everything was done. This is not an old cabin in the woods, this is a thoughtfully designed escape to the woods. OBSESSED and we absolutely will be back!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Was looking for a local hideaway when we found this listing. The pictures do not do it justice. Inside is a little touch of luxury that is unexpected. Numerous amenities available and some you wouldn't even consider. Very private location even though many local attractions are within 15 minutes drive. Host was very helpful and communicated very quickly!
Great 1st time experience for us and we are looking forward to going back and recommending to our friends and family."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautifully simple interior with design touches pleasing to the eye. No ‚Äúnorthwoods cabin kitsch‚Äù, just clean and contemporary. Updated amenities including AC/ceiling fans, jacuzzi and internet. Quiet and secluded lot with a resident family of deer and a very persistent, inquisitive squirrel. Off the beaten path but close to all the Brainerd area has to offer. Fantastic value for as nice as the cabin is and what it offers."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little cabin close to the lake in quiet, beautiful, and secluded location. Would stay again!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great getaway. A beautiful open-concept. space. Secluded and private. We would return when we have the chance.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beds were very comfortable, kitchen had everything we needed. Had great AC for the hot weather we had during our stay!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was just as described. Loved the wide open living space. We had everything we needed for our 2 night stay! Great place. Thank you Ben!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy cabin deep in the woods on 5 quiet acres. Comfortable, safe, updated. We stayed in the summer and air con was very comfortable. Great stay!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Ben's cabin was wonderful. The location was great. We walked in the woods a little, very serene. We saw deer out our front window. It was very peaceful. The cabin had an open layout which was a feature we needed. Ben was responsive. I had a couple questions during our stay and he responded immediately. We felt comfortable and safe. Thank you Ben"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ben‚Äôs cabin in the woods is amazing. Beautifully decorated just enough to feel like home but not so much that it takes away from enjoying the tranquility of the location.
The GPS takes you right to the location and the local restaurants are amazing.
The location is close enough to everything that day trips were not a problem.
We spent time checking out all the different lakes and doing some rock hounding. Ben was able to give us a few ideas of places to go.
Honestly there is not one negative to my experience at Bens cabin except the pictures do not do the cabin justice. PERFECT!!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great experience at Ben‚Äôs cozy cabin! Great location, perfectly central to everything in the Brainerd lakes area for day trips. Cabin was well stocked, clean and very comfortable. Beautiful, quiet and secluded, surrounded by forest and wildlife. Would stay again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay! My son really liked the loft, and the fire pit area/lights were awesome. Loved the modern decor! Really enjoyed seeing all the deer around the property. Would definitely recommend, and would book again in the future!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing stay! Loved it. Would 100% stay again
2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location was close to everything in Brainerd and there were lots of local trails for hiking. The cabin is very cute and located in a private area for the most part. There is a neighbor on each side of you as well as behind the cabin, but due to the trees, there seems to be added privacy. I am sure when the trees have their leaves you would not even know there are neighbors around you. The place was clean, however, there were many spiders inside the home that were very prevalent on my second night there. I must have killed at least a dozen very large healthy spiders in the bathroom and living room. I almost left the second day because I am deathly afraid of spiders. I did not use the shower due to this ""presence"". As long as the place is bug-bombed or the perimeter sprayed, this would be a great place to stay. I paid $40 for my service animal to be there, so I expected the place to be clean and well taken care of. Instead I was the one doing extra cleaning by vacuuming dead spiders."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay and was just what I needed.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were looking for a last-minute get away for a long weekend and were able to check in the same day we booked. Communication and instructions were excellent on how to get there and check in. Place is exactly as described and pictured. Ceiling is covered with wood paneling (maybe pine?) which I could smell as soon as we opened the door so if you have sensitivity to odors like that, it might not be the place for you but I happened to really like it. Would not hesitate recommending a stay here and would definitely consider coming back."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Awesome design and decor that is even cooler in person than the pictures. Super clean and had everything we needed! I really liked this place, modern interior with beautiful tall trees and wildlife to view when outside or inside from the large windows. Extremely responsive, proactive and friendly host! Just great overall."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful, special place! So glad to visit again and get away, and can‚Äôt wait to come back later this year! Quiet - the perfect place for solitude and reflection."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ben & Mackenzie were amazing hosts. Their cottage was the perfect place for a weekend getaway. We saw lots of wildlife in the yard and enjoyed the modern cabin feel. The location is very private and peaceful. It is perfect for trips to Brainerd, Nisswa, or Pequot Lakes. 100% recommend! We will be back."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I visit Minnesota a few times a year to visit family and this was our favorite stay yet! Ben was responsive, helpful and friendly. His home was even more beautiful than shown in pictures and it was wonderful being in a space as comfortable and as private as this. Will definitely be returning."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hidden gem for sure!! We loved this place quite a bit. It was perfect distance from all of our excursions that we did while up here on a mini vacation. It also provided the peaceful ""get out of the cities"" vibe we were looking for. The place was spotless and had all the amenities we needed. The up front cleaning fee is a little more than we are used to seeing, but the overall deal for the place was great. Ben was so responsive, friendly, and a wonderful host! Would definitely recommend :)"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful little place! This was perfect for a solo retreat - private and quiet. Lots of windows with lovely views, you could spend the whole time just looking out the windows from the comfy furniture. Even in winter, the forest was gorgeous and so quiet. The nearby roads rarely had cars so it was great for taking walks and enjoying nature. I can‚Äôt wait to return when the weather is warmer - I‚Äôve already booked my next trip here! Can‚Äôt say enough good things about this place and Ben! He was very responsive to any of my questions."
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Lots of fun.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,We stayed here for 2 weeks and my family really enjoyed this little cottage in the woods. The loft bed is perfect for older kids.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved the cabin and its location! I will definitely return next year!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at the cabin while I was in Brainerd for a work training. The location was secluded and private but still close to Brainerd. Ben was great to work with and a prompt, clear communicator. The cabin itself was perfect. I was hoping for a peaceful retreat in the woods and that is exactly what I got. The cabin was clean, well furnished, and tastefully decorated and updated. As a woman staying there by myself, I felt perfectly safe. That said, I would love to go back to the cabin with my husband for an extended stay. It was definitely a place where a person could stay a while. Cozy, peaceful, beautiful. I can't wait to go back."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at this lovely little cottage in the woods! Definitely would come back!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very nice place.

Amazing place to see all sorts of wildlife, roast s'mores, and go into Brainered/Nisswa areas."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a place! A gem in the woods! Stayed here while in town for work. Had all the comforts of home and then some. The secluded setting made for a relaxing experience. Very clean and new on the inside. No bugs or spiders despite being the wooded surroundings. Can‚Äôt wait to come back!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Bens cabin was a great stay. The cabin was clean and beautiful. We really enjoyed the wild life! We were visited several times by deer and turkeys :) we would definitely come back.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you like secluded places in the woods, then you'll like this place. Nice little private getaway in the north woods. Loft bed is cool, but probably better suited for kids and young adults. I enjoyed my stay at the cabin."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a fabulous time at Ben‚Äôs! They had all the comforts of home in a quiet spot tucked back into the woods. Very comfortable and great communication! Would definitely recommend üòä

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I believe the post undersells the value of the stay. Brainerd is a lovely area and this rental comes across as a brand new construction. The kitchen was more than well stocked (no need to purchase any spices). The beds were very comfortable and I enjoyed the upper loft a lot!
Check in was easy and Ben was always quick to respond whenever contacted.
Overall, I absolutely intend to stay again and have no complaints at all about the experience!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ben was a great host! The communication leading up to our stay and during was excellent. The rooms are spacious, comfortable, and gorgeously styled. It is tucked away in a private area, but was still easy to find with GPS and directions from the host. The large open windows in the main space are perfect for letting in lots of natural light and the large dining table and kitchen island make a great area for hosting games and food. The only downside we had was the lack of window coverings in the bedroom. In the summer, the sun was up quite early and it would have been nice to keep the room darker for awhile. Overall I would recommend this place to others. It‚Äôs a fantastic area with restaurants like Dunmire‚Äôs on the Lake and Pirates Cove mini golf not too far away. The rental is also close to shopping centers like Nisswa and Pequot Lakes with lots of great boutiques. We would gladly stay again!"
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,nice place
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We came here on an family trip with the kids and the house was everything we imagined! We had a great time going into town playing mini golf and experiencing what Brainerd has to offer. House was spotless and peaceful! Looking forward to coming back again.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great girls' weekend in Brainerd.
The house actually seemed a bit larger than it looks in the pictures! The open floor plan was great for us as we were crafting the weekend away!
The yard is nice and clean, very inviting, we chose not to have a bonfire, but everything was ready if we wanted one.
There were a lot of ""extra"" amenities, including toys for children, games for kids and adults, and even bathroom supplies that may have been forgotten at home!
We definitely would book here again!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Super Nice! Basically a 2 bed, one bath home completely renovated inside and out. As described and pictured in the listing. Be sure to take a look at the book of renovation photos on one of the end tables. Living area very comfortable w/ dual reclining sofa and two other sofas. Dining area with table and chairs. Huge island with chairs (where we ate). Wonderful kitchen with all appliances, dishware, etc. Great bath with all the soaps, shampoo, conditioners, etc. that you could wish for. Bedroom where we slept very nice, bed was great. Linens and towels were very upscale. Storage all over the place. Everything was clean and everything worked as it should. Peaceful yard. Nice patio out back with lawn furniture, gas BB grill, etc. We have remodeled a number of houses and wish we could have done as good a job! Actually drew out the floorplan for future reference.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Karri was super easy to get ahold of and answered any questions we had!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I stayed for 4 nights, it was very homie. Yes we spent a moment or two looking for things, but the point is those things where there. you need that morning cup of coffee, boom it's all right there, you there long enough for laundry, it's there.
My wife and I loved the mornings when we sat on the back porch, drank our coffee and watched our grandsons run around in the yard while listening to the wild life.
We didn't spend enough time in the house to cook or BBQ, but the time we spent just felt like a home. Much, much better than a chain hotel.
We will book it again next time we visit the area for sure."

We loved the hot tub and bonfire right there. I wouldn‚Äôt say the place was super kid friendly, but my daughter was just old enough to not have to worry about her getting hurt or needing constant supervision. We weren‚Äôt sure about beach access, but since we were there on a Tuesday we ended up just using the resort‚Äôs beach area and no one said anything."
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, cozy cabin in a quiet area. The backyard had privacy. The hottub was dirty when running the jets so we did not get to use it.

2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"I really wanted to give our experience 5 stars but it definitely fell short of that. When we arrived there was an awful smell, Right away I noticed alot of water on the floor in front of the fridge. I opened the fridge to find a bunch of opened spoiled food. There was open milk, and some condiments in the door of the fridge. The milk was like cottage cheese at this point, it made the whole place stink. I assume the power had gone out, but why leave open food behind? All the ice in the freezer had melted and was all over the floor along with some melted icecream, very sticky First thing I had to do was clean up a huge mess and get rid of the
awful smell so I could unpack my coolers.Dirty dishes in the dishwash, I had to run and put away in order to use it, and bedding was left in the dryer. Fire pit, No wood. We use Airbnb so we can have the amenities of home, to keep things clean. I didnt come to visit to clean up after the host or others. Other than that, the place was cozy!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here while a massive snowstorm went through the area. The house was well equipped with shovels and someone plowed us out the first day which was so helpful and kind.
We went on a beautiful snowshoe hike 20 minutes from Brainerd and soaking in the hot tub afterwords was one of the greatest perks of the place. Not to mention the hot tub is also very secluded and warm!
The area was very clean and had everything we needed, down to the utensils and games! We shoveled off the beautiful grilling area and made some delicious steaks, even in the middle of winter. Would be worth seeing in the summer!
The views around the home were beautiful, especially when covered in snow.
There was a bar/eatery just a short walk up the road if interested.
We enjoyed coffee in town at a place called Loco Express Coffee, a very unique area.
The bed in the downstairs room wasn‚Äôt the most comfortable that we‚Äôve slept on, but the bedding and pillows were very nice.
We will happily return!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely wonderful cabin. It exceeded our expectations. Having the Paradise Bar 700 feet down the road for a quick bite and a drink with amazing staff was the cherry on top. The cabin is the perfect size for a small family or girls / guys trip. The interior and offerings were perfect. Having the full kitchen and outdoor grill made cooking a breeze. Loved the location and the sunsets on the lake were incredible.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My wife and I were looking for a place to go to unplug and relax and we felt like we hit the lottery with this place. The inside of the cabin was just the right vibe combined with all the trees and lake right outside. My wife is always cold so the heated floors really stood out to her and helped us feel cozy and comfy the whole time. We ended up cooking a meal at the place and I was surprised they actually had everything I needed to make a great meal. Then we hit the hot tub, which was very clean/fresh, and we lucked out with a super clear night so we could see so many stars! It might have been the wine, but the ambience that night was off the charts. We didn't feel like cooking the second night so we took a quick walk down the road and ate at the bar. It was a cool place where we played some pool and hung out.
All in all, it was the type of place I would visit again and honestly wish we could've extended a couple extra nights!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If this place is available in your search, snatch it up and book it now!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our family enjoyed this piece of heaven to the fullest. The pictures do not do this place justice! It‚Äôs better than you could imagine! We rented a boat and tied it directly to the dock. It is set in a quiet cove with very little traffic. There is a hiking trail right across from the driveway. Only 10 minutes from town and many other activities to enjoy. Waking up to the trees was magical. We did not want to leave.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I hesitate to write this review because I‚Äôm afraid that Adventure Studio will be discovered by the hoards. But, I can‚Äôt say enough good things about our stay. Excellent accommodations, responsive hosts, good value. The pictures don‚Äôt do justice to the place. Everything we needed was there. Excellent view, comfy bed, wonderful linen, and spot on local recommendations. Even offered to get us in a restaurant that doesn‚Äôt take reservations! Now that‚Äôs the extra mile. Again, I‚Äôm worried about posting this for fear we will not be able to return. Perhaps, we can keep this on the DL, between us;)"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,John & Carna were the perfect hosts. They were quick to respond and very friendly. This property was the perfect escape.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The pictures do not lie...what a beautiful place! It's like a glammed up treehouse with all the plush comforts for grown-ups. Serene setting nestled in the trees near the lake. It was designed with a very tasteful eye and thoughtful touches. We enjoyed the fire pit and cruises on the lake and hanging out sipping coffee on the deck. John and Carna were very helpful with any questions and always quick to respond. Our first anniversary was a memorable occasion made all the sweeter for celebrating in this gem of a space--thank you so much!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Adventure Studio was perfect - clean, well organized and in a beautiful location. I‚Äôd give it 6 stars if we could. The weather was on the cool side but we still enjoyed getting out on the lake in the pedal boat. We were entertained watching the squirrels scurrying among the branches from our unique vantage point. John was generous and super helpful in providing bike trail recommendations. We had lots of fun riding the smooth and curvy southern end of the Paul Bunyan trail from Baxter to Crow Wing State Park. We hope to return to this beautiful place!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"John and Carna really embrace the essence of super hosts. Super responsive and helpful. And when they say the kitchen is stocked it is! I was pleasantly surprised to find an actual teapot, not just a Keurig machine. And I forgot a pizza cutter but one was in the drawer.
I mentioned I wanted a camp fire and all the lighters, fire starter and marshmallow sticks were ready for me.
And sitting out on the balcony was truly my favorite thing!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was my first Airbnb! It was the best place! I will come back again and again.....!!!!

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was fantastic. We only left the property for a couple meals and would highly recommend. Our 4 and 7 year old boys loved paddleboarding and we brought our own kayaks and it was a perfect lake for that. We also had lots of campfires and the games in the cabin were great to end the night. As mentioned in the posting it was over an office and garage which wasn‚Äôt an issue - we have some light sleepers but it wasn‚Äôt before 6:30 or after 9:30 so wasn‚Äôt a real issue. We also really enjoyed stonehouse coffee for their scones, notch 8 for dinner, and our kids loved goodys gourmet treats all within 10 minutes or so. Definitely would recommend and would stay again."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great stay as always. This is our second time at John and Carna‚Äôs place, so you know we love it! We made good use of the paddle boat, pontoon and SUP on this trip - so much fun!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was a wonderful stay. The studio was super clean upon arrival and everything was as advertised. In a nice location and close to a lot of attractions. Would recommend the studio to anyone looking to stay in the Brainerd area.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay! Very comfortable, relaxing, peaceful, and quiet. My husband caught large mouth bass, northern, and a big sunny off the dock. Saw a fawn, beaver, and loons. Loved the view of the trees and lake from the 2nd floor!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at this great place on a beautiful lake! We enjoyed the mountain bike trail that started at the driveway, the paddle boat, the paddle boards, the floating ‚Äúlily pad‚Äù, the fire pit, waking up to loons calling, the grill options, the well-stocked studio, Smart TV, and the great deck! John and Carna couldn‚Äôt have been more responsive, kind, and helpful. Nice clean place in a beautiful location with wonderful hosts."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic stay! The John‚Äôs family was very kind and helpful, we had such a relaxing journey. Will def come back again!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our time! It was very clean, great location, and we spent a lot of time hanging out on the dock. Would definitely return!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our time at the Adventure Studio! It was very clean, comfortable, and beautifully decorated with lots of thoughtful touches. We loved having access to the dock, pedal boat, paddle boards, and lily pad when it was warm enough to swim. The second story deck was awesome for relaxing outside. On a cooler day we found plenty of fun for our 9 year olds within a short drive - mini golfing and go-karting at Pirate's Cove, playing arcade games at Big Jay's Pizza, checking out the shops and restaurants in Nisswa. It's a fantastic location that feels remote and 'up north' but is still super convenient to shopping and restaurants (in case you don't want to cook much on vacation like me) :) Definitely the highlight of our summer so far! Thanks John and Carna for sharing this spectacular getaway!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at Adventure Cabin for a long weekend with our 5 and 7 year old kids. The place was beautiful - felt like a tree house. The loacation on the lake was also excellent as you are a bit sheltered when it gets windy. There was just enough of a sandy area off the dock to get on and off the paddle boards. We rented the old pontoon and it was lots of fun. We also really enjoyed hiking the single track path right on the property. Saw deer and an owl!
John and Carna were super friendly and very responsive. Will definitely keep on the list to stay again. One of my favorite rentals. :)"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful property, feels like being in a treehouse, very clean, decorated tastefully, very comfortable, the grandkids had a blast tubing and paddle boarding, will stay again! the hosts were exceptional!!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The space was so clean and well kept! The dock was super nice to use and we got to take the paddle boat out a few times. We felt at home and very comfortable. John and Carna kept open communication and were so friendly to us!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This spot is absolutely stunning. We stayed here for our wedding weekend at The Northern Pacific Center. It was so close to Brainerd shops and the event center, but is the perfect distance away to still be tucked away in the woods. The lake is gorgeous, the huge windows were such a treat to wake up and look out at the lake each morning. The hosts are so kind and very helpful. I would love to stay here again."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This property is as shown in the pictures with 1st class amenities and lovely views of the lake. We loved hearing the loons in the evening and coffee on the deck in the morning. John & Carna were very responsive with questions and helped with great tips for biking, hiking & restaurants. Perfect for our getaway weekend."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A fantastic place to stay with a private dock on quiet Gilbert Lake. The rental is the upper unit of a two unit studio, which I believe the owners use as an office, but remained unoccupied during our entire long weekend stay.
There are paddle boards and a pedal boat provided, which are perfect for the calm lake, but the owners also offer a pontoon for rental. On the property is also a fire pit with wood provided.
The unit itself is the cleanest of the dozens of Airbnb units we have rented, with all of the kitchen essentials, 2 bedrooms, and additional rollaway bed and pullout couch. There is also a grill available for use.
Overall we had a great time, the owners were extremely friendly and communicative, and I would highly recommend the listing!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Gorgeous private studio, with truly every amenity. Cannot speak highly enough of the stay or the hosts. We were mistaken in our checkout date and they were so gracious in helping us work through the issue. I give this stay and these hosts my highest commendation."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was the best Airbnb place I‚Äôve ever been into, the photos don‚Äôt even reflect it‚Äôs value, the place was well equipped, clean, with a lot of privacy and space. We enjoyed the lake a lot, and Carna was very nice.
If you are looking for a place to spend a good time with your family or friends, then this one is definitely it. You have lot of activities that might be done.
We would definitely come back later to spend some time when the season is open"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We really loved the studio. The goregous view from all the windows was perfectly complemented by the cozy furnishings. The grounds surrounding the house was also nice. We enjoyed the paddleboat that was provided and the firepit (firestarter and logs provided). I could have stayed inside or outside on the grounds for the whole stay and would have been very content. The kitchen had everything you needed to make all the meals - in fact that was what we did since we have a toddler. Super close to town and hiking trails. There was a really nice beach that was perfect for small kids called Whipple beach just 15 minutes away. Bumped into the family who owns the studio and they were super warm and nice. Would definitely come back again!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This spot feels like it‚Äôs in the middle of nowhere, rather than within easy access of local amenities. Expect a relaxing spot with lake view and access."

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful home with a fabulous view. The place was cozy and perfect for a girls weekend getaway. We love finding the perfect place to park it and do nothing but read our favorite books and this fit the bill. John and Carna were very helpful and communicated well and were willing to help with anything we may have needed. We will definitely be saving their place in our favorites to hopefully revisit again!

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My son and I had a fantastic quiet weekend at the Adventure Studio. The living room is beautiful and offers breathtaking views of the lake and woods. The place is modern and spotlessly clean. John and Carna were immediately responsive and helpful, including coming over with a battery to jump start our car after a cold January night! We will be back!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful place, location, and communication. Amazing winter getaway. Would definitely go back in the summer to enjoy the lake!"

John and Carna provide everything needed for a perfect lakeside stay, even in the winter! We went shopping in Nisswan, cooked meals at the studio, watched movies and played games. We were all so comfortable and in awe of the studio. Could not recommend more."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This studio is beautiful. You will be surrounded by beauty both in the house and outside. It is the first place we have stayed where I really felt like we were at someones home. John and Carna are great. John led us to the winding path out back and we went on a nature walk. Seen 3 white tail deer. Wonderful experience
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"WOW - home away from home!! My husband chose to spend his 50th B'day in Brainerd and this place did not dissapoont. The peacefulness and quiet was everything we hoped for. John and Carna are wonderul hosts, communicating was easy and the extra decorations were a bonus - Shane was surprised and very pleased!! We will be back, maybe to enjoy some summer activities! Thank you!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful property. It‚Äôs cozy, scenic, a wonderful home away from home. The short hike out the door is fun and a great way to start the day. The lake is beautiful! And everything you need is within minutes. This is a great place to spend any length of time."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our 3rd year staying at the Adventure Studio - always extremely clean, super cozy and in a great location! Right on the lake, the area is beautiful, quiet and peaceful. But you are still close to town for shopping (Christmas Point!) and dining. We will be back again next year!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very cute and clean place, with beautiful views."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and beautiful view!

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place to stay. It was conveniently located near just about anything you'd need, but had the feeling of being away from everything and very secluded. The site was super private and the house was built up very nicely! It had all of the things anyone would need to enjoy a full week there. Already looking forward to going back."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was AMAZING! We got married in Brainerd on Friday and spent the weekend here. It was the best decision ever. Super romantic vibe, clean, comfy beds!! Plus you cannot beat the view waking up to the lake sunrise with those huge windows. Thank you for making our first weekend as a married couple perfect."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is the best. My husband and I have gone there twice and each stay was terrific. It was just what we needed. Very peaceful and the trees were just beautiful. We will definitely try and get back there soon!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place to stay! The place is just the perfect mix of rustic and modern. Incredibly clean. Lovely and relaxing piece of land on the most calm and quiet lake! Definitely no complaints from us and would absolutely recommend it for anyone looking for a relaxing weekend - especially in the summer when you can really utilize the lake!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We gave the Adventure studio 5 stars! Clean, easy check in and has everything you need! We really enjoyed the grill and beautiful view! We really enjoyed meeting John. He was so nice and encouraged us to do the 1.5 mile hike, which we did and really enjoyed. What a great find! We can't wait to come back!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great time staying at John and Carna‚Äôs place. They were great communicators, offering advice on the local area and activities. The house was a perfect location, right on the lake. We loved the fall colors, and made day trips to Minneapolis and Duluth. Highly recommend. ."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Fantastic place to stay for a quiet getaway. Super clean, very nice furnishings. We wished we could stay longer....so much to do, with a pedal boat, paddle boards, fire pit, or just sitting on the balcony and looking at the sunset and enjoying nature."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Somehow even better than the pictures! John and Carna‚Äôs place is the perfect getaway for a few days or a few weeks - when you leave it‚Äôll never feel like enough. Provided some much needed fun and relaxation for us! No detail was missed and the adventure studio had absolutely everything we could‚Äôve needed for the three nights we stayed.
Many memories were made, and the paddle boards and paddle boat were so awesome to have available. We even gave the Traeger a shot and smoked a delicious pork butt. The resident autonomous mower that occasionally roams the grounds was a hoot to watch as well. Never a dull moment and the kids just loved exploring outside or sitting by the fire making s‚Äômores.
We can‚Äôt wait to come back and already talking about next year! We asked our three year old when we got home if he was glad to be back, to which he responded ‚ÄúI liked where we were at‚Äù! Can‚Äôt recommend enough.
Thanks for everything!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My family and I loved the Adventure Studio. The beautiful view from the deck was picturesque. All of the furnishings were comfortable and well appointed. The location seemed remote but was only a 10-20 minute drive to restaurants, breweries, and other area highlights. We took advantage of the fire pit, dock and the nature trail on site. As a runner, there was nice access from the studio towards town along the bike lane. The hosts were very friendly and helpful. Overall, it was the best Airbnb experience I‚Äôve had. Trust me, you can‚Äôt go wrong staying here."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and accommodations were beautiful.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of the best Airbnb experiences my husband and I have ever had. It is such a quiet and secluded area you don't even realize you're right in the middle of Brainerd. Gorgeous setting among towering pines right on the lake. Felt like we were dreaming.
The studio had literally everything we needed for a great stay; comfy beds, fully stocked kitchen and bathroom, not to mention a killer view of the lake and a really modern apartment. If you're looking for a relaxing place to stay that gives you all the up north feels, this is definitely it. The private dock, use of paddle boat and SUP's, firepit and woodsy walking trail through your own nature oasis are all icing on the cake. Fortunately, we got to meet the hosts and they are as friendly as you can imagine. They gave us great ideas for what to explore in the area too. Their suggestion of visiting the Crow Wing State Park ended up being our fave area to explore.
We had an amazing stay in Brainerd for our anniversary (Thanks guys for remembering!) and staying the the Adventure Studio makes us want to go back as soon as we can. Make this place your next Brainerd trip destination. I guarantee you won't want to leave."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved staying and John and Carnas place! Perfect location and amazing amenities- we will be back!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful apartment overlooking the most peaceful lake. Perfect for a family or weekend away with your favorite friends.

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our second time staying at the Adventure Studio and everything was wonderful! We caught lots of fish from the dock and enjoyed the paddleboat. The trails out front are perfect for morning walks or bike rides. And the studio is well-appointed and just lovely. Will be back!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had one of our best stays this summer at John and Carna‚Äôs ‚ÄòAdventure Studio‚Äô. The property was beautiful and much bigger than what it looks like in the photos. No detail was left out. It felt like we were away in your own little tree house retreat.
The house was well stocked with everything you need from kitchen supplies to extra linens to s‚Äômores skewers. We made great use of their pontoon that is available for a reasonable rental fee, the pedal boat which was free and the fire pit. They also have paddle boards which we didn‚Äôt get a chance to use. The water level has dropped this summer due to the drought and the area by the dock is weedier than normal hence the reason for the not using the boards. We hope to use them when we book again in the future. We can‚Äôt wait!!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family of five had a fantastic time at the Adventure Studio. We all felt like we were living in a tree house! Our family enjoyed the peddle boat and the pontoon boat, and our kids especially loved playing on the ‚Äúmagic carpet‚Äù floating rectangle. We roasted s‚Äômores and mountain biked on the trail.
Our favorite activity away from the Adventure Studio was mini-golfing at Pirate‚Äôs Cove. My husband and 9yo also spent a morning UTV (RZR) riding on the Emily-Outing trail.
We love that this setting felt like a get-away from civilization, but it really was a quick drive to get where we needed to go.
Thank you for providing such a well-appointed, nicely decorated place for our family to stay."
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a great time at our annual girls trip, and this space made it extra fun! Such a cozy atmosphere."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What an awesome spot! It felt like we were up in a treehouse overlooking the lake. The apartment was exactly as they claimed. Comfortably fit our family of 4. The kitchen, while small, was well appointed and we ate in almost every meal. John and Carna, the hosts, were friendly and great communicators. We even took out their new-to-the-cabin pontoon for a boat ride around Gilbert Lake and some swimming. The lake is fairly weedy, so there wasn‚Äôt good swimming off the dock but the lake was compact and quiet, which is what we were looking for. Hope to make a return visit next summer!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"We love the cleanliness of the studio and the view/location. My kids and husband enjoyed the lake, paddle boat, and fishing. We highly recommend it!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We're repeat renters of the Adventure Studio! The studio is perfect for our family of 5 - very clean (hotel vibes), comfortable beds and stocked with everything we need to cook family meals. The lake is very private and we love using the pedal boat for hours of swimming. There is really no need to ever venture out with the beauty of the property + lots of lake activities but we did check out Kart Kountry and our kids (12, 9, 3) had a blast! Can't wait for our next trip!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was one of the best experiences I‚Äôve had with an Airbnb! John and Carna had thought of everything you‚Äôd need as a guest which made the stay seamless and welcoming. I recommend them and the studio 10/10!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our vacation at the Adventure Studio!!! Our group (2 adults and 2 small kids) fit perfectly in the space. Everything we needed was there. It truly felt like staying in a tree house! The studio was cozy and really cute with a nice big bathroom and two comfortable bedrooms. Everything we needed was provided. The outdoor amenities were excellent! They have an excellent water front with a sandy area, nice cleared out space for swimming, an excellent paddle boat with a cover to keep off the sun and a ladder for swimming. We spent most of the time paddling out and then letting the kids jump off. There is a great Lilly pad to use as well as stand up paddle boards! Just bring your life vests and beach towels a d enjoy!!We made a fire in the fire pit, watched wildlife (deer, cranes, birds), played croquet, and fed a school of friendly fish right off the dock, which the kids especially loved! Nearby is a lot of family fun! We loved the zoo, go karts and bowling on a rainy day. The best was the fun 1.5 mile forest trail/mountain bike track! When our kids are older, we will definitely bring bikes, but for now we just loved hiking the twisty path! Our hosts were excellent! Easy drive from Minneapolis as well."

2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,This is an incredible vacation spot and would absolutely recommend staying here. The property is beautiful and the lake access was perfect in the summer.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great stay, would definitely visit again! The studio has all the up north amenities you‚Äôd expect, and then some!

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family couldn‚Äôt be more happy with the decision to stay at John and Carna‚Äôs lake cabin. Appropriately named, adventure studio had more than enough to keep our two girls (8&10) entertained. From paddle boarding, pedal boating, swimming,fishing, taking the pontoon boat out, to making s‚Äômores by the Firepit area, they truly offer it all. 5 days just wasn‚Äôt enough to enjoy it all! This was a first class experience all the way around. Simply put, we can‚Äôt say enough good things about Adventure Studio or the hosts, John and Carna."
2021-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Awesome memorial weekend stay! Easy check in and check out. Soft, comfy beds. Kitchen is well stocked. Very clean and well lit. Cabin is very close to Cuyuna Mountain Bike trails aside from the other trails that is just right beside the cabin. Also close to Nisswa. Pedal boat was so much fun. John and Carna are great hosts!!! Highly recommended!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect spot for our family vacation! The studio was beautiful and had everything we needed. The outside space was fun for our toddler to explore. John and Carna were great hosts and have a great space! We hope to be back :)

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This studio is sparklingly clean, comfortable, stylish and has fabulous views of the lake! It looks like something you‚Äôd see in a magazine! We loved the windows! You can tell that each one was carefully placed to capitalize on the view. It‚Äôs very quiet and peaceful. Perfect place to take a step back from the craziness of life.
The kitchen is small, but really well stocked. We cooked every day and found everything we needed in the kitchen cabinets. It was a joy to come back to the studio after a day of exploring the nearby hiking trails.
The tub was perfect to soak in after a long day and the water was nice and hot.
Self check-in was easy! The studio is upstairs, so once you go into the entryway, there‚Äôs a short flight of stairs. Bear this in mind if you have a hard time climbing stairs. It was not a problem for us at all, and the stairs are wide and carpeted with a sturdy rail, but just an FYI.
We would stay here again in a heartbeat! Our hosts thought of everything and we are very grateful to have found this place."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is wonderful! Super cozy, thoughtful space. Tons of windows to make it nice and bright inside. Right in the middle of the woods, gorgeous view of the lake, not too far from town. We HIGHLY recommend this location to anyone :)"

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was extremely tidy and clean, which is one of the most important things to me! It has a beautiful view of the trees and lake as well! Near enough to the city to where everything was close enough when we wanted to out and explore, but secluded enough to where you felt like you had your privacy! Would definitely stay here again in the future. Too bad it wasn't warmer or we would have taken advantage of the paddle boat and fire pit!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place will not let you down! The views, the comfort, the amenities, the peacefulness! I‚Äôm from a large city and being able to pack a lunch, paddle to the center of the lake, and just enjoy the disconnected life was amazing.

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Everything was very clean, modern, beautifully and thoughtfully designed! The view. Oof. A-mazing! We heard owls singing outside and even saw a bald eagle fly on the property. It was cozy and the beds we slept in were very comfortable. Carna responded quickly to our questions.

2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The ""adventure studio"" offers way more than the pictures can show you! Not only is it beautiful inside, the scenery is spectacular for an outdoor crew like ourselves. We enjoyed hiking the many trails in the woods, and found a sledding hill to take our 2 year old on. They had a skating rink available out on the lake which we LOVED! The lake has a groomed trail for skiing, snowshoeing, or fat tire bikes! Inside was cozy and wonderful. Perfectly updated and neat with all the amenities you would need to cook meals. Our son loved it here as well and had plenty of space to run and play! It's great!"

At John and Carna‚Äôs lakefront studio, we found exactly that. They were so helpful in recommending places to eat and hikes to try. We enjoyed skating and snow shoeing on the lake in front of their property. The view from the studio was beautiful and tranquil. We would recommend this place without hesitation, and will be excited to stay there again in the future."

This place is in a woodsy area so watch out for the mosquitos!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My wife and I have stayed at a number of AirBnB locations over the years. The experiences have all been positive. But this one was well past positive. Robin went to great lengths to anticipate the needs of her guests and meet them, including the four legged guests. She is the most thoughtful host we have ever encountered. For instance, I had messaged her asking for a recommendation to celebrate my wife's birthday the following day. Not only did she make an excellent recommendation, but when we arrived back at the cabin the next day, we were greeted with a ""Happy Birthday"" sign by our door. The space itself was cozy, private and stocked with everything we needed. My wife and I attend a conference in Brainerd 2 out of every 3 years. We decided last year that rather than stay at the conference center, we would like some space to ourselves. This was perfect. We will be returning to Robin's next conference."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place to rest and recharge during a coast-to-coast cross-country van trip. Robin and Fran are a friendly couple who were always available next door but gave us all the privacy we needed. The house is full of thoughtful touches and amenities for the weary traveler. There were even goodies and toys for our dogs. Since we arrived later than expected due to a flat tire AND an emergency repair, both at different times in the same day, Robin graciously offered us an extra night. A cool soak in the tub was great for itchy insect bites. We were also able to catch up on laundry, do some cooking in the well equipped kitchen, and reorganize our van, which looked like a bomb exploded inside during our camping adventures. Fran even gave us a fresh cucumber from his garden upon our departure. Brainerd itself has plenty of services and shopping, so we were able to stock up on everything we needed. Next time we pass this way, we will definitely stay again!"

A very tranquil and quiet location tucked off the beaten path in the woods. They are one of the few hosts that allow pets, although we did not bring one ourselves. It was a warm and humid day and the scent of previous dog guests was noticeable. There were wonderful treats and a sweet welcome note as well as everything that one could possibly need on an overnight stay. away. Thank you for making this place available for those who wish to visit northern Minnesota as most other places are incredibly spendy."

2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Robin was great at communicating during booking and right up to and including check-in. Very quiet, peaceful location. Close to Brainerd and a few restaurants. The things we were surprised about was that the apartment is actually in a garage next to the house. It did seem to be clean and neat. Our biggest complaint was the lighting. So dimly lit in every area. The bedroom, bathroom, living room and kitchen were all very dimly lit. We enjoy reading and there was not enough light anywhere to do that. One other item was the screen door going to the deck is badly in need of replacement. Duct tape was not going to keep out the mosquitos."

I stayed on the single bed in the ""cave"" and found it comfy and the darkness made it so nice for sleeping in.

Some small cleanliness items like cobwebs in some corners of the room and a lot of dust under chairs (only noticed when our dogs ball rolled under). Nothing terrible.

2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Many safety concerns especially if you have kids. The second ""bedroom"" is NOT one: the three stairs are hazardous at best; there is no lighting outdoors; bathmats are slippery; outdoor grill is tiny and filthy; it's easy to trip or fall off the cement patio; and I don't think the house was cleaned before we arrived.
On the good side, the host left thoughtful snacks, pet toys, toddler toys, and provided a warm atmosphere and good price."

It is a little ways out of town, and while there is a restaurant/bar within walking distance, anything else you will need to drive back into town for. Very clean and our four-year-old loved his little bear-cave sleeping area. You are right next to the owners house, but we didn't see them at all. Thanks, Robin!"

Robin is super responsive and there are lots of little extras for people and doggies in the house. I loved sitting out back in the mornings and watching butterflies in the raspberry bushes. It's very clean with a full kitchen, great internet and satellite TV - so it fits the bill if you just want a quiet place to chill but want to stay connected to the world or if you need a nice home base after a day of adventure. A great off the beaten path bargain."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice little place. Communication early on made it really easy to come and go as we pleased/needed. Comfortable, clean, with nice amenities, very worth the stay. A little outside Brainerd, but an easy drive in. Would definitely recommend to others."

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A nice, country-style apartment tucked into some woods. It's just outside of Brainerd. The main bedroom sleeps two well. The single bed really is a single bed and is best for a child. A nice spot for visiting around the Brainerd area, Crosby or Mille Lacs."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying here was great.
Place was very clean, host was extremely fast with responses.
Very cozy and clean area.
Only thing is that its like an apartment added on to the garage of their main house.
We had no problems with interference or anything wrong with it. It was great, but figured I might as well bring it up as some people might not think its very private.
Also the cable has a limit of 3 people watching at a time, we ran into an issue where the main house was using the 3 tuners at once which stopped us from being able to watch television.
Keep in mind it is a bit further out. (As it is a country getaway) but its roughly 30m from every attraction in the area.

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Of all the Airbnb‚Äôs that I have stayed at across the US and Europe, Robin‚Äôs little cottage in Minnesota was the most welcoming and comfortable I‚Äôve ever experienced. The photos don‚Äôt do the space justice. It is beautifully decorated and so homey. Robin went above and beyond to make sure her guests want for nothing. I would absolutely recommend Robin‚Äôs hospitality to anyone!!"

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Robin's place worked perfect for us. We took a 3 day scuba diving course with Minnesota School of Diving in Brainerd and this was a great home base for us. She is a short drive from the main part of Brainerd, very easy to get to the dive shop. House was very well appointed with lots of thoughtful extras. We would definitely recommend this place for others. Thank you Robin for your hospitality."

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This a nice place -- very quiet. There are many things to do in the area. We also enjoyed a day trip to Duluth, which is about 2 hours away. We would definitely come back."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Robin's place was absolutely lovely! There were so many welcoming touches like snacks, coffee, bath bombs, and wood for the fire pit. There's even fun lights outside too! The sky is gorgeous out there and Robin was quick to reply to our last minute request. Would absolutely stay again, we hope to soon! üòä"
2020-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Awesome cozy place to stay! It was so cute and sweet little touches that added to the place.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Robin's place was a nice and cozy place to stay. The back patio, which is surrounded by woods, was a great place to relax after a day of traveling. Highly recommend for a nice out of town place to stay!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Easily the best outfitted accommodation I've had after dozens of Airbnb stays. The host was very thoughtful and responsive. The kitchen and bathroom are fully stocked, and there were so many more thoughtful touches throughout. Relaxing and great stay overall."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay! Small and cozy but has everything you need. As a pet friendly place it was clean, but if you have pet allergies it may not be a great fit. Overall a great little place that is a great value! The little bedroom is very cool, a hit for kids especially!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Robin‚Äôs place was just what we were looking for on our trip cross country. Everything was comfortable and clean, and Robin was very responsive to questions. Our favorite part was all of the incredibly thoughtful little touches that made us feel right at home!"
2020-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Would recommend nice place to stay
2020-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Tucked away cottage close to Cuyuna! Perfect for quick get-away! We spent several days riding the red trails and swimming in the heat. Such a pleasure to come back to Robin's place where the air is cold, the environment is quiet, and you have the whole place to relax. Large yard, long country road, and everything you need is right here."
2020-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Robin's place is as advertised. Easy to find, lots of nice little things she has done with her ABB. Kids toys, animal treats for pets."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great fishing trip! The first thing to know about this place is that it is located near an endless number of lakes. My father and I fished 4 different lakes within easy driving distance. For me, that makes the place a terrific value for the money. It's 1/2 way between Mille Lacs and Gull Lake (both amazing fishing lakes). We also fished Clearwater lake and Bay Lake which are only a few minutes' drive to the public launches. It's exactly what you see in the pictures so if you want something fancy, look elsewhere. If you want something super clean and efficient and close to everything, book it. I was somewhat hesitant knowing that the rental allowed pets. I'm not a dog person and I assumed that I'd smell dog hair and such. However, I couldn't tell that pets had ever been in the rental. It was super clean (no dog hair visible) and totally odor free. It also has plenty of room for an SUV with a trailer (18.5 foot fishing boat) to park and back up to leave. I can't afford to buy a cabin in Brainerd, but I'd definitely rent Robin's place again to be near the fish!"
2020-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very cute and very accommodating. Over all good time:)
2020-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The cabin is as it is in the photos. It has what is necessary for a short stay. It is very quiet. Robin is adorable, very generous in her attention, she puts a lot attention to many details such as snacks or personal cleaning things. The only thing that was a drawback was the WiFi connection. It is very unstable, very regular, during our time there I was never able to connect, hopefully they solve that. Otherwise it's a good place ."
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our quick stay and really appreciated easy check in. Robin welcomed our large dog and the location was great, no traffic and woods where she could stretch her legs after a long trip. A very comfortable location, well appointed kitchen."
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute little piece of the country! Robin was very nice and a great host! Thank you again!
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic place to stay. They were so nice the entire time and even brought a tiny tennis ball for my new puppy. I will definitely return if I come back to the area

2020-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Lots of great snacks and wonderful hospitality
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Robin‚Äôs mother-in-law‚Äôs home is cozy and has everything you need for a short visit or a long trip. She had lots of nice essentials and I don‚Äôt often find at some Airbnb‚Äôs. The view from the patio door into the woods the relaxing and beautiful. I would definitely stay at her place again if I returned to the area.
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! Very comfortable and welcoming.
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Robin is thoughtful in her details, provided everything we could need. Quiet and peaceful place nestled in the woods."

I would highly recommend her place!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had an amazing time. It was exactly what we needed to spend time together and get ready for an upcoming surgery. The place was amazing, the side cabin worked great for my brother and his kids to come stay and the amenities that came with the house were better than any other Air BNB we‚Äôve ever had before. We‚Äôll be back!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at these cabins! We came here with friends to hang out and celebrate a birthday! It was the perfect place to relax and get away for the weekend.
Being right on the lake was very peaceful! It felt like we were far away but it is very close to Baxter/Brainerd if you want to go out to eat or need to pick up anything.
The cabins were very clean and were equipped with everything we needed. While it was cold so we could not use the equipment to go out on the lake, there were many other things for us to do. There was air hockey, darts, foosball, and board games to play. We had fun walking around nearby too.
Having 2 cabins was really nice. We have a new baby and none of our friends have kids yet. We were able to stay in the small cabin without disturbing the others while they slept in the larger cabin. It worked out perfectly.
We would definitely recommend the place and would come back again! Adam is responsive, gave all the details we needed, and was easy to work with."
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Amazing place! Second time staying here and will be staying here again! Great host and amazing views!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We spent a long weekend at Sunset Loons with extended family and enjoyed the comfort and space between the 2 cabins. The expansive windows and location right on the lake was beautiful and quite relaxing. We had everything needed to feel right at home. Much of the weekend was spent having quality time indoors and endless rounds of air hockey, darts, and other games in the garage. Hope to have the opportunity to visit again in the summer to enjoy more of the outdoors and time on the lake!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,It was a great stay

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had an Excellent experience at this property. It was Lake front, felt very relaxed. The Main House looked even better than the photos. My mother stayed in the Second home and begged me too book it again the next time we visit. The host was extremely responsive and emailed me clear instructions well ahead of our visit. I hope this place is available when we visit again in Jan!!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,We stayed here for my friend‚Äôs bachelorette party and it was perfect! The area is great for a private party and the house was adorable and well taken care of. We also loved using the various beach toys. Laura is very responsive and I would definitely recommend this stay for any group.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We have a fantastic family weekend up North. Everyone had their own space and the fully equipped kitchen made for some spectacular meal around the gorgeous dining table. The location was perfect and close to so many things to do. We want to come back in the summer! Thank you for a wonderful stay!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,What's not to like? A well appointed home and our best experience renting a private vacation home. The light that poured into the house each morning over the lake made each of them joyous. Laura was a top notch host! I highly recommend this vacation home!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Laura was an amazing host! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and the accommodations were beyond the average accommodations at an airbnb. I would absolutely stay again! Everything was outstanding!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We absolutely loved our stay at the Haven celebrating our 8 year anniversary and babymoon (and have already started looking to book for next year!) The home was so clean, comfortable, cozy, beautifully decorated, with all the amenities we needed, and so very dog friendly. Our pups loved relaxing on the large, wrap around, gated deck. The beach is perfect, we loved exploring the lake on the paddle boards and the dogs had a great time in the water. The location was ideal with a short drive to access several local restaurants, breweries, and the Paul Bunyan bike trail. And to top off the wonderful experience, the host was very responsive!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family had an amazing and relaxing week at Laura‚Äôs place. The house is cozy, adorably decorated and super well equipped.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay at Haven on Hartley was memorable!
The location was beautiful inside and out. From the sandy beach, blue skies and the call of loons to the comfortable and clean indoors. We were impressed with the ‚Äúkid friendly ‚Äú environment and amenities. This is truly a special upscale property with the comfort of home.

Kids had a blast on the beach!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at Haven on Hartley. The home had everything we needed for our two families with young kids. The home was well appointed and clean. The beach was beautifully groomed and perfect for splashing around or trying out the SUPs. For kids, we especially appreciated the beach toys, ample kids dishes, and large TV room for downtime between swims. The garage space was an added bonus ‚Äî many a fun ping pong match was had. We also enjoyed the quiet setting on Hartley (apart from a little race track noise) having previously stayed on much bigger Gull Lake. We rented a pontoon on Gull one day and were happy to have the serene setting complete with loon calls to come back to. We‚Äôre looking forward to a return trip!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We appreciated the quiet lake and ability to kayak during the day with minimal boating. Thanks!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"And the house was lovely, the beachfront area was wider than I expected and the neighbors were further away and we had more privacy. The kayak and the paddle boats were so fun. And there was so much to do in the area, we didn‚Äôt spend a minute being bored!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Had an amazing and relaxing stay at Laura‚Äôs place. The views of the lake were breathtaking to fall asleep to and to wake up to. It felt like my home away from home. Everything was spotless. We love this place!

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect Family Getaway! The haven was absolutely perfect for our family with kids ranging from 3-10. It was so evident that every single detail has been thought through to make it convenient, comfortable, and cozy! It has everything you could ever need in the kitchen for toddlers on up, very comfortable beds and bedding, games and puzzles, and the coziest blankets for everyone. More than enough storage for all of your clothing/coats, etc. oh, and VERY fast wi-fi!
The lake is calm and absolutely gorgeous. Watching the sunrise from the deck wrapped up in a blanket is a must! The best I‚Äôve ever seen! Great water toys‚Ä¶we used the paddle boat and sand toys a lot.
The cabin is easy to get to and only about 6-7 minutes from all of the conveniences of Baxter and about the same from the cutest town of Nisswa!
We had a wonderful stay!"
