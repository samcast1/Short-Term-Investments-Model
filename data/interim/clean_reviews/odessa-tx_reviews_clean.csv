2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The only real complaint I have about Dora’s place is not knowing about the extra room/add on attached to the cottage. No where in the description or in our communications was I aware that someone else would be staying. But her place was very clean and put together for her guests.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This Airbnb is easily one of the best places I have stayed at. It has all the essentials and much more that you would need for your stay to be as comfortable as possible.

They go above and beyond to make you feel at home. The cottage is a really cozy place as stated and anyone that wishes to spend time there, would not be disappointed.

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I travel to Odessa for hospital work monthly and so this was a very convenient location relative to the hospital. It is surprisingly quiet for a downtown spot. I slept in the king sized bedroom - the bed is great and there are black out curtains for daytime sleeping. The place is very clean. There is a full kitchen if you like to cook , but you will have to buy all your own spices, oils etc as there aren’t any stocked. If you are a long term guest, you will need to use a laundromat as there is no washer or dryer here , but it is otherwise a perfect place to stay , especially if you’re at one of the local hospitals. Dora was quick to respond to messages at first, but once I suggested that adding laundry to the place would be a big boost to the cottage , I did not hear from her. Her husband was considerate in checking in with me at my check out day , though. And they left two gallons of water for me , which was really thoughtful. It was a really comfy stay overall and would recommend it. I felt safe there , too."

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Though this is not in a residential area, it is the perfect place to stay. It is within walking distance to several local shops and restaurants. It is less than a 15 minute drive to the Ector Coliseum and other Odessa sites. The cottage is a quaint converted dental office. The beds are very comfortable and the bathroom has a great shower. The kitchen and living areas have everything you could need. I would definitely stay here again anytime !"

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dora's cottage, a charming redo of a dentist's office, was perfect for our needs. The place is very clean, comfortable and well equipped for either a short or long stay. The kitchen equipment is new and in great shape. The beds are very comfortable. The cottage is in the downtown area of Odessa and is within walking distance of restaurants, an Avis car rental, and a wonderful used bookstore. Access to a grocery store is a little more challenging. We highly recommend Dora's cottage if you need a place to stay in Odessa."

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dora was very responsive to our questions and provided us with good information about her place.

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Close to everything u need
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,This space made us fall in love with Airbnb rather then staying at a hotel! It’s located in a ideal spot but it is also hidden to the point where it was quietly quaint. You get to witness helicopters flying into the hospital and it did not disturb us one bit. I would recommend this spot and the attentive hosts.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Will return. Hospitality from afar is incomparable.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We stayed here while my husband was at work. It was a quaint place that felt homey and clean. Dora is great at responding quickly and taking care of any needs you may have. House is located near both the medical district of Odessa as well as Odessa college.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful space for when you’re traveling for work!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Cute house with everything you need!
2020-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,..
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures are accurate except for the front. The front porch is waaay prettier in person :). It looks like a little dessert oasis. I traveled here for work and I'm glad I went with this option over the others.
Even though it's located in between businesses, it still feels secluded, private and safe. The home is walking distance to a lot but given the heat and my desire to not melt, I opted for ubereats which found the home easily.
Like goldilocks, I tried all of the beds and they are all perfect! My children, who are self proclaimed ""mattress connoisseurs"", typically complain about the beds but I didn't hear a peep about these which says a lot.
I did not cook this trip but had I wanted to, I had everything I would need to prepare a decent meal. There's not a dishwasher so if you decide to cook, prepare to handwash the good ole fashioned way.
Both bathrooms offered ample towels and body soap. The temperature and water pressure are virtually perfect.
Communication with the host was perfect! I believe the response time averaged about 20 min which is almost unheard of! I had a mini meltdown after having a flat THE DAY of check out (talk about bad luck) and the host assisted in helping me find help.
You will not be disappointed with your stay here."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Little hidden gem in Odessa. Very comfortable place! Highly recommended!

2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Nora and Noah were great hosts. The cottage was very comfortable and had everything I needed for a 2 1/2 month stay. I would definitely recommend this home to anyone looking for a great place with a great location. It had plenty of room and is located right in the medical center. It would be perfect for doctors visiting the medical center or if you have a friend in the hospital. The air conditioner worked great and the beds are super comfy.
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place.
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is spacious and immaculate! Everything we needed was there. My family of three highly recommends!

Will definitely be looking to stay again in the future when passing through."
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was hoping Dora's place would be the wonderfully weird, unique experience it appears to be online... and it was! Add that Dora is a responsive and thoughtful host, and you've got a formula for a good stay. (Also I agree with other reviewers-Texas Pecan is delicious, and I generally can't stand flavored coffee. :)"

2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I found this cottage for my husband who needed to do internship in Odessa,TX at the hospital nearby. Upon finding this cottage, I had questions and Dora responded within 2-3 minutes of me sending her messages. She stayed in touch with us up until the check-in date. My husband described the place as very clean, cozy, convenient for what he was there for, home-like and safe. My husband said that the cottage looked better than the pictures when he got there. Dora was very nice. She wasn't overbearing but checked in via text every blue moon to make sure her guests were comfortable. Her place had all necessities needed for the stay( toilet paper, hand soap, dishes, cleaning supplies etc) which was a blessing to my husband. Overall, stay was amazing and comfortable. Thank Dora for everything!"

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was very cute on the inside, and clean. The location was close to Ector County Coliseum, Walmart & H-E-B. But it was in a tiny RV park. The road noise was pretty loud. When I got there, I checked out the security of the place. The window had been shut - but was left unlocked. Might not have been the best location for a single female to stay."

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,It was a very clean and quiet home.

2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"I had the benefit of being from Odessa so I was familiar with this neighborhood and felt safe here. I seen a few houses on the site but was familiar with the neighborhoods that aren't too great.
The house is however 2nd house from a pretty busy street.
The house is set up sooo cute!
I felt like it was set up like a staging home as the living room furniture is not really for sitting around and chilling. Good enough for a quick stay but not the most comfortable.
I was allowed to take my fur babies which was a huge plus. The back yard was perfect.
Tania was so kind and answered every question I had. I had a few small hiccups and Tania went above and beyond to accommodate my needs.
If you have small children, this place would be great!
I would recommend this house and will stay again."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and clean! Located in a new sub division. Will return!
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was very clean and spacious . Host was great and very responsive . However , feedback is to provide a better experience for future guests: ( we had 2 adults and 2 kids under 5 yrs)
1. There were no pool towels. We had to use bath towels, in which there were not enough towels because the ""pool towels"" became really dirty with the midland dust after taking outside
2. Kitchen is slim. 2 coffee mugs. 6 plates . 4 water glasses. No mixing type bowls/large salad/pasta bowls.There is no plastic in the place- so bringing a glass water cup outside was risky. It's pretty bare bones !
3. We had half a roll of paper towels and ran out quickly with no extras . No dish towels.
4. No laundry soap provided
5. Out of the 3 days we were there- the host showed up 2 times ( he messaged that he would have to drop by and clean the pool , and the meet a warranty repair person ) although host was accommodating and responsive - I still didn't want him dropping by at less than ideal hours ."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is clean and very comfortable with a lovely back yard and pool. The only reason I rated the location good instead of great is because the traffic is pretty loud all night long which made sleeping soundly a bit difficult. If you're not a light sleeper you will have no problem at all.

I checked in on my birthday and the welcome sign with my name made me smile. It's thoughtful that they do that and their guest book and tips from other visitors was my favorite part, I didn't get time to read any of it. The bed was comfortable, Not sure what kind of couch that was but it's was pretty cool how it pulled out and would make a big comfortable bed."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super cosy little space was perfect for what I needed. Close to the college to watch my girl’s softball and get her set up! Their daughters are adorable and Kiki was super responsive and kind. I will stay again when I’m back to visit!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place, quiet and private! Beautiful backyard with birds singing. Private entrance and close to downtown. Inside you couldn’t hear the noise from the street and it was close enough to the highway to not have to go too far out of the way. It was clean and tidy, with clear instructions :) I am so grateful to Jonny and Kiki for being flexible and understanding.
I really wish it had a full size fridge and a mattress that was more firm, but those are personal preferences. Being on a road trip with food items made me really wish I had a full fridge and freezer but all that was available was a mini fridge."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Easy stay! Great directions & instructions. Very comfortable home. Wish we could have stayed longer.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Really enjoyed our stay and will definitely be coming back.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This AirBnB was really great and perfect location for our needs. It’s in a semi sketchy part of town, but we were also working in that part of town, so the convenience factor is 5 stars.
Everything was spotless and it was easy to get in. It’s a really nice place and I think my favorite part was that they have RO Water in the kitchen. The shower was nice and accessible.
I didn’t realize one of the beds was a couch bed, but that’s on me for not reading thoroughly. It’s very plain in the listing. The two of us are over 30 so a couch bed isn’t desirable, but they had an additional fold up mattress that made it sleep-able.
Overall, it was perfect for our needs and we’d be glad to stay there again. It felt very homey and I’d highly recommend to
Small families. Kids can handle a couch bed much better than we can. 😂"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great and comfy home!!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A cute little home to stay at with family or just oneself. Highly recommend as the hosts were super responsive and respectful.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great place to stay! Quiet, sunny, and so clean. I felt very safe the entire week."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A lovely place, very nicely decorated, welcoming. It has a small refrigerator with no freezer, so don't buy ice cream! :-) The counter top ice maker is fast but noisy, so we shut if off at night. I'm glad they had one because we have been considering buying one. Perfect for 2 people, 4 would be cramped. Bed was comfortable, sofa bed was hard. Good to have a closet, but no shelves. There was street noise during the day but it was much less at night. Loved the landscaping and the friendly kitty. Lots of birds in the trees, which we always enjoy hearing. Overall, we would definitely return."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Super cute. From inside and out. Everything was perfect and amazing. We were able to explore the Monahans Sandhills State Park, super fun! The couch is a pull out, so turns into a bed. Was perfect for my kiddos and I. We really enjoyed our stay. Highly recommend to anyone passing through or visiting Odessa or nearby areas.
🖤"

The home was clean and convenient for our needs.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved the place and area! Had no problems what do ever. If we’re ever around in the area again this will be my number one spot for sure!!!

2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The bed was comfortable, not too soft, and the space fit our needs for a place to sleep. Be aware…there is a cat that tries desperately to come inside. It made it by us once, but fortunately was friendly enough to let us pick it up and put it back outside :)
Not being familiar with a Nest thermostat, it took some doing to turn off the set schedule. Thankfully the host sent us a link to a YouTube video describing the process!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great littleplace for me as I stayed in Odessa for business for a few days. The space was small but well-designed and perfect for one person! It had a great kitchen, the bed was comfy, the cleanliness was top notch, and the outdoor space was a nice retreat. It was simple, clean, and had all that I needed for a relaxing stay. Hosts are awesome and were very helpful with my requests. They do have a cat that likes to come in, which was fine with me, but those who are allergic to cats may need to know this info. The location is on the corner of one of the busier streets in Odessa, but a fence provides some privacy from the traffic. I would definitely recommend this place for one person, couples, or maybe even a family of 3."

Very quiet neighborhood. She responded very quick to my request. The price was the best and because of that we could spend one more day with our niece other way we could have spent only few hours visiting her. Brenda allowed us to invite my niece for dinner.
Thank you for everything Brenda."

We could not park on the street in front of anyone house even though it’s public parking and they don’t own the street. We had to park down the street at a school. When family stopped by to visit even my older mother who could not walk far, it was always stressful to make sure no one parked on the street in front of the neighbors houses."

2022-03-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"During March my family and I traveled from Michigan to Texas for a family event. We rented this airbnb because it had the right accommodations and was still close to family. The house upon arrival was great. Clean and organized neatly. I would have given this stay a 5 star review, but disappointingly the stay had an issue that was uncomfortable and we were not accommodated. After arriving we started to notice bugs in the kitchen. We shortly realized they were roaches and I quickly notified the host. She responded right away saying she'd call an exterminator for the following day. The issue was uncomfortable to say the least as we couldn't sit at the table to eat with out one running across. I contacted the host again asking for some compensation as this was not what we expected. She wasn't willing to be flexible at all and sharply suggested that if we were uncomfortable to find another location to stay at immediately. This was very disappointing as our budget didn't allow for another stay else where. We don't discourage anyone from renting here as the house was comfortable, however I feel it necessary that renters know there is a reoccurring issue with these bugs and that Crystal, the host knew about it and wasn't accommodating."

Upon arrival the home smells so clean and lovely. The decor is beautiful. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook. Let’s talk about how freaking cool the fridge was! I mean it played pandora 😊. The stove was also super upscale and fancy. The milk, beer, and snacks were cherries on top!
The outdoor area was very private despite being in town. The entire backyard is fenced in. (The electric mosquito repeller was another cool touch, although we didn’t have to use.)
The living room area was so comfy. I fell in love with this couch! We lounged and netflixed for an entire day. The tv is MASSIVE and has Netflix, Hulu and other apps. There are lounging blankets provided. The coffee-table/foosball table was that extra touch of coolness.
Every bedroom had a tv with WiFi and Netflix connected. Each room was also was super cozy and homey.
The bathrooms and showers were super clean with enough towels, toothpaste, face wipes, mouthwash, and shampoo.
The washer and dryer are huge and wash super quickly. Thank for the softener and dryer sheets.
Although, the rules did not require you take your shoes off throughout the home, we did. This home is sooo clean and lovely. It’s not often my husband just relaxes, but he did just that. So thank you again Crystal for your kind hospitality and for sharing this amazing home. We will certainly stay here again and highly recommend to everyone."

Mind you I was in big bend with no service and came back into this host assuming I was still there... I can only assume a new tenant was occupying the space and the host was confused. I have stayed in Airbnb’s all over the world and have never had a issue until this one, would rather stay in a hotel next time!"
