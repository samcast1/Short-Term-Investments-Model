2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jane's place met my 3 C's standard, clean, cozy and comfortable! We were only there one night on our way west and it was a perfect place to relax after 8 hours on the road. We relaxed on the hammock and enjoyed the lush surroundings. The neighborhood was extremely quite, we slept with the windows open, we heard a barred owl calling during the night. The bed was comfortable, with plenty of pillows and blankets. The bathroom and kitchen had all we needed. If we pass thru the area again, we would stay again."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My life partner and I were on a road trip across the United States and we were passing through Missouri on our way back. Our original planned location to stay for the evening wasn‚Äôt quite shaping up, and then we found this perfect tiny home tucked away in a beautiful neighborhood. All we needed was a quiet place to relax and sleep so we could finish our return trip in the morning and this was everything we needed.
The host was extremely responsive and since our stay was very short notice, it was truly wonderful to have such a pleasant person to interact with. The space itself was exactly as advertised if not better. My partner and I don‚Äôt need a lot of space, so the tiny home suited us perfectly. We had everything we needed to refresh ourselves and get a great nights rest.
I would easily recommend this location to anyone!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"So cute and cozy! Hidden gem in a great location. I would not bring kids or anyone with a disability here due to the ladder and small space, but I would 100% stay again and recommend it to the right guests! They use their own filtration systems to water the yard so it‚Äôs good to be mindful of that regarding products with chemicals you may use in the shower or dumping liquids down the drains."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were only in town for one night and the tiny house was perfect:)

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"It was a really nice stay, small but it is described as a tiny house so it wasn‚Äôt smaller than expected. Really really cute, sitting outside in the morning watching and listening to all the birds was my favoriteüòä"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great experience for going off the grid a bit! The treehouse is cozy and I‚Äôm impressed with the bohemian feel and decor. We were able to easily come and go! Nice stopover spot on our way to KC.

2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The Tiny house is a cute place to stay. The neighborhood was quiet and peaceful. It is just as described, tiny. We had 3 adults, just spending the night and it is a bit difficult to share the bathroom/living space area in the AM. Probably best for just 1 or 2 people. Jane was a great communicator. Thanks for sharing your tiny house with us."

2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The tiny house was an affordable stay for us while visiting family in the hospital. We just needed a place to lay our heads at night. Everything was as described and Jane was kind. My only complaint was that there was multiple hairs on the sheets and on the walls of the shower, which makes me wonder about cleaning measures."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jane and Dans comfortable, sustainable, and affordable tiny home packs a pleasant surprise for you to find in the colorful city of Columbia Missouri. Quaint and efficient with every inch of the space provided in this tiny home, the home gave us a much needed place for our visit with family.
If you ever felt an urge to try tiny home living for the first time like I did, I couldn‚Äôt suggest a more splendid experience for the price offered with our stay this holiday 2023."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This little back house was awesome! The pricing is affordable and the house was clean while also giving back to the environment which is a HUGE plus. Thank you! I see myself staying here quite often as I come up here to see friends and family a lot.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"wow! My husband and I were so pleased with this find. Basic but lovely, Jane's tiny house was just the respite we needed in our 39 hour trip. Close to the interstate, close to restaurants, close to a Tesla supercharger. Definitely would go back."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were attending a show at the blue note and this tiny home was the perfect place to stay! It was less than a 10 minute drive to downtown Columbia and the blue note.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,beautiful place. thank you for letting me experience the land
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"It was overall a very cute and comfortable place in a pretty neighborhood. I probably would not stay here again though because the smell from the composting toilet was pretty bad. Upstairs where I slept I didn't notice it much, but I also had covid recently so my sense of smell is negligible. However, my guest who slept on the downstairs was bothered by the smell all night, for them it was an unpleasant stay only for that reason, but they are a heavier person and weren't comfortable climbing up the stairs to sleep, so we didn't switch places. I felt bad. Otherwise a great value and no other complaints at all."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved our little stay in your cute home.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This tiny home is so delightful! Every thing you need they supply you with. They have coffee and a coffee maker and a mini fridge. It‚Äôs such a cozy and well curated and maintained get away!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I really enjoyed my stay in Jane‚Äôs eco friendly tiny house, it was so different and cozy.

2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"fun place for a night stay. just be aware it is a ""tiny house"" which means minimal but well done furnishings. the loft was fun. but the bed on the main floor, for two somewhat larger people was not as comfortable as some. still over all was a fun night and we loved the bohemian look"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a beautifully darling place to stay! It is so well curated with just the amount of things needed and so creatively customized.

The tiny house is the perfect spot for us to unwind during short weekend getaways to Columbia. The neighborhood is quiet, and the backyard is peaceful with beautiful trees, sweet pups, and a cozy coffee spot on the tiny house's porch. Inside is our bohemian dream, with an upstairs nook perfect for strumming our guitar or reading one of Jane's many interesting books lining her shelves.
We will absolutely be back and sure to book early! Thanks, Jane."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Another delightful stay in this lovely, tranquil space. SO very glad our son is only a freshman at Mizzou ‚Äî that hopefully means we have (at least) four years of return trips from Chicagoland to the Tiny House ahead of us!! Thank you, Dan and Jane!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was such a perfect spot! I was staying in town for work and needed a quick place to rest.

The personal touches and lofted bedroom space made us feel like we were in a treehouse all our own. Also appreciated the place's commitment to sustainability and how easy they made it for us to participate as well.
We were in Columbia for the weekend and found the location to be within 10-15 minutes of everything we wanted to see / needed to get to. Highly recommend!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our second stay at the Treehouse. It is a great space for what it is. It is a tiny home and it is just as it was described. It was pretty warm out so we did need yo put the air conditioning on high and use the fan. I did forget my eye mask and the Treehouse does not have room darkening curtains, so if you need complete darkness to sleep, make sure to bring an eye mask.
We will definitely stay again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved staying at Jane's place. It was such a beautiful little place with everything you need and she made it so easy to get settled in there. Would definitely love to stay there again next time we're in Columbia!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My fam of 3 loved the ‚Äúoff the grid‚Äù privacy and vibe right in the middle of Columbia! Not only is the home is surrounded by nature but the inside has nature in mind which my fam appreciated (organic/biodegradable soaps/shampoos, FANTASTIC organic coffee - even a gray water composting toilet). I even spent a bit of time on the porch with my laptop knocking out a little work, and was kept company by their two VERY lovely, friendly dogs. :) Jane was super responsive and a great host!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Staying at Jane's place was lovely and peaceful, and Jane was a friendly and responsive host. I absolutely loved this magical, adorable home!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a fun tiny home! Very unique and comfortable.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great little place. I stayed here for 2 nights with my grown son while we were in town for a family gathering over the weekend. It was perfect for 2 grown adults; he stayed in the upstairs loft and I stayed downstairs. This was a comfortable arrangement for the 2 of us but I can see where a family of 4 could also stay here if it were 2 adults and 2 children. My bed was comfortable and the hosts were friendly, accommodating, and pleasant. My son accidentally locked us out with the keys still inside the house, and I felt terrible but I had to knock on the hosts‚Äô door at 9pm to get back in. Despite how foolish I felt, Dan was super understanding and kind about it and helped us right away. All good! The hosts also provided a delicious bag of coffee for us w/filtered water for brewing, along with Stevia, honey and powdered milk to add if we cared to. All in all it was a very pleasant stay and I would definitely stay here again. I hope we are welcome to come back! ü§ó‚ù§Ô∏è"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed our stay in the tiny house. Jane communicated with us quickly and confirmed that her listing met our family's needs. My sixteen year old daughter was thrilled to stay in a tiny house and now wants to move into the peaceful neighborhood. üòÑ This was our first experience renting an Airbnb and it was great.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely place!! Everything was exactly as described in the listing. Jane and Dan were very communicative and left clear and easy-to-follow instructions for everything. The place is really neat, felt like I was staying in a fancy tree house."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cute little spot! Feels very secluded- but also very small. I stayed with my friend and her husband after a concert and the layout will easily sleep 4, just not a lot of space to walk. Very eco friendly and comfy feel. It does have a AC unit inside so would be helpful to turn on upon check-in if you're staying in the summer (we didn't have the opportunity to stop by earlier upon check-in but the room cooled down within 20-30 minutes!). Dogs were super friendly and would be a perfect spot to have a cup of coffee on the front deck. Would definitely stay again :)"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very accommodating. We had a great stay!
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Owners nice & informative when I asked via message for to-do‚Äôs in the area. Unfortunately our trek took longer than planned & it was dark when we arrived. Getting from street parking to tiny house was a little challenging. The path to the house was narrow & dark, the backyard gate was cumbersome for us with our bags in the dark.
We had what we needed to get a good night‚Äôs rest & back on the road early the next morning - the AC & fans kept us cool - fridge/freezer good."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a super cute place, we were only there for 12 hours or less because we were just passing through on our way back home from vacation. It was a little hard to find but it was also 10 or later at night when we got there. The host was really nice and I think it is a sweet place to stay."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a fun stay! Great little overnight stay on our roadtrip. Beds were comfortable, had good a/c and extra fans, shower was nice (warm water etc) and was just super fun overall! My first tiny house experience and was everything i dreamed of!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This has been my absolute favorite Air Bnb I have ever stayed at! Incredible homey and comfortable for my friend and I. Even for taller individuals (I am 6‚Äô4‚Äù) this cabin is more than spacious! Even the loft!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was such a wonderful stay! Such a sweet space and so peaceful! Will definitely be back!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Magical place, very welcoming and charming. Kind of like a treehouse. We were in town for a funeral and so this place was a welcome respite, peaceful, with a lovely garden and sweet dogs. The bed was so comfortable and I slept better than I had in weeks. We had coffee up in the loft. I also loved the composting toilet and other environmentally conscious touches. Felt right at home. thank you."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice folk.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fairy tale of a place, tucked away in a beautiful, peaceful neighborhood. We were so impressed with how thoughtful everything was. Will definitely stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a great stay! Loved the space. It was quiet and very cozy.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay at the treehouse! So cute and cozy. We especially appreciated all of the organic and non-toxic personal care products provided. We were able to keep the house cool enough to sleep comfortably even in late-June. Dreamy surroundings, comfortable bed, and easy check-in. Highly recommend!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely worth it for a short stay, or maybe even a long stay, in Columbia. I work often in Jefferson City and had to get a quick reservation for a one-night stay in the general area of the state, and this tiny house was perfect. The price was beyond reasonable, and I was actually much more impressed with the place when I arrived than I had expected to be when I booked it. The tiny house itself is idyllic, sitting in the backyard of a beautiful property surrounded by all types of greenery. It's split into two levels- a main level with the main bed/living area and bathroom, and a loft area with two more small beds that is accessible by a secure step ladder. The neighborhood is incredibly quiet, to be so close to downtown Columbia (less than a 5 minute drive away). Everything was clean and ready for my arrival when I got there. The check-in/check-out process could not have been simpler. Very clear instructions from the host. Could not be happier with my experience. Thanks again, Jane!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect cozy spot for 2 adults! The neighborhood is really quiet and the tiny house was small but perfectly appointed for 2. We would definitely stay here again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Quaint and cozy cabin feel
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Appreciated the accurate description and comments of others. I initially had trouble finding the bath towels, but eventually spotted them neatly rolled up on the shelf under the ladder. For those who like to sleep in darkness, I‚Äôd suggest unplugging the lights on the porch to make the downstairs sleeping area darker ( the curtains provide nice privacy, but they are not heavy enough to block the porch lights). I enjoyed the coffee selection, which allowed me to be on my way in the morning with a nice caffeine buzz."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful place to stay my daughter and her friend loved it! It felt like a tree house in the woods beautiful location!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute place comfortable would definitely stay again!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Been on a solo journey and decided to treat myself to an adventure. This tiny home was nothing short of whimsical and cozy. It's quiet, unique, natural. At night with the string lights, it makes you feel like you just stepped into a tree house in the woods. I enjoyed my time on the porch. It was so cute on the inside and comfortable. Across the street, there was a cute little take one, leave one box which is cool if you like treasures. It's also across from a preserve. (Please pick up your trash.) This place was all by chance and I'm glad I took it! Take a chance, you won't be disappointed."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was awesome. Husband is 6‚Äô4‚Äù he loved the little home. It was adorable and we had delicious sushi less than 6 min away. We were there for a PIckelball tournament and it was awesome to relax.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Can't recommend highly enough. The house and the location are so beautiful, peaceful, welcoming, nourishing ... And Jane and Dan are extremely kind and cool people (as it seems is the general populace in Columbia). Jane went out of her way with kindness and support--way way above and beyond expectations for an Airbnb experience. I would (and likely will) go out of my way to stay here again. Thank you so much Jane and Dan!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I did not get to stay here but the hosts were very communicative and quick responders!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect place to unwind after a long day of travel. Quiet and secluded.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful! A beautifully curated space. Cozy, colorful, tidy. Great attention to detail with quilts, lamps, books, plants. Really fun to climb into the loft. Never even felt cramped because everything is so tidy and clean. It was well lit when we arrived after the sun had set, which was an especially fun way to find the home and walk into it. We loved that we could easily make coffee in the morning, too and sit on the patio out front! Then we were close by (driving) to a restaurant for breakfast (Nourish). I wish we could have stayed longer.
Thank you for all the clear directions before arrival and in the home - we had a really wonderful stay!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a nice and calm place to stay!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! It felt like staying in a treehouse in their backyard. Small space, but very comfortable and cozy.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Easily my most pleasant Airbnb experience! Pictures don't do this precious spot justice, it really is so magical. I just stopped into town in the middle of a long road trip, and picked this place because it was so cheap, but it really made me feel like I was on vacation!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This home is quiet and secluded. Loved being greeted by her 2 people friendly dogs. Safe neighborhood.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"my brother and I came up to COMO for a concert and the tiny house was absolutely perfect for our brief stay! I like the loft situation because we still felt like we had our own space. it was easy access to the downtown area as well. the area is super safe, beautiful, and peaceful. the tiny house had everything we needed. the only thing I would recommend for the peeps that want to sleep in...white noise and eye mask (for the sweet early morning birds and sunshine coming in). The tiny house is so cute and well-kept. Definitely stay here when you come to COMO!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Thank you for a pleasant stay. Your bohemian tiny home was just as described. It was a great place to take a rest on our long road trip.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Surprisingly spacious for a tiny house! The backyard is like a wild, secret garden! I loved it so much and my hosts were super friendly. I went downtown and walked around the local coffee shops and vintage clothing stores. Will definitely be back."

2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"very cute with everything needed for an overnight on trip, jane very nice, also recommend broadway brewery"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The tiny house was accurately described‚Ä¶.it is tiny, but suited our long weekend trip. The place was decorated very cute. We had plans most of the weekend so we didn‚Äôt get to stay too long. It was very clean and I was very surprised with the chilly weather we had how warm the heaters heated up the place. The only thing that was a very small minor issue was the smell of strong cleaning solvents the first evening. But I would rather have that then a place that wasn‚Äôt cleaned thoroughly. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend again. Thanks Jane and Dan!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful and cozy. Jane thought of everything and had very thorough instructions. As well as coffee, tea, water, bathroom products and information about stuff to do in Columbia
Its in the backyard of someones house in a quiet neighborhood, so you do need to be very aware of making noise. Also of any products you use, as they use the grey water for their plants. So everything has to be biodegradable"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great value and location, a quick $10 Uber to downtown Columbia."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perhaps I‚Äôm new to tiny houses but this was one of the coolest things I‚Äôve ever seen. A very tidy, warm space with everything you need and a little more (I personally enjoyed the french press coffee). Bathroom is inside the tiny house and perfectly functional‚Äîwater pressure and hot water all tip-top. Best part, though, is kind hosts and the thoughtfulness that goes into the space."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My fiance and I loved our stay. it was so comfortable and perfect for our visit to town for medical appointments. The place is clean, easy to find, easy check in and out, and perfect with communication."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My partner and I's stay here was great. The tiny home was charming and comfortable. They had an environmentally friendly waste system (compostable toilet and a shower that all fed into their garden water supply). The location was great. Everything was incredible.

We all had a great time celebrating my daughters graduation from Mizzou. Overall, it was a great stay. Thank You:)"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the third time I've stayed at Vanessa's place. As always, it was very comfortable and perfect for experiencing Columbia. Will certainly look to stay here again in the future!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you‚Äôre looking for a place in downtown Columbia, the lofts are a top notch choice in terms of location, the space, and bang for your buck. Highly recommended!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely loft-style apartment really appealed to our 19 yr old and her parents! Really handy for visiting our son at MU, restaurants and bars. Vanessa was unfailingly helpful and delightful to deal with."
2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The loft was very nice, and it was clean. The brick and old wood floors were charming and comfortable. Everything was as described and we did not hear street noise, which is important to us. Vanessa was responsive the few times we reached out. Our one issue, and it was considerable for us, is that the king bed in the master room has a broken frame which caused a deep dip down the middle of the bed which made sleeping fairly uncomfortable. We did let Vanessa know about this the first morning after we slept in the bed, and she did come over while we were gone and placed some towels under in an attempt to even out the bed, but that did now work. The problem was a severely bent bed frame and as a result we did not sleep well any of the 6 nights we stayed. If the frame gets fixed this would be a very pleasant place to stay and it would have earned a 5 star review. Also, the blinds in the several large windows do not work and cannot be turned up, and as a result light is not deflected well."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Will definitely book again! Another outstanding stay at Jessica's place. Super caring, responsive, friendly, and proactive host. Before we arrived, Jessica contacted us to explain that she had just found some damage to the TV from the previous stay (the day before). Not a big deal to us but the explanation and options offered were appreciated and courteous. We had a couple small needs (more TP) during our stay and again, Jessica was extremely responsive and handled them right away. We have stayed here twice when attending events at the Mizzou Aquatic Center, which is a nice easy walk. Private off-street parking is included! Downtown is just outside so there is great walkability to restaurants & entertainment. Note: there is occasional street noise & a bit of light due to the proximity to downtown, not a problem for us, but if you're sensitive a white noise app or sleep mask (good travel items even in hotels or wherever you go) may be useful."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our son attends Mizzou so we come down a lot. We are a family that loves to go to the bars so this location was phenomenal for getting around downtown and campus. The old warehouse vibe creates a truly unique experience. I'd honestly say this is one of the best VRBOS we have ever stayed at and I will be rebooking here whenever I can. Can't thank the host enough...thank you!!!!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay in Columbia, and Vanessa wasa terrific host. The loft was modern andclean, and the location within easy walking distance of both the campus and downtown area."

We enjoyed breakfast from Uprise Bakery almost every day; Ragtag movies at night ‚Äî plus time to chill in the loft when we needed the downtime.
Vanessa went above and beyond for us ‚Äî it was Thanksgiving week & she made a special Target run so we‚Äôd have a rolling pin for all the pies!! Vanessa is so thoughtful ‚Äî best host ever!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Vanessa's place was great! This is the second time I've stayed here and will certainly look to stay here again. Very clean and comfortable and you certainly can't beat the location.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My friends and I enjoyed staying at Vanessa‚Äôs place for a ‚Äòmoms night‚Äô and to see a concert. Vanessa‚Äôs instructions for parking and check-in were very thorough. Her place was immaculate and exactly what we expected. There were plenty of places to eat and drink nearby. We saw a concert at the Rose Park and were able to walk even though it was about 15 minutes from her place. We would stay again in a heartbeat next time we come out to CoMo!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I am very familiar with the area, so I really like the fact that it is so close to both Columbia's downtown, and the University. The weather for very nice, so I could walk to all of my favorite places. I was in Columbia to interview potential candidates for my company, and I could also walk to some of the meetings on campus."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Really nice loft apartment if your doing anything in downtown Columbia. Very comfortable and attractive space. Would absolutely stay here again!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Vanessa's place while dropping our daughter off for her freshman year at Mizzou. The location was super convenient to her dorm - literally down the street - and I was excited to realize it was also next door to Flat Branch Bar & Grill, a restaurant we'd enjoyed during a previous visit to campus. The apartment is super convenient to loads of other restaurants, shops, the Mizzou campus and the MKT trail. We appreciated the included parking and the walkability of amenities.
The unit itself is a great space! The beds and couch were all super comfortable, and we loved having some room to stretch out after maneuvering around our daughter's tiny dorm room during the day :) While we didn't do any cooking, we did notice that the kitchen was well stocked to do so (and we were very grateful for the coffee, filters and coffee maker provided.)
We hope to rent Vanessa's place again for future visits down to Mizzou."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, comfortable, and convenient. Enjoyed breakfast at the diner across the street and dinner at the brewpub next door."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place right in town. Host is great. Large open space with everything you need. Can‚Äôt wait to stay there again when I am back.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"The apartment is clean and stylish. Perfect for our girls night away. Easy walk to several restaurants, shops and coffee spots. Vanessa had a few extras in the bathroom like nicer shampoo and conditioner and the bed and pillow made for a sound sleep for all of us! I will definitely stay at Vanessa‚Äôs apartment or other properties if the opportunity arises."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The perfect walkable location to both downtown and the Mizzou campus. Exactly as pictured. A great home base for our weekend in CoMo!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was in a centrally located spot in a college town. Very easy to get around by car and on foot. Safe parking area for tenants and the unit was like home for us. Airy, sunny and spacious. It was quiet even with Flat Branch Pub traffic (which is steps from the front door. Cannot miss this for some really great food. The day I left I spoke to some employees about the BBQ sauce and when I packed up the car there was a note on my windshield to stop by and knock on the door. They packed me up some sauce to take home). There was nothing but kindness from everyone we met. Glenn's place has great shrimp creole (and mac n cheese if you have kiddos). Sparky's was amazing for ice cream and we found a great spot for bagels and drinks for breakfast. All of these locations were within 4 blocks. Lots of shops but closed due to the holiday even on a monday. There are alot of outdoor activities as well. We took a short hike to the Devil's Ice Box but there is much more to explore"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I took my Mother and Wife to see Tab Benoit at The Blue Note this weekend. I found this loft to be within walking distance to the venue, and it looked nice so I rented it for the night. And let me just say, the pictures posted here don't do this loft justice. It's very beautiful and elegant, even more so in person. Vanessa really nailed it on this one! The view of downtown is superb, the old wood floors are exquisitely well preserved and honestly, set the tone for this property. It's also like a modernized barn feel inside. Just Gorgeous! There are so many wonderful places to eat and experience within walking distance. The next time we plan a trip to Columbia, we are definitely going to be renting one of Vanessa's excellent locations! 11 out of 10 stars! Thanks for allowing us the pleasure of staying here! We really enjoyed our stay!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Vanessa's place is a GEM! The loft itself was beautiful and we could not have asked for a better location. Everything was in walking distance - shops, restaurants, etc.
Vanessa's instructions were precise, and she was attentive - ensuring that we had all we needed during our stay. This will definitely be my go-to place (if available) for my future visits to COMO now that my daughter will be attending MIZZOU. We really loved the place!!
I definitely recommend it!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here over my brother‚Äôs wedding weekend, and I can‚Äôt tell you how many times we said we were so grateful to be staying at this Airbnb throughout the weekend. we even had my brothers groomsmen get ready and take pictures in the loft, and it was perfect.
The loft was so convenient, spacious and well located. During the times where I was busy with wedding stuff, my husband was able to walk around to local restaurants and even became buddies the guys at Flat Branch next door. Vanessa was an exceptional host, very responsive and flexible.
It did not feel like a college town apartment, and this place will for sure be my go to spot to stay next time we are in Como!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"We needed a place to crash for a wedding in town and I had not been to Columbia, MO before. I was looking for a place downtown so we could explore the town a bit and this was an awesome location to do so. Fun restaurants and bars in walking distance and coffee shops galore! The AC worked (which was needed in humid and hot MO) and the bed was comfortable. The wifi was glitchy but other than that it was a nice quick stay!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Vanessa‚Äôs place was a perfect spot for our short visit to Columbia. We could walk to all the great spots downtown and to the campus easily. The space was clean, and Vanessa was responsive and helpful. Would recommend to any CoMo visitors!"

Perfect for a college visit and/
Or game day!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Vanessa was a consummate Airbnb host. Pictures were an accurate portrayal of the place, which was lovely and included amenities that made our stay comfortable (towels, linens, dishes, pots/pans, toiletries, etc.). We ended up meeting her in person on the property over the weekend, and she was so friendly and welcoming. The condo is situated perfectly in Columbia - walking distance to the MU campus, downtown and the Columbia trail system, which is arguably the city's most beautiful assets with it's wooded paths that wind throughout the entire city - perfect for our long runs!
Thank you, Vanessa, for being so responsive, professional and transparent as a host. We would happily do business with you again for all of our future stays in Columbia (which are a lot)! :)"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay in CoMo! We will be book here again! Vanessa's loft is a super cool space, walkable, hip, clean, and comfortable. The location is primo - just SW of downtown and adjacent to campus - so much nearby. We had Mizzou university events and were able to walk everywhere. Off-street parking is nice. Host was very responsive, friendly, and accommodating. Street noise was not a problem. (That is listed in the description, and I suppose it's possible on weekends given the location, but you're 15'+ above street level and any noise is well worth the location.)"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Vanessa is a wonderful host with a property that‚Äôs even roomier than it looks in the photos. The location is perfect for walking to downtown. Very responsive and great communication.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is by far the best Airbnb I have ever stayed in. I grew up in Columbia and I had no idea there was this cool of an apartment so close to all the action. The place itself was the pinnacle of comfort and utility. The couch and bed were both so comfortable I took turns sleeping on them at night. The internet was great so I was able to work the whole time. The tv was monstrous with access to whatever you want to watch.
It was really cold one of the days and I was dreading having to go outside. Unfortunately, the batteries for the remote had died. I contacted the owner to ask if they had batteries on the property and unfortunately they did not. I was gearing up to make the couple block trek to find some, and before I could they had dropped some off for me‚Ä¶ with a hooded sweatshirt to help keep me warm. I‚Äôm not suggesting the owner can or will go out of their way every time, but this was a level of service and kindness I haven‚Äôt seen many times. 10/10 would rent again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Vanessa was awesome and even gave us opportunity to arrive early if we were in the area. Super proactive and accommodating from the start.

It was tastefully and thoughtfully decorated, as well as being extremely well-stocked with everything we could imaginably need for our stay. The host even welcomed our dogs with a dog bed, clean water set out in a cute water dish when we arrived and even a poop scooper in the fenced backyard.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,It was Avery nice house. Well maintained and we would like to stay there again sometime if we make it back to Columbia. We wish we found this house earlier when our daughter was first a student at Mizzou
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Ellen‚Äôs place was the most child-friendly place we‚Äôve had the opportunity to stay in through Airbnb. Our toddler loved the bunk bed and the other fun things in the child bedroom. There were also outlet covers already installed, so we didn‚Äôt have to fuss installing our own. Finally, there was plenty of open space for our kiddo to work off his never ending supply of energy. We‚Äôll definitely keep Ellen‚Äôs place in mind for future visits, and we wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to stay again."

The beds were comfortable and there was enough room to sit together in the living room and watch a movie!

While you can‚Äôt walk to much, I would stay here again for a Mizzou football weekend."

2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,When arriving at the Airbnb we liked it. There was a few minor things that came up while being there. I reach out to the owners and they were very attentive. I was concerned about my family getting ticks. There was three of us that got them. They said they would get that taken care of after our stay. The owners mentioned getting protection that would help keep them away. Other than that it was a nice place to stay and it met our needs.

The property was much larger than we anticipated as well! The living room and kitchen is a nice, open floor plan and feels very homey.

Everything was as advertised, but it was the very thoughtful little touches that made our stay extraordinary. Fluffy white towels and more of them than we could possibly use, but it was nice to have the option. Gorgeous and comfortable sheets and bed linens‚Ä¶comparable to a high end hotel. Desks in both bedrooms with a notepad and pen thoughtfully provided. Throws in both bedroom and on the sofa. Luggage racks and ample closet space. Fully equipped kitchen and laundry. Communication was excellent. I Will definitely be back!"

We will stay here again"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home was fantastic! We were in town for a Mizzou campus visit and stayed for the TN game. The neighborhood is older and less afluent, but Tom has done a wonderful job updating the home, inside and out! Great curb appeal with the adorable landscaping. Sets a great tone when you pull in the driveway. Then going in the home, we immediately felt welcome and comfortable. Very clean and comfortable. The amenities provided are some of the best we've seen at a property rental - nice closet set up, abundance of towels, chargers (electrical and USB) on each bedside, and plenty of mirrors. These might be small things, but they make a big difference for the guest. Also, there was a very cute snack basket, plenty of coffee/tea, and other non-perishable condiments. Water bottles provided in the refrigerator, a full tray of ice, and large square ice cubes were a plus! Also, washer/dryer and supplies available. Tom communicated extremely well. Would highly recommend and stay again!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely perfect in every regard. We travel on a regular basis and usually stay at an Airbnb. This was, by far, the cleanest, most comfortable, and most welcoming home we‚Äôve ever stayed at. Easily the best Airbnb experience we‚Äôve ever had. The entire house has been recently remodeled with high quality materials and beautiful detailed touches. There were snacks left for us and drinks in the fridge, there was a detailed binder with all of the property details, local recommendations for food and entertainment, and fast Wi-Fi. The check in and check out times were very gracious. Everything we could have possibly needed had been accounted for. The home was located very close to the colleges and downtown but on an extremely quiet street with great privacy. The beds were incredibly comfortable with high quality mattresses and thick, soft, fluffy comforters. Tons of extra towels and excellent toiletries provided.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tom's place is the new threshold that all future AirBnB rentals will be judged against. Tom thought of everything. K-cups available, Kleenex throughout, charging stations next to each bed, little hotel bottles of shampoo and such (instead of sharing some Suave with previous renters), stacks and stacks of towels, goodies on the counter and in the fridge. This man knows how to do things right!!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Our first lengthy stay (6 weeks) in an AirBnb home and our best ever. Tom's bungalow was squeaky clean and contained everything we needed. The bungalow was beautifully decorated and there were plenty of supplies. Tom himself was so friendly and responded to all of our questions immediately. The dishwasher wasn't working properly so Tom replaced it while we were there! I can recommend Tom's bungalow for short- or long-term stays in Columbia.

The living room is nicely arranged and comfortable while the dining room table easily fits six adults. The kitchen (including the oven) was immaculately clean with plenty of pot and pans for cooking. We did have an issue with the dishwasher. Less than a week before checkout, it stopped working and even though Tom tried to fix it, it would be a week before anyone would be able to come check it out. We also had a problem with the television, and Tom came right over and got it working for us. The beds are comfortable. The bathroom is small but well appointed, and the large shower is luxurious. The house is in an older neighborhood, but it was quiet. Downtown and shopping are convenient. We would definitely stay at Tom's house again."

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a great stay and everything was a smooth process from booking to checking out. The house was completely remodeled and you can tell. Everything is brand new and nice. It was very close to Mizzou Arena for our event and other attractions. The street is quite for being in a city and you can easily enjoy a evening or morning on the porch in the rocking chairs. We felt very safe there. The only suggestion was a few board games or some cards for some entertainment if you wanted to stay in. The beds where beyond comfortable and we never wanted to get out of them. We felt like we where in a 5 star hotel. Tom was easily accessible if we had any issues and he checked on us during our stay as well. I would gladly recommend to anyone staying in the Columbia area.

Tom was always courteous and responsive, and it was such a treat to meet him by chance! He and his wife have certainly created a home away from home that should not be missed."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Super cute place and perfect for my week in town. Super close to downtown and the host is great.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Tom‚Äôs Airbnb was amazing and he was such a gracious host! We loved the snacks, the books, and all the amazing art work (there‚Äôs tons of signed pieces and I was surprised by how good some of the local writing was - incredible)!
We were staying here to be close to family and really loved the location as well. Small caveat is that my friends in Columbia said our place was in the bad part of town, but I must say that we never once felt that, and we walked downtown and to coffee shops a couple times a week.
Tom was working next door most of our stay and would make himself available there or via the airbnb chat if we had questions. We discovered he and his daughter used to own a restaurant in Denver (where we were visiting from) and he seemed like a very cool person. Looking forward to coming back!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great location, very clean, quiet neighborhood, comfortable, you can qualify for a degree in art after reading all of the books in the house. The snacks were a nice plus."

The owner really thinks of everything too. We wanted for nothing and had absolutely no complaints. Enjoy!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We love this place! This small house has been updated in every possible way and Tom made excellent choices with regards to EVERYTHING. From the architectural changes to the lighting, paint, appliances and decor. Just perfect. Included during our stay were lots of nice touches like snacks, a few beverages and plenty of clean towels. It snowed a bit during our stay and Tom showed up early the next day to make sure the driveway and sidewalks were cleared away. What a great host!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This property is one of my favorites and I've stayed in a lot of AirBnB's around the globe. The design, renovations and beautiful interior design simply make you feel good. And the location is convenient to any restaurant or event that you'd like to attend. One of my favorite things about this property is the fact that when you are settings things up and communicating with Tom, you soon find out that he's the owner. He and his wife completely designed and renovated this place. I consider Central Bungalow my home away from Austin, TX. I rate it 5 stars!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"What a gem! If you get the chance and it is available during your dates--don't hesitate to book! You will be amazed.

All of the amenities, easy access to downtown, and our hosts were super quick to respond to any and all questions/requests! Would definitely recommend and will be back!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This place is absolutely beautiful. I stayed here for 2 1/2 months in 2020. The area was surprisingly peaceful. Tom is an amazing host. He and his wife thought of everything, and they also offered to bring me anything else I may of needed. I would definitely stay at again."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is amazing! Every single thing in this bungalow is wonderful. Beautiful furnishings (all new!) and artwork throughout the entire place, and it was sparkling clean. The bed was very comfortable; the shower in the bathroom was impressive. Location is great too.
Tom was a great host; our daughter‚Äôs apartments were not ready and he let us check in early. He responded to all communications promptly. We will definitely stay here again and I encourage anyone who is traveling to Columbia to book here.

Vanessa suggested visiting Caf√© Berlin and Uprise Bakery, and both places did not disappoint. These recommendations were a delightful touch that added local flavor to my visit. The loft, with its perfect blend of comfort and style, provided a peaceful retreat after a day of exploring. Its central location made getting around the city a breeze, and the space itself reminded me of a chic NYC studio ‚Äì full of charm and character.
What made my stay especially enjoyable was Vanessa's attention to detail and hospitality. The loft was well-equipped with everything needed for a comfortable stay, and Vanessa's communication was prompt and helpful throughout.
I highly recommend Vanessa's loft to anyone looking for a unique and cozy stay!"

We were unable to figure out how to use the Ninja grill, so we were not able to dine in the home at all, but this was likely user error! Make sure you know how to use the device if you plan to cook at home. Otherwise, the stay was wonderful. Michelle is very clear in her listing that this is the top half of the back apartment, connected to her home. The photos are clearly labeled as ""only to help with directions."" However since the listing title says that it's the Entire Home, make sure you understand what you are booking!"

There was easy entry and access to the hiway making it convenient. We didn't have time to venture downtown but we did make a late night trip to the closest Walmart a few miles away. Upon arriving at early nighttime and driving through the neighborhoods as well as when driving to Walmart, we did have concerns of the safety of the area, which unfortunately impacted our ability to relax and enjoy the evening and comfort of the stay. Our worries may have been completely unfounded, but I would encourage renters to become informed about the local neighborhoods.."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house reminds me of the house where my wife and I lived during Grad School, before moving from CoMo.

Although I didn‚Äôt stay very long, I think the price is worth it. Off street parking was nice since it is a busy college area. I would definitely stay again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stylish and comfortable place. Truly a home away from home. The bungalow is walkable to all of CoMo's downtown attractions and campus but far enough away from the hoopla to sleep soundly throughout the night.
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Everything was as described. A super cute house and very clean. However, the bed did not do it for me:/ and the living room set up was a bit odd with the two porch chairs rather than a couch, but other than that everything was fine."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this place! It was so cozy and private. The kitchen was BEAUTIFUL! Check in instructions were clear and easy and the place was exactly as described. Price is kind of unbeatable for it being completely to yourself. No TV as the listing states so we brought our own but since the house is a bit older, most of the outlets can only support 2-prong plug ins! If you‚Äôre bringing a TV I‚Äôd suggest bringing an extension cord that can plug into a 2-prong outlet :)"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great house and very clean. We enjoyed our stay and will be back!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,My husband and I had a great time staying here! I was happy the bungalow allowed animals to make travel arrangements super easy as we have two toy aussies.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great location. We were able to walk to the arcade district and downtown easily. The place is set up nice and welcoming.
Just a note, because we missed it and it was obviously on the description and pictures. There is not a TV, couch, or actual shower. Just be aware, if you are like me and just assume. But you cannot beat the location.
Also the internet was very spotty for two people trying to work."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I had a great time at this house! Only stayed one night but the convenience of staying here vs a hotel is worth it to me. Much cleaner and flexible. Thanks for the early check in and seamless stay. Will stay again when I visit my son who lives in Columbia.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Loved this place! Beautifully decorated and we slept great!! Mark and Danielle were very helpful, accommodating and responsive. However, I would be remiss if I didn‚Äôt mention that the Adirondack chairs and bathing situation is not the best if you have weak knees or back issues.
All that said, it is still one of the top Airbnb‚Äôs we‚Äôve stayed at in Missouri‚Ä¶and we‚Äôve stayed at many :)"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We live 4-5 hours away and had to come up for an emergency surgery for one of our dogs. I booked as soon as I knew but it was very last minute.

Very close by the University but still far enough away from.traffic areas.. Mark was very communicative and responsive in our back and forth communications. The house is very nice. The kitchen was usable and accessible and the details were great. The bedroom was in the back of the house which provided a lot of privacy and coziness. After a long day of driving in cold conditions it was an absolute great experience to use the upgraded design deep tub. The house's exterior surroundings and the area next to the rental were safe and easy access for my dogs

However, beware there are a lot of noisy neighbors. There‚Äôs a bird scooter drop on the corner and what appears to be college kids all around. Our dogs were kept up all night which kept us up. A TV would be a big help to drown out music.

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location for riding different parts of the Katy Trail each day.
This house offers an excellent value with off street parking and a very comfortable bed. It was really nice to have a pet friendly place to stay. The soaking tub is awesome.
All the appliances and bathroom fixtures are upgraded and new.
The area is safe and left our bikes locked to our vehicle with no problems.
Thanks for a great stay in Columbia MO"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a very nice place to stay. It‚Äôs close to things to do or a cozy night in. Love the house and the style.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mark‚Äôs place is tastefully decorated and the perfect place to stay while you are visiting Columbia, MO. It has all the required amenities and is located very close to downtown and Mizzou campus."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The 1920s House was very cute & clean. We definitely got a few modern design ideas for our own arts n crafts home :) Overall, the house was very clean and well appointed. Loved the Euro kitchen and the view out past the cool tree to the neighbor's sweet little garden- was such a nice way to start the day. It rained like crazy when we were there... We enjoyed stepping out onto the big porch to watch the storm blow by :) Bed was comfy and again... just nice touches thru out. Check in was easy and Mark ALWAYS responded quickly to any questions we had :) It is a not far from the highway and relatively close to downtown. Was exactly 1 mile to our daughter's dorm- so a quick drive :)
For those who care, there is no TV. But there is great wifi. We didn't find that to be a problem for us. We brought our own games to play so TV time or lack there of isn't a deal break for us at all. Just an FYI to others.
Lastly, the living room is exactly as shown in the fotos with a couple of Adirondack chairs. Altho the chairs not totally uncomfortable.. they are difficult or tedious to climb in/out of over and over again even for little yogis like me. Therefore, for those w/ mobility issues or those wanting to just cuddle up on a small sofa w/ their family to chat or even to sit alone to read a book.. that isn't really an option. Keeping that in mind... This is a sweet little house to consider for the next time you stay in Columbia :-)"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was an amazing stay! I stayed here with my dog while in town for work. Mark left a basket with supplies for my dog which was so kind and thoughtful. The home was beautiful and updated and very clean! I would recommend this home to anyone visiting Columbia!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super little spot. Clean, super close to all things university and downtown. Nice (unfenced) yard for the dogs, great porch to hang out and enjoy the rain storms on!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean, reasonably priced, Yard space for my dog and a great soaking tub!"
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mark and co-host Danielle are kind and accommodating, and their space is stylish, clean, and quite roomy, and the location is really convenient for walking downtown. My partner's take: it was a place he was glad to return to after a day of exploring CoMO. Overall, we enjoyed our stay, but there are a few things I wish I had known before booking, so here I'll just mention these things.
First, there's no shower, in the sense that you're probably used to--there's a nice tub (with great insulation for long baths) with a spray wand, but if you want to ""shower"" (e.g., after a long sweaty bike ride), you have to figure out how to do this while sitting in the tub (or with one hand while standing and not accidentally spraying water out of the tub? because there's no curtain).
Second, unfortunately, the house has blinds in every window except for the bathroom window, so if you like privacy in the bathroom, you should think of booking elsewhere. Finally, a few things I wished I had brought with me include (1) my own pillow (pillows were thin and sparse), and (2) tissues (only toilet paper and paper towels were provided).
I will also just mention that I booked this place--listed as ""pet friendly""--hoping that my partner and I could travel with our two cats, in case we didn't find a sitter. However, this space is not really pet-friendly, in the sense that the hosts require pets stay crated whenever they are not monitored, and that they never sit on furniture, which isn't a realistic expectation regarding pet behavior, even for very well-behaved cats. In the end, I'm glad we found the sitter instead."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A lovely bungalow close to all of the treasure of Columbia, MO. Everything you could possibly need was provided. The bath tub is a real treat!"

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable, well appointed, great location, and all at a great price!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great value.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was as described and was very clean. The bathtub was amazing! There was not, however, a good hang out space as it was too cold to sit on the unheated enclosed porch. Would be much better during warmer weather."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place at a great price! Mark and Danielle's bungalow was awesome- we sat on the enclosed back porch each morning for coffee and breakfast as the sun came up, and it was incredible. We were able to walk to downtown Columbia in less than 5 minutes and enjoy the breakfast places and nightlife. We will definitely be staying there this Fall!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Super cute and cozy space! It was the perfect amount of space and the area was very quiet and calm. The house was decorated so nice and it had everything we could've needed for our stay. Danielle was also very communicative and quick to respond, and checkin was a breeze!Thanks so much!"

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place and location. We enjoyed our night and had a wonderful rest. You can walk to nearby college park, and coffee shops"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"So, much, SPACE. Leg room all around and the layout is super easy to navigate. The aesthetic is appealing, homey, and artsy!! It made the stay super comfortable for me and my dog. That bathtub is probably the cherry on top of the whole experience with the full bedroom and adorable kitchen. Maybe one day in a warmer season I'll be able to enjoy the porch area but that was also very inviting even with the winter weather! Thank you to the communicative and helpful hosts!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved this house! Such a cute home. Would definitely recommend it
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"AWESOME DREAMY TUB!

2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great spot, in walking distance to downtown. The apartment was clean and comfortable. Loved the bathtub and bonus oatmeal/tea in the kitchen drawer. Communications from hosts was excellent and I'd gladly stay again! Thanks for a great visit!"
,,,"Upon arrival, the owners house appeared unkempt. Making my way to the backyard where the airbnb was was over run with plants and had unsure footing.
The airbnb itself could use some cleaning and updating. The tiny house had some strong odors which included the composting toilet and maybe some mold/mildew. The main floor futon bed was very uncomfortable. The pillows had no protective cover on them, only a pillowcase.
I had booked a two night stay but ended up leaving early, after one night, due to allergies and overall discomfort."
,,,I just cannot support a positive review.
