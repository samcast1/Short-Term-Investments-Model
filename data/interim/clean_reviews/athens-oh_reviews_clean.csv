Parking space for Unit 1 is directly behind the building and is a tight space, may not be suitable for trucks or large vehicles. The apartment is very spacious with high ceilings and bright lighting from the front window. The front wall lets some sound in so you will hear people walking by occasionally, or you may hear the apartment upstairs coming down the stairwell next to the front door.

2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Michelle was an excellent host and the house was perfect for our needs. The house will indeed accommodate up to 3 guests. My only complaint (seems a bit trivial) was that the fold-out couch wasn't flat and left me a bit restless. Best perhaps for a child or heavy sleeper who doesn't mind an uneven sleeping surface.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a great find! Clean cute and spacious and very close to the Ohio University campus. A great value and Michele was a perfect host. Great communication and loved all the amenities she provided for a comfy stay! Looking forward to my next stay!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the convenient location and the cute decor!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very sweet place to stay when visiting Athens. Michele was an excellent host. I highly recommend this place.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We would definitely recommend staying at Michele’s place. It was comfortable, cozy and just as described. Thanks again for a wonderful stay 😊"

2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place to stay!!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great spot for a trip to athens! It’s a little off campus but can definitely be walkable especially in the warmer months. The place is cozy and was better than I thought it would be. Very clean and had all the accommodations you’d want. Definitely recommend!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,this spot is amazing! right near the campus and close to basically everything you’ll need while there! Michelle was very communicative and an outstanding host! will definitely come back!

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My son and spent 2 nights here while visiting Ohio University- perfect location - spotless unit - friendly and attentive hosts.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michele was prompt, polite, and just overall very pleasant."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a nice little place close to the university. The kitchen had a few drinks and some snacks. Michele was very responsive and gave great instructions.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, cozy place. Heads up, there is (best I could tell) only one heat output vent and it’s in the bedroom; that means the bedroom stays very warm, and the living room area doesn’t. This was not a big deal, though. The fridge had a few drinks and even a small carton of ice cream! I would definitely stay there again!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was great! It was in a really good location in Athens and was private, spacious, and very well equipped. Would recommend and stay again ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
2021-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The place is very clean, and super close to OU. The host is super thoughtful, there's even hair ties in the bathroom in case you are like me and are always looking for one. :) Just be aware of the road noise and furnace noise if you are a light sleeper."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved staying here! Nice, quiet cabin. Responded to all questions promptly. Definitely close to OU, perfect for family weekend visits or just diving into the beauty of Athens."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Property was exactly as listed, check in was easy, no issues whatsoever !"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cute place! I travel for work and booked Michele’s place because of convenience and the price was great. This little apartment is so cute & cozy, I loved my stay here. Michele sent very clear instructions on checking in making it a breeze! There were waters, sodas and other beverages in the fridge which was a great find when I needed a bottle of water in the middle of the night. The bed was super cozy, everything was clean and tidy. Will likely stay here again!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a nice apartment and super convenient location!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As described, close to OU, extremely clean!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb was exactly as shown in the pictures, no surprises, and was a great stay. The host was very courteous and responded quickly to any questions I had."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,This is our third visit and it was as enjoyable as the first two. The bnb is in a great location and met all of our needs for the 10 days we were in Athens.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was my third week+ visit to Becky’s Sunroom Loft, so that should be an endorsement in itself. The studio is always a wonderful option for staying in Athens, especially ideal for hiking in Strouds Run. It’s a beautifully designed space, extremely light and airy with windows on all sides (featuring views into the treetops) and adorned with bright artwork and potted plants. Communication with Becky is always prompt and friendly, and the loft is always very clean on arrival. What makes the Sunroom Loft truly stand out, in my opinion, is how much Becky and Chris use the Airbnb to promote other Athens artists and artisans — walls covered in paintings by local artists, a canister of coffee from a local roaster, to be consumed in coffee mugs from a local artist, etc."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Had a great time here and was enchanted by the stay.
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The studio apartment is very impressive and well designed. But this whole house makes the strangest and loudest noises. I have no idea what causes this loud, constant vibration. You can feel it and hear it. Not sure how the regular occupants live with it, but they’re probably used to it by now. Their two dogs barked very loudly and constantly until I asked if something could be done, and the host was very responsive, and the dogs were pretty quiet for the rest of my two day stay."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Becky’s place is wonderful. Felt right at home and very relaxing. Was just what we needed for a few days in Athens! Hope to return soon!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It is a beautiful space. Cutely decorated and very clean. I especially liked the shower. It was a great rain showerhead!!
The hosts were very responsive and even helped us get a ride when we needed one. The price per night was a little high, but Athens is tough on a busy weekend and I was willing to pay it, and didn’t regret it one bit."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great few days here. Great space, comfortable bed, workspace so I could work while I was there and space for my pup."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place in a great town. It's damn near a ski in/ski out place to some of the finest brown powder that Athens has to offer. Becky was a great host, very communicative and reachable and rooted in the community. The place celebrates local art and culture and is for sure on our list of places to repeat."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Close to everything; nice little trail at the end of street
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved it!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our second stay here and the accommodations were great. Our host proactively communicated and a very minor issue was addressed within minutes. We will be back.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was cozy & perfect for a quick getaway from home.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a clean, peaceful, and relaxing spot. Communication was excellent with quick responses. The sofa and bed were really comfortable and I was able to get good sleep. Thanks, Becky! Hope to see you next time!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,What a gem of a place!! We loved staying in this treetop home with little white lights where local artisans featured their artwork. I am motivated to go home and live more simply. We had everything we needed there. Becky even provided a soft bed and grain free treats for our pups. We loved our stay
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place and super friendly and responsive host! I will definitely book in the future!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lovely stay! The space is exactly as advertised. Becky responded quickly anytime I had a question and even let me know that there was a dog bed in the closet for my pup to use! The space is connected to their living space so some sound does travel between the two. Location is awesome. I loved the neighborhood: quiet and far enough from campus that you don’t have to deal with “college kids,” but close enough to get uptown without it being a hassle! Definitely will stay again!"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The Place was quiet, relaxing, clean and well appointed. It rather felt like you were staying in the trees. Parking was easy and it was a short drive to downtown."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Becky was a great host. The location was good - an easy drive into town or about a 40 minute walk to mid-Court street. The loft was clean, spacious, and had great amenities including art from local artists. Highly recommend."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice great location, quite and hassle free will book again when in Athens!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Becky and Chris's Sunny Studio is a beautiful, light and airy loft with attention to detail. Well equipped kitchen and bathroom. Comfy bed and living room. They feature local artisan products to try and buy. Loved their delightful decor and how ""at home"" you felt. :)"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a lovely stay in this quiet and walkable neighborhood in Athens. The loft was bright and comfortable with minimal clutter and good amenities. The rainwater shower was a special treat. We will absolutely stay again!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here during OU family weekend and it was perfect! I was able to walk to campus(40 min walk). This place is very well done, very open and spacious with a lot of attention to making it cozy and welcoming. Would definitely stay again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet neighborhood close to trails. Well thought out accommodations. Easy check in. Fantastic, relaxing stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were visiting hocking hills and stayed here. it was close enough to hocking hills but the city of Athens had significantly more to offer in the evening once the area around hocking hills closed up. Beautiful little airbnb with all the necessary amenities.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely, easy, and clean. Thank you!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved it!
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The place was spotless. Decor was in good taste. Utilities all worked. AC stayed cool. My only issues would be with privacy. There is no curtains on some of the largest windows in the room, both of which are able to be seen through by other neighbors. The sound from the owners' living area effortlessly travels up the stairs, so it can be noisy when they have parties/events. Other than that, we enjoyed out stay very much!."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We have stayed at Becky’s twice now when visiting our daughter at OU. The location is excellent, close to the campus, Court St Coffee is close by on State St. with delicious coffee and “pup cups” for your dogs. We appreciated being able to bring our dogs and the neighborhood is so peaceful and walkable. We have seen several deer each visit. The loft is open, sunny, spotless, modern, and creatively decorated. We definitely recommend!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I highly recommend this rental. Hosts were very kind and their space was comfortable and clean. A+
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"really a charming studio, full kitchen (even though we just made coffee, which was supplied). Comfortable furniture, felt very organic. Do bring sleep mask if you're light sensitive like me (I always pack one) as some windows not shaded. Loved the leather barstool. Owner provided secure space to store our bikes overnight, much appreciated. Didn't have time to use enclosed porch or outdoor space, although it was provided. Recommend Little Fish Brewery and Eclipse (I think that was the name - on the bike path). Be sure to bike or walk around Ohio University, oldest public university in the Northwest Territory. It's a very pretty campus."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Truly lovely stay at Becky’s. Close to the highway, and easy access to Uptown Athens and State St area .. beautiful hiking trails at the end of the road, too!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Becky and Chris were great - awesome space in a fun house. New (or nearly brand new!) room with all sorts of interesting details which made it enjoyable with becoming overly distracting. Local artwork on the walls, hand made soap, plants in glass test tubes - just decorated in a style that I would aspire to but never achieve if I had my own house."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Private, comfortable and romantic setting!
The trailhead to some great hiking is less than 100 yards away!
Never heard a car or another person the whole time we were there.
It’s a healthy walk or a quick Uber to Uptown festivities.
Hassle-free, comfy and peaceful! What else could you ask for?"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful space, close to downtown activities. I would definitely recommend staying!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a very cute and clean studio! The bathroom was very clean and the shower was really nice! Also loved some of the soaps they had as well as art from local artists.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay. Easy to access in a cute neighborhood with a nearby park. Appreciated the local artwork, coffee, baskets, mugs, and soap that made you feel like a local. It is rare to find a space that has good pillows and toilet paper, but these hosts didn’t skimp. My one suggestion would be to turn on the air at noon before people check in— the day we arrived it was 90, we didn’t get there until 5p, and took until late into the evening to be comfortable. Once the place cooled down, there was no problems with the temp."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super comfortable and great, relaxed vibe. Clean and well-decorated with personal touches and great art. Comfortable bed and soft linens! Had to take an extra unneeded shower cuz the shower is amazing!!! We will be back."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We don’t remember how many times we’ve booked Becky’s sunroof stay. We are thrilled every time and we left feeling refreshed and inspired each time. Please don’t miss this great opportunity and get your bookings in early—they’re pretty darn popular here! ;-)
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Such a peaceful stay! With the plants, windows, natural light, & lofted ceilings, the unit has a wonderful vibe. Lots of care and intentionality clearly went into everything.
Bathroom is very nice, kitchen is well-equipped, and the neighborhood was very peaceful to walk our dog. There's also a trailhead just a couple blocks north.
Neighborhood is off of a busy road, but it felt calm up at the property. I'll also note that the stairs to the unit are fairly steep, but not an issue for anyone with full mobility.
Loved our stay, would definitely stay again if we come back to Athens!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the touches in this studio - original and authentic Athens. It was comfortable, quiet and clean. Becky and her husband were very sweet and helpful. We would definitely come back!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"You have to check out this place. It’s gorgeous! We’ve been returning here at least four times and we love our hosts Becky, Chris, Woody and Burnie!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great, cozy, welcoming place. Host was responsive and had great recommendations. Perfect place for a couple in the area for hiking or enjoying Athena."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place for your next visit to Athens! Everything was great.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Highly recommended! One of the prettiest Airbnbs in which I've stayed - open and full of light, views of trees through the windows, and adorned with local artwork and other local touches (including the delicious coffee and beautiful ceramic mugs). The neighborhood is quiet, and the proximity to Sells Park and the trails into Strouds Run can't be beat: I went hiking nearly every day. The Athens Community Center GoBus station is nearby, and I got along fine staying without a car. Becky was very responsive both on the Airbnb app and in person."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Second time staying in Becky’s beautiful sun rooftop! We enjoyed everything this airb&b has to offer, the room design, the plants and the light, the shower experience, and the location. Our host Becky is extremely knowledgeable for in-town recommendations and responsive to our needs. This place has been our favorite in town! Do check it out!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Becky’s place was wonderful. A perfect getaway to Athens where we were able to go on some great nearby hikes, eat good food, and enjoy a peaceful weekend. The room felt secure, private, was kept very clean and had all the right amenities. Finally, Becky was a wonderful host who was very responsive and accommodating to all of our needs. Would definitely recommend to anyone staying in the Athens area - thanks Becky!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay! Great location!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean and cozy space, perfect for what we needed. Quality linens which made for a great sleep. Nice shower and very comfortable living space. We would stay again if in the area!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great stay!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The property was neat, clean, and exactly as described. In better weather we would have enjoyed the sun room which was a nice touch. Delicious coffee was provided by the host, which made a great start to the morning. The bathroom had a large shower with washes and shampoos provided.
The bed/furniture was especially comfortable. Our brief interaction with our host Becky was a positive experience, as were the timely communications"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved out stay at Becky's place. So many thoughtful touches, truly a beautiful spot. Woke up to the sun streaming through the windows and birds chirping outside. Quiet and peaceful. Well appointed kitchen. We didn't realize ahead of time that there is a massive and gorgeous trail network about a block from the house, so that was a big bonus. Becky was extremely helpful and accommodating with a late checkout.
We had been a little worried about parking our camper on the street, but the neighborhood couldn't be more peaceful. We slept easy. One note is that the studio is upstairs from the home, and we could occasionally hear voices and activities from the house below. Not a problem for us, but it could be for someone who is looking for total seclusion/privacy. Overall, a magnificent place. We would stay here again in a heartbeat."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place. Would love to come again
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Becky and her partner are pro’s! We’ve stayed here twice now and plan to come back!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very comfortable, nice, lovely, well furnish, clean, trendy and contemporary place. I will stay here again."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay was nothing but amazing. Becky's space was beautifully designed and cultivated with lots of care and artful elements. We wish we could stay longer, but there is always the next time, right? Don't miss this opportunity to book their sun rooftop, at a very convenient location. We tried nice restaurants in town and toured around the Ohio University campus, and we looked forward to resting in their space in the evening! What a treat!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Really great space! Right next to sells park so good hiking access if desired. Very clean and easy to access. Easy communication. Would 100% recommend.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I mostly just needed a place to sleep at, and relax in my downtime during my trip. Woke up one day to hearing the rain loud and clear, it was quite peaceful. Quite a home-y place to stay and i will most definitely stay again for future trips!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Adorable place! Becky is very accommodating. Loved all the windows and openness of loft.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the sun. It did make for early rising as not all windows had blinds which was not a problem for us.
The bed was comfortable.
It was nice to be within walking distance of Strouds Run State Park. We hiked several trails there.
Look for BNB signs on house as there was not a house number we could find."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very cute place, exactly what we needed for two nights in Athens with our pup."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! Very close to campus. Had a list of local recommendations printed inside the unit. Very big shower. Everything was clean. They had coffee provided (huge plus for me!!).
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cozy and felt right at home. Everything was within arms reach and was very well organized. Would 10/10 recommend and would book again. Very friendly and responsive host.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing space, cozy will stay again …"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,The hosts were helpful and responsive if you ever need anything and the place was super clean and cute! We would definitely stay here again when going to Athens!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Becky’s stay was perfect! Cute little space to stay for the weekend. Would definitely recommend this spot as it’s close to Athen’s and campus!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Private upstairs, the unit looks exactly like the photos. It is even more spacious of what we thought.
The bed was big and super comfy, that was a big plus. I usually have back pain and I slept without any problems.
The host was very responsive at all times.
Getting in and out was easy."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean space! Felt super cozy and at home!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just great!
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Clean space and close to OU. The only issue we had was a cat tried to get inside when we opened the door and in the middle of the night the cat was clawing at the door trying to get inside for a long time. Besides that it was a good place to stay.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the best place to stay in Athens, OH. Period."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This space is beautiful and well taken care of. This is also a very convenient location. I highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Becky and Chris are awesome people, made us feel home and welcomed in Athens
I have never felt cared for by a landlord like they did.
Sending blessings their way
We enjoyed our stay, we would go back over and over.
Great location, privacy and clean room.
Loved it
Chipo &Rob"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Becky & Chris are super kind and caring hosts. They went above and beyond. Very responsive. The space was cozy and CLEAN!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Becky’s place was exactly as described. We had a wonderful little getaway. There were so many nice touches. Becky had a ton of helpful tips for the area on a clipboard and lots of nice artwork within the place. We had our pup and there was even the surprise of dog treats for us. We had everything we needed and would definitely come back.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, clean and comfy! Perfect for our visit to Athens!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb is amazing! It’s the cutest spot! Becky was very responsive, check in is super easy. The upstairs apartment was very clean and updated. I will definitely stay there again next time I’m in town!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"beautiful, well appointed space in a great location…bonus that a trailhead is in walking distance from the unit. the hosts provided extra touches that truly made this a wonderful stay."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Becky and Chris have a nice, cool place conveniently located near attractions. They’re very attentive hosts and I wouldn’t hesitate to stay again."
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Becky’s studio apartment is a lovely find. Decorated beautifully, very clean and comfortable. Communication was quick and helpful. It was tucked into a pleasant residential neighborhood that was well located, just a short drive to uptown and locally-owned restaurants and breweries. We were glad to meet one of Becky’s dogs, a sweetheart, and her indoor-outdoor cat, and a foster dog, too!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was very clean!
someplace everyone would enjoy."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved this stay while visiting my OU student. Hosts were great at communicating at all stages of our stay. Space was clean and fully equipped for us. I was able to easily work remote from provided Wi-Fi. Bed and linens were super comfortable. We will be back!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"really enjoyed my stay, very clean and overall nice unit! the hotels around can be outrageously priced at times so was very happy to find this place at a great price"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I almost didn't leave this review because I'd like to keep this little gem all for myself for future visits, but that's not nice so here you go: This place is awesome. It's an adorable loft space. Small but bright, cozy, comfortable. We have stayed at a few other Athens airbnbs and the OU Inn before and this space is hands down, the best and the best value. Bed is comfy and the shower is SO NICE. Rain shower head and wall shower head. Hot shower, big space. My freshman son didn't want to get out. Artwork on display by a local artists (very cool), handmade soap for sale (sample available), windows let in lots of light, big TV and reliable wifi. Close to campus, but I wouldn't say it's in walking distance unless you want to get a workout in. The neighborhood is super cool; love the vibe. I went for a walk one day and stumbled on the Zenner estate. I guess it was build in the 1920s for one of the wealthiest families in Athens? It's stunning! Less than a five-minute walk and you are in Sells Park...hiking paths and adjacent to Strouds Run State Park. I wanted to buy a house in this neighborhood after seeing it. We did not bring our dog but I'm glad we didn't only because he's old and the step to the loft space are very steep. They would have been impossible for him. Otherwise, I can see pets being fine in this space...just be aware if you have an old dog! Also, it wouldn't work for more than 2 guests unless the third person is ok with an air mattress. Overall, it was a great stay. We will be booking again, so please do not book your stay here when we want it for ourselves."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time I've stayed at Becky's place and it was just as great as the first time. It has so many adorable details, great amenities and is spotless! The house is super close to Ohio University...we walked to campus several times during our stay to enjoy all of the Family Weekend activities. I'm looking forward to my next visit and highly recommend Becky's place!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A lovely apartment. Spacious and comfortable. We quite enjoyed our stay. We always enjoy visiting Athens. This apartment was well located for us to get into the center of Athens while also providing for a quite retreat.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Loved this air bnb! It was perfect for my husband, dog, and I. It was clean and check in was easy!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this loft! It is every bit as lovely as it appears in the photos. Great location, lots of thoughtful touches, communicative host, easy check in/out. Definitely recommend and will stay again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a sunny, fresh-feeling Air BNB with some great hosts in an excellent location. We hope to be back soon!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great space for a single or couple. clean with unique amenities, well put together great vibes. No overwhelming requirements or demands on the guests. We loved the location, nice and quiet family oriented neighborhood, just off the main drag, minutes drive from any of the desired locations and attractions, including campus.
Whatever your reason for coming to Athens one would generally be familiar with what it has to offer so I will not review the area in general here.
Great hosts, responsive, but not trying to be a part of your life, however they are a part of the community and are great resources if you would like some input, and genuinely would made great company when the opportunity arose.
We plan on successive visits to the area, and hopefully back to this welcoming space."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,exactly as described. super cute and cozy and very thoughtfully designed. excellent location close to anything you need in town. very nice outside space with a cozy furnished porch and a hot tub but we didn't partake because the weather was just too hot. literally zero complaints. awesome owner very helpful.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable loft in a great, quiet location off campus area, but close to everything! Lots of great locally sourced additions & eco-friendly amenities which I appreciate because Athens is such a cool town! Becky was such a friendly and accommodating on-site host!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Becky and Chris’s space was a peaceful and relaxing retreat for us! It was very clean and had everything we needed for a short stay. The bed was incredibly cozy and we loved the local coffee and other unique touches. Checking in and out was super easy, communication was great and the hosts were very accommodating to our requests/questions. We would love to stay again the next time we are in town!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space is so nice for a couple. Bed was comfy, shower was refreshing, and the kitchen was a nice addition. The space was clean and decorated with local art. Location is great. We will definitely consider this place again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a beautiful spot! This space is extremely well appointed and creatively designed. Light, cheerful, comfortable - in a quiet, nice neighborhood. Loved the suggestions for places to eat and visit, and the work of local artists in the unit. We had a wonderful stay and will hope to stay here on future visits."
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is a quiet cozy space ideal for one - if you love being near / in outdoors then you’ll love the space and location, it’s right by Sells Park and Strouds Run as well as Sol on State Street. Becky was a communicative host and check in / check out was a breeze!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Awesome space; very well decorated with all the amenities. Lovely neighborhood, and the hosts have A+ communication. 10/10 would recommend."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect place for me to stay while in Athens. The apartment is amazing. Clean, so well decorated, and the most comfortable bed out there. The location is also fantastic and near a lot of local trails. I enjoyed my time here and plan to stay here the next time I am in Athens!"
2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Becky's place is stunning. Perfect combination of modern and rustic. Location is great. We walked to downtown Athens a few times. It is about a 25 minute walk, depending on where you're going. Parking was easy and free. Becky's communication was exceptional. My wife and I knew everything we needed to know before we even showed up.
The only minor thing we could pick at was that there was some pretty consistant dog barking. Becky lives downstairs with a her pets and they barked at all the normal dog things. Again, nothing outrageous, just normal dog behavior."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Very beautiful farming place to stay in Athens. We would definitely go again next time we are in Athens!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. very clean, close to everything in Athens would stay here again"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot with super cute decorations and plenty of space for one person or a couple. The host was very communicative and lives just downstairs. It is very close to campus/uptown but not really walking distance, unless you want to go on a pretty long walk. Regardless, I would highly recommend!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This charming, sun-filled loft is the perfect place for a getaway. Becky has added so many thoughtful touches throughout the space. Very clean, easy check-in, great communication. Will book again."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is hands down the best Airbnb I’ve stayed at in Athens. Great, private, cute, well decorated, and has some local flare. 10/10 recommend and will be trying to snag this Airbnb every time I come to Athens in the future."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful studio apartment in the heart of Athens. Becky was a wonderful and accommodating host! Unfortunately we didn't discover this hidden gem until our daughter's Ohio University graduation but would recommend visiting parents stay at this property.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Becky’s place was perfect for our stay in Athens. Being an OU Alumni we wanted something close to uptown that allowed dogs. Everything was clean, nicely furnished, and the shower was amazing. Becky and Chris were so friendly and accommodating to all of our needs. We will definitely be back!"
2022-04-01,3,Stayed one night,a
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The loft was beautifully decorated, comfortable and had everything we would need. Becky was friendly and helpful, the neighborhood was peaceful, and the house was just down the street from beautiful hiking trails."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay. The place is bright, airy and very comfortable with a beautiful park for hiking at the end
of the street. We liked the opportunity to recycle and compost during our stay, as we do at home. Our dogs liked it too, and were welcomed with dog treats!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Becky's place is great! There are so many small details that make you feel right at home...bottled water waiting for you in the fridge, local coffee, original artist work on the walls. She has gone out of her way to make sure you have everything you need for an enjoyable stay. And the bed is so comfortable! The location is perfect...close enough to campus with Kroger and CVS just steps away. As soon as I walked into the place, I booked it for my next trip. I look forward to many more nights at Becky's place while visiting my daughter at OU!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at the sunroom loft, Becky was a great host! It was a beautiful and comfortable space with lots of amenities. They gave us great recommendations for things to do & places to eat! Highly recommend it."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This a fabulous space. So many interesting and thoughtful touches in this unique apartment. Lovely views, great kitchen and coffee nook. I highly recommend you book this place!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Becky and her partner Chris were wonderful hosts. Their space is lovely. It has all of the amenities one could ever need. The kitchen is awesome, and the television and WiFi kept me connected. What I really enjoyed was the space. It is filled with lots of local charm. There is local art on the walls, fresh roast coffee, and handmade soap in the shower. I took a walk in the evening, and everyone I passed said hello. While I was in Athens on Business, I look forward to the opportunity to return with my wife, so we can enjoy the area. Thank you, Becky!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful space. Very responsive hosts! Will stay again.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place at a very reasonable price!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place, very roomy, homey, and perfect location right next to the brewery and close to uptown Athens. Great communication from the hosts. Will definitely plan to stay here again!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,An old farmhouse with creaky floors but a great place to stay. Responsive to issues
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome location. Great for a large family wanting to attend graduation weekend.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to crash while you are in Athens. Bonus is the brewery right next door with yummy food and drinks! Perfect spot💙
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location-awesome having brewery right behind us! Super comfy beds!
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Extremely friendly host and always quick to respond to my questions. We had 11 guests and the house was very spacious. Quick Ubers were available the entire weekend. Thank you for sharing your home with us!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is great alternative to hotels in Athens and should be considered for any multi-family event at OU instead of a hotel. The house was clean, just as described and 200 ft from Little Fish Brewery. All around fantastic stay. We will be back."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,Wonderful place and amazing food at the brewery
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"Our family came into town to see my son at OU. We enjoyed the space and the beds upstairs were very comfortable. Great table for dining together or playing games. Close to the brewery, but far enough away that we never heard the cars or people in the parking lot. Appreciated Jimmy’s help to make us a dinner reservation and for accommodating an early and late check-out."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a lovely time. Great place and the brewery is a welcome bonus.
2023-12-01,3,Group trip,"We really enjoyed that it was walking distance to the brewery.
It was a dirty house though. There was so much dust, the plants all looked to be dying, and the window sills were full of bugs."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Really enjoyed this place. Just as advertised. Plenty of space for our multi-family stay. Nice and close to the Ohio campus. Solid all the way around. Would stay here again.
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"I’ve been a fan of Little Fish Brewing Co since they opened, so I was delighted when they bought the adjacent property to turn into their B&B. Obviously you have the brewery just a short stroll away, but the house itself is a draw as well. It’s cozy, clean, and comfortable. My husband and I stayed here with two other couples, and we had plenty of room. Location is very convenient to pretty much anything you want to do in the area. The host was accommodating and responsive, provided clear instructions for arrival and departure, and gave us thoughtfully curated things to do. We will definitely be back for another stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our second time staying here, and it is such a gem. It has the charm of an older home with all the modern basics. Plenty of space for our party which consisted of eight adults and two children. Wonderful location with easy ability to walk to Little Fish and the nearby trail."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Great little spot! It was perfect for our crew to stay for our best friend’s wedding weekend.
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,We enjoyed family weekend with friends in Athens while not being in the crowds. Nice and quiet location with access to brewery and great food.
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Had an amazing experience at this Airbnb! We were in awe of the cute, eclectic decor, convenience to downtown, and not to mention the 2 minute walk to the brewery itself. Couldn’t have been more perfect!"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,This was our second time staying at Little Fish and we loved it!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,My whole family had a great time there. Nice big table so we all could eat meals together. We ordered a meal from their restaurant/brewery and it was so delicious! Very conviennent.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Wanted 10 or so of my close friends to experience Athens for a weekend and Little Fish accommodated perfectly. Not far from OU campus. Would highly recommend staying here with larger groups wanting to spend some time in Athens.
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"We absolutely loved this place! Close to campus so uptown was a short Uber away. Beautiful house with plenty of space. Only small issue was that no extra toilet paper was provided so we had to pick some up ourselves. Otherwise, definitely will be staying here again for our next trip hOUme"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Great motorcycle trip, great place to stay for the Windy 9"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect house for a multi family trip. Old farm house with plenty of character, but very thoughtfully updated.
Enjoyed being right next door to the brewery and restaurant. The house is a short drive from uptown Athens. It’s likely possible to walk uptown, but wouldn’t recommend it.
Overall, the house was a great home base for a trip back to Athens with kids in tow. The folks at Little Fish have done a great job."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay in Athens! Steps from the best brewery in town and easy access via car to Uptown/campus. Perfect for our group of alumni that were in town for Brew Week. Bring some extra towels and toilet paper!
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,This was the perfect place for us! It's really close to Athens for us to explore and having the Little Fish Brewery right next to the house was really convenient. The living room and dining room was perfect for our group to hang out to end the night or whenever we wanted a break to relax during the day! Highly recommend and we will be staying here again!
2023-06-01,4,Group trip,Loved being next to Little Fish Brewery. Well appointed kitchen (except didn’t find a toaster). King bed super comfortable. Flimsy lock to the back area that the staff uses and door knob fell off. Lots of parking space.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great visit and the house was the perfect spot! My brother and I grew up in Athens and attended Ohio. Our father still lives in town so this was the perfect spot for us to come back to town to celebrate Fathers Day. We also enjoyed being able to walk over to Little Fish in the evening. We will definitely be back!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place was very nice
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Great place for a big group! Bedrooms upstairs are a great size. Little Fish is in your backyard and you aren’t too far from campus! Would definitely stay here again.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great place to stay while you are in Athens especially if you have a crowd!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay at Little Fish Brewing CO’s. Clean and spacious. Ease in check in and communication with the owners.
The brewery next door is fun. Just a minute walk to food and drinks.
A quick drive to downtown Athens to plenty of local bars and restaurants."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is a wonderful farmhouse close to a lot of Athens amenities!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The farmhouse felt like home. Being next to brewery was super and was close to campus which met our needs.
Beds we’re comfortable and loved the farmhouse feel!"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Nice location and enough space for friends and I to get together!
2023-04-01,4,Group trip,"This is a fantastic old farmhouse. Do not expect a glamourous house with expensive amenities. That would ruin the charm. Communication was not the best t on the day of arrival. We were supposed to get a text with the keycode sometime during the day. Check in was at 4:00 and we arrived about 4:30 with no text code available. Thankfully someone was a the brewery next door, even though it was closed on Mondays, and arranged to get the keycode."
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"Great location, close to the bike path. Great place for a long weekend"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Little Fish AirBNB was perfect for an Athens stay! Can't beat being within walking distance of an awesome brewery with great food. 10/10 would recommend and will be back. Thank you for hosting us!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was comfortable and everything was there for us to use. We enjoyed every minute of being there and the owners are great communicators! We would definitely recommend to future guests!
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"Easy check in, fast responses to messages. Next to an amazing brewery with excellent food. Our group had a blast!"
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,Clean home with comfortable feel. Large kitchen and dining room to accommodate larger groups. We enjoyed the board games and comfy family room & beds. Close to Campus and perfect for visiting our kids and hosting them and their roommates for dinner.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just wanted to say “Thank you!” We had a great time, the brewery was wonderful & we hope to do it again."
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"Had a great stay for the weekend! Ample room for everybody and the kitchen was well-equipped for use. Location is out in the open but still quiet, private and enjoyable. The brewery is right in the backyard which made for a fun and quick lunch and great beers!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was perfect for our getaway! The kids loved the bunk bed room and the house had all the space we needed. The host was very responsive to any question we had! You could have walked from the house to Uptown Athens, but we drove most times. It was a quick 5 minute drive. The brewery delivery was just the icing on the cake! Thank you so much!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, right next to our favorite brewery! They were super responsive to our questions/requests and very accommodating!"
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"This Airbnb is a gem. It is well stocked, comfortable, spacious and clean. It is in a great location with easy access to breweries, outdoor activities, and downtown Athens. It was easy to communicate with the host and check in and out was a breeze. Our group of 8 adults had a great time."
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"Fantastic for larger group/families. Has a huge dining table and plenty of space for a large family(ies). Far enough from Athens to get away from the hustle but still very conveniently close by. Some members of our group found out it IS walkable to uptown, but would highly suggest driving!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,This house is surprisingly nice for an old farm house. Other than the creaky floors I really don’t have anything bad to say about it. The location is convenient and the brewery is very delicious albeit a bit pricey. If you have a big group that can split the price than this is a nice place to stay.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This a lovely old farmhouse which has been upgraded. It’s a much larger space than the exterior would imply. Bunk room is on first floor and 3 spacious bedrooms are upstairs. The only downside is the busy road noise. Bring ear plugs or your sound machine if noise keeps you awake. Biggest upside is brewery next door. Hosts are very accessible if issues occur.
2022-08-01,3,Stayed one night,"The location next to Little Fish is perfect, and the house is beautiful, well maintained and stocked with everything you need. We had some security issues with exterior doors being left unlocked, and some locks not working. If the safety issues can be addressed, this will be a great place to stay."
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,Great stay!
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,We loved this Airbnb so much! We can’t wait to come back!!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Love love love this place! It is really well equipped and really comfortable. This is probably the best equipped kitchen I’ve ever stayed in. Sharp knives, nice spices, cast iron, and nice dishes. Fresh cream in the fridge was a sweet bonus! Beds are very comfortable and the bedrooms are very cozy with great aesthetics. Great communication and we love the location. We will definitely be back!"
2022-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,Super comfy beds.....
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"Had our family stay here for our wedding. It was wonderful. The grounds are beautiful, the house was clean and comfortable. And it was awesome being a stone’s throw away from the brewery. Jimmy was great at communicating and was accommodating to our group of guests. My family can’t wait to get back!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for my husband's 40th birthday (alumni reliving some good times), and the house was so great. Very comfortable and nicely appointed. Everything is there to make your stay comfortable. And we were impressed with all of the nice extra touches - makeup remover wipes in the bathroom, lots of spices in the kitchen, etc. So many thoughtful details. And it's great to walk right over to the brewery! We're definitely excited to stay here for future Athens trips."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful Airbnb. Description is spot on. Awesome house, great location to both OU and Hocking Hills. Able to walk to the Little Fish Brewer for daily beers. House has a ton of historical charm, but is completely updated. I think I was the first person to use the oven it was so clean. Will be using again in the future."
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,Very close to downtown Athens. The house had fun things to do and plenty of room to spread out. We plan to return!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,The farmhouse was clean and comfortable. The rooms were set up nicely for multiple families. The proximity to Little Fish is also a plus!
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"Our stay was perfect. Plenty of room for a small group, good location, had everything we needed!"
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,great place! lots of room.
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,We had a great stay the farm house was wonderful and the host was great!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Scenic....but yet only 200' from one of the best breweries in the state! This farmhouse could hold a lot of friends for fun trip to Athens and its breweries/cidery. Comfortable and had everything you need. Plenty of parking... digital locks.... top notch place/home base to stay when visiting State Parks or the funky nearby college town of Ohio University. Brewery has an awesome laid back vibe and outdoor areas... not too mention the most amazing Detroit style pizza! Can't wait to visit again!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Little Fish is a wonderful brewery. The house was situated with a brewery in the back yard. Perfect for my birthday weekend.
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,Very nice place to stay !
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You cannot beat the location of this home for visiting and enjoying all the Little Fish Brewery has to offer. Pro Tip: get beer to-go in a growler to enjoy at the house after the brewery closes to keep the fun times rolling! You can also easily get into town for events on campus with a short drive or you can use the bike path to make the long walk as well. Since you are in an old house, you do tend to hear the sounds of cars and sirens on the road outside and while that wasn’t enough of an issue to bother us, its good to know if you are a really light sleeper, bring ear plugs! Having two full bathrooms is a huge plus and there is more than enough seating and space for a large group. We will definitely consider staying here again in the future!"
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,The house was so charming & the host left little treats for us. Well stocked kitchen & very clean. Wish this house was around the whole 4 years our daughter was at OU!
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,"What a wonderful place! Perfect size, location, decor, and set-up for a family. Highly recommend! Thank you Little Fish for this beautiful rental!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Ally was very responsive host. We felt right at home!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect fit for me and friends coming back from a reunion. Close enough to everything but also far enough for good sleep. Ally was incredibly responsive and helpful.
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,We had a wonderful time staying at Ally’s Airb&b. Its location is great with an easy walk to all the restaurants on court street.
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Had stayed here with friends before and came back because of great location and as advertised property!
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Great location! Plenty of space for our family. We would stay here again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Really convenient to restaurants and to campus but far enough away to be quiet amd peaceful. 10 minute walk to downtown or to city park and pedestrian trail. Tons of space. Clean and comfortable.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for a wonderful stay!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The space was perfect for a weekend visit to Athens. The king-sized bed was very comfortable and the local art was fabulous. I will try to stay here again. Thanks Ally!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So much better than a hotel. Spacious rooms, many amenities to make you feel welcome and at home. Location is great for walking to uptown, campus and the trail along the river. Will definitely book again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Love staying at Allys place! So convenient for OU and kids love the snacks and video games. beds are comfy and house is warm.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Thank you for a great stay.
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,Ally’s place was perfectly located if you’re looking for a trip spent uptown on Court Street! It was spacey with so many places to sleep — perfect for a big friend group returning to Athens! We couldn’t have had a better time!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The house was everything Ally said it would be. Close to where we needed to be and quiet at night. Great house
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,We're repeat guests that I'm sure will be back again in the future! Ally is such a wonderful host and incredibly responsive to any comments or questions.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Excellent location! Walking distance to uptown and the ciderhouse. The home was clean and peaceful and had an amazing common space with a huge couch and lots of seating to visit with people we were staying with. Ally was a fantastic host and everything was just perfect.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay!! The location was close to everything. I would definitely stay here again thank you for a wonderful home away from home!!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house/apartment was exactly what we needed for Dad's Weekend. Having gone to OU, it was an Athens house so I had an idea of what to expect. I like the way Ally has all the instructions and local things spelled out. It was neat, free of clutter and a perfect place to crash. We had perfect weather so we hung out on the deck for a little. Loved that there was parking right behind. The lock was a little challenge at first but we got it working and had no issues after that. Very timely communication.
My only disappointment is it's not available for some other weekends we're coming back down! Thanks!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"We really enjoyed our stay at Ally's place, while it did have the feel of converted student housing it was clean, comfortable and had everything we needed for a great stay. The notebook was full of helpful restaurant and activity suggestions, in fact her's should be the model for every AirBnB. It was incredibly useful plus it had all the instructions on what to do for one of the easiest check out experiences we've ever had. The location was great and convenient for getting to Court Street or to the OU campus."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect for a weekend stay with friends from college. Walkable to uptown (about 10 minute walk to Court St) and campus. Great alternative to staying at a hotel and having to drive into town--able to get that ""just like being back in college"" experience."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect spot for us! Close to campus, easy access and very clean. Thank you!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, short walk to uptown, lots of amenities, plenty of parking, host was kind and very responsive."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Would love to stay here again! A great, spacious apartment within walking distance to campus! Clean, roomy, unique ~ highly recommend!!"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful spot for a fun alumni weekend!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay in Athens for family weekend. Comfy and large enough for my daughter and a friend of hers to stay with us.
We accidentally left a gift bag in the kitchen and the Ally was kind enough to bring it to my daughter at her sorority."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Just as described in the listing. Ally was super responsive. Would definitely stay again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location for our visits to downtown Athens!
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Loved our stay at Ally's place in Athens!
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,We were so excited to score “the Good Place” for our annual visit to Athens. Plenty of space for everyone to congregate on the magnificent couch or zone out in a bedroom. Super chill host with minimal/basic house rules. Great location close to Court but not too close. I’m almost afraid to rave too much and make this place the hot ticket.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What an awesome property to stay at! The apartment was clean and looked exactly like the pictures. Uptown Athens was totally walkable from here. Plus, there were plenty of local spots within a block or two to check out. We recommend the West End Ciderhouse a block away for cocktails and hard cider. This apartment totally took me on a walk down memory lane to my days as an Ohio University Bobcat!"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Great stay with very responsive host.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"We had a great stay. It's a great location, only about a 15 minute walk to uptown. It was very cozy."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here in this location/apartment! Ally's a great host. If we ever come back, we will be sure to stay here!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Ally’s place was absolutely perfect for our visit back to OU! It’s kind of hard to tell the layout from the pics, and we were so pleasantly surprised when we arrived! Totally spacious and wonderful for for 5 people! The yard and porch were also perfect. It felt like being back in our college house, except way nicer and cleaner. Wifi was easy to connect to. Everything was labeled in the kitchen. Bathroom was clean. The living room and giant couch was so nice for hanging out. It was like a 10 min walk to court street! Just like the college days. Seriously awesome. Can’t wait to come back."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"This is a great place to stay in Athens! It's not directly on Court, but it's a only a short walk to it. The apartment is SPACIOUS with many beds and other places to sleep. The couch is as comfortable as it looks in the photos."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Great place! Super clean, comfy and cozy."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Great place very close to court street. Had a great time and really enjoyed the location. The video games and board games were great to have as well! We would definitely stay again!
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Our stay in Ally’s home was so nice! There was plenty of space for my family of eight adults, all four bedroom were spacious and comfy, especially the beds and linen! My older two kids LOVED the N64, brought back fond memories of their childhood! It was a 10 minute walk to town which was nice walking home after the evening out. Thank you Ally for a lovely stay, we’ll be back!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is better than the pictures
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"This was the perfect Airbnb for our stay in Athens! Close to things, easy to get around. There was some construction during our time but Ally communicated that to us ahead of time and provided updated driving instructions.
Definitely recommend this location, this was a great stay!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ally’s place was close to main campus. Apartment was clean nothing fancy but met all of our needs. Ally was very easy to work with. Plenty of room. Could of used a second bathroom but I knew that when I selected it. Ally left us a lot of nice treats.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place to stay in Athens. Easy walk to court street and campus!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay for OU moms weeeknd. This spot is exactly as described. It was more roomy and cozy than I was expecting. We also loved the extra touches of snacks provided ! Great spot - would highly recommend. Enjoy !
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Airbnb was in a great location just a short walk to court street, was just as described, and check-out was very easy."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice athens home
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Can't beat the location for any activity at OU. The street noise is a little loud, but with ear plugs and white noise machine, can fix that! Comfortable beds. Make sure you check the thermostat because ours was set to go to 58 at 11:45 pm, it was freezing!"
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,Great location within walking distance to court street!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place, very convenient to the main part of town. Love the N64!"
2023-02-01,4,Group trip,"Had a great time, plenty of space for a larger group. Easy walk to uptown."
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"If you went to OU this place will feel like you're living in a college house again, but way nicer. :) It's also very ""Athens"", with little nooks and crannies upstairs, it was a very cool space. Ally was super responsive with any questions, but we didn't have many since instructions were so detailed and everything went really well.
If you are wanting to spend a lot of time in uptown Athens (bars, restaurants, coffee shops), this is very walkable, about a half a mile or less."
2022-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,Great stay. Very clean. The beds were great. Would stay here again.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You can't beat the location, amount of space, and large deck."
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Clean and roomy upstairs apartment off a very busy street. Very comfortable but a lot of stairs. Enjoyed our stay!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An incredibly comfortable and clean spot in a perfect place! Right next to West End Ciderhouse and within walking distance to everything Athens has to offer.
Already planning to stay here again next year. Ally is a kind and communicative host and I very much appreciated her working with us on a last minute request to book after our original VRBO fell through. (This was an upsetting and stressful event and Ally saved the day!)
Love this spot. Will be back!"
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,We booked for Athens Brew Week and this Airbnb was perfect! A short walk to Court Street and very easy to find! The hosts Ally and Eric are amazing and definitely will be booking again next time we’re in Athens
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"When in Athens, especially with a group, this is a great place to stay. It's a short walk uptown to Court Street or campus. The deck and yard are perfect to hang out, play corn hole, etc.. We've stayed here twice now and will definitely stay again on our next trip."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,The place was in a great location and very easy to get to uptown! We loved the Cider house that was basically next door. Ally was exceptional to work with and we appreciated her timely communication and assistance!
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,Ally’s place was super comfortable and cozy. We really appreciated having such an affordable place to reconnect with friends. Thank you!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place has a great location and is just a short walk to downtown. There are a few local places to hangout within a block. The communication was very good and the place was clean. Would definitely recommend to stay here.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and walking distance to campus. Would stay here again.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful adorable place to stay!!
Hope it is open every trip I make to Athens!!
It was perfect!!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Airbnb was absolutely perfect
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this house! and LOVED the big comfy couch! Everything you need for a weekend in Athens. Upstairs bedrooms were quite toasty but we didn’t use them, luckily. (Not sure if there was a switch we missed, but I think the AC is motion-automatic when you are inside the home? It was always a bit warmer when we returned) Walking distance to Court Street, and the Cider House is basically right next door. Very nice space for friends :) Good size rooms. N64 & TV with streaming is clutch!
One suggestion would be lessening the “cleaning requirements” of a guest prior to leaving. Understandable that you don’t want guests to trash the house, but when a cleaning fee is already charged, it seems a little much to require wiping out the microwave and doing dishes. I’m a clean person anyway - but I just wouldn’t want to feel that I’ll receive a bad review on my profile if I miss something on the cleaning list. Tough to straddle that line as a host, I’m sure! Thanks for a great spot :)"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Everything was perfect! Beds were cozy and we had everything we needed. Thank you!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Excellent location, excellent communication before and during our stay, always willing to go the extra mile. The place itself is ideal for those wanting to least amount of travel time to Ohio University whilst maintaining a fair distance from Court Street (5/10 minute walk easily). The bike path is very close by also."
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,Ally was a fantastic host! She’s super responsive and accommodating! The place was clean and very spacious! Would highly recommend!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place, highly recommend"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best air bnb in Athens!! I will always stay here when I come back to visit. Amazing location and beautiful place!
2022-04-01,4,Group trip,"This is a great sized second and third story 4 bedroom Airbnb. It’s an old house, typical of Athens Ohio but is really a step above. Very well accommodating great spaces, perfect for a large family or group wanting to spend time together. Hosts go to great lengths to provide what you need!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend this accommodation. Very easy going, laid back place. I’ve stayed on three separate occasions with my family!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place was great, convenient, clean, roomy, and communication with Ally was quick and helpful."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was a great place to stay! As an OU alum, being able to stay within walking distance of Uptown was great. Ally left plenty of information about the place and was easy to reach. I will definitely look at staying again for my next Athens visit!"
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,Nice place in a good location
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay to visit kids at OU. Skip the over priced hotels and go with Ally’s home. Great host and great communication.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at Ally's place. It was clean, and the location is great. The N64 was a huge hit. One warning: the street is pretty loud at night. Ally provides ear plugs; you will need them if you are a light sleeper. The coffee was great, and the snacks were as well. Ally was very responsive and flexible. We will be staying here again!"
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,"Nice and affordable place , definitely recommended"
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,Had an excellent stay! No complaints!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time we’ve stayed here. Ally leaves great snacks and makes the stay a nice one! Highly recommend, especially because it is pet friendly and great location to Ohio University."
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,"Great stay, the place is stocked w everything you’d need & hosts are responsive and friendly. Comfortably sleeps 7-8, but there is just one restroom so keep that in mind. Local art hangs throughout w the option to purchase. N64 w classic games. We had a great time!"
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,This house is in a great location for visiting Athens. All of the beds are super comfortable and the hosts are thoughtful in what they provide for guests. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!
2022-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great location for the price. Easy to get to. Beds were comfortable!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was nice
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was a Good place for us to use for holiday activities. it is near enough campus and downtown for easy access but is right near the hospital and across from an industrial area if late night noises might be a problem. Overall it was a good place for us
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was great! Location was awesome, right next to Tavolino and Millers Chicken. Walking distance to uptown. Parking was easy and ample. The apartment had everything we needed as a young family. We loved having the washer and dryer. The showers were hot and had nice pressure. The foam beds were sooo comfortable. And like others said, the couch is perfect for snuggling up and watching movies together. We would love to stay here every time we visit Athens!"
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,"This place is amazing, in a great location, and has everything you need! Walking distance to everything, and even includes a Nintendo 64 with some Mario kart! Awesome place!"
2021-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great location to uptown and campus. Bed was comfy and plenty of room to spread out. Definitely an older house with some quirks, but worked for our stay."
2021-11-01,3,Stayed about a week,"The pros: The location of this apartment was in walking distance (about a mile) of a number of good restaurants, which we liked.
The unit itself had 2 spacious bedrooms, plus 2 smaller bedrooms on the next floor up.
The cons: Regarding safety, there was no lighting on the stairs going into the unit or at the front door.
Regarding cleanliness, there were dead bugs on the window casings upstairs, which I’ve not seen at an Airbnb or hotel before.
Regarding overall atmosphere, there were heating vents that stuck out about a foot from the walls and other ‘remodeling’ that gave the place a feeling of low rent student housing. It was functional but not how we’re accustomed to living.
We loved our visit to Athens but would not stay here again."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay! Had everything we needed. Everything was so comfortable. They truly thought of everything. Highly recommend.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Roomy and perfect location; short walk to uptown. Host communicated well and check in/out very easy. Definitely recommend. We hope to stay at Ally's place again soon.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ally’s apartment was very clean, nicely decorated and well maintained. It’s location was ideal for visiting my son who goes to Ohio University. Ally answers messages in a very timely manner and she is quite accommodating. I would definitely recommend her place to anyone who is looking for a place to stay in Athens. I do plan on staying there when I visit my son again."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place was clean and close to uptown.
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a bohemian and spacious place to stay with friends or family, do check this place out! Conveniently located and has lots of amenities. Do be prepared for some street noise at times. We enjoyed the deck. Also, Ally was extremely responsive and helped us address our unique needs during our stay. Thanks, Ally and Eric!"
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,Great place to spend a weekend! Ally communicated everything very clearly.
2021-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great location! The beds and pillows are super comfy!! Many nice touches throughout the apartment!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was perfect! Exactly what we were looking for and exactly what it said it was! It was all beautiful and roomy
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great space, lots of room! Had a Nintendo 64 which my husband loved having!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great vibe from the start with this place. Pet friendly - even some pup treats left for our short furry kids.
Location is very convenient to OU.
EV free charging across the street.
Plenty of room. Snacks, spices and condiments for guests.
I will be staying here again to visit my OU student!
Thanks Ally!!!"
2021-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Convenient location to uptown Athens. Worked for the two of us, and would be plenty of bed space for a larger group of young alumni; The 4 and 5 star hotel goers may not find the general condition of the kitchen appliances and bath amenities to their liking, but it seemed acceptable for the price point. The house has been converted into multiple units that share parking and yard spaces. Our unit was reasonably clean inside and smartly decorated."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,WONDERFUL 4 bedroom apartment just a short walk to Uptown Athens and campus. Beds were all comfy and the place was very clean. Owners made checkin and checkout very easy and simple. Definitely would rent again.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing 4 bedroom apartment. We had a toddler and an infant and the apartment was as safe as it could be for them. The couple of bedrooms upstairs were deceptively hot (we were also there on an extremely hot weekend), but cooled down significantly as soon as the sun set. Close by to some wonderful places, such as Miller's Chicken and West End Ciderhouse, and close enough to Uptown so we could walk to it!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute and spacious place in a great location. The walk uptown is not bad, the parking is super convenient and the place was comfortable and clean! We will definitely try to stay here again on our next visit to Athens!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great space, location, and price! I would definitely stay again. Very spacious."
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"Great home base for Brew Week.  It was nice to have lots of space, AC, WiFi, and easy parking all within walking distance of Court Street.  When not hitting the bricks, all of us could sprawl on the sofa and play MarioKart or laugh at Letterkenny between sips of some fine local brews.  Ally even thought of the little details like ear plugs and Pedialyte packs!"
2021-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"Ally's home is adorable, comfortable, spacious yet cozy, and clean. The house is nice and close to campus as well with ample parking. This was our first time staying at an Airbnb, so maybe it's normal procedure, but I didnt like having to take the time to strip our sheets and felt it should be part of the cleaning fee.
My only word of caution would be for light sleepers like me. The windows are original and thin which meant being woken up by traffic intermittently. I would suggest light sleepers take the room next to the bathroom with the beautiful silver comforter since it is away from the busier of the two streets. She is kind enough to provide ear plugs which helped somewhat."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Second time staying here with my family. All was good and would definitely stay here again!
2021-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great value. Clean and roomy. Loved the upstairs bedrooms private suites . House manual full of useful information. Will stay again.
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,Ally's house is perfectly located. We were without a car for the majority of our stay in Athens but it was no problem at all with bars and restaurants easily within walking distance. A beautiful home! I would highly recommend!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay with everything you would need (dish/laundry soap, cleaning supplies, even snacks :))"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,All exactly as promised. Smooth sailing all the way.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ally’s place was a good fit for us to visit family in Athens. We met other families members to ride bikes on the beautiful trail. The space was very cozy for 4 of us. It is a really great location. We enjoyed a visit to the Ciderworks for a drink and a snack. We also walked down town for breakfast. We could not have found a better value in Athens!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,very beautiful
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,The place was perfect and very clean. Would definitely stay here again!
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,Great location! Everything you need is there - the hospitality and attention to details to make you feel welcome and comfortable is all there. If your looking to stay in Athens this is a great alternative to pricey hotels.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super nice apartment in a quiet neighborhood. Loved the Westend Cidery a few doors down.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay and fast communication. Very cozy and has everything you’d need!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was exactly as advertised. I appreciated all the detail provided upfront. There were lots of little touches and conveniences provided that are the kind of surprises that you do welcome as a guest! The host was great with communication, and even went out of her way to double check for me that the pack ‘n play was on hand... and then went the extra step of setting it up for me before I arrived. We were off with family during the daytime, and then this place was perfect for our tired bodies and minds to come relax and rest before the next jam packed day of family fun. There was nothing extra to do or get - comfort and convenience as soon as we entered. I would definitely stay here again."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay! We love staying here - super clean and comfy and great location!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ally is a great host. Her place is nice and large, plenty of beds to choose from (mind you- they are comfy!) and short distances from anything you need! The homemade cookies were a hit as well! I definitely recommenda stay at Ally's place!"
2021-03-01,5,Group trip,"Ally is a great owner and she is very quick to respond. The apartment was immaculately clean, and everything was labeled and well organized."
2021-03-01,5,Group trip,"This place is perfect for a weekend in Athens! Ally is extremely responsive. When we got locked out, she was over within 10 minutes to help us."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The location is excellent! The space was very clean and the beds were amazing!
2021-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,We had a lovely week with our OU student! Ally’s place was super comfortable and she provides everything you need and more. Communication was always quick and the location is great. We will definitely stay again!
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in here and enjoyed it. It is a fairly big space with a lot of beds. There is a Nintendo 64 and Ron’u TV which is nice, and the oversized sofa is nice as well."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,The apt was really spacious with 4 beds and large living area...the sectional is so cozy and can sleep 2 adults very comfortably if needed. Very quick walk to OU and Court St! Taking dogs on walks was so easy. Will come back to stay!
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here. It felt so much like our college apartments that we were a little surprised at first but it was much cleaner with way more comfortable beds and a couch in the living that would have been perfect in the 70s:) And was sooo comfortable. Ally has included a lot of fun amenities and the place has a wonderful airy feel about it. And if COVID was behind us, a short hop to the Cider House would have probably been a nightly occurrence. Perfect for a fun college weekend stay or family trip."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent location! Very responsive host.
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lots of space and beds in this home. Be ready to share one bathroom, but it worked very well for my family. House is clean, plenty of kitchen stuff, great high quality coffee selection and snacks. Owners are great communicators and will answer or solve any questions quickly. I liked the beds and was very comfortable with the down comforter, but my wife isn’t a fan of foam mattresses so we were split on the sleeping situation. A fair amount of traffic noise, but owner provides ample ear plugs. Didn’t bother me at all but might bother some. Convenient location, be sure to get food to go from Miller’s Chicken, down the street."
2021-01-01,5,Group trip,"Amazing place for an amazing price, great people with great taste to ensure a good stay, 10/10 would recommend"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious well-stocked kitchen, roomy bathroom, incredibly comfy king bed and couch, and wifi worked well for video conferencing. Overall the space was a relaxing place to hang out. All host communication was quick and clear. "
2021-01-01,5,Group trip,The place was well cleaned with great hospitality!
2021-01-01,5,Group trip,This place was very clean and cute! Also very close to downtown which was nice.
2020-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,Great location for easy access into town. Don’t miss Donkey Coffee for your morning jolt!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was in town for work. Great location! And all around a wonderful find
2020-11-01,5,Group trip,"Communication was clear, quick, and easy. We were given wonderful directions which made travel easy, and check in was a breeze. We were blown away by the little touches like cupboards with a few snacks and the retro video games provided. The beds were like sleeping on warm marshmallows, and more than enough blankets and pillows to go around. The welcome binder gave us several ideas of places to go and places to eat, and the brochures made it so we didn't have to do an Internet search for every little thing. The spacious living room and couch made it so we could all comfortably sit and spend time together snacking and watching movies. We have come to the Hocking Hills area many times over the years, but after this trip we will be staying in Athens instead. Can't wait until our next trip."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and hospitality!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We booked this home last-minute to visit Hocking Hills, which was about 40 min away. My husband, 2 teenagers & I really enjoyed our stay. It’s a spacious apartment in a very old home, located in a busy college town. The beds are comfortable. There some nice touches like high-end toiletries and very fine bedding. Ally provided some snacks/candy, which was very kind. Traffic outside the house is sometimes loud, so we definitely used the earplugs left bedside. TV w Netflix was awesome after our full day of hiking. The walls are adorned with amazing artwork that’s for sale. Very nice stay overall!"
2020-10-01,5,Group trip,Perfect
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I was pleasantly surprised by this space. I needed something at the last minute and Ally was super helpful. It's a huge two-story apartment with everything you could need. The location is superb. Free parking on site and pet-friendly very much appreciated.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place really had everything- the little touches such as granola bars and snacks and spices in the kitchen and individually wrapped makeup remover wipes, extra toothbrushes, and ibuprofen in the bathroom was unlike any other place I’ve stayed. We were welcomed with fresh baked cookies and information and goodies related to the reason of our visit. The location was the perfect distance from town- an easy walk but away from the college town chaos. It was also a short 40 minute drive to Hocking Hills! Ally’s place provided us the perfect blend of relaxation and adventure!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in the upstairs apartment, which was very spacious and comfortable. There were thoughtful touches throughout. It's definitely not the Ritz Carlton, but for the money, it's a great place to stay. It has the Athens vibe, and it zapped us back to our time there. The location is but a short walk to downtown -- just the right distance from the din and craziness that is Athens when the students are in town. If you're a guitar or banjo enthusiast, you may be delighted to find that you are right across the street from the historic Stewart MacDonald building, which has been beautifully restored."
2020-09-01,5,Group trip,Great location! Close to so many local restaurants. Had brochures laid out With a map. The place itself was quite clean and I would recommend to anyone.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend Ally’s place - very thoughtful and really made us feel cared for. She had bowls for our two puppies, even chopsticks, and every single condiment we could wish for! A very well stocked kitchen even with a large pot and steamer. She also welcomed us with a plate of cookies!! Her response time is great, and I consider her a model hostess. The beds are very comfortable, and she provides plenty of extra blankets as well as towels. It was a very last minute trip to Hocking Hills, which is about 40 minutes away, but served as a great home base. Very cozy and homey. We really enjoyed our weekend!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was wonderful. We were a group of 6 exploring the beautiful nature during Labor Day weekend. We received the most heartbreaking news during our stay but were so comfortable in the space Ally and Eric provided all of us, that we decided to stick it out. My boyfirend and I stayed in the queen room as soon as you walked in and that bed was the most comfiest I've ever slept in. Our friends in the king room said their bed was also. The whole space on the first floor invited feelings of calm and tranquility as well as the room upstairs with the chair in front of the window. Everyone absolutely loved that they could wash their clothes. It made the place feel like home instead of something like a hotel room. The materials we were left to use on the coffee table in the living room were incredibly helpful and insightful for what to do in the area. I was personally thankful for the sleepy time tea, electrolyte packets, and ibuprofen. They thought of EVERYthing, we were blown away by the amenities.
The adult neighbors downstairs were polite and communicative and even enjoyed us playing music on the patio last night. All of our questions were answered in the house manual and the handbook was enjoyable to read to hear the hosts' personalities. We appreciated all of the little things so much we tried our best to follow the check-out checklist on the fridge.
The hosts are doing a great thing with the art through the place. We've never seen that at an Airbnb before. Very cool. We would love to come back!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ally & Eric's place was great! The apartment is quite big, and they've really got the place stocked. Seriously, I've never stayed in an Airbnb with as many cool amenities in the apartment (N64 with 4 controllers and Goldeneye, ALL of the dishes/cookware/spices I needed to make dinner, local art in every room, washer/dryer, etc. etc.). The location is also fantastic! We didn't get to visit any of the local eateries or bars during our stay (thanks COVID), but we did get to take a long walk around the neighborhood. Lots of cool stuff nearby.
They definitely went out of their way to make a super comprehensive manual for the place, covering everything you'd ever want to know about the apartment! If you can't tell, my little family and I had a great experience staying here and we'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay in Athens!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"After a crazy week, we decided to find a place for an impromptu night away from home. The house was everything we could have asked for and more. It was more space than ever could have needed, and it would be the perfect place for a larger group as well. The couch was cozy, the beds comfy, the kitchen well stocked and this place had some fun touches to boot. I’m fact, we bought a painting from a local artist that was on display in their living room. Would definitely stay here and, and highly recommend for others!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,A+++for cleanliness. Perfect Court Street location for when you find yourself visiting OU. Bar noise was minimal & not noticed in the bedroom. I usually travel with a sound machine but forgot it this time. If you don’t have to wake early you may want one to lessen the morning street noise. (Maybe it was just trash day for the area) Super responsive host. Would definitely stay again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of the best places in Athens and the best host. I’d recommend anyone to stay here and at any of Jamie’s places.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jamie made us feel at home—the place was extremely clean and modern. He was accommodating and allowed me to check in early with my newborn. Perfect location for exploring Athens!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jamie's place was so nice. It is right on Court Street! So convenient. The place is brand new inside and spotless. Shiny clean and clutter free. Plenty of space for 4 people . 2 huge beds that are very comfortable. All the amenities you would need. Thw noise from the bar was not an issue for us. The music was very good and not loud upstairs.
Jaime was a great host. Clear instructions. Parking spot right across the street. I would definitely stay here again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Place was very nice. Appearances outside don’t do it justice
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,It was a great location! So convenient for hanging out on Court Street. It was expensive but the location couldn't be better.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I stayed in Jamie's place with my 13 and 15 year-old for a small Spring Break trip to Athens. Location couldn't have been better - right over Lucky's on Court St. Sure you can hear the bar below in half the apartment, but hey that's part of the college town atmosphere. The apartment still had that ""new"" smell to it, and was amazingly clean and put together with solid furniture (which I reminded my kids was NOT part of the college town atmosphere...ha!). Would not hesitate to recommend Jamie's apartment, and will hope to stay there again for our next visit."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a newly finished apartment in an amazing location. Jamie (host) is very responsive (we’ve also stayed in another of his apartments on the upper floor) and he was very helpful with some questions and troubleshooting we had to do. The apartment was spotless and everything new and fresh. Two king beds were a bonus for comfort. The building is old and it’s above Lucky’s bar so you’ll hear music until they close, but who cares, the proximity to uptown is awesome!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I very much enjoyed my stay at Jamie’s. Very clean, comfy, and lovely. So helpful and responsive to my questions. Needed a place to feel comfortable and welcoming in my short stay in Athens, and my expectations were fully met."
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great location. It’s right in the heart of the action but the noise was never disruptive. Comfy beds, nice little kitchen, solid tv."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is the perfect location for a visit to Athens! It’s spacious and pristine. As the host mentions, you can hear Lucky’s below, but only in the kitchen and family room. There is no noise when you are in the bedroom."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a perfect and affordable location right on Court Street. Jamie was extremely communicative and helpful, especially with parking. We would absolutely stay again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a great little place to stay. Right in the middle of town so everything was easily walkable. Highly recommend this place. I can see why Jamie is so highly rated as a host, super and quick responsiveness."

2024-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"The place was great. Plenty of room, comfortable, great location. The only knock is that we could smell cigarette smoke from the bar downstairs (or from the outside. Nonetheless, it was a great place to stay and Jamie was a great host."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute place in the heart of Court St./ OU. Great for alumni or parents visiting students. The bar below was louder than I expected, but host was very upfront about it. We had ear plugs and really didn’t have any issues sleeping. The place was easy to get to and was very cozy. Bonus that it had a parking space. Would definitely stay again."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for OU siblings weekend and had an awesome stay! The place was exactly as described and I would stay here again in the future. It's in a perfect location that allowed us to be close to everything and walk to all the bars, restaurants and around campus.
The only thing that I want to emphasize is listen to the listing when it states its above a bar. Music plays until the bar closes which did not bother us but it's not an over exaggeration that you're above a bar.
Thanks for the hospitality, Jamie! We will definitely be back."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,10/10
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location and great space!

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you’re staying in Athens, this place is right in the center of it all. Located in the heart of “the uptown scene” you are in very, very close walking distance from any Ohio University atheletic event or performance of any sort. It right in the middle of the night life scene as well! Jamie is also an incredible host!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,If your coming to have fun this is the perfect place to be.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay in Athens! Well worth the price 👌
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this place. My girlfriend and I are both OU grads and were really looking forward to experiencing all the fun uptown Athens has to offer. Jamie’s place absolutely did not disappoint.
Location is awesome, overlooking Court St. We worked a 1/2 day from the apartment while looking out the huge windows onto the street below. The place was clean, spacious, and comfortable. We never really needed to use the kitchen because eating out at some of our old favorite spots was part of the reason for the trip.
There definitely was noise from Lucky’s below, however Jamie was completely upfront about the noise so we knew exactly what to expect. Nothing that some earplugs and an Alexa couldn’t negate.
We would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone looking to stay in Athens."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a perfect spot right among all the nigh t life. Perfect for a parent staying the weekend with their children. Thanks to Jaime as it was perfect all around!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Apartment was very clean and well-stocked!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place is perfect for a trip to Athens. Description clearly states that you will hear music from the bar below. As long as that is okay with you.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great one night stay at this apartment, both in experience and in sleep. Can't beat this location in Uptown Athens -- we were close to all of the campus action.
The space was comfortable, well kept, and as described. And the morning view from the windows was incredible. Looking forward to staying here again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay on Court Street. The apartment was perfect for our weekend stay-spacious, clean and close to everything at OU. I would love to stay there again. It is very loud located above a bar but Jamie warned us about it and we were ok with the noise just so we could be in a convenient location."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place! Jamie was great and very accommodating! Perfect location. Will definately stay again. If staying on the weekend it is loud b/c it's above a bar but Jamie was very upfront about this. It did not bother us but others it might if you go to bed before midnight. There are stairs to enter that are a little steep but it's very clean and private entrance. Rental was very very clean and well decorated! Great stay!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"very clean and updated, but still a lot of the athens old building charm. and definitely right there in the action. you will hear the crowd beneath you, but take that time to sit by the windows and just watch and listen to the court st chaos. thats just between us, don't tell anyone about this place ..."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, comfy, streaming services, good price. Jaimes super easy to communicate with"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Really enjoyed the stay and the perfect place to stay at while you experience Athens. Would (and will) stay again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Honestly one of the best hosts I’ve had!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as described, easy to find. Jamie was easy to communicate with."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really loved the apartment and being on Court Street. We came for Parents Weekend and it made it easy for us to visit our daughter. It was nice to have a place we could hangout. Host was transparent about it being over a bar so we knew what to expect.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Very easy check in and check out. Very good stay!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"great location! Place was clean, easy to find, and comfortable. Would definitely stay again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay in Athens! Jamie was very responsive.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Location, Location, Location! Perfect location to enjoy Athens while visiting OU. Great parking location and so convenient to everything we needed. Absolutely spotless. This location is above Lucky's but we didn't mind. Probably not for light sleepers or people who go to bed early. They played great music downstairs. Will definitely stay again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay right on Court Street. Highly recommend.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Just as described. Great location if you are looking to be right in the action of Court Street.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, great view, apartment is spotless and well stocked with anything you could need. He was kind enough to let us use a reserved parking spot while there and even after we checked out.
My only gripe, which is not Jamie’s fault at all, is that although I was expecting it to be loud at night, we pulled the short straw and they were paving the parking lot next to the building and so it was also hella loud in the morning. If you’re a light sleeper you wouldn’t like this location, but I will say the bed, pillows and sheets were very comfortable."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great time in Athens at Jamie’s Airbnb! Jamie was very responsive whenever I had any questions. The apartment was clean and comfortable (plenty of towels, cups/dishes). The location can’t be beat for anyone visiting Court Street. The additional bonus of a parking spot makes the price unbeatable. Only suggestion I have would be to have non disposable coffee cups available, but there were paper cups available."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect place!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This apartment was clean, spacious, with plenty amenities in bathroom and kitchen. Bed was super comfortable and pillows were high quality. Loved the walking distance for restaurants and bars. As Jamie said in her information, you will hear and feel the noise from Lucky’s Bar below. So if you plan on being out all night and not expecting much sleep till after 2:00 am, great place. We were not able to sleep till after 2:00 am. I was here Friday night so I’m not sure of how much noise there is during the week. But we were warned so I can’t blame Jamie. Great place overall, depending on your plans."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Jamie was a very good host. Answered all my questions and was accommodating.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had a blast in Athens. Loved our stay there. Apartment was conveniently located near shops, restaurants and bars. Everything was perfect. Very clean and had everything we needed. Oh, and the bed was so comfy. I would totally stay here again!!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place to stay and feel back at home in Athens. The location is unbeatable.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location with easy walkable access to downtown. Tons of restaurants and bars nearby. It is right above a bar, but I didn’t find that to be too bothered. I heard it one night, but not the other. For the location, I would say it is worth dealing with the noise. Everything was very clean, the bed was comfortable, and the host was responsive and helpful with figuring out parking, which was easy enough. I would stay again, for sure."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,I loved it so much I booked again ❤️
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This is the perfect place to stay for a night out in Uptown Athens. You can’t beat the location and amenities provided. Jamie communicated very well and provided helpful tips for parking. Definitely plan to stay here again in the future!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This location was perfect for what we were looking for! Located right in the heart of town just steps away from all the bars and restaurants below.

Perfect for a night on the town or visiting friends in Athens. Highly recommend!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was a great place to stay and have close access to the bike path, campus and uptown. We also were able to take our dogs which was an additional plus!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place that I'll be rebooking in the future.
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,Always our favorite place to stay!
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,I’ve stayed here about 4 times now. Always a clean and convenient place for me and a few of my friends to stay. 5/5 stars for sure
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Easily walkable to all the downtown amenities. The front and back patios and yard were great for our dogs. Michelle was a great host.
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Great place, wished for a longer stay!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location is stellar, has enough parking, the deck and porch are great spaces, what more can I say? There is just something magical about having a house in Athens and this one has been really well cared for. I would recommend it to anyone and we can’t wait to stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Location was perfect for our swim meet at OU. Much more comfortable than staying in a hotel room. Will most likely stay again for future swim meets
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"The property was as described and the host was responsive. Good location to Uptown Athens (it is potentially walkable in good weather, probably about 15 minutes at a quick pace). It was nice to be able to stretch out in a comfy home rather than being stuffed into a hotel room with our family while we visited our OU student. Parking was close and handy. Would stay again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Everything was great
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"Fantastic Place.

Great location, super clean and well stocked with everything we needed. Parking was easy and plentiful (and in Athens that is saying something!). I would recommend this place to anyone visiting the area."
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"LOVED this place! A group of us OU alumni stayed the weekend and it was everything we hoped for and more. Easy walk to court street, parking was amazing, nice spacious rooms, 10/10 stay!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"House was tidy. Bathroom w shower was well appointed w plenty of towels, shampoo/conditioner.
Stairs for upstairs are steep and a little shorter than normal. Just be aware for older guests. There is a bedroom in main level so we put our 20 something’s upstairs.
It’s awesome having JackieOs behind the house….so fun to hang out there. Neighborhood across the street great to walk our dogs.
Would stay again!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The ideal home in Athens for a family vacation.
From check-in to check-out, Michelle is highly communicative and responsive, making the stay simple. The house is furnished with everything you need for a comfortable stay, and we appreciated both the large deck and the cozy rooms. Easily reachable on the edge of Athens, the area is quiet and relaxing. Campus and downtown are nevertheless within walking distance."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful reunion weekend in a wonderful space.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay with family here! Excellent location, especially if you enjoy Jackie O’s right across the street. Very walkable to downtown Athens. Would love to return!"

2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Thank you! The house was close to our family.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was exactly what we were looking for.
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"We had a very nice stay in Athens and Michelle was very easy to commute with. The shower in the bathroom was a little dirty, but I contacted Michelle and she took care of it immediately. The downstairs bed is really creaky which we are not used to. Otherwise, a great area and very comfortable place."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Michelle was extremely friendly and accommodating with our large group - I would absolutely stay again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Michelle’s listing was everything we could’ve hope for! It’s right in Jackie Os backyard and an easy walk uptown! The house was clean and spacious! It was a hot weekend and the AC worked perfectly and made a nice haven to return to. If we ever need another weekend stay in Athens we will certainly stay here again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice clean home to stay. Michelle was easy to communicate with! Great location! Everything within walking distance!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great location and very nice bedrooms. We loved our stay and being able to walk to Jackie O’s. Would definitely love to stay again next time we make a trip to Athens!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place and excellent location!
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"The house was very clean, spacious, and everything we expected. It is walkable distance from campus and uptown Athens. If you have more than 3 guests and want everyone to have a bed, bring an air mattress or cot. There is plenty of room for everyone to sleep. The back patio is a nice addition with ample seating."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home on the edge of town. Peaceful and relaxing.
Brewery behind the house was a plus.
Would definitely recommend staying here!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location next to Jackie Os on Stimson. Had everything we needed.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Athens is smaller and more walkable than we thought, after staying at this place. Very close to the bike path along the Hocking that goes around the outside of campus, so we got to experience a view of OU that you can't get from a car. From a map it looked like it was a ways outside of the uptown area, but its really not far, so we were able to walk just about everywhere. House was well-appointed for our needs, they kept it cool for the hot summer, and there were extra fans set up. The dogs were even happy (and my dogs are pretty picky). Will stay there again!"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,So close to uptown Athens! It was a perfect place for a reunion with our friends!
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Very nice host. Great location for anyone visiting Ohio U!

There were so many little ""bonus"" details throughout -incredibly thoughtful and made you feel like you were at home - such as extra blankets in the family room, kitchen spices, coffee supplies in the cabinet, and loved the sink upstairs in the hallway between the 2 bedrooms. While we were not outside to enjoy the deck - we all commented how nice it was and also convenient to Jackie O's taproom - literally across the backyard! Additionally, Michelle was fantastic - easy to communicate with, responded promptly and sent us all the necessary info with detailed but simple instructions! Highly recommend!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Michelle was a great host and her place was a great stay in Athens! It is spacious and very close to the Jackio’s tap room.
The house is just far enough from campus and where most student housing is, that it’s very quiet, but just close enough that everything is very walkable on campus.
This place had easy check in, accessible parking, and a homely feeling.
Amenities included towels, coffee maker, games, and little extras in the kitchen and fans in the bedrooms.
Definitely recommend for a weekend whether as alumni visiting Athens or if it’s your first time to the area. We stayed in the winter time, but would definitely stay again in the summer to enjoy the porch and bring our dogs, as the place dog friendly."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location in Athens. Right behind one of the best breweries in Ohio and a convenient walk to downtown. Also just two blocks from a really nice walking/running path that runs along the river in both directions.

Being able to use Michelle’s home to allow him a family Thanksgiving is sooo awesome. We are all thankful to Michelle and for the use of her home.

Wish we could have stayed longer."
2022-09-01,4,Group trip,"Super easy communication and check-in/out with Michelle! She was so wonderful and helpful. This place was cute and located across the street from the Taproom at Jackie O's, if you are a beer fan. The bed in the lower level bedroom was a little noisy getting in and out for some reason, but we slept just fine and had enough space for at least 6. Be advised the second bathroom is just a water closet, meaning no shower or tub, so if you are having a bigger group, the line for the shower can get a little long! Otherwise, a fab place to stay in the Athens area, for sure! Thanks Michelle!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is a great option and much better than a hotel! The house is spacious and beautifully decorated. The location is very convenient for Jackie O’s Taproom and the bike trail and just a 10-15 minute walk to campus and uptown.

The beds are very comfortable and towels plentiful. Guests should be aware that two of the three bedrooms are on the upper level, but both bathrooms are on the lower level. There is a sink in the upstairs hallway, but the toilets are downstairs. Not a problem for our group, but for some people this might be an issue.

2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great getaway for NYE at Michelle’s house! It was clean and the location was perfect. You could walk to campus and along a path against the water and it was lovely! If you are looking for a place to stay in Athens, this is a fantastic option. It was also in the backyard of Jackie O’s Taproom and Brewery which was a major bonus! Would definitely stay there again!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house is very lovely and with awesome amenities. Nice touches like coffee, tea, basic cooking supplies, food storage supplies etc. house is newly remodeled and well decorated. It’s close to Jackie O’s and the bike path. I would love to come back in warmer weather!"

2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a comfortable stay here during Thanksgiving weekend, visiting Hocking Hills State Park. We were a party of six adults and four kids. This is a newly renovated house with new appliances, cookware ,fixtures,beds and beddings. Rooms are tastefully decorated giving an impression of small boutique hotel. There are board games and cards to keep adults and kids occupied. House has one full bathroom and a 1/2 bathroom which worked well for us. There are enough cooking utensils, cups and plates but there is no dishwasher washer, which would have been convenient.The best part is the wraps around deck, this can wil be an excellent space to gather around in spring and summer.Property is located next to a taphouse, sonic and KFC are also across the street. Overall we enjoyed our stay,kids had enough room to play around, and adults were happy chatting, cooking or eating. We would recommend this place to people visiting Athens or nearby areas."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a perfect place to stay in Athens. Easy walk to uptown and campus. This is a newly renovated house and is pristine!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jana was very responsive to any texts! Everything was very high quality! Very neat and organized! Extremely clean. Room darkening curtains were wonderful. The porch swing was delightful! If we are ever back in the area we will definitely stay again! Highly recommend:-)
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Private apt in Athens with a clean crisp feel. The hosts are kind and responsive.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This stay was a great walk to downtown and perfect space for two. Parking right next to the place was a huge plus! Easy to get in and very clean.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great Location, plus convenient parking! Compact unit but everything you need in one place. We also enjoyed sitting on the front porch swing. We could hear the above unit renters some when walking around but that was expected in being in an older remodeled home."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! The neighborhood was quiet and the porch swing was a great place to relax in the evening. It is a short walk to Court St and many places on campus. I look forward to staying there again when I am in town.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed another great stay in this cozy studio. It’s nice to know there’s a home away from home available close to everything. Looking forward to coming back again soon.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful stay that is close enough to the action, but far away for some peaceful relaxation. There's so many amazing things to list out that I'm not sure were to begin. Greg and Jana were gracious hosts that checked up on us during our stay to make sure everything was going well and went above and beyond. The space itself is wonderful and quaint. We loved the porch with swing in the front and we made it our routine to always enjoy a cup of coffee or tea outside in the morning, and during our routine we would hear the birds chirping and saw a couple of deer walking around. The amenities were very well stocked, including many kitchen appliances that one could need as well as in the bathroom. The washer and dryer in the bathroom was amazing and a great plus. Lastly, the parking right next to the airbnb and the ""Guide book"" provided with a lot of information about the amenities and Athens itself was amazing! Hoping to stay here during my many visits to see my Bobcat Sis."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Greg and Jana take such good care of their studio and their guests. I will always try to come here first because of their kindness, the location, wonderful linens, fantastic hot shower and the washer/dryer. The weather took a turn and Greg and Jana reached out to make sure we were ok, provided a scraper for the car and attended to the steps and walkway. Feels like a home away from home. I have another stay booked!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice listing. Close to uptown, nice area. Hosts were very responsive to questions. Would recommend."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"My daughter was in an impossible roommate situation at OU, and with finals coming up needed a place where she could sleep and have someplace quiet to focus and study I reached out to Jana and Greg to see if they would allow an 18 year old to stay in their lovely apartment for 2 weeks and trust that she would take care of the place, and Jana responded with kindness and compassion that her daughter has a similar experience and would allow my daughter to stay at the apartment. She was the angel we both needed!
The apartment itself is beautiful and spotless. My daughter said it was comfortable and quiet. In our case, the walkability to campus and town were essential since my daughter didn’t have a car at school. Jana checked in with her a few times to make sure she was ok and the whole process of checking in and out was A+ due to great communication and flexibly. Next time I visit my daughter at school, I’ll be staying at the apartment if it’s free! Thank you Jana and Greg!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Greg and Jana’s apartment is well appointed and very inviting. In addition to the beautifully renovated apartment, which was built around the turn of last century, they provided an interesting history of the area and great recommendations for activities and dining."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"16 Foster Place is a wonderful place, and Greg & Jana are wonderful hosts! I'm an Ohio University alumnus and booked their place for Homecoming weekend. It's an excellent location within walking distance to many restaurants, bars, Uptown, and campus yet just far enough away to be peaceful.
The place was beautiful inside and out and had everything I needed for my weekend stay. It was kept immaculate and was very welcoming. I especially enjoyed sitting on the porch swing and watching the students hang out and have fun. I wish I could still keep up with them!
Greg & Jana are very responsive and accommodated my special requests. They checked in to make sure all was going well. Wonderful people and wonderful hosts! I will definitely keep them in mind for future Homecoming stays."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was beautiful: very clean, well decorated and stocked with toiletries and other essentials. It is located a short walk from campus and downtown Athens. We were in town for a weekend of hiking and, with the state parks only a short drive away, this place offered us the best of both worlds. Greg and Dana’s clear directions made finding the place and checking in a breeze. They also gave us some great recommendations on places to eat and bike/hike nearby!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in Athens so that we could bike on the Hockhocking Bicycle trail. (highly recommend )
We stayed two nights and it was delightful! We loved sitting on the back deck , looking across the wooded valley. It was very private & reminded us of a bird sanctuary!
The studio apartment was very clean and refreshing! We had everything we needed! It was so relaxing! I highly recommend this Airbnb! It was a short drive to the trail. There are many restaurants, a great bike shop in plenty of places to pick up supplies. We loved every minute of our getaway!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exceeded our expectations! Clean, quiet, and private. HVAC heated cabin quickly, immediate hot water, and bed was comfortable. Sumit was nearly immediately responsive when we had a question. If you need a piece of cookware that isn’t in the unit ask him and he may have it in the main house and might loan it for your stay. If you like walking the campus is a short 2.1 miles with only one relatively short incline. We will return when we are in the area for sure!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fantastic stay. Small place, with a nice porch for your morning coffee out back. Spacious shower, nice kitchen and full size fridge.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice quiet neighborhood
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really loved staying here during our time in Athens. Easy to find, but remote enough that you don’t feel like you’re in the city. Everything was super accessible, and the property was so nice - peaceful, calm, clean, and well-appointed. Would stay again without any reservations."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Sumit is the perfect host.
I ended up having to switch my stay to a different day. Sumit had no problem with the late notice and messaged me right away that he had arranged everything for us.
The apartment was as described, and very clean. The amenities were fabulous.
We will definitely be staying with Sumit again! I would give him above five stars, if I could."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great place to stay

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed probably at around 6 different Airbnb ‘s in the Athens area when visiting OU. This place by far was the nicest! The neighborhood was beautiful and peaceful. The location to the campus couldn’t be beat. It is really only 2 miles away.. It was like a peaceful efficiency apartment, very quiet with a beautiful deck, overlooking the woods below. Sumit was very accommodating on check in time which made it a very clear choice for me. If I needed a place to stay in Athens in the future, and this place was available this of course, would be my first choice!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location was nice, the room very comfortable and Sumit was helpful and prompt in communications. I enjoyed my stay and would stay again!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Excellent accommodation! Beautiful, new and spotless!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Both Sumit's photos and list of amenities create an accurate description of what to expect. This is a clean, new cabin in a lovely and peaceful subdivision. Not having to deal with in-town traffic or worry about parking was delightful -- yet all the assets of Athens are just minutes away. Despite the simple, one-room accommodations, it was surprising how many nice little touches were thoughtfully available -- extra comforters, iron and small ironing board, instant oatmeal and coffee and tea choices, maps and booklets about the area, generous portions of shampoo, gel, soaps, dish detergent, etc. This was the perfect place for two tired travelers to crash, and sipping my coffee on the deck on a pretty fall morning revived me for another day. Sumit's communications were friendly and helpful, but never obtrusive. Our privacy was respected, yet we knew Sumit was just a text away. Thank you!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Adorable space. Had just what we needed to visit our son at Ohio University. Very close to campus. Loved the coffee available and great that there was ice in the freezer. Will be back!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Another great stay at the cabin. I alway enjoy my visits to Athens, and the cabin."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, comfy studio and quiet location. The bed felt like memory foam so it was very comfortable for us. (I have chronic pain so it was good for me.) Sumit is very fast to respond to questions or to help with anything. He even allowed us to remove something from the place that was giving me an allergy headache, and said he would just leave it out for good.
The deck to sit outside was a nice addition although it was 33°-40° the mornings we were there so didn't use it as much.
The kitchen has enough to cook simple meals with, but it isn't set up for anything elaborate like a Thanksgiving dinner.
The location is just about 8-10 minutes drive from a great variety of restaurants in the downtown Athens area, or heading to a grocery store. We stayed here to go on day hikes in Hocking Hills, which was about 30-45 minutes through some lovely countryside. The costs of staying in the Athens area were far better and also offered fun places to eat, get coffee, etc. Highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,was a perfect place.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Very close to OU which is what we needed. Everything was great. Comfortable and quiet.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very nice, quiet place to stay. We loved having easy access to Athens without having to stay in a busy area. The place its self is very clean. The host was very clear with his communication. Great shower, spotless little guest house. Very nice."

I can't wait to stay again! I'll definitely be back. Thank you, Summit, for another SPECTACULAR stay!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,An excellent peaceful stay as always.

The kitchen was well-equipped with a kuerig coffee maker. We will stay again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was the perfect place to stay after moving our kids into OU for the start of the semester. It was immaculate & comfortable. We were able to sit on the deck at night to unwind after the chaos of moving, to drink a coffee. Can’t say enough as to how kind of a host Sumit was in reaching out to say his cabin was ready early, if needed. Many thanks!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stayed here the night before moving our son back into OU, so our car was packed full and we had a late check-in.

2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay located in a quiet neighborhood just outside of Athens! To no fault of Sumit's own, we had plenty of rain during our stay. The back porch provided us with the opportunity to enjoy the outdoors/ weather while enjoying the local wildlife. The only problem we had encountered with was the thin mattress as we were able to feel the metal platform bed frame underneath of us. The kitchen was phenomenal to have during our longer stay and supplied us with all we needed to cook simple meals. The shower was really nice with great water pressure!"

The place was immaculate and very thoughtfully appointed. While it was small, it had everything that we needed and was a great way to avoid the price-gouging that the local hotels do around event weekends in Athens.

We especially enjoyed the rear deck with views of the lovely backyard. We saw deer grazing on the hill in the evening and heard several different types of birds singing in the morning.
Above all Sumit was a great host. He communicated quickly, let us check in early, and was available if needed but completely unobtrusive."

Summit was more than helpful and accommodating with my weekend needs and stayed in contact with me continuously. The forecast called for extremely high winds one day during my stay and he made sure to offer me an alternative parking idea to keep my car safe from damage. As a female traveling alone, I felt extremely safe. This location is perfect while visiting my daughter at OU. I will definitely be staying here again on my return visits! Thank you, Summit!!"

We enjoyed the fire pit and my kids did build a tee pee fort with all the big sticks they found. I think we left it up and sorry if that was a problem. They had a ton of fun playing in the wilderness. Beds were clean and cozy and hot tub was nice in the evening. We grilled out one night and didn't have a lighter but we got one and all was well. Thank you for the stay. We will surely tell our friends of this place and we more than likely will be back since we have a college student who attends OU. Thanks again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a really nice weekend stay at Timarie's place. We had plenty of space, the beds were very comfy, and the proximity to beautiful sights was awesome. The townhouse is also a very short distance to downtown Athens - best of both worlds.

2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"My daughter and I stayed at Timarie’s rental home while we were in the area for my daughter’s two days of college horse shows. While we were at the stables for most of the trip, the beds sure felt good after a long day of horse showing. The house was very clean, the beds were very comfortable and plenty of linens and towels were provided. The hosts were very responsive and friendly in their replies. The home is in a secluded area which was just the peaceful tranquility that we needed after the busyness of our days."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Vince was extremely accommodating. We got there a bit early and he let us to check in early as he was finishing up cleaning from previous guest. The space was clean and had plenty of room. Beds were comfortable and we appreciated the use of a dog bed for our pup and the washer and dryer for our college kid's laundry. Wifi is fast and reliable-even surrounded by woods in a rural setting, so if you have work to do or just don't like being disconnected, this is a plus. We used the space to just have some quiet down time with our OU son, so we made use of the TV (has Roku so we streamed our own Netflix and Youtube TV accounts), watched a couple movies and brought groceries in to make our own meals. We had a restful, quiet visit. Vince was very responsive and got back to us quickly when we had questions via airbnb messaging. Close to Strouds Run State Park, so we got in a nice hike with the pup. Expect a 15-minute drive if you need to get to campus. Overall, a positive experience!"

2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"The place was easy to find. It was super clean and new. The beds were comfortable. Good TV (they have a Roku), and the Wifi worked well. If it hadn’t been 8 degrees while we were there over the holidays we would have hung out on the nice porch. We did not spend a lot of time there because we were visiting family in the area.

The Airbnb was very easy to find, especially with the directions provided by the host. It was close to Athens with enough space for 2 toddlers to run around. They had some children’s book much to the delight of my son! I would book this Airbnb again for a family getaway or a girls trip."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed prior to 2 students auditioning at OU for music programs, so being able to easily walk to campus was a plus. We were pleased there wasn’t too much late night noise even being in the center of “uptown” but feel that may have been due to being close to finals week! Bed were comfortable! We could see ourselves staying here again if we become Bobcats!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jamie’s place is in the perfect location for your visit to Ohio University.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Host was wonderful. Clean and exactly like the pictures
2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"Jamie was excellent and very responsive! It was easy to access, including parking. The beds were comfy and clean. I went for a college visit with my 17-year-old son, another parent, and their college-bound kid. The location was right in the middle of uptown, which was super. However, as an alum, I should have realized that the Thursday before Halloween—or any Thursday—would be noisy, and it was, including the downstairs bar emptying its glass recycling at 4 am. But that's just a heads-up for future renters rather than a critique of the place, which was clean and stocked, even if oddly laid out (the family room is quite narrow! but also, pop tarts!) The price is steep, but I think that reflects Airbnb and its hidden fees—it ended up double what was initially listed."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location. Close to everything and had parking!
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Just what our group needed. Great uptown convenience. Would recommend to any OU alum.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Only came for one night following a wedding in South Carolina. we live 3 and half hours north of Athens and decided to stay for one night to spend a little time with our freshman at OU.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, clean and spacious. Highly recommend"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jamie's Airbnb is the perfect place to stay if you are visiting OU. We parked in the parking garage a place away and paid via app. added time as needed ( there are 10hr parking floors) and we didn't have to deal with parking again since we walked everywhere. Jaime stocks her Airbnb with everything you could need. My friend had forgotten her contact solution, she was ready to pull out her glasses when she discovered that Jaime had thought of that as well. This is the second time I've stayed here and will do so again whenever I'm in town."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jamie was a great host, and the apartment was very comfortable for our family of four. A few things to note: we could hear some music from Lucky’s, the recycle truck woke us up at 4am when it upended the dumpster, and the beer restocking truck woke us up at 7am while restocking Lucky’s.. None of this is Jamie’s fault, but you should know to expect it."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location by the diner. Everything is in easy walking distance. The apartment is giant with lots of sleeping space. just one bathroom so you'll need to plan ahead if you're with a group. And you'll have to pay for parking unless you're there on a weekend but then you can park in a university lot and walk to the apartment. It's pricey for a single or a couple but if you're with friends or other family to share the cost It's ideal!

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ideally located close to downtown; five to ten minute walk to most anywhere downtown.
Off street parking was an excellent feature. The garage is small; a mid sized or compact car will easily fit. I drive a Prius and had no issues parking in the garage.

I plan to stay again during future visits to Athens."

I highly recommend and would definitely stay again.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was perfect location to get to Ohio University. About a 5 min drive to the aquatic center, where my daughter had her District Meet. The house was spacious and remarkably clean for an older style home. Kitchen was fully stocked. Nice touch with providing a tray of snacks and a variety of different Keurig cups for the coffee maker. All amenities were updated and functional. We appreciate being able to choose our own passcode, which made it so much easier to remember rather then having to search my phone for it! Great stay and would recommend to everyone."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Bryan served us very well! The house has a great location, close to the Campus of OU and nearby cafes and supermarkets. Casa impecavel and the exclusive pub was an extra! Very good for my family. We'll be back!"

I stayed there with my wife and daughter visiting our son at OU. We loved it, especially the massive entertainment room in the basement and outdoor pool area !! I had trouble leaving the basement and even enjoyed my coffee down there watching college football game day on Saturday morning sitting at the bar. We cannot wait to stay there again in the future! OU OH YEAH!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thanks Anne for hosting us. We had a good time.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a perfect stay to visit OU with our daughter! Quiet, restful, and clean situated in a beautiful property with the ability to walk on a road through pretty and hilly fields. Well appointed kitchen with coffee and tea supplies, and a recently renovated bathroom."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Cute farm style home that was perfect for our family after a long drive. Cute farm house decor and homey little touches added through out the place. Loved spending time out on the deck while the dogs were able to wander around in the fenced front area. Loved our stay here and was exactly what we needed!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,She really thought of everything! We would love to stay again. Had such a nice relaxing time
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Needed somewhere to stay for my son’s last baseball game at Ohio university that was close to the University and had enough room for our family. Perfectly priced, very clean, she worked with me for an early check in since my son’s game was moved up due to upcoming weather. Very accommodating. Loved that the place was so pet friendly. Fantastic experience for our family."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved our stay and having a fenced yard is a must for us with 2 dogs. Very close to OU and convenient location not in town but not buried in the woods. We were moving our daughter into her first off campus house from out of town and we were exhausted by the end of the day. Going back to the peace and quiet to sit on the porch and relax was amazing! The traffic did not bother us at all. Took my dogs up the trail for a walk and saw a deer. So beautiful! The extra perks of the house were a pleasant surprise! Stocked coffee station and snacks. Thank you so much for sharing your beautiful home with us! Highly recommend!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,a very clean and homey space! It was the perfect getaway
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a great time!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a weekend stay for graduation. It was so nice to be able to bring our dogs. We actually spent most of our time enjoying the covered porch at night.
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,The house is very detailed. Everything expected in a household is available and easy to access. I was there with my family for my graduation ceremony.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything about our stay was wonderful, we only spent the night there just traveling through on our way south. We arrived after dark and the house was easy to find and get into. Would love to stay here again when we have more time! The home is beautiful."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay at The Creek was amazing! The house is homey, like one would imagine an old well loved farmhouse would be, but with plenty of technology features and high end appliances. It is surrounded by beautiful nature, and my daughters loved visiting the horses at the top of the hill.
It is a short 10-15 minute drive to OU which was a bonus for us. We have 3 more years with our girls at OU so we hope to get the chance to stay here again!
Anne couldn’t have been a better host. She is very responsive and gave great directions. Very friendly!❤️"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We booked Anne’s place because we came to town to tour Ohio University with my high school senior. We were amazed at how perfect the location was! It was easy to get to and is only about an 8-10 minute drive from the campus yet was quiet and removed from town. We brought our family (including our dog) and enjoyed the cozy fenced in front porch area all weekend.
Everything in the air bnb was clean and spacious. We loved how well stocked the kitchen was. Especially the coffee bar! I’ve personally stayed at many air bnbs and never had a kitchen truly have everything you needed to cook a full meal but Anne’s place had it all. The cabinets and drawers were even labeled to let you know where to find everything. It was such a thoughtful touch.
We enjoyed walking up the hill to feed the horses apples by day and at night the top of the hill was the perfect place to stargaze.
Anne was a friendly and great communicator.
We hope to enjoy more visits to “The Creek” in the future!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Anne's place was perfect for visiting Ohio University. great location in the country while still close to town. very nice amenities as well. Would highly recommend for anyone looking to stay in the area.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay here! Great house and very good communication with the host. Thank you!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best bnb’s I’ve stayed at! Exactly as described, true to photos. In the kitchen everything was labeled, so no need to open every drawer when looking for something. Anne’s kitchen was the best well stocked kitchens of my bnb stays. If I wanted to cook a chicken or a lobster I don’t think I would have had any problems and I can’t say that is true for many places. Very comfortable, we felt right at home. Plenty of room and I loved her decorating style! Anne is a great communicator, any questions we had, she responded immediately. We were able to have our dinner on the porch every night, which was lovely. Thank you for you hospitality Anne, better than any hotel❣️"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Great stay and a short drive to downtown Athens. Anne was a great host and very accommodating! The home was perfect for our group and had everything we needed 😊
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"In town to visit the university. Anne's place was a nice place to relax after all the walking we did. it was peaceful, private, and the porch was perfect for coffee and listening to the birds. We would stay again. Anne was friendly and responsive."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"It's always a great time to find a nice, quiet, peaceful spot to call home for a few day. Anne's place was just the right spot. Thank you for the ability to walk the dead-end private drive which lead up into the hills and beautiful views. Best regard!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute little home perfect for your stay in Athens. I loved the trail walk! Very close to OU campus.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just a beautiful home to get away from every day life
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great stay! The kitchen was fantastic!
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"Very peaceful! Anne’s house felt like home immediately and was the perfect combination of private and removed but also close to town. We enjoyed visiting the horses and walking the trail and slept very well. Even with the house being located right next to the road, we didn’t hear any road sounds at all."
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Anne’s place matched the description of her home. We were in town for a visit to Ohio University and it was the perfect location. It was outside town but, only minutes away driving. We had our dog and it was nice to be able to take him for a walk up the private drive instead of on the busy street. Also super convenient to have the fenced in yard. The sound machines help drown out the sound of the passing cars."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I really loved the home and the property! The house was decorated with a farm style touch and very cozy. The house was very clean and had everything we needed. There were trails in the woods behind the home that my dog and I walked 3 to 4 times per day.
The location was great too! It’s located just a tad over 10 minutes outside of town. I would love to stay there again. I bet it’s gorgeous in the fall!
Anne is also very friendly and communication was great."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Anne's place was great! It was clean and cozy. Anne is very accommodating. I wish we could have met her but our stay was too brief. If we ever end up in Athens again we would definitely stay with Anne!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place for a family getaway ❣️
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Anne is a very responsive host and the house if very comfortable. Lots of extras on the property for people who love the outdoors.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Anne was super—a very gracious host!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Creek House is a beautiful and private place to stay if you are visiting the Athens area, especially with dogs. The house has everything you need and has very cool decor inside. The yard surrounding the house is fully fenced in. You can also walk the property, which is a working farm. It's only a 10 minute drive into downtown Athens and OU's campus. Anne was very responsive when we reached out. We hope to stay here again if we visit Athens in the future!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Easy access to Athens. The place was welcoming and clean. We walked the private farm path up the hill to the other side and back (almost 2 miles). Enjoyed the porch and thought the electric fireplaces were cozy. Anne’s directions and responses were prompt and helpful. We would definitely stay here again.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is a hidden gem. So quaint, peaceful, homey. Very close to Ohio University."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"second time staying here, still a great little spot.
Love everything about this place, it's just adorable and not far from Athens and Ohio University."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was our second time staying here! It is close to OU where we visit our daughter. This is our favorite place to stay when we visit Athens. We even had friends surprisingly staying next door to us on the property. Highly recommend if you are visiting Athens.
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"The house was absolutely incredible!! Super beautiful, lots of amenities, and a great space to have a group weekend! We also had a great time checking out all the cool stuff Anne has around the house. Would 100% recommend staying here!! :)"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"It was the perfect stay for our family. Anne was helpful and provide great information. The first thing my son said when we walked in was, ""How does she keep it so clean?"" Would definitely recommend."
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Had a wonderful stay for December graduation at OU. You will love the bathroom and its amenities. Everything was clean and comfortable.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Anne’s place was such a nice surprise! We had to make a last minute booking, and im so glad this place was available. It was a cute little farmhouse, with lots of cute eclectic decor. Honestly just the epitome of the area. The house had plenty of blankets. Super soft towels. And plenty of places to relax.
Anne was super responsive and allowed us to check in early and check out late.
Just a heads up about this property - if you are coming with larger dogs, the yard is pretty small. This is made up for by having trails on the property for a long walk.
Also - this is an old farmhouse, so be prepared for differing temperatures throughout the house, especially in the winter.
This house is also located right on a busy road.
Overall, this was such a great place to stay. Highly recommend!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We have stayed at about 25 Airbnb locations in Athens, and this one really stood out.
There is a very open layout that made the property feel very spacious and livable.
Yeah, they’re super good the kitchen had absolutely every amenity, including Keurig coffee maker, popcorn, complementary chips and water, and updated appliances.
The property is super peaceful. It’s technically by the road, but it is completely fenced, and we didn’t hear a single car the whole time we were there.
Anne was super friendly, responsive, and flexible.
It seems very rural, but it’s only about a nine minute drive to the university and downtown.
We really loved this stay!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home was full of character, clean and a perfect spot for Thanksgiving. There were special touches like a pie plate, flowers on the table and bottles of water, not to mention the great coffee bar!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Creek is incredibly comfortable and has absolutely everything . I travel with a couple of containers of must-have or might-need items which didn’t even need to come inside. The towels and bed linens all passed my rigid cotton standards, there were enough kitchen towels to keep paper towel usage to a minimum and let me tell you about the heated toilet seat!!
The water pressure is great and the shower included amenities not only for humans but shampoo for doggies as well.
The washer and dryer are in the bathroom which added extra “counter” space for my cosmetic case, super nice!
Our pups were comfortable here as the location is quiet and restful.
This was our first time in Athens(visiting friends) but I will long to visit this space again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The place was charming and perfect for pets and family. We were close to town, not in town. We were there for a family wedding at the University Inn so it was the perfect spot to relax and still enjoy all of the wedding festivities…I would stay there again!!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place. We will definitely be back!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Worth every dollar and second we spent!
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful home, 10/10 would recommend"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Anne was an awesome host. The house was loaded with any accommodation we needed and more. Would stay again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is our second stay and we loved it just as much as the first time. The cottage is so quaint and quirky and makes you feel at home. We will be back.
2023-10-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The home was difficult to locate in the darkness & loud at night since it sits right on the highway. Because of the multi-level flooring, walking through the house at night to get to the restroom, is hazardous. Rooms are very spacious & clean, lots of soft towels!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay to visit our daughter at OU. Anne was great with communication and even allowed us an early checkin! Very hospitable!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Our stay at The Creek was more than perfect! Location is amazing as it’s within 15 mins of anything you’d need. Anne thought of everything for her guests! The porch is a perfect spot for a morning coffee and/or evening drink by the fire. Would love to stay again.
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Great stay! Great spot! Worked out perfectly for us. Would stay again! Anne is an awesome host.
2023-10-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Nice stay in Athens, especially if bringing pets. The walkable trail and gated porch made it easy to wear out dogs."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The Creek was perfect for our family. We stayed with our two dogs to see our daughters at OU. We just loved the house and had the best time hanging out as a family. The house is very charming and has everything you need. Great location - so close to OU. We would love to stay there again!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place, thanks!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful home. Quiet and peaceful setting. Love the extras- coffee, snacks, mini water bottles, bath products. Updated appliances. Unique layout. HUGE walk in shower. Just a few of my favorite things about this place. Hope to visit again"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This is my second time to the creek and it does not disappoint. Easy to get to/from OU and clean/comfortable. Thanks again Anne
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a nice nite at the farm before OU move-in day. Anne was very responsive to our questions. We took a long walk on the farm road which made for a nice evening. The house is close to the road so you can hear cars go by, but the inside is lovely and comfortable. Feels like grandma’s house’ where you immediately feel at home. The pull out couch was very comfortable and provided a nice restful night. We’ll be back over the next four years, I am sure!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Awesome as always. Definitely the best place I’ve ever stayed! Would highly recommend to everyone.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay in your eclectic cabin. We already booked a follow up visit and cannot wait.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very organized. Overall good stay.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,We had a great time staying here! Anne answered any of my questions right away and the house was very cozy and homey!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the roominess of the house, walking the trails, and the location for visiting Athens and OU."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is totally delightful and cozy. Had everything we needed for our family and a wonderful porch for a quiet evening hang. I would have loved to stay another night if I could.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This house is a TREASURE. We were moving halfway across the country after a short term assignment, and this house was an absolute haven. Our dogs were able to enjoy the yard, there were chips and water bottles waiting just inside, the house was clean and comfortable — it was a dream! I cannot recommend this place enough. Anne answered any questions we had very quickly and the check in was smooth and simple. I could go on forever, but the main point is that this house is outstanding and we hope to come back someday."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"House is very nice and roomy and well-stocked. Porch is excellent and we spent a lot of time on it enjoying the outdoor space. Shower is huge. Property is amazing, great for walking the dogs and hilly views and star gazing. Location is convenient. Only part that made me nervous is how busy the road is next to the house. Speed limit is 55 and vehicles fly by even faster. Not a huge deal but something to be mindful of if you have dogs or kids. Overall a great stay!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"An absolutely awesome place to stay. Really spacious living area and kitchen, outside patio is gorgeous and the bedrooms are great as well. Highly recommend."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Easy check in, beautiful place, and close to OU campus!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This house was perfect for our family of four traveling with 2 dogs. Great to have a fenced yard and lots of space. Hiking up the hill with the dogs was nice. We did not really eat in, but the kitchen was nicely set up and stocked. Would stay there again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great little set up
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved the house, it was decorated very nicely. Clean, but still pet friendly so much so there was dog shampoo in the very massive shower!
Both bedrooms had very comortable queen size beds, the electric fireplaces are a nice touch. TV in one of the bedrooms in addition to the main room. Had a quaint little coffee/tea bar with several teas and coffee options, I did miss having no sugar but there were alternative sweetners if you like those. Brita in the fridge for fresh cold water. Lovely deck area with fairy lights, a fire pit and table and chairs to chill outside at.
We stayed for a very short visit, did a tour at Ohio UNiversity, which was a very easy 9 minute drive from the house! Looked to be plenty of areas to do some hiking.
I would suggest packing a noise maker or small fan, you will eventually get used to it but you could hear some cars driving by, this was not a constant thing just on occasion.
We will definetly stay again when in the area!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time at Anne's farmhouse. It's on the main country road, so very accessible but with no next door neighbors, so it feels very private. We loved the morning and evening walks / hikes with our dog up the farm road / hill to the meadows and farming area - it was beautiful and scenic. The two horses in the barn come out at dusk and are majestic looking. Saw some deer and rabbits too.
The living room furniture could use an upgrade/deep clean but other wise the farmhouse is very nicely done and has all the amenities for a comfortable stay. We will definitely consider coming back."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"I checked in very late and managed to get lost on the way, but Anne was THE kindest and most patient host. She was extremely responsive and made sure I found my way to her place. I don’t think most hosts would have been available at the ungodly hour I messaged her at. The place was clean and thoughtfully stocked. It’s an older home, which does show, but she puts effort into making it homey. The neighborhood is quiet because you’re the only house around, which is nice. I enjoyed eating my breakfast on the patio."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I do not typically write reviews, but Anne was beyond a great host. She went above and beyond, after hours on a Sunday to help find us a veterinarian for our dog before we even made it to her place. I couldn’t recommend Anne, let alone The Creek, enough!"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Very comfortable and unique place! We really enjoyed this as a stop over on a long drive and definitely would stay again.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very comfortable location. I would suggest parents stay in the middle bedroom...kids in the back bedroom. Just a little louder when cars go by in back when windows are open. I would also suggest boots. I failed to remember there would be snakes (I think copperheads) out here in the country of Eastern Ohio. Otherwise, great place...super comfy for pets. Our host, Ann, was terrific."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful creek and homey interior. Recommend!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My family and I stayed for one night while passing through and were so excited to explore the on-site trails. They did not disappoint! The trails were beautiful, calm, and peaceful. The home itself was large, well-stocked, comfortable, and clean. We would recommend it!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Was super comfortable. Had everything we could need plus more. Felt super homey. 10/10 would recommend.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is an excellent location for our OU orientation stay and would be great for any parents/family visiting OU. Anne’s place was stocked with snacks, water, coffee and tea, and even shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. Everything is labeled and easy to find inside. She also has plenty of apps for movie watching. It was clean, affordable, and easy to find. Recommend!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The farmhouse and farm were wonderful! We were able to explore a small piece of the property, and I wish we’d had time to do more. Anne thoughtfully left snacks, bottled water, and coffee pods, and the house was well-stocked with soap, shampoo, conditioner, and other supplies. Anne provided clear instructions for check in and check out. I would come back anytime."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved the stay and the trail to the pastures!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really really enjoyed staying at The Creek! We had tons of space, privacy, and the house was stocked with pretty much anything you could think you would need (which is not common for most places I stay that provide the bare minimum). Everything was clean, the kitchen knives were sharp, there were all kinds of cooking appliances, spices, oil, etc. and we felt very cozy during our stay. Highly recommend to anyone staying in the Athens area!"
2023-06-01,4,Stayed one night,Lovely visit. Our favorite part was walking the land behind the house.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our stay at The Creek House! Anne was so helpful with instructions and making sure we had all that we needed. We enjoyed taking our dog on the walking trail on the property and the close proximity to bars and restaurants in Athens. All of the Hocking Hills trails are also within 45 minutes- 1 hour away, definitely doable for a day of hiking. The house was cool and peaceful and the porch was great for coffee or a glass of wine and a book. We would definitely recommend this listing to anyone who is coming to the Athens area!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great house. A peaceful retreat that's easy to find, quiet, and close to Athens amenities"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our visit. We liked how close it was to Ohio University’s campus.

Having stayed at my share of home rentals, I can’t tell you how much I appreciated the labels on all the light switches and cabinets doors. Also one of the best stocked homes I’ve ever stayed in. Added bonus was the heated toliet seat."

We had a minor toilet issue that Anne responded to right away, and was remedied quickly. Also accommodated an earlier check-in, which was much appreciated. Would definitely recommend and stay again."
