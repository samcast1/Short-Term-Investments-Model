2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my second stay here and it was perfect.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was perfect for my work trip. it was close to where I needed to be and in a quiet neighborhood.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice newer home. Easy stay. Needs more bath towels but wasn't a big deal.
2024-04-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"Naomi was very responsive. The issues I had were:
- The house is really a 3 bedroom home, and the master bed/bath locked off. No real issues there, but just not clear in description
- The house is very bare. The room I stayed in had JUST A BED. Nothing else other than an old mirror on the floor, a few hangers in the closet. I had to bring a dining room chair to the room to act as a night stand. I complained to Naomi, and she said she gives pictures that show this, but it wasn't clear to me that the house was bare and felt very temporary.
- Backyard totally torn up. No outdoor seating, and just a very uncomfortable loveseat in the main room.
- The INTERNET DOWN entire time. I understand that's not the owners fault, but given the house was so uncomfortable, we had no tv, no place to sit outside, the only thing to do was sleep :(
I try to give constructive reviews, people need to understand what they are buying here and i think there is opportunity for simple owner improvement"

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location ! Beautiful and clean home. Only thing I have to say is the bedroom to left, the bed is very uncomfortable. Also blanket was very thin. There was no extra blankets for us to use. All the closet doors where you would assume blankets would be were locked. Everything else was great! Would stay there again!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very comfortable and clean.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I couldn’t imagine a better place to stay in Fernley then Naomi‘s lovely bungalow! Terrific value, wonderfully warm host, and a very comfortable environment! If you’re wandering through northern Nevada and wondering if you should book this place for the night, the answer is absolutely yes!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Naomi’s place was amazing -great location, new house, clean, quiet and comfortable. We had the entire home to ourselves. I highly recommend, and would definitely stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I can not say enough great things about Naomi. She hosted us at her beautiful home for over a week. She has a beautiful home, and by far the cleanest one me and my family have stayed at in Nevada. She was very nice, great communication, and responsive. Her place felt just like home. We will most definitely keep booking her home. I highly recommend. The house is very clean the garage space is amazing and omg I LOVE her kitchen. Very spacious! Thank you Naomi for hosting me and my family!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Naomi was on point and very responsive. Would definitely contacther for another visit next time we come through Fernley!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed while visiting my brother in the Fallon assisted living community. I got much-needed peace & comfort in a beautiful safe place. (I was fine being alone in the house, but I do recommend a lock on the bedroom door. I also recommend a bedside table, and a chest of drawers.) Naomi is a great communicator but amenities are a bit scarce. (She would have helped me if I messaged her, & that is critical and assuring.) There's a Keurig, a few tea pods, & bag of coffee. Couldn't decide about stuff in fridge, so I bought things & left hoping there's a use.) A worker got a wine opener for the house. I got toilet tissue (couldn't find any after the first roll), Kleenex, bottle of spray cleaner, laundry detergent & softener, new Kitchen sponges, paper towels (like I use at home). I appreciated the cool filtered water and excellent Wi-Fi, along with the offer to park in the garage! All in all, folks, this is a 5-star place. I hope Naomi gets lots of guests to enjoy it!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I definitely feel like this airbnb was home away from home. Naomi is such a gracious host and very kind to us. She was so comfortable to be around and gave us our space even though this is her home. My Son, girlfriend and baby were able to spend all the time with me they wanted while I was there. Her home is so comfortable and she makes you feel like it is your own. It was very spacious, clean, comfortable and cool. It was so hot in Fernley so it was nice to have a cool place to spend time with family. The kitchen is well stocked with all you need and a coffee maker that makes great coffee. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to go to Fernley or just passing by. Way better than a motel. Since my son lives there, I will be staying at Naomi's every-time I am there to see my kids. Thank you Naomi for such an awesome place to relax and enjoy family. It is well worth the money. Can't say enough good things about it."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Carrie was very friendly and gave clear instructions. The place was comfortable and quiet. We had a great stay
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"The unit itself was cozy, comfortable, and had everything you would need for a nights stay. Easy, fuss free check in process. I do have to minus 2 stars because of the dogs. It is noted in the air bnb description that there is a dog on the property however note there are 4-5 dogs on this property, which are behind a gate, and bark a lot. I have no issue with friendly dogs and was happy to see them when I first pulled up to the property. However, only 2 of the dogs are friendly seeming and 2 of them seem very aggressive and will snarl and try to bite through the gate as you walk by. The one small dog was particularly aggressive and barked nonstop for the first 3 hours after my arrival. It was a bit unsettling as the small dog was very bothered by my presence and I was nervous it would squeeze through the gap at the side of the gate and attack me as I was unloading my car. The barking began again in the morning at 6am and continued nonstop until I left two hours later."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a cool little spot to stay nice and clean the chairs were nice and the bed was super comfy! Definitely fairly priced.

2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was comfortable,clean and fit our needs. It was easy to find. It was very quiet except for a short time of dogs barking upon arrival and in the morning. It didn’t hinder our sleep. The coffee was good. The surrounding area is dry desert but it’s not too far from Virginia City. The neighborhood view is mostly mobile homes and a few looked in need of repair. Overall it was worth being close to where we needed to visit. Carrie was very responsive."

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was wonderful - Carrie utilized the space so well to make it feel comfortable, spacious, and homely. The AC unit worked great and the bed was super comfortable.

We had a little problem (my fault: misplaced the key), & Carrie was kind & very responsive. You'll be in good hands!

2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place for us to crash at while traveling. Had just the essentials but that’s all we were looking for! Easy check in and check out, nothing more you could really ask for while on the road :)"
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We needed a place to stay on a road trip and this location was a good place to break up the drive. We didn't know anything about Stagecoach, NV. It seems like a subdivision of mostly mobile homes, some better than others. Carrie's place was a nice home on the highest part of the highest street. The view would have been nice but for the neighbors across the street (lots of various vehicles.) It was very quiet, the sheets and bed were very comfortable. Perfect for the few hours we spent there."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved the Tumbleweed Inn! Great stepping stone for a road trip across Nevada. Stars were brilliant at night.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This Airbnb was so cozy, I was tempted to stay an extra night bc of its charm and comfort. Let’s talk about pillows! Thanks Carrie for having not only so many but so FLUFFY. I must of dreamt of cotton candy and marshmallows all night but how would I know? I slept so well it just felt like I blinked and then BOOM it’s the am and I’m as refreshed as a pampered poodle coming from the puppy spa.
After checkout, I went to Pyramid Lake from Carries Guidebook and it was breathtaking. Thanks again for hosting my stay and also for having wonderful recommendations!
5 stars, hands down.
Cheers!
Becca."

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The best and probably only place in Stagecoach, Nevada! It provided us a great place to unwind at the end of long days in the field. Although small it provides everything you need to relax and enjoy. The place is kept meticulously clean. The neighborhood was very quite allowing a great night rest."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Extremely cute space and very comfortable! Carrie was very friendly and very communicative. Highly recommend!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Carrie's place was very cute and welcoming! I was traveling through by bicycle and she even had a bicycle pump ready for me and drove me to grab dinner. She is very attentive and her place is clean and offers a lot of privacy/your own entrance.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a wonderful little place to stay! It is very clean, cozy, and functional, is well furnished and has everything you need to decompress after a long day in the desert, at Lake Tahoe, or on the road. Carrie was very nice, it’s in a quiet neighborhood, and it’s dog friendly, too!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie's place is proof that downscale and modest doesn't have to mean dumpy or boring. She's transformed what's basically a section of a doublewide into a cute, craft-filled little home away from home in the high Nevada desert. It's a little ways from away from anything that could be considered a tourist attraction (Virginia City, the closest, is a good 25-minute drive), but after two days in Las Vegas, that was just fine with me."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a cute little place! Cozy and Comfy
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice private apartment perfect for a short stay.
2021-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie is a gem hidden out there in Stagecoach! She was extremely communicative and kind throughout my stay, and even installed a window unit in the apartment as I was concerned that it would be in the 80’s one of the days I was there and I have an old dog who overheats easily. The place was beautifully decorated and she had many thoughtful touches throughout. I loved the big, cozy blue chair in the living room. Initially, I was a little concerned that it would be too “close quarters” to her because it’s an apartment attached to her house, but it didn’t end up being an issue. My dog used the side of the front yard to potty, and there is also a dirt road just down the street from her (about a quarter of a mile down the street on the right) where I was able to take my dog to run each day. When you arrive, don’t be alarmed by the house before her that has a little shack in the back - that’s not where you’re staying! I almost had a heart attack initially, but her house is the (much nicer!) next one down on the right. Hahaha! Have a wonderful trip!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A very nice place to stay! Close to Lake Tahoe and offroading trails :) would stay again.

My dogs loved the adventure."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I escaped the city life and this was the perfect place to spend a nice, quiet week. Very cozy space in a quiet part of town. Love the view of the mountains. The people in the neighborhood are friend. Very communicable to places like Reno, Lake Tahoe, Carson City. There is only a microwave and mini fridge, but the Smith's grocery store has great food in the deli for dinner and lunches. I had never been to this part of Nevada and was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere. Easy check in and out and Carrie checked in on me to see how I was doing."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Carrie's place was the perfect stop between a couple days of long driving. Check-in was smooth, the space was clean, and there were a number of nice extra touches (snacks, water, sanitizer/wipes, coffee, etc). Carrie was also very lax and flexible when we had to change our check-in time due to some delays on our drive. Overall, a great place. Wish we could've stayed longer!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was absolutely wonderful. So clean, and cozy. I slept like a rock and felt so safe there. Would definitely book again. Thanks for everything!"

2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Leslee was great - the place is amazing and has lots of good features. The WiFi didn’t work - I could have probably called Leslee to see if she could fix it but it was after 10pm and I sent a message on the app hoping it would be taken care of by morning. It wasn’t addressed. I don’t know if that was a fluke or not - BUT the security light right outside the window was so bright I had to put a pillow over my head to sleep. It was like daylight the whole night. And the curtains were sheer and the blinds were a very thin white

And she's really friendly, easygoing and accommodating. We stayed for a week and had enjoyed her company and grew fond of her dog, which is chill and friendly. We brought our dog along for the trip, was welcomed to play in her backyard. We appreciate that a lot especially seeing how she keeps the backyard in perfect manicure.
She welcomed our use of her kitchen and rest of the property as if it were our own home! Highly recommend to anyone needing a place to stay in the Reno / Fernley area."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Julie was great, she was very responsive and friendly. She provided us with some cool recommendations near the area. Her place had all the amenities that we needed in order to enjoy our trip.
Red (Julie's beautiful, sweet, strawberry blonde, three legged dog) was an amazing tour guide, she showed us around and took us to the lake where she took a quick swim and dried up in the sun. She made sure we (people, chickens, goats, and dog) were comfortable and safe."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"it was definitely the most interesting place I've ever stayed! Julie was very pleasant. The goats caught me and my dog off guard, but they minded their own business and didn't monkey with anything strapped to my vehicle during my move."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was a great stop on our way to Lake Tahoe. It was peaceful and tucked away from the highway so it felt very safe. The jacuzzi tub was definitely a bonus that we enjoyed a lot but beware of the spiders before you use it!
I would definitely recommend staying here if you get the chance!"
2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"Exterior of cottage & surrounding buildings were not at all inviting - old, dilapidated and ""junky"". There were chicken & goat droppings EVERYWHERE (with accompanying flies) & landscape was only dirt, sand & brush, plus rusty tools & nails laying around in parking areas.
The inside, however, was welcoming, especially the whirlpool tub.
We also played fetch with a sweet 3 legged dog."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was super clean and comfortable, we felt right at home!
Julie was excellent at communicating, even reached out before we arrived to see what time she could expect us. We inquired about bringing our young daughter and not only did she grant access she even made up a bed for her on the Futon.
If you want a clean quiet place near the river this place is for you!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Julie’s place is a great example of air bnb community and brand.
She has at least two spaces she’s renting to travelers and has fixed them up. The kitchen and bath additions are impressive and easy to use.
Everything is clean 🧼 including white sheets and bath towels.
I loved her pup Rhen and the goats on property.
I’m a light sleeper, so I could hear the tenant next door and traffic from I80.
Julie escorted us onto the property and suggested a walk to the river."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Julie was a wonderful host and very welcoming. As a solo female traveler I did feel a little taken aback by the burned out and graffiti covered barn when I arrived, but the space itself was clean & tidy. Once I met Julie I felt good about staying solo & had a relaxing night. Enjoyed meeting the goats."

It most likely purifies the well water; but, it seemed highly concentrated. Julie did post her formula on line. We only needed a short overnight stay and left early the next morning; so, we didn't do much."

Bring water shoes and swimming and picnic gear!
Thanks again Julie"

All my needs were met during my stay and I will book this spot again next time I’m in the area!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Just a short ride from Reno, this is truly a gem out in the open nature. We lived our stay here! It was easy to find, convenient parking in from of the room and ample space to stretch your legs, especially when you have a dog. The river is just a short walk from the room. It is just beautiful there. I especially recommend to go outside in the dark. City folks haven't seen that many starts! We will be back when we come through the area again. Thank you!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to rest and recover on a road trip. Right off the highway, but very peaceful. Had all that we needed to cool down and get a good nights rest.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Julie’s place was just what we were looking for while on the road. Not too fancy, clean, safe, comfortable, private with parking for our unsecured flatbed trailer load. Check in was a breeze and communication was rapid. Cute place, would definitely stay again on our way back through town."

2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Really neat old farm sandwiched between the river and the road. Easy, convenient access to the freeway and both Reno and Fernley. My only small complaint was hearing the semi trucks at night, but once I figured out the fan we slept good. The goats are fun, there's chickens and a friendly doggo that greeted us every time we came in. You can even walk down to the river and skip stones, and if you're lucky the dog will go with you!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stayed been there twice in the last month and a good location for fishing pyramid lake.
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Decent little cottage close to pyramid lake. It even comes with GOATS! not a perfect little cottage but miles better than a hotel. Julie is a good host.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great value! Right on the Truckee River and close to Pyramid Lake.
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Nice place once you are inside (the exterior looked a little run down. Not a big deal) and a convenient location! Didnt get to explore the area as I had to leave early but seemed interesting
2022-02-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"The host entered the space without getting permission. The bathtub had a bad smell coming from it. The remodeled bathroom was really nice. But, overall we had a bad experience here and the host made us feel uncomfortable."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Julie’s place may look a little rough on the outside but it’s a hidden gem. The room is beautifully decorated and very clean and comfortable. Julie was kind and courteous, and her sweetheart of a dog made fast friends with ours. The goats are great entertainment. Overall great place to stop along the Truckee River - highly recommend."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What an awesome find real close to lake pyramid plus the room was awesome too!
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Cute space. The bathtub and shower were both super nice looking. The bed was very comfortable. The whole bean coffee with French press was a nice touch. I felt comfortable and safe during my stay. And Julie was an excellent host. I would stay here again!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was a great place to stay at while passing through the area. Julie was very communicative and I appreciated having wifi access.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect spot for us! Wish we had another day to relax and explore. Great hiking near by and a great, quiet (surprisingly so with vicinity to 80!) retreat with a lovely view of the Zephyr and freight trains rumbling across the river! Goats were friendly!♥️🚂🐐🥾"
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay and we would come again. Julie, is very kind and easy to get a hold. We loved being able to walk and be with the goats and play with her dog outside. My husband threw a stick to play fetch and then they were friends quick. And the jacuzzi was amazing!! Gave a 4 Star only because of a couple corky things. The freezer wasn't very big, so I would buy ice and bring a cooler for frozen goods. The bed is corky, but a great size, good for choosing whichever side you feel more comfortable on. We knew of no tv, but my husband brought a projector and pop up screen and were able to set that up and enjoy some movies during our stay as well. Again, we did enjoy our stay, we really really loved the jacuzzi and the dog was awesome!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely spot, everything I needed for a short stop. Best to arrive in the daylight. The drive can be hard to see at night!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice convenient location. Clean and comfortable cabin 👍🏽👍🏽☺️
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very nice accommodations in a rustic setting. Loved the open ranch with river access and even goats. 10/10 would recommend

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything is exactly as advertised, and Julie is one of the best hosts I’ve had. Very responsive and super pleasant. Nice and quiet, away from the city if that’s what you’re looking for."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely space filled with rustic nostalgia and a patina of an era bygone.
Julie has added personal affects to make it cozy and warm. Sight, sound, smells like coffee beans and tea with a water heater and a coffee press!
Julie was attentive to my eta and was prepared for my arrival! All the towels and linens were cleaned and smelled awesome!
Loved the space - wish I could have hung around longer to enjoy it and the grounds more!
I Love what Julie is doing with this space and encourage all those traveling through to take a break from corporate and the gambling scene and experience ranch style tranquility!!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We stopped just for overnight on our way to Idaho. Great location right off the main road. bed was comfy and host was easy to communicate with. Only thing is watch the doorway coming out of the bathroom we tripped as the floor is uneven.
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Julie was very hospitable during our stay at her Airbnb. She offered ideas on places to go see in the area and things to see on her property. The Airbnb was cute, easy to get to, clean, and ready on time."

2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,It was a nice and easy experience. Exactly what we needed. Right off the 80. It was clean and sweet. We would stay there again.
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,It was over all a good stay. Little did I know there was free range goats (had I known I would have parked completely different) and well I did end up with some damage to my Denali which the front end was just replaced on so all paint was brand new. Just make sure you park front end up to the house so goats can’t get on the hood. It is straight dirt/dust so if you have a nicer car be warmed it will be covered in dirt/dust. The tub was amazing the water is just a little slow to fill up. Show is nice and big with a shelf for shampoo etc. Place was bigger then I was expecting. Quiet/beautiful area though. Right off the freeway which is also nice. Aside from the one mishap it was overall a good stay.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a one-night stopover for us and very much suited our needs. Easy to get to off of I-80, very cozy apartment decorated in an eclectic sort of way, and has the basics you would need. And the king bed was suuuper comfy. Great value!"
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great find just outside the city of Reno.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Comfy spot with a nice ranch feel. Julie was a very easy host and communication was fast and helpful. Super convenient on/off from I 80, making it a great stop on our road trip.
Friendly goats and pupper too!"
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Cozy accommodations in a private setting.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is great and the goats are super cute! Jacuzzi tub is slow to fill, but soooo worth it! The shower is divine and huge. Bed was very comfortable. Conveniently located as well."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"great experience and an awesome property, very kind and communicate and hardworking person."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location and Julie is awesome and helpful.
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,Very peaceful setting. Fun to watch the goats. The cottages are one house that is divided into two roomy cottages. Fernley is just 5 minutes away.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,clean and inexpensive. we walked down to the river. very peaceful
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We got tired of hotels, and your typical Airbnb. Julie’s farm stay offered a different experience where you can walk to the river, greet the goats in the morning, and take a relaxing bath a night. Julie was spot on with her hospitality making sure we find the location, and that our needs are met."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Really great spot and beautiful accommodations. Plus hard to beat the views outside! We were very comfortable with this stop along our road trip.
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,A nice place walking distance to the river!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,always a great time at the property. put the camping chairs in the river and grilled out!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is very cute inside. The place is a little goat and chicken ranch. Then when you get inside the Airbnb it is decorated very modern and comfortable. It has a jacuzzi tub and a huge walk in shower. The kitchen has a huge stainless steel sink. It was spacious with a comfy bed.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The stay at Julie’s is very nice - it doesn’t have a lot of appeal from the road - but you have goats & chickens in the area and the accommodations are very comfortable! We even went to the river and waded in it in the evening.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Julie's airbnb is a great stopping point for people who don't want to stay in Reno and right off the highway. In addition, her lovely dog, chickens, and goats add a real fun element to the place. A lot of the compound is clearly under construction and can seem a little confusing at first, but the room was nicely appointed and a perfect way station for some weary road trippers."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Julie’s place was a perfect spot for us to stop during our travels. The jacuzzi bath was a nice added touch. Wish we could have stayed longer!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely cabin. Great communication, wonderful location and awesome amenities. Definitely recommend"
2021-05-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Julie's place is as advertised. It looks kind of run-down from the outside but provides very serviceable farm-house type accomodations on the inside. There is a comfortable dining table and all the basics for reheating your meals. There is also a couch to relax on and the bed if very comfy. The AC/heating unit is right by the bed though so, if you're a lite sleeper - you may not want to turn it on because it is quite loud. Also - there aren't any spare blankets in the room so you may want to bring extras if you get cold"
2021-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Clean and spacious. The animals were great, especially the super sweet dog."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Julie is a very sweet person and a great host. we enjoyed our stay on her ranch and her dog Ren is just the sweetest.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly what I needed. I was moving and had to bring my big dog with me. It was great spot, there were chickens, goats and rabbits. the hot tub was wondeful!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Julie's place was very clean, just what we wanted!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Julie's property is beautiful and open, a wonderful retreat in the desert. It's simultaneously accessible and near to amenities but also provides a separate, quiet space. I specifically wanted a place to finish a big writing project and this was the perfect space for me. This place would be great for those needing a quiet, meditative space in the desert, and it would also be a great basecamp for folks who are headed out hiking to areas around. It's super easy to access from the interstate, with groceries and food and other amenities about 10 mins (or less) away, but it's still out in the country, so you won't need to worry about running into other people or crowds. This was my second time staying at Julie's place and I'd be happy to stay there again if it worked out."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a nice quiet space ,very comfortable."
2021-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Compact, cozy and comfortable for a small family. It’s also perfect if you have a pet. The bed was so comfortable. One thing to note from my experience is that this place looks to be smoke-friendly so if you are allergic to the smell of cigarette smoke, it would be a good idea to check with Julie ahead of time and ensure that the place is cleaned to get rid of the smell before you checkin. Julie was such an awesome host and I loved their hospitality! I left some of my stuff in the house and Julie was so helpful and said she will ship them to me. I had a great experience and would recommend the place!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I loved the stay the animals were awesome my 2 yr old loved the chickens and goats picked a great time to stay goat kids were very new Julie was very nice and sweet she made our stay very comfortable she cooked lamb for us and made develed eggs and salad for easter dinner my dogs loved the outdoors space to run and played with julie's golden retriever pup loved every bit of it most definitely will come back
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a relaxing and comfortable spot. If you're lucky like us, you might even get to meet a goat!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is a real gem! It is on a funky old farm, and the goat will eat your socks if you drop them, and will also try to push his way into the house and/or your car. There are chickens everywhere. The little house itself is beautiful and peaceful, and our three year old loved all of it. Be prepared because the cooking options are very limited. Julie is very friendly and hospitable, and showed us the river and the newborn baby goats. We had a really delightful stay."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was our second time at Julie’s place and we had a great time. Julie’s super nice and very responsive. We love the farm animals especially Ren and Jessie!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place to stay. I stopped through on my way to Vegas and had a great time! Was able to wander the property and met a very playful dog and a goat with a nice home.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Driving into the property, my first impression was that it felt a little post-apocalyptic. However, the room was beautiful, modern, and clean inside. I really enjoyed the large tub and comfortable bed. In the morning, I was greeted by the sweetest and most gentle dog outside my door. This place has a unique charm, and I would definitely recommend it!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a perfect get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Just a place you needed for relaxing. We had fun, especially our little puppy who love to chase and play with the goat and Julie’s puppy. We we’re able to take home fresh eggs straight from her hens. It was a nice experience. We will come back for sure. :)"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We’d like to thank Julie for such an amazing stay. Everything was just as described. We brought our Dog, and Ren (Julie’s wonderful dog) was amazing and made Pepper feel welcomed. The room was everything we could have hoped for and very comfy. The tub, oh, the tub was outstanding. We took at least 8 baths in it and could have taken more! There’s no way to prepare food other than the microwave, but we planned for it. Once you arrive, don’t be put off by the outer appearance, the accommodations inside make up for everything else. There’s no TV but we brought our own which worked out well. Little things like salt and pepper or coffee would have been nice, but the lack there of, were of no consequence.
We’re already planning our next “Get-away” here and looking forward to it.
Thank you Julie😊"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place to rest with our 15mo baby on a long i80 road trip.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cozy and on beautiful land!
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The reviews before me were mostly accurate. I didn’t spend much time on the property. This is the perfect spot for pyramid fly fishing trips. It looks like there is plenty of room for boat trailers, but cannot confirm as I did not ask the owner. I will definitely try to book with Julie for my next pyramid trip."
2021-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,This is a very rustic and sparse piece of land. The room is cozy but very minimally equipped. The bed is high but comfortable. There are extra blankets in the closet to keep you warm. It's very clean.
2021-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,If you want a space right off the highway for a nights rest this is it! Decent bed and the jet bathtub is amazing. Its a nice and quiet single room. The only downside was that there were dirty cups put away and three spiders on the ceiling. But other than that i enjoyed my stay. thanks!
2021-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful Airbnb the jet tub was just what we needed after a long day of traveling.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location, and very responsive host. It was exactly what we wanted for the weekend."

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cool place.
2021-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great value for money, easy access to I-80. Barebones basic amenities (no salt and pepper, no knife, no dish liquid or scrub, bar soap instead of liquid hand soap, no kitchen towels etc). Julie is very friendly and walked us to the river (which is about half a mile away). My daughter got a thrill out of seeing the goats, hens and dog on the property."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Julie's place was a great stopover place for us while traveling. The room was very clean and everything was just as described. Her dog is adorable and very sweet!

2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Julie’s place is a great desert getaway. She was an accommodating, friendly and helpful host. The guest house is very spacious, with a nice remodeled bathroom that has good spa-like towels and a great shower. It was fun to stay on this quirky little farm, not to mention she has the cutest puppy in the world! We would be happy to stay here again."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stop for the night on a long drive with my dog. Peaceful, spacious, and easy to find after dark. Julie was quick to respond, and check-in/out was a breeze. Would stay again!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I had a great stay at Julie's place. It was spacious, tranquil, and impeccably clean. A perfect spot to rest, write, and take in some sun and mountains. Really a beautiful place. Julie was a lovely host. She gave great directions to help me find the space. I hope to make a trip there again. Thanks so much, Julie!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Julie has a great cabin-like studio that is perfect for a writers retreat or a nights respite on a long drive, which was our use. The space is thoughtful, ample, and clean. We also liked parking right in front of the room."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay and enjoy the rural northern Nevada atmosphere. Host was very friendly and responsive. Our 3 year old really enjoyed being able to hang out with dog, chickens, and goats on the ranch 👍"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just what we were looking for for a relaxed stay outside of Reno. Enjoyed exploring Pyramid Lake, and it was a mellow drive into Reno for food and errands. The farm is full of character, and the space itself is comfortable, thoughtfully decorated, and very clean. Thanks, Julie!"
2020-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great location
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to spend the night when traveling with dog.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The cabin is a nice place to stop if you're traveling on Hwy 50 or 80 near Reno and don't want to stay in a motel or go as far a Reno. Julie and her daughter Julie are super sweet. We were very happy that we got to check out late, as we checked in late at night after a long drive from Utah. Julie was very quick to respond and accommodating!
If you're looking for luxury, this is not the place for you. But it is a good place to stop on your way through Nevada if you're interested in interesting people with interesting stories.
We're hoping to come see what Julie has done with the place next year, and in the years to come as we travel on 50 or 80 near her compound."
2020-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Nice location off of the highway and the farm had a pleasant feel to it!

It was exactly what we needed after a long drive on our way home!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Stay was excellent. Went in with an open mind and didn't expect anything extravagant. Much enjoyed stay and the good morning greeting from the ranch doggo.
2020-09-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Julie’s place is clean and comfortable, and Julie was responsive to my inquiries and concerns. It’s very close to 80, so the freeway noise makes it less peaceful to sit outside. It wasn’t terribly well stocked, especially the kitchenette. The jacuzzi and shower are very nice. There were some friendly teenagers about, and a gentle 3-legged dog named Red, along with a few goats."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful host and very thoughtful. We had a great stay with 2 small children.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Place was great for our relocation from CA to CO. It was sparkling clean!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Julie was a welcoming home and we found our accommodation functional, sparkling clean and spacious. Good location on our road trip as it’s minutes from I80, next time i would bring ear plugs for a quieter nights sleep. Walk to the river with our dog was nice at the end of a days driving."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This farm property is dusty and a bit desolate, but the unit is modern and pristine."
2020-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great location - rural, quiet and just a few minutes off I-80. The room is comfortable and the shower is great. We were greeted by goats outside in the morning, very charming."
2020-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Easy check-in. Rural location with river access. Good value and location for exploring the area!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice room to stay at for the evening. We did find it difficult to find room #2 as the room didn’t have a # on it to label it. That is my only complaint. Otherwise it was a good stay!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"An interesting property with history and charm. The amenities were great, a very comfortable bed and ample space to park two cars. It was relaxing to walk to the river and around the property after a long day’s drive. And there’s goats!"
2020-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is very cute, sweet, and cozy! We had a couple of cleanliness issues when arriving but Julie came over to fix it up. We did not get to use the Jacuzzi since flakes were coming from the jets each time we tried (Julie even came and cleaned the tub out again once this happened). But the area around is very lovely!
(As a side note, if you are somewhat of an arachnophobe like myself, there were also a decent amount of spiders inside of our room. It is on a farm location though so not too surprising)."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay at a farm. I loved feeding the goats, and my cat loved watching them from the window. We did not use the tub, so we can't speak on that, but the shower and bathroom was very nice. We stayed for a week, so it was nice to have a fridge and microwave. I enjoyed going into the river with Julie and her daughter, Julie, one day while my boyfriend worked from home. He did unfortunately struggle with the internet speeds initially, but we believe this was likely due to the location of the farm. Julie was very accommodating and made sure she did everything she could to help us with the internet speeds. Using a WIFI extender that we purchased from Walmart, we were able to get approximately 10-25 mbps. If you would like a farm getaway with animals (chickens, roosters, goats, and their friendly dog), definitely stay here. It was also about 1.5 hours from Lake Tahoe, which we went to three times during our stay."
2020-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you don't judge a book by it's cover, you'll love this site. The room was very clean and comfortable and provided lots of space for us and our dog. It was also a great value and preferable to staying in a hotel in this somewhat remote area."
2020-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Rental unit was comfortable and the photos are accurate. As mentioned in other reviews (which I did not read carefully before staying here) the setting is ""rustic and utilitarian"" with many ""working buildings"". I was taken aback by the outdoor setting, but happy with the interior. Julie was helpful when we had an issue. Kitchen needs more dishes and silverware, soap and sponge. When we mentioned it, Julie offered to bring more, but we had already eaten. Good for a stay when passing through on I 80."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a great stop on our road trip. Julie and her daughter were very friendly as were their animals. This is a very unique property and the views of the stars at night were unmatched
2020-08-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Hmmm, interesting place....if you need things perfect this is not the place for you, however, the quirks are memorable and made for some unusual photos to send to friends. Despite the description, this is not a ranch but a collection of aging buildings, some uninhabitable and festooned with graffiti and goats running through them. The Airbnb unit on the inside however is very acceptable and with 2 changes, overall would be very nice. Recently renovated, the bath and kitchens are new and the floors are pergo hardwood throughout. It was also very clean. But The mattress is saggy and the air conditioner is aggressive / noisy and so sleep was not good. The host is very very nice and she has a GREAT dog. It also is not far from seeing numerous bands of wild horses in the town named Mustang. So if you can do quirky, don’t have a bad back that needs a firm bed and plan just to come in and have a clean place to eat and sleep then it might work for you."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a great place to stay while on a cross country trip. Julie's place is very conveniently located and easy to access from I-80. It's small but very clean with good A/C and a lovely shower! We loved seeing the goats and quails, and hearing an owl at night. The walk down to the river was lovely after a long day driving. We would stay here again :)"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Julie is amazing! The space she has set up is great, especially for a getaway. I’m considering staying for longer next time, if she ever has the availability! 😀😀😀"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Julie’s place was very clean and comfortable. A perfect place to stop and rest during our long journey to Colorado. There was plenty of room for two people and two pups. Our youngest dog had a lot of fun playing with Julie’s sweet dog while we packed up our car. We would definitely stop here again if we are passing through.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Julie and her daughter were very polite and sweet. The inside was very neat and clean. Located next the river with beautiful Scenery also town is about five minutes away with nice restaurants, shopping center and 2 casinos. Will definitely recommend to my friends"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great place to relax and unplug. Enjoyed the Truckee River, the landscape, and being in a rural location. Julie is a great and caring host. It was fun being able to relax and see the area."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We booked Julie's place on our trip across the country with our dog and it was a perfect place to stay just off the interstate. The property was as listed and anything you could need. Julie was a wonderful host and was very friendly and responsive. If there was anything we needed, all we had to do was ask and she'd be at the front door with it! We appreciated the space and the large shower. Private and quiet, we slept like logs."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Julie was a great host! Very friendly and clean was my first impression upon arrival inside. The water is just a short walk down. Was fun to play farm for a day!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place to stay. Super clean inside and Julie is very friendly.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Julie was an incredible host. The living arrangements and amenities were beyond our expectations. The place was clean and well decorated. The hot tub and spacious, shower was a huge plus for us. We have two dogs and both our pups loved their time exploring the property. The property is well secured and safe. We were very happy with our experience. Julie and her daughter were very accommodating and kind. There’s a beautiful river on the property that is incredibly clean and safe for dog swims. We usually don’t let our dogs play in natural water, but the river was clear and very clean. It was an amazing experience and we highly recommend considering staying here when in the area! You won’t find any better!"
2020-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Really nice spa room with access to the river
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Julie was a total sweetheart. Place was super clean and I really enjoyed my stay. Very peaceful property, the nearby river was a dream and the night sky was breathtaking."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a great place to stop for a night during our cross country road trip! Our doggos loved running on the farm and meeting the other animals! The place is clean, tiny, and quite chic! Wish we had longer to stay! Julie was a wonderful and communicative host."
2020-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The inside of cottage is clean and very basic. Font expect anything other than some toilet paper and a few dishes you can use it needed. Be prepared to walk around tracking dust all around because the parking lot ( whole property) is just loose dirt. Your shoes and vehicles and yourself might leave the place ready for a good shower after. Carefully that the goats roaming around do not try and get onto your vehicles, they are pretty heavy and will damage. Host was nice but maybe that is why this place had much better reviews that made it misguiding. Next time travels through this area will stay at the hotel in fernley."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location on the river. We enjoyed swimming and hanging out on the property. The room is good sized and had what we needed. Recommend!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a great place and we felt safe. We were so tired at the end of a long drive and were able to book this place for the same evening with minimal research. Julie was super responsive to make that happen. Thank you Julie for letting stay at your eclectic ranch. Our dog met some goats for the first time and that was cool too :).
2020-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Very low key, cute little farm stay with the sweetest dog you've ever met! Great for kids, great for pet owners! Accommodations are very simple with minimum amendments, but this was fine for us for just a 1 night stay.
If we are passing through again, we will definitely stop by!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay for what we needed. Julie is a great host and welcomed us at the property.
As you arrive, the scenery might question you but DO NOT let it full you. The location is developing and the Airbnb’s are really nice and clean!!! Definitely would stay again!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Just the right spot for a road trip stop! Make sure to use the perfect French press coffee maker. The interior is just as described in the listing and reviews. If exterior beauty is your thing, go to the river, watch the sunset, or look at the star filled sky. Great spot with super hosts. (Other choices in the area seem to be hotels right on the highway)"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"As expected, located right off of 80 so convenient place to stop on our road trip. The outside is a bit rural - dirt, multiple buildings one with broken windows and tagged with graffiti looking art where the goats live - but the actual place you stay in is clean and remodeled. There was another person staying in an adjacent building that we could hear and were not aware of until check in so may want to double check with Julie before booking if that concerns you. She was friendly and hospitable."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Julie's place was close to the highway and made for a perfect place to stay on our cross country road trip. The bed was great! The goats and the dog were great additions. Loved the shower (surprised on the size of it). Her daughter was very helpful!
2020-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Julie's place is nice and clean- similar to the photos. One thing I found disturbing is that there is a grotesque drawing (and quite sexist in the wording) description of how women should remove tampons. For example, it addresses how men should educate women about tampons and says any woman that flushes a tampon is an ""idiot"". I believe they made this after having issues with guests flushing harmful products into their septic system, but a simple ""Feminine hygiene products will back up the septic system. If backups occur, guests will be charged!"", or something similar, would have been more appropriate. Overall though, a nice place to stay and a welcoming family. Plus, the goats were fun."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Julie was great and very welcoming for a quick stop on our family road trip. She showed our toddler where to find all the animals and let him sit in the tractor. He had a blast which means we did too.
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice quaint place, super clean. Nice bed. Short walk or drive down to the water. Goats and chickens on the property lead to a nice peaceful country feel. River access could be cleaner. Some old furniture detracted from the ambience."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Julie's place was exactly as described. We had total privacy and were free to walk about the property. The property looks like it has been around for many years, there are buildings on the premises that are older and not in use, but this did not hinder our stay. It was actually a good place to take some vintage photos. The area is very open and desolate, if you are in need of silence then this is a great place to stay. I will give 5 stars alone to the jetted hot tub, this was my favorite part of my stay. The place is the size of a studio but had everything I needed. Make sure you check the weather prior to your stay since it was very windy when we visited , however, it gave us a ""horror movie"" kind of feel and we loved it. The property is right next to the highway and you do not need to drive down windy roads. You only need to drive a matter of yards to actually get to the airbnb once you enter the property. There is a Walmart, fastfood, gas stations and a couple casinos w/ restauarants an exit away."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect place to spend the night with my puppy! We enjoyed meeting resident puppy Ren, watching the goats, and playing in the river. Great night sleep too and Julie is very friendly and kind!"
2020-05-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,There is a really nice bathtub. The renovations are really nice. The bed is a bit uncomfortable. Right off the highway and a perfect place to rest on our road trip. The hosts were really nice and invited us to have a campfire with them. Make sure you aren’t scared of goats if you book here.
2020-05-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"The apartment that we stayed in was nice and accurate to the description of the property, however upon arrival the property can be surprising. There is an abandoned house near the apartments that is covered in graffiti that is not shown in property photos. There are many other buildings on the property that were also left out of photos. The land is nice and there is a beautiful river that you are able to walk to. Julie was a kind host and communicated quickly. Had the description and photos been accurate, I would not have booked, however now that I have stayed, I would book again.
Travelers be aware that the apartments do not have a way to lock completely. Could still get in with the code. I personally would have felt safer with another lock on the door."
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The space is super comfortable & the location for an i80 traveler, very practical. The farm animals were a joy to play with and Julie is a wonderful conversationalist & hostess. Had a great stay. Highly recommend!"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This unit right off the freeway so if you're looking for a private place to stay that is quiet and pet friendly while you're travelling on 80, Julie's place works extremely well for that. Especially during this pandemic, Julie assured us of her disinfecting procedures and we found the unit clean. The bed was comfortable and it has a nice big shower."
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect pit stop for a good night’s rest right off the highway!
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Julie was an excellent host, the stay was gorgeous and waaaay better than I expected. I loved the marble shower and bath tub (reminded me of a fancy Indian spa). If arriving at night the first thing you'll see when pulling in is the goat house. It can be a little scary if you aren't prepared. No need to worry though, the goats are super friendly and so are the hosts. The place is absolutely stunning in the day and at night the stars are bright."
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Julie's place is wonderful. We didn't get a chance to use the jacuzzi tub but next time! We had a great time hanging out by the river, talking with Julie and her daughter, feeding the goats and their puppy Ren. The fire pit was a great way to end the weekend. We'll definitely be back."
2020-03-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,The area is rural and quiet but very close to the freeway and Fernley. The internet was great. There’s a small refrigerator with a tiny freezer which was super helpful. The inside of the place was remodeled and had a nice bathroom.
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Julie’s place was awesome! Great restful oasis for our family to stop at outside of Reno while traveling along 80.
Secluded, private, quiet area surrounded by nature and a restful respite inside! Taking a soak in the jacuzzi tub (with complementary magnesium oil) was just what I needed after a day on the road.
We were just off 80, so getting back in the road in the morning was almost as easy as turning out of the driveway!"
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always a great time at this property. We love having our family farm stays here. The property is beautiful and the location near the river is amazing. We loving being able to hang out on the bikes all day bbq and play with the goats
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for what we needed! Will be back next year most likely!
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Coffee brewer would be nice as well../
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place for the wife and dogs to stay while traveling for work.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very accommodating since we booked same day as check in. Place was very clean and comfortable. Great quick stay!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place
Great host and peaceful neighborhood"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This home was absolutely perfect for our holiday trip. The home was clean, well stocked with necessities, and felt like home
it allowed us a safe place to share the holidays with our family and include our dogs. we look forward to booking again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The mattresses are very firm and comfortable! I had to pull the linens off to order some for my guest bedroom lol
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Big house! Very nice, very clean! Just a heads up! Doordash/instacart has a hard time with locating it for some reason. They got sent to the wrong house twice… so let your delivery drivers know."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place was a home away from home and had lots of space for my family and more. We definitely recommend staying here and if we are in the area again will stay here again. Thanks again for allowing my family to rest at your home.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Excellent home. Had 6 kids w us and needed at least 7-8 beds and this place had that - super comfy mattresses too! TVs in every room. Nothing was hard to do or find. Communication was great. Easy.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was very nice and perfect for my family to stay at when they were visiting for the holidays.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Clean property. Easy to find! we stopped on our way through Nevada and it was a nice rest. Thanks!
2023-11-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay, my only complaint would be that the beds were really hard and stuff. The whole family Struggled to sleep the first night."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place in Fernley! Will definitely stay again!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,awesome property
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Got to town early and let us check in early, very responsive and great location."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place!
2023-08-01,4.0,Group trip,"Majid’s house is new, clean and worked well for our one night stay. There’s no landscaping or outdoor amenities yet but the house is very comfortable and everything worked as expected."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house was completely gorgeous and spacious. Very clean and had everything we needed.
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Excellent place to stay, incredible house, clean and peaceful. I highly recommend, my family and me were so happy!!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house was clean with the exception of dog poop in the dirt backyard. If you have a large family and are passing through the area this could work for you.
Otherwise, keep driving. There is nothing to do In Fernely.
The house is large and is furnished with firm beds. Every person gets a bath towel and hand towel, but no face clothes are provided. Also, if you’re staying more than a day and you’re planning on cooking bring everything with you including the salt and pepper.
Also, be sure of your travel plans because the hosts will not honor requests for cancellations.
Finally, when we asked a local what people do in Fernely he summed it up with one word, “leave”."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"LOVED LOVED LOVED our stay here! This was one of our favorite Abnbs so far!
The house was SUPER clean, cool, comfortable and perfectly stocked and we also really liked that we could park our car in the huge garage. The neighborhood is so quiet and within a mile of restaurants, Starbucks, grocery and gas - very safe. And the co-hosts were all friendly, super quick to respond and proactive with information.
We will definitely be back!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"clean, quiet and comfortable"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The stay was great, from easy check-in to the cleanliness and comfortable spaces. It was the perfect size for our stay and we felt very welcome. Would definitely stay here again"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great stay!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Still had the new house smell and there was room for all of us. Good communication with the host.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was very clean. It was very new and there was a lot of room for my large family. We stayed here for two days to get ready for a funeral and it was a perfect location for us. There isn’t any extra towels or blankets. it was great for what we needed. I mean, it didn’t have knickknacks and things like that, but it was pretty stylish.. I would definitely stay there again. The host was quick to answer any questions so communication was great. If you need an extra towel for like drying your hair, you better bring your own. No bathmats either which I thought was a little odd because you only have one towel per person, so you have no way of drying the floor Unless you use the one that you’ve got around you. Overall I’d stay there again thank you."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very much enjoyed our at Majid’s listing. Was clean, spacious and comfortable. My only complaint would be if you bring your dogs the back yard is full of large weeds most with stickers and we picked up quite a few nails from when home was built."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We have stayed here multiple times. It's just a place to sleep for the night on our road trip to visit family, but we appreciate the new and clean feeling of the place. We have three kids, and one is little so I love that I don't have to worry about stairs. The house also doesn't have too much clutter for the kids to mess up. The beds are comfortable and I truly appreciate that they don't use too many scented detergents and fabric softeners on the sheets and towels."
2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,The home looks just like the photos. I found it to be a good value and it was quite spacious. Not much to do around the area but it’s a short drive to Reno. The neighborhood is safe. Plenty of televisions and space. The homeowner was responsive and helpful when I reached out.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house is brand new and exactly as described. We stayed to help family in the area move and we had 10 people, 4 pre teens. Everyone was comfortable. Basic amenities but it says so in the listing. Thanks so much."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"I felt at home, the neighbors were friendly, we made breakfast! The only issue is that in the shared bathrooms there was no towel rack. Nevertheless every bed was beautiful with two towels rolled waiting for us it was such a pleasant stay! So nice to see all those beds made up. I didn't know there was a Keurig machine with coffee pots we didn't even use it but what a sweet gesture. His instructions helped us to connect to the Wi-Fi and then we could screencast on all his TVs hahaha it was great, and it was a tremendous good deal for What he charged us! Thank you, Majid!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This house was a perfect place for my family to stay while we waited for our moving truck to arrive. Thank you for hosting us!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"House was clean, there is a ton of room. quiet neighborhood"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Very nice clean home. House looks new it is a great spot
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Very good!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place to stay.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Lots of space and has the basics for kitchen. Big driveway to fit a couple vehicles. Wifi was good too.
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"It was a great new house, clean and the owner was very responsive."
2023-04-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house was spacious and accommodated our family well. We were there for my father’s celebration of life and many family members attended. There were only plates bowls and coffee mug and one set of pots and pans , no glassware or salad bowls no salt and pepper- you basically have to buy or bring those things. The outside is surrounded by dirt, no outside chairs or places to gather- it is a new rental, I understand- however upgrades need to happen"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family of 5 prefer to stay here on our way to my parents place. We like this house because it's very clean. It helps that it's brand new. It's also safe, neighborhood wise and because I don't have to worry about stairs with my two year old."
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"The place was exactly what I saw in the pictures. The owner was very responsive and his directions were clear and concise. The house was very nice, clean and spacious. Our party of 10 fit perfectly."
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our five-night stay at this beautiful new house. The only drawback for us was that the kitchen was poorly equipped for cooking and serving full meals. Nonetheless, we’ll be happy to stay there again when we visit Fernley."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I would definitely look into booking this home again on our next visit to nevada
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We appreciate staying here on our way through NV. It's very clean and spacious for our family.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"As advertised, brand new home in a quiet development. Easy access to home and freeway. Worked out very well for us and Majid had very good communication and was very responsive to the few requests we had."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was not the quickest response as it took days to receive one, and my question wasn't answered in the end. Other than that, the house is spacious and squiky clean."
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"It's really a nice place. We rented it because of the bed space, and we were not disappointed. Large open area (kit, dining, and living room). My siblings and I were in town for a funeral, we had 10, then I think another 6 family members before and after the service, so it was really nice to be able to spread out a little and visit. Very clean!!
There isn't a door for the master bathroom, so maybe a privacy curtain for the shower and tub?? the toilet does however have a door. There aren't any towel rods but I'm not an owner that has to repair loose or damage rods and walls. There is however a washer and dryer. Items easy to work with or around.
Okay so there is the great and the something to consider, overall, I would stay there again without even looking to see what else was available. Thank you for a great stay."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I rented this home for a couple of coworkers. Very responsive. Easy Check-in. Nice neighborhood. They stated it was very homey and nice. Will definitely book this home again.
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Clean house with plenty of beds as described.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,It was a nice place. Minimum but clear communication and overall a great stay.
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"New place, pet friendly, clean and lots of room for a family, or two. Minimalistic with just the right amount of amenities to be comfortable. Excellent internet speeds which was top priority for us and why we chose this place to stop for a night while on a road trip. Great communication from owner who accommodated us and some of our special requests at the last minute which we really appreciated. Efficient self check in process. There’s lots of places to eat, a Walmart, a Ralph’s and other such stores an easy 10 min drive from the house.
All the beds are SUPER firm and some bedding could use an update; (they were clean, just looked faded and were thinning out from lots of laundering so they felt a bit lightweight) but if a firm mattress and lightweight bedding is your thing you’ll get a great nights sleep. I myself prefer plush bedding and a soft, pillowy mattress."
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,wonderful house.. great communication with the host.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Though we only stayed one night we loved this house. It's brand new, you can smell it, but not in a bad way. Super clean!
We loved that it was one story for the kids, so no need to have a baby gate.
They had some basics like soaps and shampoo. I appreciate that they don't use strong scented products in the house. I'm fairly sensitive to them. We enjoyed having the TV entertainment and internet too.
There was lots of space and places for everyone in a family of 5 to sleep."

Plenty of kitchen items, washing machine and dryer and has a shower that’s easy to get in and out of for people that struggle stepping into a bath tub. We typically sleep on a soft bed so the hard beds were an adjustment but everyone has different opinions on mattresses. Thanks for sharing your home with us. Jeri"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Juan is very responsive. We found his home to fit our needs especially since we needed ADA requirements. The main suite bathroom included a walk-in shower with a corner bench and grab bars. It is our 2nd stay & we'd happily stay again!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The house was very clean and conveniently located. Only recommendation is to add additional kitchen appliances.
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"I would stay again but would be better prepared for no frills. No hangers, no wash cloths, one kitchen towel, no laundry supplies, limited trash receptacles, and the internet was only available to one device. it was clean, updated, and fully ADA equipped. There were ample sheets, blankets, and pillows. The owner was extremely responsive and flexible. Accessibility to the property was simple and as communicated. And we even had the pleasure of seeing wild horses roam the neighborhood."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really liked the house, as well as everyone I brought alone. Great abundance of towels and offered soap and shampoo which made traveling a ton lighter.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very cute, cozy home. Host allowed early access as we arrived a couple hours early. Hot water was perfectly HOT. And they provided bathroom amenities. I forgot mine so, thank you!!!!
The only down falls, uncomfortable beds, and no games or anything for kids. Bring your own laundry soap."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"We were on a road trip with 5 people and just needed a place to shower and flop for the night. Juan’s home was clean and comfortable and exactly as pictured. In addition we were able to park our cars in the garage for added security. It would be nice to have bigger beds, as they are full sized. A great find!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very beautiful and spacious. Super easy check-in. The only thing was that the kitchen was a little sparse and didn’t have many cooking supplies. Overall would recommend and come back!
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Good place for a quick get away.
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The home was clean, the neighborhood was quiet, and I felt safe. The house is tastefully decorated, however I do wish the beds and living room furniture were more comfortable. Overall I felt like it was a good value and Juan was an excellent host."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was great for what we needed. We were passing through town and needed a place to crash. The house was clean and very spacious.

Juan was a great host, very responsive and helpful. We were in town for my husbands job and this home was a great location with a lot of things to do around. Highly recommend!! Thank you for the good experience."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"The house was clean, nice-looking furniture and tapestries. The owner was very helpful. The only thing is not many utensils or dishware. Furniture was not very comfy, no relaxation was happening. But it is a nice place and the owner was nice and it fit our needs."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and host was great!!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home was nice and clean. My family appreciated the location as a stopping point on our drive home from UT. We just stayed one night so we aren't thinking of it as a vacation spot so much as a clean comfortable place to sleep.
The single story home is great for little kids because you don't worry about stairs or bringing a baby gate."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great spot to stay during a trip. The surroundings of Fernley are beautiful, though there are few points of interest nearby. The apartment is well-stocked, spacious and has a good layout. Peaceful area - you can hear the train in the distance, but it’s far enough away to not be disturbing. Good WiFi available!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,She bent over backwards to make sure everything was working and we had everything very pleased
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Susan's place was exactly as listed. I didn't spend too much time there as I was with family, but it was clean and nicely stocked."
2024-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We were there a month. Generally things were ok. We had to make a few modifications for our small children .The beginning had a few rough patches. Check-in had some issues the lock combo was not changed yet. We were told everything was ready. There was apparently a miscommunication with the cleaner. We did get a discount. They were quick to respond when we texted them with any issues.
After the first week, we did not need to call and enjoyed the rest of our time. The host had most amenities and the local parks were great and frankly the better part of the stay. The Pac-Man arcade game was a bonus."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was perfect. Highly recommend to stay. Will be back next year same time. They even provide snacks and drinks. Thank you Susan!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Had a great weekend, no surprises."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place with friendly and helpful hosts. would stay again
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Hosts were super hospitable and responsive. We didn't spend the majority of our time at home because we were busy exploring Reno (about 35 mins away), however, every time we got back in, the mobile home was warm and inviting. Also, the area and neighborhood felt safe and not at all sketchy as some other reviews imply. BTW, I'm also a light sleeper and didn't wake up to the train passing or any street noise. Upon check out, the neiboring kids were riding around the property in their scooters, and it was really cute to see the park so lively. Service animal friendly. Family friendly. Small town vibes. Great coffee spot about 1 mile down. Locals in shops nearby have great customer service! If you are looking for bells and whistles, this is not the place for you."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Always love staying here.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Their place was clean and well equipped. They went the extra mile and helped when something was left behind. Would definitely stay there again.
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Clean, comfortable place to stay for my family. There were toys left for my toddler which I really appreciated! Only thing I would say is if you are planning on staying awhile/doing a lot of cooking you may want to bring your own pots/pans. The selection was mismatched and pretty beat up."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is our second time staying here, we can’t recommend it enough. You feel right at home."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very clean, host is very considerate with extra amenities.
Very quick respond with questions. Only downside is there are some traffic noise."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is the 2nd time we have stayed here. The 1st time was great and was delighted that it was available again this year. Sure beats staying in a motel room :)
2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"A little spendy for the location it's in. It's not a great spot in Fernley very busy street to be on and not the nicest neighborhood. Was pretty clean and had an awesome little Pacman arcade in the spare room overall, not too bad. Susan was very nice and helpful"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Quiet little home just as advertised. Easy check-in and very responsive host. Pleasure to stay there.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Living in a mobile home was an interesting experience for us. The equipment is comfortable, there was everything we needed and even more than we expected, we appreciate two bathrooms. Board games and flipper in one room, which was very popular, are a great idea. Contact with the host sensational, very fast and always we needed. In the home there was information with local recommendations - an excellent idea! We feel that the host cares about her guests, we really appreciate it very much and recommend everyone to stay at Susan and Heather’s."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My cousin and I were initially there for a funeral at the veterans cemetery, and needed a place to stay. It turns out that Susan’s place was way cheaper than a motel.
We were then having a family get together for my fathers 85th birthday, that Susan was kind enough to let us have. We had a BBQ, which was there on the property. The kitchen was a blessing, stocked with everything we needed.
As many have stated before, “don’t let the outside fool you”, but we had plenty of parking, the house was comfortable, my nephews loved the game in the front bedroom, and the adults were comfortable inside and out.
Thank you for your hospitality!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Awesome place in the heart of Fernley. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to stay in Fernley!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A perfect place for us to stop over and stay the night on our way from Cali to Salt Lake.

2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place, well cleaned and well maintained. Had plenty of plates and utensils. Good beds and cozy for sleeping"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We couldn't have been happier to stay here. All the accommodations we needed and wanted. Our family of 6 (4 small kids) had no issues staying in the comfy beds. It was almost like a throwback to when airbnb was really awesome and they provided wonderful things like coffee, pop tarts, cold filtered water,board games, TV, and even arcade games. Compared to any other experience I've had in the last 3-4 years, this was tops. My family was shocked that Ferntucky had an airbnb, and we'd stay here again for another visit. Thank you so much!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,great place. would stay again if needed.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was amazing!
We did Thanksgiving dinner for our family who live there in Silver Springs! Heather was very responsive and checked to ensure we had all we needed to host.

I appreciated the snacks and coffee left for our use. I also really liked the Ms. Pacman game in the front bedroom –- super fun to play! We were able to chill out each night, watch Netflix, and hang out in the front yard as much as we wanted. Using the cooling system was easy and straightforward thanks to the instructions. Highly recommend staying here if you're passing through Fernley!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Third time that our family has stayed with this host. Comfy beds, very clean place. Well stocked (including condiments), but bring your own tea. Pleased overall. If you're sensitive to noise, bring ear plugs/white noise machine as the train makes a few nighttime runs and this unit is on the corner of a busier street. Car lights and noises are a bit challenging in the bunk room if your kiddo is a sensitive sleeper like mine. Come prepared."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My stay was a short one, but I enjoyed Susan’s place. It was quiet, clean, and very convenient."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a great place! It is full of thoughtful touches, Susan is a wonderful and kind host, and we will definitely be back!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was just a short stop (overnight) as part of a longer road trip with myself, husband and 3 teen daughters . It was a charming space, very clean and comfortable. The twin over full bunk bed was creaky but the other beds were comfortable. There are an assortment of snacks and drinks available that were very much enjoyed by my daughters. There is a folder of restaurants and interesting things to do around Felton which was very helpful when we arrived in the evening hungry and tired. Communication with Susan was easy and clear prompt reply. We had a great stay."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Needed a quick stopover between Reno and Salt Lake. Susan’s place was outstanding, very comfortable and well stocked. We had everything we needed and more. Susan was quick to respond and very friendly. Thank you!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is my second time staying with Susan and I would definitely stay again. Her place is great!
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This truly is a hidden gem, you don't expect the inside luxury when you see the outside. Our stay was to see family but if it's just a vacation there's plenty to do and see and this home is in a great spot. Susan couldn't do anything about the smoke/smog that marred our time. But inside she made up for it with the luxury master bedroom, great facilities and lots of touches of generosity. Snacks, drinks, coffee keuireg, bathroom items, games and more Because of the lack of fresh air and my age I was rather hot and my 2 teenagers found the 2nd bedroom very hot, by the day we left, the skies were clearing and there was a lovely breeze we didn't even need the swamp cooler in the master bedroom. The swamp cooler was a first for me! I'm British what can I say..... thank fully there were clear instructions, we turned it off when out of the home. At night we filled it right up as the first night it woke us beaping, the float wasn't working so I dipped my hand in where you filled.
my only change would be different lighting we didn't have enough bright light for when we needed it and we used a lamp for a low light in the bathroom at night. Would definitely stay here again and reccomend to friends."
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"We loved our stay! If you are in Reno area, this place has a home-feel. Host are communicative and were friendly. We loved the space and would come back again! I really liked the travel notebook that guests can sign and kitchen island with supplies."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Susan's place was just as I expected. She really went above and beyond with all the snacks! I would definitely stay here again.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very comfortable place to stay. The instruction on how to do things in the home, local attractions, places to eat... all great stuff. I did not stay very long, but it would have been an easy multi-day stay. Check-in was super easy!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very sweet , she made sure kids had enough arts and crafts for our stay ! Truly the best ! House was very clean and they even had snacks for kids ! Loved it for sure will be back !!!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I've stayed at many Airbnbs that were host by ""SuperHost"". Susan, surpassed all the Super Host! She's Top notch! I've never stayed at a mobile home before so at first I was a bit unsure when I booked the place. But after reading the many positive reviews, I wanted to check it out myself. I highly recommend her place. The home is REALLY NICE! She thought of everything to make our stay welcome, enjoyable, comfortable and with complete amenities such as snacks, food, drinks, treats, coffee, milk, everything! Thank you for a wonderful stay!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent host and ideally located for a stop and stay. Accommodations were exactly as described: clean and comfortable. Many thanks to a wonderful host!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks again for a wonderful stay!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"As a previous reviewer had mentioned, when you first turn to get into the community, it does look a little sketchy, once we walked in there was absolutely no concerns about our stay. The attention to even the smallest detail made it clear that Susan takes a lot of pride in her home and making sure that the customer is happy. From insuring kid appropriate toys and snacks were available, cleanliness was immaculate and making sure we had all we needed plus more.
I few things that would be cherry on top but not a deal breaker would be providing a long length mirror, extra trash bags and if the cooler wasn’t so loud… but overall we had a great visit."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was much better than we expected. Community was very safe, we had our bikes parked overnight and everything was fine. House was clean and beautifully decorated. They had a lot of toys, games and other amenities such as juices, sodas, milk in the kitchen - our kid loved it too!
Thanks Susan for the great stay!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The home was as described. It was clean with plenty of room. Everything worked. I feel like it's a good deal. I would stay there again.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful first experience in an Airbnb! She made it easy and provided a place twice in our road trip. A lovely place to stay and it was a relief to use the laundry after several days on the road. Loved having a few snacks when we got in after a long day on the road and then a variety of things for breakfast. Thanks so much for your hospitality and personal touch for my dad’s birthday!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"So, the place looks a bit shady as you drive into the park, but it is AMAZING. The home is clean and beautifully laid out, and to top it off, there were SNACKS. We were provided with a pack n play for my baby, toys for my older kids (toddler aged and elementary school aged), and coffee for us grown-ups to survive. We will definitely return here. It's just a short drive to Reno, Sparks, and Virginia City, and it's a few blocks from a local bowling alley."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little place for the 4 of us! Very accommodating and the few snacks were wonderful!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"great place for extended stays, everything you need."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was great. We offten visit Fernley and get hotels. When traveling with friends, family and especially children, Susan's place can't be beat. We will definitely be staying again."
2021-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Convenient location and clean accommodations. There are two bedrooms at opposite ends of the home, which lends itself to greater levels of privacy than can be found in other types of accommodations."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Highly recommend!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a mobile home close to train track and nightly trains. Otherwise, all was fine."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is the second place of Susan's that I've stayed at and I'm just as impressed as I was with the last stay. Very clean space, personal touches, great amenities, and host is easy to contact and quick to reply. Will more than likely stay here again!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location, comfortable & clean home w/ nice extra touches."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is great! Very quiet corner lot. Easy to locate, right off the freeway. Close to stores, great places to eat, and of course... gambling. The sunsets are beautiful as well. The home is very clean, comfortable and cozy, and our host Susan, was very sweet. There was a variety of snacks in the cupboard to choose from, and even milk, juice and a selection of cold drinks in the fridge. For anyone thinking of paying a visit to the area, whatever the reason... I think you would be hard pressed to find anything better for your money. 😀"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Susan's place is the best place to stay in Fernley. Close to everything in town and not too far from Reno. The special touches are the best. The owners are very accommodating. I would recommend this place to anyone.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Notes around the housefor tips, a booklet of nearby food and activities and reviews, some food menus and a little coffee/ hot chocolate section. Susan went above and beyond at her airbnb and was easy to contact and work with through the whole process. They even brought a portable crib for our daughter to sleep in if we needed or wanted to use it. I definitely recommend this place and hope to return on our next trip."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is the second time I’ve stayed at Susan’s place. Comfortable, quiet and very well equipped. I will definitely stay again."
2021-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place is so much more delightful that it seems from the outside. It is located in a trailer park on the corner of a busy street, so there is street noise, but it settled down at bedtime. The inside is beautiful! And the hosts added many thoughtful touches that made us feel welcome and comfortable. They asked the ages of our kids and customized the sleeping arrangements in the second bedroom so our three children would be able to sleep safely and comfortably (they are too young to use the top bunk). They also had a wonderful kids table set up for them with crayons, duplos, books, and other age-appropriate toys. The kids ran inside and immediately settled down to play happily, which was an enormous relief for me after a long day of travel. That moment of peace when I realized the kids were fine and I could settle in and get dinner ready without having to parent is reason enough to come back! But there are other reasons too: the space is roomy and happy, the bed comfortable, the place clean, and the amenities thoughtful."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Susan’s place was roomy, comfortable, well stocked, clean and close to everything in Fernley. She was quick to respond. We will definitely go back!"

We will be back in the area and can’t wait to stay with Susan again."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time here and wished we could have stayed longer, Susan made sure we were stocked with juices, snacks, coffee, even milk.

2021-01-01,4.0,Group trip,"The house had a lot of seating and bedding options. There was plenty to do in the area as well. If there are more than three people staying, make sure to take shorter showers so the hot water lasts longer. Overall the home was very nice."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,this is a great place and the Hosts are the best I have experienced.

2020-12-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Nice place to stay, perfect spot to get on & off fwy, & towne. Easy to find, host were very responsive and thoughtful"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,By far one of the best and most thoughtful AirBNBs we’ve stayed at. Susan goes above and beyond to add comfort to your stay and even put age appropriate toys and games in the house before our stay for our kids. The amount of extra that comes with these booking makes it a must stay!
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Your place was amazing
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I have stayed with at this property on multiple occasions. the place very clean well stocked and comfortable. Susan and Heather really go above and beyond when it comes to making their guests feel at home. I honestly cannot recommend them highly enough.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Susan responded quickly to our last minute reservation. The place was very clean and had thoughtful touches and amenities. It was convenient to the freeway and she got it warm before we arrive. It was a seamless reservation and would definitely stay here again.

2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Susan went above and beyond anything we could have expected. Her house was incredibly clean and very homey. She provided extra toys and games for our four year old daughter. Our daughter was amazed to see everything and felt like it was Christmas. We definitely recommend staying here and will be referring all of our friends and family to stay at her house.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was great. My husband was out here with the Navy for the holiday so I decided to bring my boys up to visit for Thanksgiving. Fernely was a good midway point, it was only an hour to Lake Tahoe and 35 minutes to Reno. The location was nice and quiet but close enough to be able to go explore. Mrs susan left age approptiate books and activities for my kids and even snacks and juice. Great host, cute house and our first trip to NV was amazing. We can't wait to come back!"
2020-11-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Perfect stay
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"These are not just superhosts - with this home, you have a real team taking care of you 24/7 :) These ladies are always in the area, ready to assist you on location, keeping the property safe, well-maintained and available at nearly every hour to answer questions.
This location offers a super-comfy, “small town” living experience, but close enough to the “big town” amenities: same-day grocery store delivery, incredibly fast wifi and even food delivery from both local favorites + familiar chains.
The local environment is exactly as described. This mobile park is filled with the energy of families: enjoying the sunny weather while biking, taking in the gorgeous mountain views from their patio chairs, or listening to music together.
The inside is a “hidden gem”, just as described. The kitchen is perfect to create absolutely any meal, with a huge variety of dinnerware and cooking utensils, and an amazing gas-top stove. The furnace works exceptionally well, and the coolers keep it comfortable on hot days. There are fun games for the family, comfy bedding in both bedrooms, warm fuzzy blankets, and comfortable chairs to sit at the desks or tables for working or meal time.
But above all, these hosts are exceptional people who were so accomodating on my last day when things didn’t go as planned for me. Gracious women, to say the least : )
You cannot ask for a more comfortable family home to stay in this area!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Susan’s place was clean, had lots of treats, and overall very lovely. Would stay again!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place for a quick overnight stay. The snacks and drinks in the kitchen were a nice touch.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Susan's place was amazing! We only got to stay one night but everything was perfect. Place was cozy, and it had everything we wanted and more. Susan responded super quick and was accommodating. We will happily stay there again if we are in the area."
2020-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Susan's condo is very conveniently located for travellers looking for a quick over night stop. It's right off i80.
Susan is very thoughtful and has everything stocked up for her guests.
The cooking system is a bit tricky and different so can take some time to get adjusted. But Susan has all the instructions to help you theough it.
Overall great place, great host and excellent location ."
2020-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,The place was clean but the neighborhood was noisy and we couldn't sleep well.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved Susan’s hospitality, she went above and beyond. Great communication, easy check-in, SO many snacks and clear instructions. Thank you for making us feel welcomed!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A very convenient place to stop between California and Wyoming. As others have described, the amenities are excellent: coffee, juice, cereal and even a full carton of milk! There is also an excellent collection of streaming channels: Disney+, Netflix etc. Comfortable and conveniently located near the highway so could be on our way within minutes. Would stay again."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice stop on our road trip back to CA. Remodeled, clean and stocked with snacks and Susan even provided some toys to entertain our 3.5year old. Easy access and Susan was very communicative. One thing to note is the cooling system is pretty loud and requires you to leave the windows open for it to work."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Susan and her daughter were responsive and friendly throughout my stay. There was a major storm my second night and they were quick to offer assurances that this was within the normal range of storms in the area.
The kitchen was among the best I’ve encountered in terms of helpful tools and ease of use. They had stocked a nice variety of treats and provided some basics that made cooking meals easy.
Bed was comfortable and a very nice bathroom. It was a great place to work and relax for a couple days with good wifi and functional workspace. Netflix and more on tv. Comfortable living area. Swamp coolers worked well to keep house cool and there was good signage that made it easy to operate various appliances. Thanks for a functional and comfortable place to work and rest!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Susan’s place was magnificent. Thoughtful touches including snacks, breakfast and lunch foods were perfect. They also allowed me to have an extremely late checkout as I was needing a place to work during the day. I would definitely recommend their place if you are in the area for whatever reason. Thank you!!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Group trip,I am new to the Air B&B experience and I wasn't sure I would feel comfortable with staying in a strangers house. Susan made the experience so comfortable and her personal touches made us feel like a part of the family. She responded quickly both times we had a request and made sure we had everything we needed.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great space and very kind Host. Host contacted me to confirm our booking because I had made a mistake in my initial message to her - love that she went above and beyond.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I have stayed at a lot of Airbnb’s now and this one probably had the most amenities of them all! It had pretty much everything you could think of: snacks, hot and cold drinks, cereal, condiments, hair dryer, washer and dryer with detergent etc. shampoo etc. if you stayed here you wouldn’t have to bring any of those annoying little travel packs. I also loved having two bathrooms and I noticed some bedding was updated from the photos and was super cute. Overall great place to stay! If we come back this way in future I’d definitely stay again and recommend."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Susan's airbnb is comfortable, clean and has everything you need. There are extra touches like lots of coffee, tea, milk and treats. Wifi is easily accessible. The cooling system works great! It was 100 degrees outside and we were comfortable inside. It was great to just kick back and she even had disney so I could watch Hamilton finally! The bed was comfortable, the shower was clean, everything was great. We stopped to break up our 3 day drive from Denver to the Bay Area and it was so easy. I had my own troubles for a moment unlocking the door and called and her daughter came by within minutes to help. (The trouble was completely my fault, not hers.) All in all I highly recommend Susan's place!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place for our family to stop for a night on our cross country trip. Location felt safe and home was clean. Susan went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable during our stay.

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place has a lot of basic amenities and great value for the money! The host also left us some snacks and the fully equipped kitchen came handy.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our second time staying at Susan's and it was even better than the last one. One of the reason was comparison. We stayed at many other airbnb properties in this trip and some of them were 2x the price but half the value. Susan is thoughtful and responsive. She responds immediately for any clarification you need regarding the property and check in. She also gives you coffee pods, milk, bread, egg etc. things you need to get your day started. Now, my preferred choice of stay in this area"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"She left snacks in the fridge and breakfast items, also drinks. The trailer was super cozy and clean! Had everything you could need to relax and feel at home. I’d definitely stay again next time I visit fernley!"

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Susan was a truly outstanding host! Everything about the place was comfortable and charming. Best of all, Susan added a number of really special touches just for us, like age appropriate toys for my 3 year old son (who had so much fun that he didn’t want to leave)! Would definitely love to return if we are ever traveling this way again!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Susan is the most considerate host I’ve ever encountered. It felt like staying at a friend’s home, in that there were so many thoughtful little touches like fresh eggs and juice in the fridge and snacks for my son after a long day of traveling. The tv had Disney+, Netflix and Amazon Prime video (and more), so there were lots of entertainment options - including some games and a play table for kids. My son really liked the bunk bed as a novelty since he doesn’t have one. The whole place was immaculately clean and it was easy to find. Fernley was also a great city to stop in, along hwy 80. There were some good restaurant options and a very well-stocked Walmart nearby. I also opted for this place to avoid a hotel during these risky times for catching Covid-19. I felt much safer here than in a place with common halls and elevators."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Susan is a fantastic host -- very attentive and easy to communicate with. Wonderful little home to stay at for a night.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Kitchen supplies were pretty basic, made it more difficult to feed a crowd with only a couple medium sized pans and no sheet pans. Also missing potholders for handling hot items from the oven. They sent a message that the trash was strictly one bag for our overnight but the trash cans were already overflowing when we got there."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Majeed was very responsive. Instructions, and stay was very easy for all of us."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Thank you for hosting my family and I! This place was amazing we felt right at home.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent
2023-12-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"The house was nice and spacious but we saw a mouse run from the laundry room to the locked closet door in the living room, had to move trash bin and bags in the garage to fit both cars, and the curtain hanger is very loose if you touch it. Other than that it was a good place to stay."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great price for the size. Hosts were extremely responsive and gave all the info we needed proactively.
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,.

2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Nice place
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The neighborhood is certainly quiet and off the beaten path. That made me feel more secure and the home was very quiet and there was ample parking. An older home, but they don't make em like they used to. House felt cozy and sturdy and the charm of the exterior lighting was nice."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dena and David were great hosts! The room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was directly across the hallway, was clean and well-stocked for guests."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This room is beautiful, comfy and refreshing. Dena’s home is beautiful! I loved all of the Christmas decorations. Classy and tasteful. Dena was responsive and respectful. The neighborhood was so cute and peaceful. It was the perfect place to lay my head down after a long day of events. Will 💯stay again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My stay was welcoming and warm. My room was clean and well put together. Dena was easy to communicate with and answered any questions I had.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed for 3 nights and had a wonderful time. My mother in law says she hopes to book here every time she visits Fallon!
My only critique would be that at night the entrance to the driveway is not well lit, so I guess it would be easier if to find in the dark with more lights. Over all, a wonderful place to stay."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Jamie’s place was perfect for our big truck and trailer as well as UHaul when we passed through. Very clean and she was super quick with responses!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very friendly and accomodating host! Jamie was fantastic! The home is very nice, private, and quiet. Even with it being around active farm equipment it was still quiet, peaceful, and the equipment could not be heard from inside. This home was perfect for our 2 week stay! Will definitely reccomend to friends that may need a place to stay if they are in the area!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home on the inside was wonderful. Extremely clean and very comfortable. Plenty of dishes and other supplies one might need. The outside of the home is a tiny bit rough. This is not a criticism, you can absolutely tell the outside is a work in progress. If the outside is finished as well as the inside, it will also be beautiful. We will be visiting the Fallon area more often and will absolutely reserve this Airbnb again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful weekend at Jamie’s place. Very comfortable, clean, easy check-in/out. Jamie is very responsive. Quiet rural neighborhood. The surroundings of the house look like a work in progress so we are curious how it will transform! Jamie is an awesome host!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Fantastic! Very accommodating and excellent hosts!
10/10 recommend"
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nothing fancy but got the job done. Was a little dirty upon arrival but hosts were very responsive and sent a cleaner when I asked for some additional cleaning. After that it was much better, but the house is a bit beat up and has just seems like it needs a good deep clean. Bit of an odd scent as well. That said, It worked fine for me, not sure If i would choose to stay again though. Hosts were very friendly, responsive and accommodating though so that was a positive!"

2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed about a week,nice little place but check windows pretty sure someone came in through my bedroom window at some point in our stay and we kept coming back to the house unlocked but never left anything more than cloths in there so nothing ever came up missing. little sketch being so close to weeklies. and was diaspointed there were no pots and pans to use for the stove.

2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a nice, spacious place to relax for a couple days while we did business in Reno. It was worth the 30 min drive. Definitely beat staying in a hotel, in my opinion."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super cute house. Clean and comfy with good amenities. Neighborhood leaves a bit to be desired but easy walking distance to restaurants and a nice brewery. Would certainly stay there again.

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Although this was just a work trip and my time at the Airbnb was just to rest after a long day, it felt like home away from home and if I ever do come back this way I will definitely be staying here again. Thank you so much for your hospitality again Sunny"
2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, cozy and easy access to the place, good for checking in late at night."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I stayed here for about a month and I have to say I felt very welcomed and at home since the very first day. Dawna is an amazing host, very friendly and personable. She helped me through a very rough time and transition when it wasn’t expected. Really felt like part of the family while staying there. It did feel like a second home after I got comfortable and settled in. I would definitely stay here again in the future and recommend anyone new in town or passing through to stay here compared to the local temporary living. Thank you Dawna for being part of my life, I couldn’t have asked for a better host/place to stay in my time of need."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,of course I had to come back! Dawna has always been a great host and is constantly updating the space to have more amenities. She even helped me get my car unstuck from the snow after a major freak snowstorm!! I will always recommend anyone coming to this area to stay in one of dawna's rooms!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Two nights in the single sanctum, comfortable bed, tv, plenty room for all my stuff,
place for my laptop and my coffee maker,
yes the place was very nice,
but the best part was meeting Dawna and her husband, two great, accommodating, and friendly people.
Thank you."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"After staying here for a two month long term stay, this place is an amazing stay. Dawna took amazing care of me and takes amazing care of her house. As my first long term stay at an airbnb, I could not have asked for a better place! The room is the perfect size for one person. The bed was comfortable and there was plenty of extra amenities available to use. I did not partake in any 420 activities while staying, but the house does not smell like weed at all. If you're in the area looking for a place to stay, this is the one. If I ever come back, this is where I'll pick every time! 💜"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing Host,
Quite possibly the Best Air BNB I’ve ever stayed at. Clean Home, Courteous Hostess. Plenty of Amenities including an amazing Kitchen. Very Peaceful stay."
,,,"So, I feel compelled to write an honest review. As a host myself, I think Airbnb users deserve to know what they’re paying for. I would not recommend this place. My wife and I almost had to find another place to stay in the middle of the night. Unfortunately, the cohost occupies the adjacent space that shares a wall in the bedroom of the unit. From about 10pm until the morning hours, they had very loud music playing (think booming through the walls). After a long day of travel, the last thing I wanted was to be kept awake by loud music, especially from the cohost. I sent a message to the host through Airbnb, sent a text message to her phone, and called her phone several times. She never responded to me (and still hasn’t). There was no number listed for the cohost. We finally resorted to banging on the walls, which is not something anyone looks forward to doing when paying for a restful night. This complete lack of hospitality soured the entire experience."
,,,"Horrible experience! Not a good place to stay!
The ""jacuzzi soaker tub"" is a child's tub. It does not fit one adult and is certainly not fit for a couple trying to enjoy time. The host left the wood open to under the tub, so we could see the dead rodents as well as the poison to kill said rodents. The poison, alone, was not safe for us to breath in, let alone the DEAD RODENTS.
Even excluding the tub, the place was VERY UNCLEAN. The host was super intrusive, and someone tried to BREAK INTO OUR ROOM at 5:00 AM. We paid for 2 nights and stayed only the one."
,,,"I was taken aback upon arrival as the outside appearance is a bit run down, and her livestock were lying in the driveway by my room and not enclosed. I had my dog with me who is recovering from a knee injury, and it is not detailed in her description that livestock will be loose and unattended outside the door to your room. Her dog is a pretty dirty farm dog, which is a great life for a dog, however he leaned into my car as I opened the door and the host was not around. I did not feel comfortable letting my dog out of the car with unattended livestock and pets so close. The room was very clean but unfortunately the odor of bleach was so overpowering that it was uncomfortable to be inside. Normally you could open windows to mitigate this, however the air quality index in the area was hazardous that day and week from over a million acres of forest fires burning in neighboring states. I explained to the host that my dog and I were both having allergies from smoke inhalation and I therefore couldn't open the windows to air out the bleach, and the smell was too strong and unhealthy for us to stay in there with the windows closed. Julie responded by saying ""I have a strict cancellation policy and great reviews"", rather than showing an interest in what was uncomfortable for me regarding her stay. She then agreed to a 50% refund and said she would keep her word, but did not go forward with that in the end and denied my request through airbnb for that. It was my first disappointing and frustrating experience with airbnb, and stressful as I had to drive to Reno to find other accommodations that would take a pet on short notice with many folks staying in town who had fled forest fires."
,,,"Place was still dirty when I check in. Called the owner and he sent some to clean. But it needs a deep clean. Only the primary area where cleaned, I had to clean the light switches, mirrors, door handles. Couch, bedroom tables. The main areas in the kitchen were clean, but move anything and there’s food and dirt and hair there. Overall very disappointed. Also house is located next to a main road. So you hear cars all night. When a Simi truck passes the house it shakes. Asked for cleaning fee refund, but not happening."
