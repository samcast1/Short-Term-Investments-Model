2024-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Overall I would describe my stay as ‚Äúokay‚Äù. The main factors that did not make my stay ‚Äúgreat‚Äù were the screams of the hosts kids early in the AM (9am both morning of the stay), the chicken sounds also in the AM (as early as 6am), and the bed could be improved (low to the ground and slopes toward the middle).
Everything is as described in the listing and the stay is in a desirable location but would probably look for a different Airbnb on my next visit."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and quiet place just love it !!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,A host that is very flexible and responsive. Terrific location and very comfortable stay!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Eva‚Äôs place was so lovely and felt like a cozy home away from home! Everything was pristinely clean and the decor was carefully selected for a welcoming environment. The location is right off the plaza and everything is within walking distance. Please come and enjoy this amazing getaway!!:) thanks again Eva for your generosity and hospitality!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time here, it was in a perfect location took about 9 mins to get to wherever we were going. Everything was so clean and the bed was super comfortable. Perfect little spot for two people. Would stay again if we went back!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Very close to cool shops and restaurants. Nice quiet neighborhood. Eva was very responsive to our needs.
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,It was cute! Location was great. I think it was fair for the price.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely place, just as described. Hostess was great to work with, very accomodating."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect place for a quick solo trip. Thanks guys!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cottage is very cozy and clean. Great location with restaurants within walking distance and a short drive to downtown. Quick response time from the host! I enjoyed my stay and would book this place again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved this tiny little space & the area. Me and my husband had a great stay & would definitely return in the future!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very cute, clean, and convenient!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A Lovely little spot just minutes away from the Plaza Arts district. Close to museums and all that good stuff in OKC. I highly recommend it!
2024-04-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Cute. Great location. Host was very nice and responsive to our concerns. The bed was comfy. It was cool to be able to see the neighbors‚Äô chickens. They weren‚Äôt noisy at all. I‚Äôd say the listing was accurate, and we had a great time running around OKC. I‚Äôm happy we were so close to the Plaza area. It was our favorite by far."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay at Eva‚Äôs Airbnb- it was clean, cozy and private and had everything one would need. I only wish we could have stayed another night! Definitely recommended."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"One of my favorite places I've stayed. This was exactly what I wanted - a cozy, clean and cute little place for my week in OKC. Right down the street from the Plaza and I didn't want to leave. Worth every penny and hope to stay here again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Eva's place was great - a very easy walk down to the Plaza for fun eats and drinks, and a perfectly cozy little getaway!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for what we needed. It was nice having places to walk and eat. Felt private. Ubers around the city were pretty cheap. If I came back to OKC I would consider this listing!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great Hostess,"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Cozy cottage in a nice neighborhood.
2024-03-01,3,Stayed one night,"We didn‚Äôt have an issue finding the address or getting to the backyard, but if you had very large or heavy suitcases it could be difficult as there was no paved path and you had to walk around the hosts vehicles in the driveway. The place was cute and nicely decorated. Only tap water available, I wished there was a water filter pitcher in the fridge. There was no ice available. Everything looked and felt clean - however I had troubles falling asleep because the linens smelled so bad. It was like they were using a moldy washing machine. The towels were the same. They looked clean but just had a lingering musty and unpleasant odor. The worst part was the guinea fowl! I knew they had chickens‚Ä¶. But these other birds were SO LOUD and INCESSANT at all hours. Also, kids playing right outside made our adult *alone* time feel‚Ä¶awkward. The screen over the front door of the place was quite sheer and I didn‚Äôt feel like we had privacy in that room. The price was very reasonable, though."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,The house was perfect for a one night stay. The location was super close to the concert venue we attended (Beer City Music Hall). Overall a good experience. Thank you for the hospitality.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved staying at Eva‚Äôs! Perfect distance to walk to the Plaza, and exactly what we needed for the weekend. Hope to visit again!"

2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Cute spot, def get the Scandi IKEA vibe here. Loved that the next door neighbor behind the unit had a chicken coup. Didn‚Äôt feel like you were in Oklahoma City üòÉ"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice private area! Very cozy
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a very cozy stay and felt right at home. We hope to stay here again!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice quiet area, but there was a lot of things to do within driving/ walking distance. Eva was very clear with her directions so check in was a breeze."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything was great!
2023-12-01,3,Stayed one night,"Nice location- quiet and near restaurants. However, the hostess ignored multiple messages about our need for bath towels (never responded even though the messages were read). We were unable to take showers because of this and were in the middle of a road trip. The bed was also uncomfortable and caved in towards the middle. Additionally, the air/heating unit rumbled the room so I would recommend turning it off to sleep."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, Felt like home! Eva was great! Perfect for our weekend in OKC!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great price! Cozy and cute accommodations. All was clean and nice.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Eva's place was beautiful, cozy, and very thoughtful. Perfect natural light and efficient layout for a small space. Amenities were just what we needed. Super walkable to the Plaza district, and a ton of cute houses throughout the neighborhood!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This airbnb was a great stay for me. I was inbetween workstations and needed a place to stay for 2 nights and it right during Halloween. So the neighborhood was flooded with kiddos but it was nice.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Eva's place was a fantastic little private place tucked away in a nice neighborhood but not far from pretty much anything you would need. A grouping of restaurants was half a mile away and, like most things in OKC, anything else was just 15 minutes away. The place was clean and had everything I needed for the stay and Eva was super friendly and responsive. Great recommendations too. Highly recommended, would definitely stay here again!"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"Location is walking distance from the plaza district with plenty of things to do and places to eat.
The listing looks just like the photos and had everything we could need for a quick weekend stay."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Good place to stay while visiting family in OKC. We didn‚Äôt have a car so walking to the Plaza is a huge bonus - shops, bars, restaurants. The space is the perfect size for two. It‚Äôs nothing glamorous, but just fine for us!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay!! We enjoyed our stay!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really enjoyed staying at Eva's place. It was a great, cozy space with everything we needed while traveling. Would definitely stay again if we're in the area."

2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice place. Great location. Useful amenities and items provided. Would stay again.
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,It was a good location and the bed was comfortable. It was a little hard to get belongings into the unit as the entry to the unit was the main tenants driveway so had to squeeze by cars.
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"Older, but fixed up.
Clean"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,I was only there for one night for a concert but Eva's place was quiet and clean and one of the few who has matcha in their home. I'm not a coffee drinker myself and when I saw there was matcha and even a kettle for me to make some I was over the moon with joy!! 10 out of 10 would stay here a again!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Enjoyed our one night stay at Eva's house. Nice neighborhood in close proximity to a variety of restaurants and shops. It was too hot for us to walk around and explore, but we would definitely return to the area at a cooler time of year and do just that. We were traveling home after a long camping trip and had a lot of gear in our car but felt secure leaving it parked on the street. Appreciated that Eva already had the air conditioning on so that the space was cool when we arrived. Appreciated the awesome coffee setup even more."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay for a weekend trip!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We stayed at the plaza cottage for one night. It was perfect for a night getaway to celebrate my girlfriends birthday. We decided to stay in but there was so much to do around us. Very clean and would stay again.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a great anniversary weekend at the cottage. We love exploring the Plaza District so the proximity was awesome. We went to a concert at Beer City Music Hall and it was a short drive just like the various local breweries. Eva and her family are so sweet and accommodating. We would recommend this place to any couple looking for a fun, romantic, weekend."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay...everything as stated!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We absolutely loved this place in OKC! We were there just one night on a road trip and it had everything we needed. The space is perfect for a short or long stay and the neighborhood has such great restaurants and shops. Highly recommend!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was passing through and only stayed for one night but the cottage was so cozy and welcoming, I wish I was there longer. It is very walkable to restaurants and bars and in a quiet neighborhood where I felt very safe. 10/10 would absolutely recommend!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had a lovely stay at the cottage--the bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom and kitchen were very well-stocked! It was a little bit of a challenge to locate at night time, but I managed."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a nice overnight stay at Eva‚Äôs cottage while we were in OKC. It is in a quiet neighborhood, set back behind the main house. It is a short walking distance from restaurants at Midtown. It has all the amenities you need for a short stay. Thank you!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Our stay in Eva‚Äôs cottage was great! We felt like home! Everything was like in the description. The neighborhood was really beatiful and safe. Eva and his husband have been really kind and give us useful suggestions! We would like to come back to OKC!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very cute, just like the pics. Only stayed for one night but it was exactly what I needed! Thanks Eva!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at Eva's was fantastic. The place was super cute and clean. I would definitely stay at it again. The neighborhood was peaceful and I felt very safe. As we walked down the walkway to the private stay the hosts were on the front porch hanging out and we were able to chat and get to know each other some. Super welcoming and friendly!!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Eva's place was so cute and lovely. We were passing through Oklahoma City and I highly recommend staying here!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed this space! It was easy to get around to everything we needed in OKC and we enjoyed being close to some fun local restaurants and shops. Everything was neat, clean, and comfortable, and we appreciated thoughtful touches, like good coffee, oatmeal, and toiletries. The bed is a bit low, which didn‚Äôt bother us, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend for everyone. There‚Äôs also a step up from the kitchenette to the bedroom, which, again, wasn‚Äôt an issue for us, but is something others may want to be aware of. Overall, we would definitely recommend and will try to book again next time we‚Äôre in OKC!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"it was in a nice location, clean, and safe. Eva was helpful and communicative. I appreciated having matcha and milk in the fridge! it was a nice convenience"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved this spot! It was perfect for my wife and I. Really close to lots of things in OKC.
2023-05-01,4,Stayed one night,"The place is nice but very hard to find the location at night, I arrived at 9:30pm and hopefully one neighbor helped me to locate the house."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed staying here. It was a quick walk to a strip of local restaurants and close to our other destinations in the city. Easy check in and clean.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely spot! We had a show at The Tower Theatre and it was the perfect stay. Would definitely stay again.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was perfect for my couple day say in OKC! I loved how close it was to the Plaza District restaurants and it was even close enough for us to scooter to downtown! The mattress was so comfortable that before I left I took a picture of tag on it because I want one in my house!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Eva's place was a wonderful choice for our night in OKC! She was so easy to communicate with. Highly recommend!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I‚Äôd have to stay that this was one of the best experiences we‚Äôve ever had with a host, and such a wonderful overall experience with our stay that I cannot recommend Eva‚Äôs place more.
She sent a message at the time of booking-weeks in advance, asking if we had questions and I asked for all of her recommendations.
She asked my interests and tailored a guide specifically to me. I made a brief mention about liking Matcha tea, and that was that.
Fast forward, we arrive with a breeze of a check in, took a look around and everything fit the space so well. You can tell Eva has attention to detail and despite the space being small, it was exactly what we needed.
She had a coffee corner where something caught my eye, a matcha setup to make my own, that I had forgotten I had told her about weeks prior. Turns out she got me everything to make it because she dug deeper and found out the place she mentioned stopped serving matcha and she didn‚Äôt want me to miss out.
The cherry on top of our trip"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay very much. Eva was a terrific host and great communicator, and we would certainly stay here again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Sure, we could come again. Nice stay."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was a very cute and well decorated AirBNB! There were good amenities and everything you would need for a quick getaway. It probably wouldn't be big enough for more than 2 people. The space was a little small and a bit noisy with it being a converted shed behind a home, but aside from that it was quiet at night and very cozy. It was also close to a good area of OKC in a nice neighborhood. Thanks for the great stay and hospitality."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely little cottage :)
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,this place had everything we needed for our quick stay! the bed was very comfortable and the place was very clean. we definitely recommend.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Quaint and charming guest cottage walking distance to neighborhood food and drink! Comfortable and peaceful space with friendly and accommodating hosts.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Eva‚Äôs place was a nice and secluded getaway in OKC! It was just a 10 minute commute downtown, and had a beautiful quaint kitchenette and bedroom! She also provided me with a variety of different recommendations for food and coffee shops, as well as places open late for a bite to eat since I was getting in very late. I was able to explore OKC and find just what I needed when I was in town!"
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Responsive host. Is behind their house and in between some yards with kids in the houses playing outside. So not super private, but lovely place."
2023-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"We booked this place at 3 pm the same day we arrived‚Äî very last minute. We were thankful to find a place available that felt safe and was convenient. It was clean and tidy. The bed was plenty comfortable, which was a plus. The street is tight but in a quiet neighborhood. We would definitely stay here again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great Cottage! Very private and clean.
She also left some dairy free milk and oat meal which was amazing. I highly recommend this cozy place for someone who is coming to Oklahoma. Thank you Eva!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Eva‚Äôs place was perfect. We explored Bricktown and the canal on our cross country road trip and it was the perfect place to sleep and shower. The neighborhood was safe with very unique houses. Highly recommended!
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy is the perfect description! Eva's place is a cute, stand-alone cottage in the back of their driveway. Clean with very comfortable bed, it is perfect for 1 or 2 people to stay when in Oklahoma City. It's extremely close to the Plaza strip via 3-5 minute walk. Great local restaurants and bars. Perfect free on-street parking and easy driving or Uber/Lyft access to other parts of the city for exploring. Cottage included anything you may need for your stay as it relates to toiletries (bonus for including some items that other places don't provide!) and in-kitchen essentials. Was pleasantly surprised to have option to create own french press coffee in the morning. Recommend for your next stay in OKC :)"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,It was great! The check in was simple and the place was well stocked. Would def return when in OKC!
2023-03-01,3,Stayed one night,"I wouldn't go out of my way to find it again. It is suitable for one or maybe two ppl for a few nights.
Bed is comfy.
Neighborhood seemed safe. There was a sheriff's SUV parked across the street overnight, guess he lives nearby.
The unit does not feel private or quiet. You are obviously staying in someone's mother-in-law cottage just a few feet away.
Shower is *tiny*.
One small car will park in the middle of the driveway and make it weird to walk back and forth.
Milk in the fridge was unopened but weeks expired, glad I didn't drink it ü§¢"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,my stay was very comfortable in this cozy cottage. it had everything I needed and was quiet and private. The decor was simple and elegant and the cottage was clean and tidy. I will definitely stay here again when the need arises.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful family!! I asked about healthy places to eat and because it was a Sunday, Eva was concerned about my finding a good place due to limited places opened on Sunday. She invited me to dinner. The meal was healthy. delicious , and simple. She cooked a chicken from their stock and veggies and we had wonderful ,stimulating conversation with 3 beautiful children present.
Thank you Eva, Truman, Viliam, Winter, and Smillen( forgive spelling mistakes) for opening your home to me. Many blessings to you."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome host and an awesome cottage! Thanks Eva!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Eva‚Äôs house was super cute and clean! It‚Äôs the perfect size for a couples weekend. It‚Äôs also located near a bunch of different restaurants and things to do.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay here! Location was easy to access and in walking distance to the Plaza district. The bed was very comfortable! Perfect cottage for a little getaway trip.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"parking can be a little confusing as there is not much room on the street to park without fear of your vehicle being hit. Otherwise, it is a great place to stay, it was a great and very homy place."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice cozy little place with hot water and good heat! Just right for our needs!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Eva has a great place! It's easy to find and has plenty of street parking. Clean, cute, and comfortable. It's also easy walking distance to the Plaza district which is a massive bonus!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fantastic, cozy cottage with easy access to great food and entertainment. Quiet and beautiful neighborhood and still very secluded"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,As described. Has everything you need for your stay. Small ish drive way that is sometimes hard to get through without having to step in the grass/under small tree branches. Worth the price!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,The Airbnb was so cute! We really enjoyed our stay.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was clean, quiet, and so close to everything.m in the city. We will definitely stay again!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"An adorable and well-appointed cottage! Would definitely stay again. Great area, LOTS of shops but also private and peaceful. Extremely comfortable bed and lots more amenities than some larger places I've stayed, quite impressive! I was nervous about the shower (as a fat) but it was great w/ everything you could need on a trip!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Eva‚Äôs place is exactly as described. It offers a bit more than a standard hotel room and gives you an idea of what it‚Äôs like to live like a local, tucked into a quaint neighborhood away from the bustle of downtown. We did take advantage of the ease of street parking, leaving our car by the cottage and walked a couple of miles to check out local sites, restaurants and breweries. As others have mentioned the shower is a bit tight, but the remaining bedroom and kitchen space makes up for it."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I stayed here for a night while in OKC, and it was great! The shower is small, though, so just keep that in mind! But still a very nice place!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was exactly like the photos and the description on how to find it and get checked in were very descriptive. Perfect for a few nights stay. The shower was a bit small but overall the quaintness of the whole place was perfect for me.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Charming place that was just the right size for two people to accommodate our brief stay. It was clean, comfortable, easy to find and a short walk from the Plaza district where there were plenty of places to eat or grab a beer."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Extremely comfortable, safe, and a great host -- perfect for my work trip. Highly recommend!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"My boyfriend and I went to the Warriors vs Thunder game and needed somewhere to stay. When I found this Airbnb, I was ecstatic. It‚Äôs modern, beautiful, and cozy. We only stayed for one night but the hosts provided towels, washcloths, women products, etc. There‚Äôs also a coffee grinder, keurig, mini fridge, and much more. The hosts really know how to make their guests feel at home and it was much appreciated!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great stay. It was freezing out but nice a cozy inside. Lots of nice restaurants nearby.
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice owners, very clean house, and easy walk to plaza."

2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,llll
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very cozy little guesthouse. Bathroom was a little on the small side, but it's expected with what you booked and serves it purpose well enough. very quiet area. felt right at home. Eva was very quick with responding to any questions. Highly recommended."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was amazing! We absolutely loved the stay! Would definitely go back!!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I loved our stay here! Very clean and cozy. I believe the hostess was out of town for the holidays, and she so kindly let us park our car in the driveway. Everything was just like it was pictured and described, and keyless entry was perfect considering we arrived pretty late at night. The shower is a tad small, as mentioned in the listing, but we had no problems showering at all‚Äîjust not the type of shower you can share. Neighborhood is quiet and serene, felt very safe."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had an excellent stay at this charming and spotless garden cottage. The hygge is strong here and the coffee was excellent. The nearby Plaze district offers a lot to do and is a short, pleasant walk from the cottage. Thank you, Eva!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a wonderful stay at Eva‚Äôs cottage. They were accommodating with letting us park our car in their driveway while they were out of town. Their friendly neighbors took care of their cute chickens. There‚Äôs a sheriff that lives nearby as well so it felt even more safe for neighborhoods. The whole historical homes in the area were beautiful and had so much character. This cottage was the perfect size and close to so much like a short drive to the Paycom Center to watch a Thunder game. Eva gave great recommendations on food, but also highly recommend Cafe Kacao. The bed was comfortable with clean and soft linens. We‚Äôd stay here again for sure."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A small, simple, cozy cottage, excellent for travelers passing through OKC or as a place to relax while in town for a conference. Very safe neighborhood of unique houses: family residences. A very funky 3-block district of shops and restaurants and brew pubs is a 10 min walk away. The street is well away from noisy interstates and streets, and the little house itself is tucked back off-street: private, a good night's sleep assured. Be aware that the kitchen is a bit under-equipped for cooking a meal. Highly recommended."

2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Emi's place was great. She made sure to ask me if I had cat allergies, since they have cats in the main part of the home. I do have mild allergies if I get around them too long, or maybe get the right amount of dander or hair on me. She assured me that they do not get into the guest side, so I decided to take the chance. When I arrived, she told me that she put an air purifier in my room, and had shut off the vent connected to the main part of the home so the air could be purified by the time I checked in. I had a great nights sleep, without any sign of allergies. I really appreciated the honesty and concern to make sure I had a great and safe stay. I would recommend her place anytime."

She always was making sure I am safe and don‚Äôt need anything. She and all her family were very nice. She is a great host and mom! During that hard time with everything closed, cancelled rotations, staying at home just studying, the low mood and anxiety surrounding the circumstances and add to this being away from home, I felt like there is someone didn‚Äôt want me to feel away from home or to miss family.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was as described. Quite and clean. Would stay again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a really nice choice for our trip to OKC. It's a new build, and new style of home that you may not have seen before. Small living space, but well-organized and offering enough room so my wife and I could work independently when necessary. Stairs are tight and steep - they'll be tricky for children and/or those with knee trouble. Neighborhood is terrific - residents out walking dogs and waving at each other. Onsite eating at Taco Nation (good) and a Fall Farmer's Market in the center of town. Very charming.
The loft at the top of the stairs was an oasis - including a futon, electric standing/sitting desk and plenty of natural daylight. The living room allowed for some pre-bed television, and they had a new memory foam mattress - meaning we both slept well (no divots or bouncy springs). My wife was pleased that the kitchen offered all the amenities we needed, and the host left some beverages in the fridge as a courtesy. I was glad for quiet neighbors and fast internet."

Will definitely stay here again if we are in the area."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Katherine‚Äôs place was more than I could ask for in an Airbnb. I came upon it after arriving to a different airbnb and needing to move to a last minute place for health reasons. Katherine was immediately receptive and flexible which allowed me to make a quick transition to her place where I could easily let out a sigh of relief. Her place was immaculate, and thoughtfully curated and in a really cool spot. I wish I could have stayed there longer. I went from the worst Airbnb I‚Äôve stayed in to probably one of the best.

Eric and Blake‚Äôs place in the Plaza District is a clear standout from all the rest. I returned here every chance I could because they have created such a comfortable, lovely space in a great neighborhood. There are so many wonderful touches-plentiful, high quality towels, choices of delicious coffee, the perfect selection of dishes and wine glasses, thoughtful snacks-so many of the things that help a person relax when traveling. The design is extremely well done and the art choices are spot on. Eric and Blake could not be better hosts-so very kind and generous and welcoming. I am so grateful to have found this gem!"

The bed was super comfortable, the TV was huge and had plenty of streaming services, the WiFi was fast, the fresh flowers were lovely, and the washer and dryer in unit was a godsend. The artwork was gorgeous and fun, the instructions were excellent, the hosts were extremely responsive and friendly, and the most fun neighborhood in the city is a few blocks away (The Plaza). Even the occasional neighborhood church bells (daytime) reminded me of my grandparents‚Äô grandfather clock and made me smile. The cold water and breakfast items were very thoughtful and the dogs were adorable and greeted me on occasion. Such a great place! I will be back! Trust me, THIS is where you want to stay!
Oh, and you MUST try the pie and quiche at The Pie Junkie in The Plaza! Call ahead or go online to order and they will have it ready. Great take out!"

Only tiny negatives (although clearly stated in their listing) is there is no bathroom door, if that's an issue, and their ceiling fan is a little noisy if it's hot out, you like to have the fan on at night, and you're a light sleeper. Otherwise, this is one of the better Air BnB's we've rented, and is perfect for a couple visiting OKC and wanting to be close to everything in the central part of the city."

The location was great because it was only a 10 minuet drive or less from everywhere around the city that we needed to go for our friends wedding. Fair warning to any light sleepers who are staying for the weekend, there is a church across the street and on Sunday they rang the bells bright and early. We didn‚Äôt mind since we were already up to catch a flight, but it might be something to be aware of if you like to spend your Sundays sleeping in. Other than that, 10/10 would highly recommend!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't recommend Eric and Blake's place enough! It's definitely a great place for being on your own or a couple. It's mentioned in the description but just a heads up that this is a guest house and there isn't a door for the bathroom. If that isn't an issue for you, it's so comfortable and cozy!
Everything in the place is so updated and really thoughtfully put together. You'll never want to stay in a hotel again! The bed is so comfortable (a big plus for me!) and there is a large TV in the bedroom with access to Netflix, Hulu, etc. The shower is great as well. Even though the space is small, the kitchen is set up nicely. It's not a full kitchen, but they have a hot plate, toaster, microwave, and fridge if you have leftovers or want to cook something easy. They also have a dishwasher and plenty of dishes.
They also left granola bars and oatmeal and various snacks. Which was super thoughtful and sweet. Plus as you can see in the pictures, the entire place is decorated with local artwork. Really loved my stay here!"

I wish I had a reason to stay here more often! 100% recommend."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute and clean, small but functional, guest house. Convenient location and comfortable. Only (very minor) possible issue: the owners‚Äô home is next to the guest house, and they have 3 dogs. We love dogs, so not an issue for us, but be aware that the dogs probably will be out a couple times each day around the guest house, and they will bark in the early morning (6 or 7 am), if you‚Äôre a light sleeper (or don‚Äôt like dogs)."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is so adorable! Huge spacious bathroom with natural light was a huge perk. Had a nicely appointed kitchen that ALMOST made me want to cook on vacation.
The neighborhood is cute and quiet and also like 10 minutes from basically everything I wanted to do."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We couldn't have chosen a better place to stay at in OKC! This guest house is small, but super nice and just all around perfect for a couple or small family like ours(1 child). We loved how clean and welcoming the place felt as soon as we stepped up into the unit. Not only is the guest house super nice, but the Wheeler District, in which it lies, is really beautiful also. The best part though is its location! It's super close to all and any downtown activities, restaurants, or sights you may want to visit. Most stuff in downtown, including bricktown, is about a 10-15min drive up the road. Super convenient in every way.
We truly did enjoy our stay, even though it was just for two nights. Stephanie and Chris are amazing hosts. Great communication and they make you feel welcome and right at home. Don't pass this AirBnB up. Highly Recommend a stay here!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,It‚Äôs was fantastic!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Highly recommend staying here!!! We really enjoyed our time in this neighborhood and at the Airbnb! The Airbnb smelled amazing, was really clean, and the bed & couch were so comfy! Stephanie, Chris and their kids are friendly and welcoming! The neighborhood is very new but feels very welcoming! Also Taco Nation has the best tacos ever!! All in all, great stay- and we hope to back some day!!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stephanie's place was such a delight to stay in. The area was both clean and looked just like the images. Stephanie was a communicative host. She was very responsive, even late at night/early in the morning. I recommend staying here if you are wanting a relaxing stay."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely beautiful Airbnb! Extremely clean and smelled soooo fresh. We felt very comfortable, and the hostess was so kind and hospitable! She provided more than what was even needed, and was very attentive. It was the perfect place for us to stay ü§ç"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you were going to be in Oklahoma City for any reason, I highly suggest booking this Airbnb. It‚Äôs located in a peaceful, enchanting neighborhood with a brewery, coffee shop, taco restaurant, and several parks within walking distance. The space itself is beautifully decorated, clean, and comfortable. They have added very thoughtful touches, such as a fully stocked coffee/tea drawer, a locals guidebook to Oklahoma City, and a cute, easy to identify entrance marker. Felt like a home away from home! The host is very accommodating, communicates well, and is super responsive.
Stephanie and her husband created such a fantastic space. I can‚Äôt wait to visit again. Thank you so much !!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved Scissortail! Very comfortable couch with the TV set up to watch multiple streaming services. Well-appointed kitchen with everything easy to find. I was able to park right by the entrance and could see my vehicle from the living room.
If you stay in Wheeler you must check out the businesses nearby. More coming each week, The Big Friendly is a great brewery. A huge bonus of staying at the property is the proximity of the businesses.
Stephanie was very quick with communication and answering my questions through the app! Super friendly, she could not have been a better host. Everything was easy to use, they've got one of the better welcome books I've seen. Scissortail is a great spot, I'm definitely coming back!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a beautiful, cute cottage neighborhood, and this rental was the perfect stay for our one night in OKC. We had everything we needed, and communication was impeccable. We had a blast, and you will too!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Don‚Äôt have a single negative thing to say about this place. Great host and great price. The location is beautiful and easy to feel right at home. Even with the temperature falling down to 5, couldn‚Äôt think of a better place to cozy up. Will definitely be back here when I come back to OKC."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, beautiful design, and everything has been thought of! The coffee/tea drawer is epic and all AirBnB hosts need to take notes!!! 10/10 will recommend to ALL of my out of town guests and colleagues!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed in many Air Bnb‚Äôs, but I have never been as impressed as I was with Stephanie and Chris‚Äô place! Not only did they have clear instructions, but I was checked on multiple times throughout my stay. The apartment was immaculate and so aesthetically pleasing. Will definitely be back!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the best visit at The Scissortail OKC! Stephanie is an INCREDIBLE host. The space is absolutely gorgeous, peaceful, & clean! The space is fully stocked with anything & everything you will need. So thoughtful & intentional to provide guests with the best experience & stay. The checkin/checkout instructions were clear and to the point. Stephanie also was very responsive, interactive and friendly! She gave us great local recommendations and offered to be any help that she could be. We will definitely be back to stay anytime we are in the area!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place deserves more than 5 stars! I thoroughly enjoyed my stay! Stephanie was the best and most responsive host ever and made me feel right at home. The home is full of top notch amenities, cozy touches, and is located in a great area. Can‚Äôt wait to stay again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND
Stephanie was my favorite host to ever have on Airbnb. She was incredibly involved and helpful. My favorite stays are always on the property someone is currently living in because there are around for any help or needs. Stephanie‚Äôs home was BEAUTIFUL and had every travel necessity you could think of (EVEN SHOWER CAPS!) I will most definitely be staying here again in the future."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely did not expect how amazing this place was. The community was beautiful and peaceful and the views were amazing!

There was plenty of space for two couples and the hosts have done a great job with decorating.
I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient stay. Will definitely book again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"While our expectations were not completely met with respect to the value for the condition of the home, our host was accommodating in meeting our expectations with customer service to help offset our disappointment.
We certainly appreciate the gesture of breakfast offering or 15% off of our next stay!
We most likely will not stay again for $230/night for the amount of issues in cleanliness and disrepair that took down the value of the advertisement.
We were also on alert with DB monitors in the home, the overall comfort level of the home, dirty walls and baseboards, loose flooring, broken bed frame, and the very strong odor of Marijuana for the majority of our stay."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,I didn't know what to expect. After I got there I was amazed at the building. It was great with a great view of Oklahoma City!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to have all to yourself. Good locations nearby and walking distance too. The price should've been $150/per night, $247 overall price was too much to cover the cleaning expenses for the host. I do love the layout and style of the place though, it's beautiful but the price could be better. I recommend it for the experience."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"A one minute walk to some really nice restaurants. A cool coffee shop up the street. Great OKC cityscape view from the master bedroom balcony. This was one of my fav AirBnBs, you won't go wrong staying here."
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful condo in the minimalist style. It's location is great: within walking or trolley distance to dining and more, including the OK City Convention Center. The unit was fragrance chemical scent free and there were no musty, dusty carpets. The heating and cooling worked well and access to the unit was simple.
There were some cons for us tho: the furniture in the living area was fantastically uncomfortable which made it difficult to enjoy tv watching and meeting sessions, additionally, the living area contains an entire wall made of glass without shades or curtains so there is no privacy in that room. There were no shelves or racks in the shower to place your home-brought shampoos and soaps and the door to the bathroom with the shower in it did not close all the way. Also lacking in the condo in general was the option to dim lights or have low light level choices.
We hope these things might change because we'd love to count on this condo as our go-to stay in OKC!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and very clean.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great host
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"My wife and I stayed overnight during our cross-country drive from California to North Carolina. We knew we had a long drive from Santa Fe to Oklahoma City, and that we would arrive late and tired. We needed a comfortable place with laundry near the downtown area, and this was perfect. Cody was extremely responsive to a couple of questions. After a good night's sleep, I enjoyed coffee and pastry from a nearby shop while taking in the views from the living area. The photographs accurately reflect the stylist interior. Although I didn't walk much during this stay, I know the area well, and this is a great location walking distance from the downtown area and several restaurants."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nicer places in okc price is cheap for location
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Exactly as advertised - in an awesome location in Midtown, easy walking distance to several restaurants and bars, and very unique with the large windows and excellent view of downtown. We traveled with our newborn and dog and had a great time. The neighboring space for pets was very useful and there was always ample parking on the street in front of the unit. The stairs between levels provided a good workout, so keep that in mind if any of your guests would struggle with that. We didn‚Äôt find the city noise to be an issue, but you will hear sirens coming and going from a local hospital. The hosts were very responsive and helpful! I would highly recommend for smaller parties who want to enjoy the nightlife in the area."

2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Six of us had a wonderful weekend getaway to celebrate our friend‚Äôs upcoming wedding. We ate/drank, hung out at the pool and hot tub, played pool and cards. And most of all enjoyed the great conversations within a backdrop of an absolutely gorgeous home inside and out. There were so many rooms; it took awhile to remember the way away around the home. We felt very special."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"This place was amazing... truly living up to its name, ""The Dream!"" The beautiful hacienda style home is perched on a gorgeous and manicured hillside, among tall trees and flowing fountains. The property is secluded and private, yet close to anything you need in town.
We rented the main house, both casitas, and the separate guest house for a family gathering, and loved having the whole property to enjoy. The exterior is green and lush, with beautiful landscaping and potted plants everywhere. The interior feels like a museum of carefully curated one-of-a-kind antiques, art pieces, and Mexican pottery. You could spend hours admiring the fabulous architecture of this historic home, along with the thoughtfully chosen updates and unique decor throughout.
Other amenities like Nespresso machines placed in each of the bedroom areas and fresh robes hanging in the closets make you feel like you are truly pampered. The owners were very kind and easy to reach for anything."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,El Sueno was the perfect place to celebrate our Anniversary with the entire family. Sherry & Erick made the stay easy. The grounds were beautiful and the house is beyond spectacular. It comes with lots of amenities. The kitchen had everything we needed for cooking several meals. It was too cold to use the pool or hottub but it looked inviting and easy to use. We would definitely want to stay here again.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This home is absolutely beautiful. From the Mediterranean architecture, tile work, art and decor, it is all stunning and simply fun to admire.
I took my bridal portraits here and it was the perfect back drop for so many amazing and different pictures.
Very clean!
This venue/home could be used for so many different events, experiences, or memories.
Such a cool new and unique spot for OKC!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful, beautiful home. Five star amenities throughout the property. We entertained our entire family the week of Christmas including Christmas Eve and Christmas Day dinner, all accomplished with ease with what was included with the home. The space is secluded, but within just a few minutes drive of restaurants and shopping. To best illustrate our positive experience our three teenagers had smiles on their faces the entire week, a true sign of a great space!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay while renting here. Beautifully furnished and comfortable. Location is great as well whether you visit downtown or drive elsewhere in/around OKC. There‚Äôs a small diner and restaurant right across the way we walked to. The parking garage added a level of security/safety, but it takes a little practice pulling into the designated spot since it‚Äôs immediately against the wall when you drive into the garage. Check-in and checkout were very easy. We arrived late at night and had no issues getting in. Checkout was very quick and smooth. We‚Äôll definitely consider renting here again with our next visit to OKC."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was wonderful, and Colton was very responsive and gave some great suggestions on things to do"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at this location! We would stay again! Very clean. Very safe. Great communication. Convenient location! Wonderful security measures. Our only negatives would be that the shower though very nice is not very practical with the open glass shower. Water would get on the floor and we were not able to enjoy the rain shower. And the bed frame needs improvement as it is not attached to the headboard and would slide and require constant adjustments. Besides that we enjoyed our stay!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved this place! It was a very relaxing stay. I really wish we had booked an extra day or two.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of my top places to stay in OKC. Very responsive and comfortable suite. Having the garage makes it a plus.

2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed Colton‚Äôs place and found him to be very responsive when we ran into a problem.
2023-06-01,4,Stayed over a week,"This studio is compact and efficient with some stylish features in the interior. Bed is fine, but my spouse thought it higher at the foot than the head. The kitchen is compact but reasonably stocked and offers a few more spices or other condiments than normal. We had trouble with the AC and a confusing thermostat and wifi but eventually were accommodated in an adjacent unit. Colton was generous in that regard.
While the interiors are nice, the exterior of the complex feels quite dingey and run down, dirty and uninviting. That made coming back after a day out a bit of a dread. The neighborhood is in transition and the nearby streets are a mix of old and new, run down and reinvented."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Overall great.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great deal on place and value. Colton was a great host who was helpful and clear with our stay.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Honestly this place is cheap for what you get. Modern place with decorative interiors. Couldn‚Äôt think of a better place to be with better places to eat and enjoy. Thank you Colton. Also, very nice and communicative host."

We‚Äôll be back :)"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was absolutely a fantastic stay! I will first say that I've stayed in a lot of Airbnb's and while the accommodations were excellent here, what truly stood out to me was Colton's customer service. Proactive messages to see that you were OK or if you needed anything... courteous, responsible, and flexible.
The space was beautiful - from the decorations, to the comfortable bed, to the lighting, to the cute outdoor area... the space felt cozy and homey. There was plenty of everything, getting in/ parking was easy, it's located convenient to the stairs, his rules are straight forward, there are restaurants within walking distance, easy access throughout the city, and the condo was in a great area.
I would definitely suggest this Airbnb!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Colton, has a great location close to bars and restaurants it was perfect for my weekend trip. It was clean and exactly how he described it. Colton was also very responsive. There was an issue with the garage clicker and he responded to my message with minutes and had new one put in the lock box within 30 minutes. It was very much appreciated and I‚Äôd recommend staying here."

Definitely on the top of my list next time I come to OKC."

The bathroom was so nice! It had shampoo and conditioner incase you forgot yours and as well at q tips, cotton balls, mouth wash etc. we didn‚Äôt use the towels because we always bring our own but there were plenty towels to use.
