2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very cute tiny home!! so fun and peaceful. Host has a great manual to make your stay as easy as possible.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cute little cabin stay. Little quaint and we saw some deers around, overall beautiful. Small but great for people that don’t mind smaller spaces and like a good adventure."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The location was quaint, isolated, quiet, and incredibly peaceful! We weren't at Little Blue very long due to our packed schedule but it was perfect and exactly what we needed. If we pass through the area again this would be a great spot to stay!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved my stay at TinyBlue. Cute tranquil area perfect for escaping the city. Brett was a great host and very helpful during the stay!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great Place! The communication was fantastic! We will absolutely be back. Very nice place.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful cabin near everything. Would stay again
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely loved, always wonder what it felt like to be in a tiny home."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was amazing for a night away! We loved how there were outdoor games and a hammock for the summer day our booking fell upon. Everything was perfect and check in went smoothly. We will most likely be staying again!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was my first time experiencing North Carolina, and a tiny home, and I was so pleasantly surprised how much I loved both! This tiny gem in the middle of gorgeous woods was just the peaceful respite we required. My three-year-old loved the deck, the loft bedroom, and had an absolute blast. The shower was so nice after a long day of travel, and I loved sharing close space with my family without feeling cramped.
Hosts were very kind and thoughtful and made sure we had everything we required. Wish we had more time to experience it!
Would highly recommend and would book again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"this was a good experience very clean & comfortable, the host was very nice a quick to address my questions and provide help would definitely book again
Thank you!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place and perfect for our 1 night stay in Locust. A bit hidden but not difficult to find. Host was friendly and had lots of local recommendations.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved the peaceful atmosphere! Very close to shopping and great restaurants! It was just enough space for myself and my husband to have a short stay. We really enjoyed it and sadly we didn’t have enough time to go see the other tiny homes that Brett was working on. Great experience in our first tiny home! Our family already wants to book their own trip to visit! 🩷
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super clean. Very responsive host. This our 2nd stay and we would stay again
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed here before and will stay again. The house is perfect and the location and surrounding are even better. It’s minutes to town and food but so private. 10 out of 10.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay. It was a great location out in the country, no traffic but modern conveniences just up the road. It was just as described. The bed was very comfortable and slept cool. The upper windows and ceiling fan created a nice cross breeze. It was also a nice view of the sky in the morning. Easy check in and Brett messaged me upon my arrival to ensure everything went smoothly. Just as described you can hear the paintball next door on the weekend but by the time they got started I was off to my events for the day and they did not play once it got dark so it wasn’t an issue. I would definitely stay again. Thanks so much Brett"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,wonderful experience. simple and easy. highly suggest
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Tiny Blue was fun, efficiently laid-out and furnished, and affordable. The surrounding area is pretty as well. We enjoyed our stay so much, and Brett was very easy to communicate with, as well as accommodating. We live right near by and will definitely want to come back!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our short stay. Tiny blue is a beautiful place & very peaceful at night. We hope to come back & stay longer!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stat very peaceful a little tricky to find
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tiny Blue was perfect for our quick anniversary get away! It was so peaceful and tucked away which was exactly what we were looking for. Brett cautioned that we may hear noises from the paintball field not too far away but we never heard a thing even though it was packed both days! We cooked and ate out by the fire pit one night and while we were eating Brett messaged to let us know there were deer all in the yard behind Tiny Blue! It was so magical to be eating dinner while the deer grazed and ate as well right by us!!! It was a great trip!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The stay at Tiny Blue was amazing! Brett was very helpful and friendly! The house was very clean and had everything we needed for a weekend stay! The firepit was great and feeding the chickens was an added plus! If you are looking for a small space to stay with plenty of things to do, you should stay here! Many local restaurants, distilleries, wineries, and hiking locations available within a 20 minute drive. Did I mention there are chickens!!! 😀"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a beautiful stay , super
Cozy and relaxing for contemplating the tiny home life. Brett was an excellent communicator throughout the process. Would love to return!!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Small but perfect to relax ❤️
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great home really comfortable
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was an extraordinary bucket list stay that will not be our last in this cozy, fully stocked, comfy, and peaceful, tiny home. What an amazing experience for my hubby and I, along with our son who recently turned 18, and his pal. The four of us had an absolute blast! We spent the evening at a Charlotte Hornets basketball game and settled into our tiny home nooks after we returned. We opened the windows to fall asleep to the soothing sounds of nature. At sunrise, the light danced across our tiny home space creating an unbelievably spacious feel. The owners were so kind and we enjoyed sharing a little bit about each other and our passion for tiny homes. Do yourself a favor and enjoy a stay in this tiny home. There are multiple venues for breakfast, lunch, and dinner within minutes but this tiny home location is peaceful and off the beaten path if calm and mindfulness is a must."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I love the place nice and cute tinny house
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Brett was a great host, very communicative and helpful. Tiny Blue was a great place with everything you need for a getaway. My best friend and I stayed for a girl’s weekend and felt so relaxed and right at home. We can’t wait to stay again."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Another great stay at the tiny house. It’s a beautiful quiet location , it’s a little out of the way which makes it even better. Any thing you need is a mile and a half out on the main road. Plenty of hot water and nice and warm even at 18 degrees
Will stay again"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect house and location! I have friends local and there are no hotels anywhere close. Brett’s house was perfect! Will definitely stay again and have already recommended to some friends who travel to this area.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a dream stay for anyone.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I always wanted to stay in a trailer, so it was worth the stay. It was actually very nice and cozy and we had fun. All the amenities were functional and useful aswell"
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I enjoyed our stay while we visited family in the area. It was the perfect location for us.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome unique place that I will recommend to everyone!!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Brett was such a fantastic host. Kept us up-to-date with everything and was there when we really needed him for things. We had a minor issue but Brett really went the extra mile to make things right for us and we really appreciate that. This is my wife and I's first time staying at a tiny home, but will definitely not be the last. We will absolutely be staying with them in the future. Brett is Definitely an asset to Airbnb. Wishing you many more years in the future with hosting. I've stayed in a lot of places before, but this is by far been my best experience. Thanks for a memorable and amazing trip."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was lovely! It was a great location and I was in awe with the surroundings and the Christmas lights on the tiny blue! It smelled super festive once I walked in. There were a couple of lady bugs in the home and it was no bother at all. We also woke up to chickens! Lol! I definitely will be booking again!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a location that I travel to with work. I will check here first to check availability and would even change my travel times to get back in here. I will definitely be back.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Tiny Blue was so cute and welcoming. It’s even decorated for Christmas which is such a nice and sweet touch. Loved our stay and will definitely book it again!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I had a wonderful time staying in Brett and Heather's tiny home! It was easy to find, located on a beautiful property, and the home itself was very charming and comfortable. I also loved how they had it decorated for the holidays-that was a nice touch! The weather wasn't the best or I would have spent more time relaxing on the front porch or exploring the property but all around I would highly recommend staying here and would love to come back sometime! Thank you! :)"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"we loved our stay very much, the house was beautiful and so was the land!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Tiny Blue is adorable and comfortable! We arrived the evening after Thanksgiving and the interior was tastefully decorated for the holidays. My two young daughters were tickled to explore the living room, lofts and board games left in the cabinet. Our 1 day stay was made extra special when we woke to deer in the front yard. I’ve been interested in a tiny home experience for several years now, and Tiny Blue didn’t disappoint!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Brett was a great host. Very friendly and helpful.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Tiny Blue was great! Very private and cozy. We had everything we needed. Perfect for our night away!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great little spot! Right outside of town and very comfortable. It is a very cool tiny home. Though if you happen to be a bigger person, be warned that the bathroom is very very tight, so it can be hard to maneuver! But, I had zero complaints, it was a great trip and everything was as it should be!"
2023-11-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"I’ve been wanting to stay in a tiny house for some time now. Brett’s place was indeed tiny but super cute. Upon arrival we had an unexpected welcome party of about 15-20 ladybugs inside, no fault of Brett. He offered to come right over & take care of them but we were able to use the vacuum provided to do a catch & release ourselves! We were not quite prepared for the paintball complex at the end of the gravel path near the home. So there was some noise from that & quite a bit of dust kicked up from the cars. But after closing time all was quiet. The shower was very small (think tiny house!) & the water pressure was really low. There was only one bath towel provided but we did have two wash cloths & a hand towel. There was coffee & essentials provided plus bottled water & some apples in the fridge. I can’t say a whole lot about the bed, just a mattress on the floor of the loft. Overall it was a neat overnight experience."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first time staying in a tiny home & Tiny Blue did not disappoint!! The property is absolutely beautiful & Tiny Blue is a true tiny home. The owners Brett & Heather were quick to respond when we had a slight issue upon check in. I do recommend following their directions with the hot water while showering. Our entire stay was wonderful & if we are ever back in NC, we will without a doubt book Tiny Blue again!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Tiny blue was adorable and exactly what we were looking for! Close to the Main Street and breweries in Locust, as we were there supporting a friends establishment."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place inspired me to decide to buy a tiny house. I’ll stay here every time I pass through from New York to Florida. It was perfect! An aside, I texted about coffee and instantly there was fresh ground coffee on the porch! This is fantastic hosting!"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great secluded place to enjoy some peace and quiet. Still, close to anything you might ever need. An excellent place to getaway without having to sacrifice the comforts of modern life."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable stay for us, close to family, shopping and restaurants. We took a really nice drive up to High Rock dam and stopped and fished along the way. (No keepers, thankfully🤭) We hope to stay here again for the next family gatherings."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Brett’s place was one my favorite Airbnbs I’ve stayed at. I wish I would’ve stayed for an extra day to check out the rest of the property!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A fun adventure.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,our second stay here & just as pleased as the first time

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tiny Blue was the perfect place to stay! We loved it and can’t wait to stay again!!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My first stay in a Tiny House was fun! I had everything I needed and Brett was easy to communicate with. Thanks!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We have never stayed in a ""tiny house"" and thought we would give it a try. We loved that everything we needed was right there, in one small space. The setting is quiet and peaceful and we felt very much at home in our little space."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful surrounding and great hosts!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Needed to get away from the wilderness (society, noise and drama). This tiny home was the perfect get away. In the mornings I sipped tea and chilled on the porch and late at night worked on some personal projects. I’ve always been interested in a tiny home and plan on getting one. Perfect layout and settings. Will most likely book again end of the year to rejuvenate."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Just as listed!
Perfect!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,I’m always impressed by tiny home builds and Brett’s place is great. Greeted by deer each evening the space is quiet and a nice change from city life. Would recommend if you’re interested in the tiny house vibe
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a wonderful stay! Great for our one night get away!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute little space!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The tiny home was a fun place to stay! It was in a quiet location with cool amenities (hammock, tv streaming services, etc.). I would recommend to others who want unique accommodations for a weekend getaway."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was really very nice. We saw some deer and lots of fireflies. The house is cute and spacious despite the size. Four is completely sufficient for one or two nights.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What can I say more then it was beyond me and my boyfriends expectations! It not only was beautiful and peaceful but it was super clean and overall so much fun! Be careful if you’re tall like us with sitting up in bed but besides from that overall fantastic definitely would recommend 10000/10!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome tiny house! In a peaceful setting. Even had several head of deer around the place. Clean and cool (ac worked great during these hot summer days!).
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Brett was a great host. Place was exactly as described. If you like to see deer, you will see a lot. He responds quickly and gave us dry firewood for the pit."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fun getaway with a country feel, good size for the 2 of us. He had board games which was a nice surprise. Backyard was very private with fire pit. We checked out Rocky River Vineyard and loved it! Super nice staff with delicious wine."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’m obsessed!!!
Seriously this is my favorite Airbnb ever. It’s so well done and the location is so peaceful.
Don’t hesitate - book it!!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was awesome! I stayed here to see a concert in Charlotte, which was a 40ish minute drive away but it was worth it. This little place is amazing and was absolutely perfect for 2 people."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,very comfortable spot for a getaway
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I had a great stay here for my birthday! The place was very clean, had clear instructions, hosts were very pleasant and responsive. The Badin Drive-in movie theater and the Mac Tabby cat cafe (concord) are two fun and different places to check out! I highly recommend staying at Tiny Blue! 😄"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cute place, first time in a tiny home. My daughter and I loved it!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved Tiny Blue - very charming and comfortable place to relax. Brett was responsive and easy to reach. We especially loved meeting some chickens!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Tiny Blue was perfect for what we needed. It’s also very close to a commercial area, which made finding food & amenities super easy. This was our first time in a tiny home & I was impressed at how well it is designed & laid out. We enjoyed the novelty & beautiful space. Also, we left something behind & Brett quickly contacted us to return it. Thanks!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing place! Friendly hosts! My family had a great time. Kids always love to stay here! A great get-a-way! Will do this again!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great, great, the weather and the forest plus the fire pit 🔥"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If if I could give 10 stars and 2 thumbs up, I would!
We had the absolute BEST time! Off the beaten path feel, with the convenience of being real close to town.
We always try to get out and explore while we stay away from home, and this was a great location for that! We are nature lovers, and boy did we get our fill! Deer, lizards, turtles, toads, frogs, a vast variety of birds, and the friendliest host chickens!!
If nature isn’t for you, I’d still highly recommend! Inside Tiny Blue is comfy and cute! Hop in your car and you’re 3 minutes from a gas station and 5 minutes from the bigger stores and restaurants.
We got the pleasure of touring the Tiny Homes that Brett is currently building, as well as the neighboring paint ball field (of which we never heard a noise from, which wouldn’t have bothered us a bit, but was still very nice!)
I could go on and on about the absolute pleasure we had staying here, and will definitely be back to stay again! Brett and Heather, thank you so much!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Tiny Blue, and it’s owners, were a dream come true! This will become a regular getaway for our family. The beauty of their property seems to be the perfect setting for the perfect tiny home. Our family was very comfortable for the night and grilled out. Heather has a beautiful garden next to the porch. For breakfast, Brett invited us up to gather some fresh eggs. Talk about amazing! And for those that really love tiny homes, Brett is a designer and builder. If you are lucky, he may give you a tour."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tiny Blue was perfect for my son and I for a last minute stay! It had everything we needed and more! Comfy beds, extra stuff if we needed it, and even deer that visited each night. It was so peaceful and relaxing."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. Plenty of room for myself and exactly what I needed for my business trip. Off the beaten path yet easy to get to and quiet. First experience in a true tiny house. Did experience the shower water temp fluctuation but then followed the tip in the guest book and all good.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Brett was so responsive, friendly, and accommodating!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute place!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My husband, our two boys (ages 9,10) stayed and had an amazing experience. There was plenty of space although it is a tiny house, it was perfect. Room for board games, family TV and lounging, outdoor adventures. My sons were able to feed and pet chickens and told me they were living their best lives. It had a quiet, country feel outdoors but fully modern interior. Two lofts provided the perfect bedding set up. The mini toiletries were adorable! There is even a guide to local restaurants and more on tiny home living. Well-laid out design, comfortable, and we definitely hope to be able to return soon! A 5 out 5 stay, incredible! Exactly what we were looking for! Thank you!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tiny Blue was an incredible place to stay. Very private but lots of stores and restaurants within a short drive. Though a tiny home, the layout made it feel larger. The front deck is an awesome place to relax after a long day. Especially when the chickens come around! They all hung out with us for a while and Brett provided food to give them and they were very friendly. I absolutely loved this place and can’t wait to stay again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very responsive
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was great!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Tiny Blue home was a perfect stay for my visit to the area. It was very comfortable and had everything I needed. I highly recommend it!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Upon our second visit everything was just as we remembered!! Space is great for us, totally peaceful woodsy environment in the country. We only wish they had another Tiny on the property due to the limited availability from always being rented. The family are Amazing hosts!! You won't find more hospitable, down to earth folks and smiling faces. Love seeing the chickens, all the deer, the forest, the little garden, awesome fire pit and total Zen atmosphere."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had an absolute amazing time! So cute and peaceful. Definitely plan to come again!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying at Tiny Blue. It is tucked back off the road and very private, which we really enjoyed. And the kids loved feeding the chickens!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Brett offered an amazing place to stay around Concord and Charlotte! Tiny Blue was the perfect little spot for my friends and I
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place and great host!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Bretts place was exactly what we needed for a local BJJ tournament that was close.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Awesome tiny house! It had everything we needed for a short stay. The property is back behind trees and is mostly private, you can just barely see the host's home between trees in the back. On the weekends it is noisy and some traffic since there is a paintball field/center across the way, but it did not disrupt us. We enjoyed the fire pit, feeding the chickens (made me feel right at home), a walk in the woods, and exploring old sheds from the original land owners was cool. It was 4 min from Walmart and many other local stores and amenities yet feels like you are in a remote property once back at the house! First time in a tiny house :)"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,really cute tiny house! exactly as pictured and described
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, beautiful little house with quiet woods all around, still close to the city. Cleaning service they used didn’t show before we checked in but the host personally got us clean linens. Lofts are nice but not for the shaky legged, overall nice place with everything you need."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a cute and lovely placd. Everything was well taken care of and thoughtfully prepared. The host even placed chicken foods in case you want to feed them. My kids loved it really.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,fantastic
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A very cool place to stay and perfect for our weekend trip to the area. We enjoyed the unique experience of living in a “tiny home”!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great people, great place!"
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Great stay.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Tiny Blue was a wonderful stay! My boyfriend and I only stayed for one night after a wedding but it was an adorable place and just like the pictures. They had board games and a binder filled with rules for games present in the yard as well as food suggestions. It was quite cold when we stayed in there but it was also 22 degrees fahrenheit the night we stayed! I would definitely recommend being comfortable with the people you stay with here as it would be difficult to change/get ready in the rest room but I would expect that with any tiny house. Overall, I really enjoyed the stay, the place was beautiful and wonderfully prepared for activities. It would be quite fun in the summer."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Fantastic stay! This place was awesome for the 3 of us to getaway.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is comfortable and unique! We enjoyed our stay. We loved the location (you can see so many stars!!!) and the space had everything we need we needed. Our host was responsive and we couldn’t ask for anything better.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing stay! Such a cute space and so peaceful. 10/10 recommend
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Tiny Blue is truly a gem! The tiny home was much more spacious than it may look in the pictures. This was our 2nd stay in a tiny home and Tiny Blue was much more comfortable than our previous stay. We enjoyed grilling outside and looking at the stars at night over the fire pit. The home was well stocked with everything you need and was very tastefully decorated. We'd highly recommend staying here when in the area!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Thanks again, we enjoyed our stay!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We will likely use this as a travel checkpoint again as we did on this trip. We saw deer, we fed chickens and enjoyed the local eateries."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great stay!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Tiny Blue is a perfect space, and Brett is the greatest host. Looking forward to staying again soon!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"First time in a Tiny home! Was definitely worth it. I can’t wait to stay again! Feeding the chickens was definitely my highlight. It was nice that Brett & Heather had chicken food to feed them also. The place was exactly what was pictured. Tiny home felt very cozy, clean and felt like home."

Cute, clean and comfortable"
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Nice spot for an relaxing little getaway.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We live local and stayed at Brett’s tiny house while having some construction done on our home. It worked well for us so we extended our stay the duration of our construction.
The location is very peaceful and quiet. Several deer came to visit at night.
Brett was super accommodating with anything we needed or asked for ….He did a great job packing a lot of usable essentials into a small space. Even a small washer/dryer! If you haven’t tried tiny living and wonder what it’s like come for a stay…..we highly recommend"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cute place and very close to everything! My girlfriend and I really enjoyed our stay at Tiny Blue!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Place was very clean and as the website shows. Brett was very quick to respond and we booked last minute so we were very pleased. Because I’m older and have a little trouble with my knees on stairs the beds being in the loft wasn’t ideal for me but it was a very comfortable bed. We highly recommend for kids and youth. Especially, if they like to play paintball. The fire pit in the back and horseshoes on the side was a nice touch."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We decided to visit Tiny Blue, and boy are we glad we did! The house looked just like the pictures - neat, comfy, and cozy! We couldn’t have asked for anything more for our first tiny house adventure! #TinyHouseNation🏠"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a fantastic tiny home! Definitely would visit again!
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful property, definitely more suitable for older kids due to loft and sleeping arrangements.. My 9 year old loved it as we had a quick trip for an out of state cheer competition. We didn’t get to enjoy as much as we would have liked due to time restrictions but was definitely a pleasant trip. No complaints at all other than my daughter being disappointed she didn’t see any of the chickens and had a lady bug in her bed 😂"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome place
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful space! It was perfect for a night while we were visiting family. Literally the only thing that I would’ve wanted is some nicer pillows, but I’m just picky!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely space. Very homey feel, clean and comfortable. It is private and the area felt very safe. The instructions for check-in and amenities are clear and concise. We have family in the area and will definitely stay here again. Highly recommend."

2022-11-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Charming little spot, but be prepared for limited hot water."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"At tiny blue, every morning I woke up, sipped my coffee and sat in the loft to watch the deer graze and play in the yard. My boyfriend and I were visiting family in Charlotte for thanksgiving. So we needed a place that was practical to fully live out of while feeling like we were on vacation. With the full kitchen, laundry unit, and wifi, Tiny blue had it all! The hosts were very accommodating at all costs. Loved having a small fire in the fire pit and putting Netflix on inside to decompress from long days with family."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tiny Blue is such a sweet place to stay! My husband and I have loved it both times we’ve been. It’s such a cozy spot with great amenities and far enough out of the city to be quiet but close enough to not be inconvenient to get into Charlotte!

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great time in Tiny Blue!!!! and loved seeing all the deer in the evening. The attached deck was a great addition and its absolutely amazing to see all that you can fit into such a small space.

We are definitely considerng buying a tiny home in the near future."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Tiny Blue exceeded all of our expectations.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a great space out in the country! Tiny blue was just as described and the outdoor space was peaceful and tranquil.

I will definitely stay again if I am ever in the area.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super cute/ Creative/ Clean/ Great Layout/ Adventurous…. Great for an out of the norm experience.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I went to Little blue for my birthday weekend and had an amazing time. It was extremely relaxing and fun. My friend and I ventured out to concord and went to the sweet life bakery which had plenty of gluten free options, eat well (great healthy grocery store) and table eleven (amazing food). The following day we went for a hike at Buffalo creek preserve and it was beautiful. The tiny house was amazing, just be prepared for less storage! It was so cozy and felt like home, I can’t wait to return!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super quite area. The tiny house is very charming. Love how the owner has activities available outside, including horseshoes and a fire pit. We will most likely visit again."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Tiny Blue was just wonderful! Our stay was brief, but everything was perfect! The house is so cute & more spacious than we expected. Everything was clean, check in was a breeze, and the area was very private and relaxing! 100/10 will stay here again the next time I’m in the area."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little place to stay. My boyfriends daughter loved the chicken feed that was left to feed the chickens!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Tiny Blue was just as described! The tiny house experience was fun for our family of 3. My 14 year old son loved having his own loft and ladder. Tiny living is surprisingly very functional and we enjoyed all the little nooks and crannies and storage. The front porch is wonderful and my son enjoyed sitting outside playing his guitar and singing. We were out and about most of our stay but Tiny Blue is conveniently located near Locust and the wedding venue we were at for our friends. We wish we would have had more down time to enjoy the hammock and other games in the deck box (definitely check those out). My son and fiancé did get to play horseshoes and feed the chickens which was great! Just some notes and not at all a negative reflection on this place because we would absolutely stay here again. There is a paintball place past Tiny Blue and traffic can get heavy at times early on Friday morning (my early is 9am) but there is no sound from the paintball place from inside the house. Be prepared to climb stairs and hunch over to get in the bigger loft area. This was not a problem for us as we are 5’3 and 5’6 but taller people should take note. If you sit up in the middle of the night you might hit your head on the ceiling. The only other thing is if you want to sleep late be aware the sun comes through the windows and there is really no way to block this out. For us, we had to be up early anyway. Brett was very kind and very quick to offer his assistance with anything we needed. He was very friendly during our communication and I wish we could have met in person! We will definitely be staying again when we come to visit our friends!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our favorite tiny home to date! Incredible layout and such a modern and updated space. The chickens on the property were such a bonus for me!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a great space - with so much more room than I was expecting. It was also very clean and the check-in was quick and easy. Would absolutely stay again!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful little paradise in the countryside with everything you need to have a peaceful stay!! Wildlife abundant with a bird feeder, roaming friendly chickens, a garden, lovely deck and hammock as well. Perfect place to unwind and reset from the chaos of a 9-5 and life in general. Definitely recommend for couples to enjoy this amazing little Tiny home and take the tour. Brett is incredibly talented and it shows in the craftsmanship of his homes built in the property. Fantastic price for the space and will be consulting for our Tiny build when we buy land!!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful well thought out tiny home! We enjoyed a very peaceful stay at little blue.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Spotlessly clean and comfortable tiny house. It was perfect for my needs. There was a glitch with the hot water and Brett attended to the matter and got it resolved. I would stay here again.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Best Airbnb experience I've had thus far!! I stayed here with 3 friends for a weekend and we were all so surprised at how roomy the tiny house felt with 4 people living in it. The most surprising things were the full-sized fridge and shower. The host went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed during our stay and even gave us farm fresh eggs for the weekend! The tiny house is tucked away, so it's quiet with the only sound being the occasional car heading to the adjacent paintball field. I needed assistance getting the oven going, and Brett came over right away to replace the propane tank. We will definitely be staying here again!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Tiny blue is amazing!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Exactly as described and more. The house was absolutely adorable and I would definitely stay again. The chickens came when we called and ate out of my hands! This is a nice welcoming tiny home that was very nicely built with high-end finishes. Truly a treat. Best Value ever!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Tiny Blue has all the necessities. So much room in so little space. Nice quiet environment and Brett was very friendly!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Property was gorgeous and scenic, tiny house was clean, great use of space and the best farm fresh eggs! Truly enjoyed our stay!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful first tiny home experience with our own personal chicken escort to send us off in the morning. Communication was great and the place was spotless. Will definitely be coming back when I have more time to explore the area

It may be a “tiny house”, but don’t be fooled, it’s very spacious and has everything you need.
Brett is a wonderful host and gave us great recommendations for near by activities and restaurants.
Super clean, comfy, and peaceful place to stay. I hope my fiancé and I can visit again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Marc’s stay was in a prime location close to some of our favorite restaurants in Charlotte. It was awesome to be able to wake up and grab donuts across the street. Very clear instructions on how to get in with photos to help. Clean and cool apartment. Overall great stay!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was everything! Looks just like the pics honestly better. Very clean and loved the decor. A lot of bars within walking distance. The music from the bar didn’t bother us at all. We were so comfortable and felt so at home. I definitely will be booking to stay here every-time i visit!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Right in Noda. Needed to get a last minute place and Marc was super responsive and accommodating. Thanks.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect place to stay. This was a one night getaway for us and I’m so happy we picked this place. It was walking distance to everything. Will definitely come back to this loft. The host were great. Getting in was a breeze. The information and details were very clear which made for an easy entrance and exit. Highly recommend.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thanks for a great stay! This was the perfect spot to meet up with and spend an evening with friends in NoDa. Loved the space!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location and perfect for a quick weekend trip in Charlotte.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had an amazing time staying at Marc’s loft! Instructions were super clear and everything was exactly like the photos. If you are staying on the weekend, some of the restaurants nearby play live music. Would definitely recommend staying here if visiting Charlotte again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place and location. Close to everything NoDa has to offer. Very clear and simple check in/out instructions which is always appreciated these days with air bnb's. Only wish I could have stayed longer. Can't wait to make it back.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a great find! The location and space were perfect. We will be back!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed staying at this location. It was close to where we needed to go and had the amenities that we were looking for. Thanks!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, lots of room, feels private. Perfect for a couple. You are right in the mix of the NoDa. You can walk to the train in 5 minutes, you can drive downtown in 5 minutes. Friday night things started to ramp up party wise with music and people all around and we were not affected by the noise.
The loft stayed quiet enough for us to sleep. Nice place, thanks."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed ourselves!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place, as long as you understand that it's in the heart of a very lively neighborhood!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place if your in town for fun things to do
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Me and my boyfriend loved our stay here so much we booked another night after our first night there! This place is in the perfect location right in the middle of Noda which gave great access to near by restaurants and bars. Our host was super responsive and understanding with our quick change of plans. Definitely great for a solo trip or date night with your partner! Celebrated my birthday here and will definitely be back to explore the area more.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay! The host clearly spelled out what to expect abd went above and beyond to ensure we had everything we needed. The location and space were great. Would definitely book again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fantastic experience - seamless check-in, great location, the place was in pristine condition. Highly recommend!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really cool loft in an amazing location.
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you read one review, read this one. The host isn't going to like this review I'm sure, but I would not stay here again. Yes, the host describes the A/C unit noise and does provide earplugs, but I went 2 nights with very little sleep due to the loud slamming bang of the AC unit (when it kicks on) and noise of it running that follows. It's unlike anything I have ever experienced at a rental before.
The space was clean and had super quirky décor. The bed was massive and the mattress was comfortable.
I think the host is in between a rock and hard place. The AC unit is for the whole building (multiple restaurants and flats) and it just happens to be directly above the bedroom in this unit.
Overall it's not the hosts fault, but potential renters should be aware of the issue at hand."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean and great location!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing location and great place! 10/10 would recommend.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"great location, super niche on the inside. definitely matched the vibe of the trip!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stay was great! Fantastic location with quick access to some of Charlotte’s best.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great stay at a wonderful place in a fun location. Highly recommended. Would do again.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was the perfect place to stay to go see a show at the Blackbox Theater!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Booked Marc’s place last minute and holy crap not only did the property exceed expectations but the neighborhood is an absolute goldmine of great local businesses!
Book your stay and then check out Smelly Cat Coffee for incredible coffee and breakfast sandwiches , Salud Cerverceria for top tier pizza and amazing beer selection, Jack Beagle’s for incredible wings and gourmet Mac & cheese, all within walking distance.
The only recommendation I’d make is to bring ear plugs. At night there’s an extremely loud rooftop unit that might wake up light sleepers. The onsite documentation made mention of there being earplugs supplied in the complimentary welcome bag but mine did not include any.
Long story short: will absolutely stay here again next time I’m in Charlotte!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great time! Great location. We’ll be back.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It's worth it
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I’ve stayed here multiple times and it never disappoints. Great location, great communication and check in process, and a super cool loft space. Look forward to my next stay!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Again - don’t hesitate to book this rental. PERFECT location, private parking and the host is great! We stayed here twice in a week span. Will be back!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Don’t even hesitate booking this place, just like everyone else said. And the bed is SO COMFY!!!!!! We will absolutely be back."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This unit has a fantastic location for those that want to do things while in Charlotte. Located near the light rail for access to Uptown and the South End and the NoDa neighborhood itself is lively and has tons of restaurants and pubs to enjoy. Felt safe the entire time and we walked around from 9AM until after midnight. The unit is well appointed and the bed and furnishings were comfortable. The unit was exactly as described. We enjoyed our stay here and would gladly rent from Marc again.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I really enjoyed the energy of this neighborhood. Loved being able to walk to neat stores and restaurants. As the description says this is not the “burbs” there is an energy and aliveness on the weekends. We will return.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome!!!!!! Perfect place to stay in the heart of Charlotte/NODA area! We had a blast!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Exactly as pictured and described in the listing. Located in the heart of the NoDa neighborhood with plenty of options to walk short distance to. Would stay again if in the area!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was super cute and clean! The bar next door and the air conditioning are definitely loud. This wasn’t an issue for me cause I can sleep thru anything but definitely something to keep in mind. The parking lot is a bit hidden but the pictures provided in the instructions were very helpful. Overall I thought it was a very cute and nice spot!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is easily Top 3 places I’ve stayed. The loft was amazing and the location ideal. I will say, if you plan to stay on a weekend, there is a live music venue right next to you. We thought it was awesome bc we got to listen to some good music for free! We also weren’t planning on going to bed by 10pm either. The price per night was more than reasonable for the space and location."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,my stay at the loft was phenomenal not was the location amazing but the photos don’t do it justice I would 10 out of 10 rent from Marc again I felt very at home and the energy of the building was amazing!!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I love Marc’s place. This was our second time staying and it has cemented itself as our go-to Airbnb when we are visiting Charlotte. The building shares lofts above several local bars and restaurants in NoDa, so if you’re looking for a fun place to spend a long weekend in the city, this is it. The night life is front and center so you’ll have plenty of things to do while you’re here!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place pics don’t do justice, only thing I didn’t like was the parking situation. I has just parked and went through the process of getting the parking pass & conveniently someone was puttin a boot on my car as I was comin down with the pass. I would recommend doing something to where the pass can be accessed before going inside the building. 200 dollars could have been avoided that way"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Would totally stay here again!!! So many bars and restaurants within walking distance, as well as the neighborhood theater and the light rail station.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay! Perfect location for exploring NoDa. If you are a live music lover, this is the place for you! You can walk out of the front of the building, and immediately enter any of the neighborhood’s wonderful eats or listens. The unit was secure and clean. Check in instructions were super easy with step-by-step instructions complete with pictures. The bed was squishy (my fave!) and the pillows were incredible. Lots of sweet touches such as laundry soap, toiletry bags and dish soap. Highly recommended!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in NODA. Very convenient.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thanks!
2023-12-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"I will say that the place was clean, bed and pillows were comfortable and it was right on the main drag. The issue we had was the noise level was HEAVILY downplayed. We stay in cities a lot and understand there’s bar patron noise and sirens/horns, etc but the listing failed to mention that there is a live music venue literally sharing the parking lot outside the apartment. It was as if we were at the bar and it played both Friday and Saturday nights until after midnight. There’s no tv or sleeping with this level of noise, even with the provided earplugs and a white noise machine that we brought. Additionally, the noise from the AC unit was also downplayed. It is directly above the bathroom connected to the bedroom and kicks on about every 20 minutes with a startling loud bang and sounds like there’s an electric sander grinding on top of you. We were thankful Sunday night when there was no band, but we still needed the earplugs for the loud AC unit, and we are not “light sleepers”."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I was extremely excited to stay at Marc’s place. Unfortunately I got sick and had to cancel. Marc was still very helpful with everything and trying to find the best solution. When I’m in Charlotte I hope I actually get to enjoy this place.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Gorgeous, super clean space located in a vibrant Charlotte neighborhood.
Marc’s instructions were thorough and helpful, and he was always prompt to respond.
Couldn’t recommend more warmly!!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent and centrally located place! The loft was very comfortable. We didn’t need to leave a 2 block radius during our stay.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was great, clean, comfortable"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,First time staying in Noda and now it’s the only part of the city I want to stay in! Great location and great space! Felt at home while in the middle of the action! Loved the decor as well. Great hosts and great airbnb.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot! The loft was clean, a great size for two people, and in an awesome walkable neighborhood. NoDa was such a fun place to explore. We'll definitely stay here again if we come back this way."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"WHAT AN OCD PERSON'S DREAM!!!!
When we first arrived, I think we were too excited and we had an issues as we went to the wrong door. lol. It was completely an overlook on our part. Marc response time was very fast; he was patient helping us with checking in.
When we walked in, everything was as it looked online. Everything was in pristine condition, clean sheets, bathroom was spotless, a good number of hangers in the beautiful walk in closet, shoe hanger, and Marc even had a little care package on the bed!
I prefer places like this over a hotel ANYDAY! I made coffee the next morning and to my surprise, even the coffee pot was spotless! This spot is like a home away from home. Everything you need to get to in the NODA area for us was within walking distance as we were just getting away to take a little break.
I am super impressed with the cleanliness of this place; talk about no stones unturned.. lol.. What a beautiful place and I would most definitely book again"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay at the loft in NoDa, Charlotte, NC. The loft was not only stylish and cozy but also in a fantastic location. The host was incredibly welcoming, and the amenities provided exceeded our expectations. We enjoyed exploring the vibrant neighborhood, and the loft's proximity to great restaurants and shops made our trip even more enjoyable. We highly recommend this Airbnb for a memorable and comfortable stay!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the location! The ""hum"" of the air unit (described in other reviews) actually helped me sleep!!
A lot of things to do in the area.
Just be sure you know what phone # is actually attached to your account so you don't have to bother the host 🤦‍♀️, however, he was quick to respond!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay and especially enjoyed the location with close proximity to restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and the LYNX blue line. The loft itself was beautiful and comfortable and next time we’re in Charlotte will definitely be staying again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is such a cool space so close to the nightlife. I wish I could've stayed longer.
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location! The space had amazing decor just like the pictures! Marc was proactive in providing all information we needed. I really appreciated the ear plugs as the A/C unit and Saturday night band were both louder than I expected. I will say that this was fully disclosed in the description of the space so I wasn’t mad about it!
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Marc’s Airbnb was absolutely beautiful and in a prime location! Walking distance to everything, great food, great coffee shops and cool shops to look around. I took off a star due to the check in process. Everything went great until we had to put our code into the door - which didn’t work. It took 45 minutes to resolve and fortunately his housekeeper came over to help us! It wasn’t as noisy as I thought it would be. The bed was extremely comfortable as well. We’d stay here again in the future!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Marc’s loft was perfect for the weekend! He was very clear with check in instructions and everything was clean. NoDa was a great location to stay in, so many walkable bars and restaurants. The balcony was great for hearing the live music in the evening. We’d definitely stay here again!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Marc’s loft was perfect for our little getaway. The location in NoDa was very convenient for walking around.

We left wanting to come back another time and will definitely want to stay at Marc’s place again!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great location in NoDa area. It was a perfect weekend trip in Charlotte.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Marc’s place is very unique. We enjoyed our one night stay by eating tacos and listening to live music playing right outside our balcony (bar/venue next door). There’s plenty of restaurants, shops, bars and things to do within walking distance from the loft.
Marc’s description of the neighborhood (people and noise) is very accurate."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was really nice. The previous person took the parking pass and he offered to pay for our parking without us asking.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"wonderful place in the center of Noda. Great spot for a commute to uptown and wonderful restaurants. Unique apartment, loved the style and atmosphere of the place and neighborhood."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Marc’s place was great! We were able to walk to great bars and restaurants and the venue that we came to see a show in. It was also very close to the art museums and other stuff downtown. Everything was very comfortable and we felt right at home.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Love love love! Will definitely be coming back. Marc’s place was exactly like the photos and clean. The instructions for checking in were 10/10. Marc responded instantly for any questions. Would definitely recommend staying here if you’re visiting Noda!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The stay was awesome! Marc gave clear instructions and made the whole process a breeze.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay love the location right next to everything
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, really nice loft and cool places to walk to. It was as described and I’d recommend reading the house manual as it made the experience better! The check in was a bit involved but the clear instructions made it simple. Thanks Marc"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was great pictures don’t do it justice. I am really excited to visit again in the future
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Marc's place was a perfect ""home away from home"" for the evening. Very close to lots of great restaurants, bars, and breweries. I really appreciated the photos and the specific check-in instructions. I wasn't left with any questions. The loft was gorgeous and the twinkle lights added a special romantic effect."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Staying here was wonderful! Was perfect for a solo get away. Definitely recommend for creatives looking for a workspace or a chill space!
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Host communicated really well. Place was in immaculate condition. Perfect location. Very descriptive info on how to get in and out which was super helpful. Only drawback was there was a REALLY loud sound starting around 4am - my husband says it was the AC? It would go in cycles (LOUD, loud, off, repeated in 20 minute cycles?). Made it hard to sleep after it started."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect place to stay when visiting NoDa! Park your car easily and walk to all the best restaurants and the Neighborhood Theater.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Right in the heart of NoDa and a super cool spot to boot. Will be looking for this place on my next stay in Charlotte and hoping it’s available!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The perfect loft pad for a show weekend at the Neighborhood Theater in Noda. Next door to Protagonist brewery and only 2 blocks from the venue. The couch was awesomely comfortable and super deep for 2 to nap/chill on during the day’s heat. The bedroom was upstairs and had a very comfortable king and down pillows. What a great find and place to get away to!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great beautiful place to stay. I read reviews about it being loud we didn’t think so at all even for a Friday night. Marc was very responsive and made sure if we needed anything to let him know. He was even allowed us to check in early. I will definitely be staying there again next time I stay in Charlotte
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Marc’s place was perfect for our trip. We’ve stayed in Charlotte, but never the NoDa area. We’re sold. So many great food and drink options right out the front door. It’s a fun neighborhood to explore. The condo was clean and comfortable with everything we needed. Parking was simple with the detailed instructions we received. I recommend Marc’s place. I’d stay again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Place was exactly as described, very comfortable and walkable. One thing to be aware of…if the place next door has live music it will be very very loud and last until midnight. Unfortunately for us, it was a classic rock cover band with a very overzealous guitarist."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The loft is right above a restaurant and near the busy nightlife of NoDa, so if you are not ok with the noise, this place is not for you. It didn't bother us, and earplugs are provided. The apartment is as described, and you get very detailed instructions on how to get there, and check-in was a breeze. I will rent this place next time we are in Charlotte"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome spot. Perfect location and very comfortable place. Marc was also very responsive and helpful.
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved the location of Marc’s place in the city. Lots of walkable local restaurants and shops and easy to get around to other areas of Charlotte. It is a busy area at night. The loft space is clean and hip and comfortable.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were visiting for a show at the Neighborhood Theatre and playing disc golf. The location allowed us to be able to walk during the evening. The private parking included with Marc's place was a blessing. He kept the space very clean with easy to follow check in directions. After returning from our show, we enjoyed sitting on the balcony to watch a smaller band play at the spot next door. Overall, as we return to Charlotte for trips, I will be keeping he spot in mind to return to. 10/10. Thank you!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This trip was amazing! The loft was great! It looked exactly like the pictures. There was so much to choose from, as far as dining, and it was all right out the front door! We will definitely be back!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First of all, the pictures do this place no justice, it is much more spacious than it looks. The decor is top tier, Marc is awesome and the area is full of things to do. If you are looking for a home in the heart of it all Marc’s place is where it’s at. 5 Star place, 5 Star people!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved the place! Clean, easy to find, and awesome host. Very clear instructions and a lovely vibe. Spacious and just right for walking around NoDa. Would come again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Marc's listing was exactly as described. The interior decoration was esthetically pleasing, and the provided amenities were everything I needed for my stay.
Marc was attentive and responded very quickly to my questions. Long story short, 10/10 would stay again and definitely recommend to a friend."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Marc, was such a gracious host! The loft was exactly as described and it was in such amazing area!! Super walkable and surrounded by great restaurants. Highly recommend staying here."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I absolutely enjoyed our stay! The place is exactly the way it’s described and seen in the photos. The coolest part is the location is on the same strip as several restaurants, bars, boutiques and coffee shops. Marc was a great host! We would definitely book again in the future."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was clean and chic. Loved the exposed brick and the barn doors leading to the bathroom and closet. All the the light switches had labels on them which was super helpful and something that all hosts should consider doing. It was nice to be able to get fresh air from the balconies downstairs and upstairs. When we got hungry, we didn't have to drive anywhere. Less than 60 seconds walk to delicious food. I will definitely stay in NoDa again and if I'm lucky enough, I'll stay at Marc's place again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an excellent stay at Marc's place. Definitely pay attention to the warnings about noise -- it is a very active street (especially on the weekend), and the AC turning on and off was very loud. The place was spotless and as described and Marc was very responsive to our questions. The location could not be better if you're looking to immerse yourself in the local scene -- so many resaturants, bars, cafes, and interesting things to see right on the same block. We could not believe how much activity there was on Friday night with street vendors and live music! The train that goes to downtown and UNC is 2 blocks away. The bed was very soft -- could be a plus or a minus, depending on your preferences. If you're not sensitive to noise, this is a great place to check out!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Marc was very friendly and the detailed check in description made it a breeze to navigate first day. Absolutely amazing location near some great restaurants and easily drivable to other fun places like camp north-end, optimist hall, etc. despite being surrounded by venues with live music the sound proofing was great so noise wasn’t bad and the decor feels very homey and modern."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The location was amazing to stay the least; you’re in the heart of NODA and many places you’re able to walk to. We loved it and would highly recommend for Charlotte getaway.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place with a helpful and communicative host. Perfect location for NoDa and to access the rest of Charlotte with the light rail. We would stay again

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My fiancé & I loved staying here for a quick trip to Charlotte! Marc’s good recommendations were spot on and we will definitely come back again!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Easy booking, responsive host. Parking is a little tight. Very clear instructions on how to get inside."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This loft was great! We had never been to Charlotte before; exploring NoDa while also having an easy/cheap way of getting downtown (light rail) was perfect for us! Lots of great coffee shops, bars, and restaurants to explore down the street. We even saw a favorite artist of ours at the neighborhood theater! The loft itself was comfortable and clean. We especially liked the washer/dryer with complimentary detergent pods :). Marc was a great host!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Just the right touch of cool. Happening neighborhood vibe and low key!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,NoDa is a great place to visit. Super close to the train and really easy to visit all of Charlotte. Host was great and super responsive. we had a great time. Well worth the money...
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The loft was such a cool space! It was very clean and well decorated. NoDa was a very lively area. Personally, we enjoyed listening to the live music from the loft & seeing all of the surrounding art. Marc’s check in instructions were SUPER clear and helpful and included pictures. We really enjoyed the stay and the location! It felt like we were able to experience the heart of Charlotte! Thank you for hosting."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,If you’re looking for a place that allows you to fully experience NoDa you should not go anywhere else. You are in the thick of everything. It is also drivable to all the other fun neighborhoods in Charlotte. Marc is extremely responsive and willing to answer any questions.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Marc was very responsive and extremely kind. The photo instructions for check in made everything very clear, everyone should do that. This Airbnb is in the absolute best location in NoDa, right in the middle of all the action. We sat on the balcony and listened to love music at the bar next door, walked to restaurants and the neighborhood theater. Amazing experience. The bed is the most comfortable Airbnb bed I've ever slept in."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"clear and concise directions looks exactly the way I thought it would look. It had a little odor in the hallways and stairs, which I think was related to an animal in the building. the bed was the most comfortable we had ever slept in, even more than some hotels. Overall, I would book here again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"great place, nice & neat , cool artwork, as described, the outside noise wasn’t bad at all !"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved this space. Perfectly nestled in NoDa within walking distance of great restaurants and bars. We event ended up singing karaoke at a bar downstairs one evening! Would love to stay here again and again!
2023-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"This stay is absolutely amazing! Very clean aside and well organized. My only complaints are the ac unit and the fan. The ac unit is very very loud and rattles so trying to sleep while it runs is hard. Also, the fan in the bedroom clinks even at the lowest setting, so I don’t recommend using it. Aside from that it’s absolutely incredible and I definitely recommend (just maybe bring some ear plugs)"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a cute place! We loved the location for a wedding we went to at the Goodyear House! There were so many fun things to do in walking distance. We didn’t mind any of the outside noise, however, the air conditioning would kick on about every hour and was quite loud. We got used to it after the first few times. We would highly recommend!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great Stay! So much to do within walking distance, Will Definitely book again!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Marc has a wonderful loft in the heart of NoDa, which made it wonderfully easy to access local restaurants and stores to shop in.
Check-in instructions were easy to understand and simple to follow! Marc also had plenty of other recommendations for activities to do in the area.
The loft itself was in pristine condition and indeed chic industrial. He had laid out complimentary shampoo, conditioner, and towels as well.
We had a wonderful time and only wish we had more time to stay and explore NoDa!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Love the location! Definitely in the heart of NODA.
Let me tell you about that bed! Omg it was so comfortable, I didn’t want to get up and leave the morning of checkout.
Definitely worth staying at!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Marc was a fantastic host. He answered any questions I had and was quick to respond. The place is fantastic and very convenient if you want to explore NoDa. I would definitely stay here again.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great loft in the hustle and bustle of NoDa! Super clear instructions on how to get in and out of the loft and parking in NoDa is hard to come by so having a parking pass meant a lot. Very safe building too.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had such a great stay at Marc’s place. The interior has such a beautiful industrial feel to it. All of the decor was very complementary to the place. It’s a prime location in a Noda within walking distance of some many great places. Room N Board for the party atmosphere. Bennys for an amazing slice of pizza. We will certainly be back! 10/10 recommend.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Have always loved Noda but the Airbnb made the trip. The cutest place and quiet.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This Airbnb was excellent and we will certainly look into staying here again. The location was fun and convenient. The space itself was clean and comfortable. Overall we had a wonderful experience at Marc’s loft we really did not want to leave.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The industrial loft was a great getaway for my girlfriend and I’s 2 years anniversary. Perfect setting for listening to live music and walkable to several restaurants/bars.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a great Air Bnb. It’s right in the heart of the fun. Don’t go there hoping for quiet. It’s loud and fun. Several fun bars in walking distance. Street vendors. Cat cafe across the street. Dog friendly bar a block away. Really cool vegan spot with lots of yummy foods. Host is responsive and kind. The loft is lovely and cozy. The bathroom was clean. Washer and dryer available. Host was kind enough to leave laundry pods. Read the instructions, they answer all of your questions. I look forward to coming back someday."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay for concert at Neighborhood Theatre. Lots of great restaurants in the area. Happened onto an open mic night on Monday at The Evening Muse. Cool little area!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had to wait a few days to write this review, just to find the right words to describe how wonderful my weekend was. From the absolutely perfect decor, to everything you need being a short walk away, the live music that could be enjoyed from the balcony; I was actually sad to leave.
As noted in other reviews, this is not a place to go if you want “peace & quiet”. The nights are lively, the days are bustling. My favorite part was sitting in the yellow chair with the balcony doors open while I sipped my morning coffee from the Smelly Cat Cafe. At night there’s so much to do; and I enjoyed a show at the Evening Muse just down the street. Then I went home and listened to the cover band playing at Jack Beagles from my balcony. The music usually ended by midnight, but it’s February so…
Marc made everything so easy for check in with very detailed instructions, and check out was a breeze. The loft is very clean. And the neighborhood, as well as the building feels very safe."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, loved it so much. Awesome host! Great with directions and I felt so safe! Love the scenery and everything around the place! Will definitely be back again for another Experience!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our second stay. As great as the first! If you want peace and quiet go somewhere else. If you want a great place in the center of the bars and restaurants of NoDa this is your place.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Marc’s apartment was the perfect spot to stay in for our short trip! We came for a concert at the Evening Muse, which was practically right downstairs. Within walking distance there were several great restaurants and coffee shops (I highly recommend Oh My Soul) and we had no trouble working remotely from the apartment on the Wi-Fi. The apartment is spacious (perfect for two people), the bed is huge and soft, and the TVs are great for a late-night movie. Would gladly stay here on a return trip!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great condo in the heart of NoDa! The condo was just as described and very clean. There was a band playing outside at the bar next door until almost midnight but that’s expected for the location on a Friday night.

Check-in was a breeze with his clear instructions, and he left some great tips for places to eat. The apartment itself was super-cute and the location was perfect for music venues, breweries, restaurants, and the light rail into downtown. We will definitely look for this spot again when we return to Charlotte."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment was great for mine and my boyfriend’s stay in NoDa for the weekend. It is a bustling and loud area, so don’t stay here if you will mind the noise. But if you want to be right in the middle of the action, this will be perfect for you. Overall a very nice stay. Looks just like the pictures."

This is not one of those soulless spaces with the garbage furniture, there is love in the details here. The bed and couch are both dangerously comfortable. There is beautiful lighting and stylish light fixtures. I found myself landing here in a real bind, and Marc let me check in early, was very responsive to my few questions and showed real compassion. The instructions for everything are carefully written and detailed, I had no problems finding it or getting in. Awesome location for a social butterfly or bar- goer, and there’s a ton of good food on the block."

The bed was super comfortable and we loved the lighting in the bedroom and throughout. NoDa is a fun neighborhood to explore day or night."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"NoDa is our favorite part of Charlotte. This is right in the heart of NoDa so you are walkable to all the bars and attractions the area has to offer. Wonderful apartment. If craft cocktails, breweries, great food aren’t your thing - you might look somewhere else. Otherwise it’s a great place to be.
Had everything we needed and more. Will definitely be booking again."

My friend and I enjoyed evenings walking up and down the neighborhood's streets and soaking up the nightlife as well as relaxing in the comfy surroundings of the loft just reading and talking. Whether you choose transit by foot, train, or car--the location facilitates day-trips just about anywhere in the region with the knowledge that you'll return in the evening to a beautiful loft with plenty of pedestrian-friendly businesses still open."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Incredible farm stay. The grounds are a homestead wonderland of various small-farm animals, including a lovely backporch overlooking free-roaming chickens, roosters and lovely greenery and garden areas decorating this home-grown comfort nest. The kitchen was luxe- cabin with beautiful decor, complimentary washer & dryer supplies, 2 immaculate and romantic cabin vibe atmosphere. I wouldn’t have changed a thing. I truly regret not being able to spend more than 1 night there. The creative lighting was warm and ambient. Can’t wait to have a real stay and be able to spend more time interacting with various farm activities waiting to be enjoyed. Jeremy was responsive, and extremely thorough in making me feel informed, and even invited several opportunities for farm fun activities. Truly lucky and grateful. Thank you again. Can’t wait til next time!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Zachary was very accommodating and flexible with a moving target of a checkin time on my end. Everything we needed was easily accessible.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"great stay, exactly what we needed for a couple days. great host and very responsive!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at Zachary’s place. The working homestead was so enjoyable to be around. The location is perfectly located close enough to Charlotte, but tucked into a wooded area to feel private. We would definitely stay with Zachary again if we come back to the area!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place is amazing! It's a beautiful log cabin home on a working farm. My family and I love animals, and outdoors. Zachary was a great host and extremely accommodating. He gave us a tour of the grounds, answered all of our questions about his place and the animals, as well as giving us recommendations about hiking in the area. This place feels secluded and so peaceful, yet you are a stones through from viewing the Charlotte skyline. We attended a wedding and dinners in Charlotte and both were like 20-25 minutes from this home. HIGHLY RECOMMEND staying here. If you love nature and/or animals look no further. ;-) We have 3 boys and as soon as I saw this booking I knew this was the right place. My kids takeaway so far has only been Zachary, the log home, and all of the plants and animals. Wedding and dinner were dismal compared!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Zachary is a great, very sociable host. As noted, his cabin is the center-piece of an active farm, so potential renters just need to come with that in mind. Roosters crow. For myself, I loved it. Literally, a 20-minute ride from the airport (I took a flight from CLT), minutes from all the standard restaurants as well as local fare, you're on a quiet farm talking to a guy who loves hosting and loves running his farm.
The cabin itself is accurately depicted in the photos and description. Zachary has made nice updates to the place. The bed was comfy. All the amenities necessary in the kitchen, and the living area was great for relaxing in."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you love animals (and trees) this was the place! Super friendly dogs and cat. There were puppies!! The pigs and chickens were fun to watch too. Cabin was comfy and porch was nice to relax on. Zach was friendly and had recommendations of where to hike and where to eat. Driveway would have been hard to find at night the first time, but the description mentioned that."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Such a beautiful farm. A true gem in Charlotte.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"best airbnb stay ever! an amazing host i could talk with him for hours, helpful recommendations and insight. he keeps an impeccable cabin with a truly remarkable homestead with the most gentle loving animals ever. truly an amazing stay, definitely coming back ;)"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Probably one of the best places we have ever stayed. Felt right at home and beyond relaxed. Everything was very clean and cozy. Zachary is, for sure, one of the nicest people we have ever met and we’d return and book again for that alone.
Great time!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Zach was a wonderful host and just a really nice guy. The place is adorable and so comfortable. He is responsive to questions and also proactively made sure I knew how to get there and check in. I was at a training in the area and gone during the days but enjoyed spending some quiet moments outside in the morning and evenings, often to the sounds of the rooster, which I loved! Dogs on-site are very friendly but are in a fenced area and quiet during the night. Everything needed is included. Very clean and the bed was super comfortable. It is a rustic log cabin style home with modern upgrades that Zach has done a great job with! Thanks for an awesome stay! If I needed to return to the area, I would definitely stay here again! 😊"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was very beautiful, it was a home away from home. It was a nice get-a-way, and allowed us to be close to everything without getting in the heavy flow of the big city! The animals are all so friendly, and this is the true definition of a farm house. Zachary was very friendly, responsive and communicated fast throughout the booking, check in and out process."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was friggin FANTASTIC. By far one of our favorites. Hands down. Comfortable beds. Great bathroom. It has a rustic country vibe.Amazing doggies. Super cozy cabin. Zach is super cool. I meant to tune that guitar for you before I left actually Zach! Our kid loooved it. If you dig animals and nature it’s a good pick for sure. It’s actually not that far from downtown Charlotte. A+!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great one night stay at Zachary’s cabin! We were greeted upon arrival by his pack of beautiful white dogs (they were penned and so well-behaved!), roaming chickens, and a very friendly and informative Zachary himself. The cabin was super clean and beautiful. I am a plant person and really loved his beautiful collection inside the cabin. Our only regret was having to leave earlier than planned the next morning due to the rain (and 4 hour drive ahead.) Because of this we unfortunately missed out on his offer to let the kids feed the pigs in the morning and play with the dogs some more. This will give us a reason to come back the next time we find ourselves in the area. Thank you, Zachary!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"One of the coolest AirBnB experiences we’ve had. The kids had a blast with the animals. Super convenient to downtown, whitewater center, and Hornet’s Nest Park. Highly highly recommend!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a great time. The house is so cozy and it’s exactly how I expected it for my quick get away. The animals are cute and fun to see. Believe me you won’t feel like you rent an Airbnb but it feels more like family home full of nostalgia.
Super responsive host. I would give 10stars to rate this if I could."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at Zachary's homestead.
We arrived from CT to NC early and I contacted Zachary asking if there was a way to check in early.
He had guests from the previous reservation, but said if they leave earlier and he had plenty of time to clean, we could check in.
We visited with our daughter and he gave us an early check in at 1:30, which we appreciated.
When we arrived, my husband was so excited to see the homestead.
Zachary meet us as we drove in.
He was very friendly and gave us his story of the homestead.
He introduced us to his animals as well as PUPPIES!
The home was very clean. Had everything that was noted in the ad for the AirBNB.
The plants in his home were beautiful! I was a little jealous :)
It was very relaxing watching the chickens!
You must like animals, nature and understand this is homestead life to truely appreciate his place
We both wish we had more time to spend there.
If he will have us, we will definitely use his place again."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,we only stayed 1 night everything was great that we needed. sure would stay again
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a perfect little cabin for an animal lover craving a lightly rural getaway. The house itself was very cozy and comfortable--we slept easy in the bed, and had no trouble with the bathroom or kitchen. It's hidden enough to feel secluded, but residential enough to have an easy drive into. The animals make exactly the amount of noise you'd expect from a place listed as a homestead--quiet at night but reasonably chicken-y in the mornings. It was only about a 20-30min drive to all the fun places in inner city Charlotte. The host was extremely responsive and friendly, and really looked out for our general safety and wellbeing. I couldn't recommend this place enough, we hope to go back!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Zachary was an incredible host! I booked for my parent’s joint birthday stay and had a chance to speak with Zachary before my parents got there. He was very informative regarding his homestead and showed us his animals. Speaking with him felt like speaking to one of my family members! Zachary was kind, funny, and informative. If I could give this place and host 6 stars I would."
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Cute cabin, unique experience with many animals and it felt amazing to wake up thanks to a rooster!
The cabin itself lacks a lot of very basic small things, it’s minimalist.
The lighting could be improved (lots of bright white bulbs), no bed side table lights, looks better in the pictures than in reality. But overall your stay is not about being in a well decorated five star log cabin, this place feels cozy and it workex for our stay. Thanks Zachary!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Zachary was super communicative throughout our stay. The place was beautiful and super clean. The only drawback is we only got to stay for one night, wish we could’ve stayed longer!!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was exactly as described. Very cozy and peaceful.
Wonderful farm animals kept us company."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed one night at the farmhouse and immediately knew it was one of our top 5 favorite Airbnbs!! It was such a unique find, and you couldn't ask for a better, gracious, host!! Peaceful escape in the business of Charlotte. Clean, quiet, perfect for a small group. Thank you Zachary for a memorable trip!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If I had to describe it in an Airbnb review I’d say it was really good. Not only did this place offer a complete package for our stay, it made me a better person and brought my family closer together"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was really lovely, and I can’t wait to go back. Zachary was a very friendly host, responsive and kind. I even got a little tour of the plants and animals on site, and to feed the pigs a pumpkin, which was super fun. The cabin feels “off the beaten path” without being too far out of town, which is really nice when you’re trying to combine activites in Charlotte with a little break for yourself too. The beds were comfy, the bathroom is lovely, and there were lots of nice places to sit and take a call or read inside and outside. I will definitely book again!
One note…remember that animals on site means animal noises on site. Chickens are gonna chicken, roosters are gonna rooster, dogs bark if they’re startled, but if you dig that vibe, it’s really fantastic. I loved watching and hearing the chickens roam and the pups keep the place safe for their chicken friends - I’m sure you will too."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful hideaway on the edge of Charlotte. Charming rustic cabin is a peaceful reprieve from the busy city. Easy access to 485. Fully equipped with all the amenities makes cooking a breeze. The farm animals are an added bonus. A pack of Great Pyrenees rescues, a barn cat, several Vietnamese pigs and a plethora of chickens, roosters and hens roam the farm. Zachary is accommodating and responsive and an all around great host."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very scenic and homey. Will definitely stay again. Loved seeing all the animals
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed the night on our way through but it was a very pleasant stay. Zachary was very responsive leading up to and during the stay. Cabin was easy enough to find, even in the dark. Place was spotless top to bottom and the carpet was new and plush. Zachary was kind of enough to show us around the property in the morning before we left. Him and my wife talked about all the plants and the grounds for a good bit before we headed out. Will definitely stay again next time we're passing through."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Zach was awesome. Place was beautiful. I couldn’t be happier, and could not recommend more. Very grateful to have found this spot."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I had such a pleasant stay at Zachary’s cabin. The property was well maintained and very peaceful. I especially enjoyed talking with Zachary and learning about agriculture; he is very affable and has many good recommendations for things to do in the area. I would absolutely stay here again and would encourage anyone else seeking a peaceful getaway to check out this cabin!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"How relaxing it was to wake up to the sound of roosters welcoming the day! My 9 year old granddaughter played with the chickens, the big dogs, and the barn kitty. She had a great time watching Zachary feed the pigs their pumpkin breakfast. Zachary is a great host, very responsive and helpful."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Zachary was super helpful and kind. My friends and I had a wonderful time. The kitchen was great and the room layout was perfect. Meeting his dogs and pigs were definite highlights for us. Overall, just a great place to stay."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was by far and above one of the best places I've stayed in years! It was just so beautiful and peaceful and the ambience was so soothing! Everything about this place is amazing and worth the trip out there for sure! Zachary was such a great host and had lots of good recommendations that I'll definitely be stopping there again! Also there's something just therapeutic about this place that even after one night away I feel absolutely rested and ready to take on the world!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Zachary was awesome. We loved the dogs and the chickens and we appreciate that he let us feed the piggies. Take advantage of this stay and it’s everything you could want !
Great communication on Zach’s part
Beautiful scenery and funny animals 10/10"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved staying here. It was exactly what I was hoping for. Coffee in the morning on the porch with the sunrise and the view he has here was the best way to start our day. We left feeling inspired!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Oh my, if you love dogs and a quiet remote location, this is it! Seven (count them--seven!) Great Pyrenees but they are fenced so you don't have to worry about jumping! The cabin was lovely, remote and quiet but very convenient to Charlotte--I highly recommend this great place!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The space was perfect for our weekend trip! Was clean and quiet, and Zachary was very clear with instructions on check in and finding the place!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One of the best Airbnb’s I’ve ever stayed at. Loved the cabin and the decor inside. The host was amazing. Got to meet the cutest cuddliest dogs 😭🫶🏼 loved the garden, chickens, and the pigs. Location was so peaceful and also just a 20 min. drive to the city, which was perfect for what I came here for. The guitar in the cabin was also a plus since I forgot to bring my guitar. Wish I stayed longer. Definitely will be back. 🤎"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay, clean & clear, quick communication"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This spot is so great that I booked again for three days later and came back. So peaceful. Fabulous porch out back looking over the chickens and barn and plants. Awesome spot for morning coffee. Very private and quiet. Not far at all from ""civilization"", but feels like such a secret spot. Zachary is an incredible host. He is quick to reply and always super helpful and warm. His place is so comfortable and always spotless! Everything you could possibly need during a stay is here. And Zachary is committed to making sure you have anything you need. I will definitely be back for a 3rd time and more!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Zachary was an awesome host! He did a great job communicating with me before I arrived and checking in to see when I'd arrive. Everything was absolutely immaculate! Very quiet and peaceful spot. And the cabin is much bigger than he mentions so that's a perk too The porch out back is such a great spot to relax and just look over the chickens and all of the plants and property. I had too quick of a visit so I booked a return four days later as I head back to town. I'm so excited to arrive early enough to be able to relax and enjoy the peace and quiet at this place. Kudos Zachary!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, we felt right at home and we enjoyed all the animals. The accommodation was roomy and the loft was a great spot to hang out and relax. We enjoyed our morning coffee while sitting on the porch off the kitchen."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Zachary and his home were wonderful! Nice and secluded - will definitely rent again when in the area!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Zachary’s place was amazing! If you are looking for a get-away that is full of peace and connected to the serenity of nature, his farm-cabin would be the perfect place and space for you. The cabin was spacious with all the amenities without taking away from the simplicity of the off-the grid feeling you get as soon as you enter the gated sanctuary. I’m a early riser, so I went out to see where the roosters were that were setting the atmosphere for what was going to be one of the most amazing (AirBnB) stays I have ever had. Once outside Zachary was already up attending to the chicken, which he invitingly allowed me to partake in the connective movements with all of his rescue animals (dogs, chickens, and pigs) Zachary was so personable with his education on the garden, the animals, and the history of the farm. I enjoyed the conversation, walking, and taking pictures of so many amazing plants, flowers, fruits, and vegetables. Zachary, topped off the amazing tour with 6 beautiful eggs."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,it was great! loved the animals

Hailey furnished and completed the home with everything & anything you could imagine. We definitely would suggest this place to anyone going to the Charlotte area. We will be back for sure. I loved the outdoor bathtub. The bed is comfy. There is even a projector in the living room for watching movies. A nice TV in the bedroom too! The kitchen is perfectly designed and organized, beautiful dishes and extras. The bath....WOW fantastic shower! On demand hot water. The toilet we have never seen before, didn't know there was such a thing. Such a smart idea. Privacy and calmness, set back from a main road, plus only 8 miles from the Charlotte Speedway! Only word to describe.....PERFECT! Thank you! Bob & Gayle"

The home was spotless and welcoming, the surroundings beautiful, and all the amenities were top-notch, including yoga mats, a convenient little space heater, and snacks. Hailey is super friendly, a fantastic communicator, and kindly accommodated my late checkout. I was concerned that I would not have transportation during my stay, but I had no problem requesting Lyft when needed. I also made an evening stroll to the recommended pizza spot and was happy to learn it was on a well-lit sidewalk the whole way. Also, take advantage of the neighborhood greenway--easy access across the street--for your daily walk or run. Thanks again for a restful stay; I will not hesitate to return on my next trip to Charlotte!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"In one word, INCREDIBLE! I wanted to stay forever. The bed was amazing! I’ve already purchased all the linens and reached out for the link to the mattress. The tub outside was lovely. So many little touches, from bandaids to yoga mats, umbrella and Bluetooth speaker. The location was perfection. You didn’t feel like you were in the city but we were less than a 10min drive to everything we could have needed. 15min drive to the Panthers stadium on Sunday morning. Hailey was always quick to reply. We already want a reason to come back!"

This is not your typical airbnb, which was why we wanted to check it out, and it was GREAT! Our hosts were extremely responsive and made us feel like special guests. The remodeled shipping container was well done and thought out. It felt spacious in spite of the size. Beds were extremely comfortable with fresh linens and could actually sleep four. Kitchen was stocked with everything you could think of, including a few snacks. It was a peaceful location and the weather was perfect for sitting on the front porch with morning coffee and an evening beverage. We even tried out the outdoor bathtub, which was like sitting in a hot tub. A friend came with me on this trip, but I'm thinking about bringing my husband for a weekend get-away! Thanks to our great hosts, we had a wonderful weekend!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect getaway for us as a couple. Would highly recommend to anyone visiting the area. Hailey was very responsive and kind. What a great host and a cozy stay. We appreciate all the love that was poured into this tiny home. We will be back!!

I’m a Charlotte local so this was was the perfect staycation .The container home was spotless , the bed / sheets super comfy . The towels and rags felt like pillows . You can just tell with the little things equipped in the home where all premium quality items. Which honestly was must appreciated ! This made me feel like Hailey truly cares about the comfortably of her guests. The out door tub was a 10/10 , it became very chilly the weekend of my stay .It was just so perfect to heat up the tub and just relax to take in all the natures beauty. This place I would recommend to any one ! This was a cute romantic weekend getaway for myself and boyfriend and was 100% worth it !"

She had everything from yoga mats to umbrellas to bubble bath and bath salts. She had everything we could have possible needed and more. She knew it was our anniversary and left a sweet surprise and petals in the shape of a heart on the bed for us. We had the best 3 year anniversary. We will most definitely be back and sharing with all of our friends! Thank you so much for being so kind and accommodating for our special celebration!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little getaway! Lovely place and very accommodating hosts! Would definitely stay again if headed towards the Charlotte area!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first stay in a container home and let me just say I was very impressed! It felt cozy inside, very solid and well insulated. And even during a rain storm I couldn’t hear a thing. I appreciated all the amenities and how Hailey anticipated anything that could be needed while on my stay. Hailey was very helpful and available to answer any questions I had. I enjoyed using the projector for movies, I thought that was a nice touch. Great location if you’re wanting to have a secluded feel surrounded by nature but still close to everything! I also loved they are only 7 minutes to a Trader Joe’s. And about 20 minutes from the airport and all city stuff. Overall I recommend and would book a stay again next time I am in the Charlotte area!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hailey was a great host with good communication before and during our stay. She’s thought of anything you might need during your stay. The bed and bedding are so comfortable. This place is so private and quiet, you’d never know you were in Charlotte! The location is very convenient to a lot of near by shopping and dining. We will definitely be coming back again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was by far one of my favorite stays! My first time staying in a container home, and It couldn’t have gone better. It was clean and cozy. LOVED the rocking chairs and the outside bath. You come off the main road onto a beautiful long driveway and suddenly you feel like you’re in the countryside. Quiet and secluded. But downtown Charlotte is still only like 20 minutes away with the train stop a couple minutes away too. It’s surprisingly well insulated. The design is so smart to make it feel roomy and give you everything you need in a smaller space. And Hailey herself was a lovely host. They really give you your space, but were ready to help if I had questions. I hope to have more business down there and return!! Thanks Hailey!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Had an enjoyable time. Got to spend time with my niece and were able to family dinners and had plenty of space around the table.
The backyard was lovely too. Our dogs enjoyed the space and as well the adults just hanging out playing backyard games or relaxing by the fire.
Also, has a nice grill with special directions for starting.
The house is clean and had a book with all information how to use things and good restaurants to animal hospitals."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great weekend celebrating Mother’s Day and mom’s birthday. House was very cozy, kitchen great for making brunch, large dining room table- great for game night. Fenced in yard was a huge plus for the dogs. We felt right at home and will definitely come back to this property."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The house is a quick ride to so many parts of Charlotte and easy to get to. The house and yard are exactly as pictured and comfy for a work trip or vacation in Charlotte. The yard and lighting were A+ for enjoying nice weather or taking dogs out in the evening. Hosts were very responsive to a question I had and have done a great job thinking through how to provide a comfortable stay.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Super close to first ward park and different restaurants and such. Super cute on the inside. Not a bad location either!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was our first time in Charlotte and the location of this place was perfect. It was within a 10 minute drive of most things we wanted to do downtown, and less than that to a grocery store for snacks and such. The backyard is SO convenient for dogs and it was truly relaxing hanging out there when we were staying in. The house in general is very cute and nicely decorated.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful home on a nice quiet street that isn’t too far from anything. Felt very safe during our stay, and had everything we needed! Will stay here again when visiting Charlotte."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Priscilla & Andy’s home was very beautiful and very close to the city and other things we did during our stay. Priscilla was super sweet and communicated me with throughout our stay. I gave this home a 4 star because the floors were not cleaned. If we didn’t have a baby we would have not known because it isn’t visibly dirty. Once letting Priscilla she did offer to send her cleaners back to clean the floors but we offered to do it ourselves because that meant we would have needed to leave the home while the cleaners were there.
Other than that the home was beautiful! The backyard was our favorite spot!! Lots of space. We took advantage of the projector and fire pit.
Overall really nice place to stay!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying here! It’s close to noda so we had plenty of choices for food and things to do. We really enjoyed the back yard setup. It looks just like the pictures- very clean and cozy. Would definitely recommend to a friend.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful place and very central for everywhere
It's identical to the pictures"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Priscilla & Andy were such amazing hosts!! We traveled in for a wedding and when I messaged them asking if their home had an iron since we would have dresses & suits, she responded that they didn’t but that she would overnight one to the house. Such amazing, accommodating hosts! The home was spotless and looked exactly like the pictures. It was a quick 10 minute ride into town and conveniently located to where we needed go for our event. This may have been one of the most well decorated/clean Airbnbs I’ve ever stayed in. Priscilla was so responsive when I messaged her with questions and everything with check in/out was so smooth.
One item I do want to mention is this home is outside of the city in a run down neighborhood. I don’t want to say we felt unsafe, but we were extremely cautious of our surroundings when we were outside in the front/back of the home."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This house is EVERYTHING that was advertised. It was absolutely perfect for a solo trip. My family that lives in Charlotte came to visit me and said they will definitely recommend this place to family and friends that are visiting Charlotte. Priscilla and Andy check in on me during my stay which I thought was great. The location was perfect. The back yard was so relaxing and we loved the fire pit. The neighborhood was quiet. The train was not a problem. I absolutely loved the house and will definitely book with Pricilla and Andy again.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ross was always quick to respond to messages, extremely flexible and adapting to travel plans, and very welcoming! Our stay was very comfortable, and my boyfriend and I enjoyed the homey feel of the place. I cannot express enough how effortless the check in and check out process is—super comforting when you have a long distance to travel before and after your stay. While in Charlotte, we were able to get to the city for less than $10 with Uber, and there was so much in the area that was accessible in a walkable distance. Overall, such an amazing and comfortable experience—thank you so much Ross and we’ll be sure to come back in the future!!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Has to be one of the best spots to stay in Charolette. Minutes away from downtown able to Uber/Lyft around all night. Chose this location mainly due to the safe private secure parking location. Had everything and more than ever needed for the brief stay. Very friendly. Highly recommend this location to enjoy Charolette and will definitely be staying here every time visiting Charolette.
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Unfortunately, we had to cut our trip short for reasons completely unrelated to the quality of the AirBnB, so take my experience with a grain of salt. The check-in process was clear. The BnB was clean and orderly. Ross was responsive and friendly. That said, the little things may make or break this place for you. The BnB is effectively a MIL suite in the backyard of the host’s house—which in and of itself is fine—but you will hear kids running around. You’ll need to do a three-point turn to get out the parking spot allocated to you as a guest. The windows in the living room and bathroom do not have blinds or privacy filters. This may not concern you, as the suite is on the second story, but for my wife, she felt exposed when using the facilities, with a full view of the neighbor’s backyard. If you can live with these compromises, then hey, it’s a great deal located in the heart of Noda, restaurants and entertainment all around, with a well-organized host with plenty of recommendations."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I was not able to stay at Ross's place due to the area losing power however I'm giving 5 stars due to the way he handled the situation.

Ross gave me a full refund on the day of the reservation. With that in mind, I can fully reccomended this listing as I'm confident if anything goes wrong Ross will take care of you."

Host responds quickly. My only advice would be to let the host know when you are arriving. There is a gate they initially have to let you in then they give you an opener. I failed to let them know I was much earlier than expected and had to wait to be let in the gate. As long as you let them know your arrival time everything else will be seamless. This space was homey, spotless and relaxing. It’s also in a great location- close to everything. We stayed for a concert and we’re only 10 minutes away. Thanks for having us! 10/10"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay- Enya is a great host and provided all of the information and tips we needed to make our stay nice and comfortable.

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place the only downside is that the thermostat was not in the location but she was willing to adjust when asked.

Enya responded within 5 minutes to a question and immediately addressed it. Everything was very clean and well organized. I really enjoyed my time here!"

The unit was just as described and Enya was a terrific hostess, with timely communication. Everything inside the rental was up-to-date and things were even labeled with clear instructions for renters. Her online Guidebook was helpful too.
We look forward to returning in the future, as our travels take us to Charlotte again. Thanks Enya!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay! Would stay again.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enya's place was just as advertised. I would loved for the place to have a kitchen but I understand it is a small place. it was very clean and I would stay there again! Worth the money for a short visit!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved the Blue Door BNB! It was cozy, spacious, the mattress was so comfy I wanted to switch it with mine! 🤣Enya was so thorough that we didn’t even need to contact her at all. Oh! Also the shower was so nice!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enya's place was very cute and just what I needed while working in Charlotte. I could make coffee, stash my leftovers in the fridge and get a nice, comfortable night sleep. I really enjoyed sitting on the front porch, listening to the thunder with a beer from a brewery in the neighborhood. I was there by myself but it would be a very spacious place for couple to stay.
I loved walking around the neighborhood along the trails and sidewalks. If you're up for walking a lot you don't even need a car (I didn't have one while I was in Charlotte). I walked to work downtown and walked to breweries, restaurants and coffee shops. Only occasionally did I get a Lyft back if it was pretty dark out or my feet were done!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The apartment was very clean and comfortable. It was easy to find, in a nice neighborhood, plenty of street parking, and has a self/check in lock.

My daughter and I were very satisfied and will now book this darling apartment whenever we stay in Charlotte.... Five stars, highly recommend!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great little place close to downtown Charlotte. Quiet neighborhood and very clean. A little toasty but i’m sure if I had messaged hosts they would have fixed it, but it was very late and I didn’t want to be a bother. There were several fans provided and a powerful ceiling ling fan. Great stay."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing! Such a beautiful area and so many things to do close by. We took a golf cart tour around the city and it was amazing. The property was in a great location and was super easy to enter and get settled. I would absolutely stay here again!

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Awesome location that is very walkable to downtown. Very clean. Comfortable bed! Enya was very responsive to anything I needed! I would definitely stay here again. Noise level is similar to an apartment and you will be able to hear from the apartment above you. There is a sound machine in the bedroom to help with the noise at night.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Enya’s place was perfect for our one night stay. It was exactly as described and would be a great place for a Panther’s game.

Easy to get to, great parking, plenty of room for 2 could work just fine for 3, everything was there as described, close enough to walk downtown during the day but likely a Uber with lots of choices for entertainment. If you’re picky about the temperature being too hot or cold you might find this a talking point. I am not btw"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great time! Make sure to sign the guest book. If you arrive after sun goes down, let host know and they can leave light on. Walkable to downtown; download app to lock/unlock door before arriving. Great communication and definitely a good value especially if you visit for 1-2 nights. It was somewhat noisy in the early AM hours on second night from neighbors but there is another unit right next door. If temp in apartment needs to be adjusted, you can let host know as well. Would stay again if returning to Charlotte in future. 😀"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We thoroughly enjoyed our quick trip to Charlotte for New Year’s. Enya is a fabulous host who made us feel right at home.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location was great for our needs, walkable to most areas or easy access to taxi or Uber. Spacious bedroom and bathroom, living very comfortable. There is a sofa bed in LR though we did not need that. Everything was very clean and updated decor. There is a little kitchen area with Keurig, mini fridge and small microwave that was all we needed. Not to mention the nice touch of some complimentary bottled water and various snacks. We would definitely stay again when we are back in the area"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A quiet place in a nice neighborhood. Very suitable for our short stay. The hosts were responsive, which was important because the apartment--half a duplex--has its thermostat in the hosts' side of the residence. A very secure and safe method of unlocking and locking the apartment door digitally seemed unnecessarily complex to us. Upon arrival, we had a short period of confusion trying to download and install the necessary app while traveling. Others may not find this to be a problem. The accommodations were clean, comfortable, and affordable."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My son and I watched UNC play in the ACC Championship game and this was a perfect spot to base ourselves out of. The space exceeded my expectations and Enya was a great host!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Enya’s place was so comfortable, cute, and in a wonderful location! The neighborhood is quiet, walkable, and picturesque. My husband and I stayed with our 18 month old daughter. Enya accommodated us with a pack and play and fresh linens for our baby to sleep in. We loved that she was able to accommodate our family for our stay. She went above and beyond with every communication and answered every question we had. The place was spotless and felt just like a home away from home. The bed was also super comfortable. Thanks again for your superb hospitality, Enya and Chuck!"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Enya’s place is beautiful and clean. The step up on to the porch is very large so if you have challenges with steps keep that in mind. The unit does not have control of the temp but Enya was super responsive and help me out with making it cooler. Enya is an amazing host who was quick to respond. I would definitely stay here again.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great from start to finish
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a cute and trendy little house in a nice neighborhood. The houses are older that have been refurbished and they have style! The inside was clean, and inviting. The master bed was comfortable. Our son slept on the pull out couch which was also comfortable. The bathroom has a nice and clean shower. This house is within walking distance to the stadium and several local restaurants. We will stay here again!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We just needed an overnight layover, since we came into town to pick some friends up at the Charlotte airport. This spot turned a utilitarian visit into a mini-vacation! Enya has thought of everything you could want or need in setting up this space. Her guidebook was also thorough and well-thought out. Even her response to a small hitch with the lock was prompt and kind.
The space IS on the small side, but surprisingly didn't feel too small and it perfectly suited our needs.
I highly recommend this space and will book it again whenever we come back to the area!"
2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Nice space, smaller than expected. Only a few houses up from train tracks just fyi. Noise level is similar to apartment living. Didn’t have any issues with parking, which was a big relief."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect little get away place and conveniently close to a lot of things. We will most definitely book another stay. The place was very clean and necessities were in reach in all of the rooms. Very quick response from Enya during the booking. Everything was labeled and explained perfectly in the house book. I would 100% recommend this little blue house.
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very good location. The place was very clean and communication was great. One negative was that the only non disposable plates, cups, flatware etc. were 2 small plates. Everything else was paper or plastic. (And only 4 cups provided). This lessened our experience and seemed wasteful. Also the “snack” basket that was left was lacking in comparison to the pictures.
Overall, a good experience."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great relatively quiet location and an easy walk to the BOA Stadium and several restaurants. Plenty of space for the 2 of us with a large bedroom and bathroom. Though the living room was a bit smaller than the pictures portrayed it was still very comfortable. There wasn't anything we needed that wasn't supplied.
Highly recommend!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved staying at this listing right near downtown Charlotte! The location was fantastic and we have absolutely no complaints about the Airbnb itself.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family had a wonderful time, we felt right at home! It was in walking distance of the convention center that we were attending and the neighbors were very friendly and kind. The home remined us of our yearly camping trips we take because of how the woods seems to surrounds the home, but still had plenty of light at night to see your way around. I will definitely rent this home again next time we are in Charlotte!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Bamboo Bungalow was an amazing find and likely my favorite Airbnb that we’ve ever booked! It was just as pictured: gorgeous. The house was thoughtfully designed and stocked with everything you’d need. It was located close to so may good restaurants and attractions, yet still peaceful. We stayed for 4 nights as we were in town for extended medical care and after long days, it was so nice to rest our head at the Bungalow. We will definitely book again!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Bungalow is fantastic if you are in the Charlotte area. It is like this little oasis in the city. It it is a close drive or uber to pretty much everything! We loved that about it. Marcus was a fantastic host. We ran into a couple of issues with pipes due to very cold temps while we visited, and he was on it immediately, and even came back later to double check. The bungalow also went offline while we were visiting (it wasn't a huge issue for us, as we were not there for much of the time it was down) but he was sure to alert us immediately. It is modern, pristine, and very comfortable. We wanted to stay longer! We would absolutely book the Bamboo Bungalow again when visiting Charlotte."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Marcus offered recommendations, quick to communicate & friendly! The location was close to many things and the house was super cozy! It was very clean and comfortable."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was a great stay, but located behind another residence. You’ll have to go through their driveway to get to the house. Once you get there, you’ll be in awe! Parking access was easy and there was enough space.
Easy access to everything in the City.
Area was quiet. House was super clean!
Thank you for our stay :)"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The stay was absolutely amazing. My boyfriend and I just wanted to get away for a few days and it was perfect. Marcus gave us the option to check in early if need be and communicated very well and in a timely fashion. The space had everything we needed throughout the stay and was extremely clean. Could not have asked for a better house or host.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I enjoyed our weekend getaway here! Everything was extremely clean and cozy!

We highly recommend!"

Looks exactly as it looks on Airbnb , definitely will be staying here again when I come in the city again ❤️"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It's a little oasis in the city.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I don’t think it would be possible to love this place more than we did. We joked multiple times about everywhere that we went was only 15 mins or less to get to. You are in the middle of charlotte but feel like you’re out in the woods by yourself. Marcus was incredibly helpful and responsive as well. We can’t wait to get away again and stay here.

Fully furnished and of the highest quality
Host is helpful and race when we asked for a few extra things
I recommend the house very very much"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,best airbnb to book.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, exactly like the pictures. Very relaxing and beautiful for a peaceful getaway. The place is perfect but to make it even more perfect a hot tub or fire pit would have been fun to have on the property. Robes and body lotion was the only thing that was missing to make it even more perfect."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I could not have asked for better accommodations. Marcus’s place was everything we needed and more. Immaculate cleaning, peaceful and secluded yet near to many great restaurants and cafes. The kitchen is fully stocked and even has some seasoning essentials to get you started. The bedding was like a dream. No sleep was lost here. You will not be disappointed with this stay. My daughter and I were not ready to leave. We are already looking at dates to return. Thank you for a wonderfully relaxing weekend."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Marcus was very responsive and accommodating. The bungalow has everything you need and more. Kitchen is fully stocked as well as seasonings. It was an extremely cozy stay. Can’t wait to revisit.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is awesome. I would definitely return and recommend to my friends. It gave you a secluded feel while being very close and convenient to all the action. I would suggest bringing a pair of grippy socks as the flooring throughout the house was very slippery.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Can I just pay rent to live here the rest of the year?
I came here for a “staycation” as I worked on an online residency program for grad school, and I got the peace and quiet I was looking for, and it felt comfortable and homey. Communication was top notch."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome location, hidden away but still very close to downtown and everything. Everything was super clean and cosy. Marcus was very nice and responsive to any questions that we had. Very nice getaway vacation for me and my girlfriend."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Easy to get to any part of Charlotte. Nice quiet secluded location in grove of trees. Perfect for a weekend getaway visit. Also Marcus was great host...left a pair of ear pods behind and he made sure I got them the next day.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the bamboo bungalow was nothing short of spectacular. This is fighting for a #1 spot of our Airbnb stays. When you walk in, you will smell the freshness of this build. Brand new & I felt like I was walking into a Joanna Gaines build (there were touches of her line in the bungalow:)). Marcus really thought about it all. The shower was huge, the beds were very comfortable, all outlets were labeled, a full use kitchen, & W/D (extra touch). Marcus was a great host!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed our stay here! Marcus was very helpful with anything we needed. Would definitely stay again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing air bnb! So clean and in such a good location
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was such a fun place to stay while in town for a concert!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow…this place! Such a serene spot. Marcus was a pleasure to communicate with along the way, so welcoming, and the bamboo bungalow was the perfect location for our visit—the neighborhood is fun with many neat stores, restaurants, coffee shops, etc. in waking distance. The interior of the bungalow is modern, extremely clean with comfy beds. The exterior with all the bamboo makes it feel like an oasis. Sitting in the back steps in the evening, watching the fireflies, hearing the cicadas, feeling the warmth of summer…truly a memorable experience. Should my travels bring me back to Charlotte, this is the first place I’ll check for availability! Absolutely gorgeous, peaceful, and perfect! Thank you, Marcus!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was very enjoyable, although it is hidden behind a forest of bamboo it adds to the aesthetic of the house along with the area being quiet and peaceful. And it wasn't too far from the grocery store or some fast-food restaurant to grab a quick bite to eat. The layout of the home was also very nice, the stay was great."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely stay! Definitely will be back again. Everything about this place was the definition of relaxation. It has all the amenities you need in such a beautiful breath taking surrounding. The only thing I would say this place may need is a full length body mirror to check yourself out 😉
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was amazing! This would be the most accurately advertised Airbnb I have booked, it looks exactly like the photos. I will be rebooking this one in the future."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome experience! 10/10 highly recommend. I will be staying here again.
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall we had a great experience! The home was clean, in a great location, and the instructions provided by the host were more than helpful. The beds were uncomfortable and hard and the place also didn’t have a large mirror. They’re were 2 small mirrors located in the home, so I had to use my phone to get idea of my appearance. The location was great! The home is located behind two other homes, but it is in a private spot in the uptown area. Overall we recommend!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We absolutely loved this home!! Spotlessly clean. So peaceful. Beautifully decorated. We hope to be back!!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"me and my wife had an amazing experience staying at this location, and we planning on coming back ."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Incredible location and house! The bamboo forest is absolutely stunning, even better than the pictures! The kitchen is beautiful and the beds are comfortable. Would definitely stay again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and I booked this airbnb on a short notice and marcus was able to accommodate for us. He was a great host and the house was incredible. Very clean space and it was very cute. 10/10 stay.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The host was incredibly accommodating, meaning quickly responsive with answers when we had a question. This airbnb is hands down one of the most serene, beautifully built, and spotless airbnbs we have ever stayed in.
The bamboo woods and giant owl flying through the yard made us feel like we were in a scenic wonderland. The home is nestled behind 2 homes at the front of the property, a long driveway and ample parking like the description says for 2 cars. The neighborhood is quiet and the neighbors were distanced enough, and we felt like we had privacy.
Please for the love of God, please respect and maintain this airbnb, because it’s definitely a gem!
Thanks Marcus 😁"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Spectacular the site would go there again
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was just like it said… a standard king hotel room. Bed was comfy. Easy to control the temp of the room. 10 min from the airport. Good deal.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,excellent vacation
2023-11-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"After getting off such a long flight, I just wanted to check in my room & rest. I wouldn’t completely blame the host but honestly checking in should’ve been a lot smoother."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice and clean
2023-10-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Booked a room at LoSo last minute when needing to stay an extra night in Charlotte. The upside were: friendly helpful staff, clean room, comfy bed.
We felt that the room was a little pricey for what it was. The hotel seemed pretty dated with what felt like cheap and sloppy finishes slapped over a facility that still feels outdated.
It was not a bad stay by any means, just not what we expected based on photos, description and price. ""Relax in a luxurious and convenient hotel in trendy neighborhood"". Adjacent to but not exactly IN the up and coming neighborhood and questioning the luxurious part of description.
Very comfy bed and everything felt clean!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thanks for the stay
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Gorgeous and clean space. Tamara’s communication was perfect. I loveeee the decor and use of the space. All directions regarding check in and check out were crystal clear. Definitely will be returning.

Tamara was extremely helpful and gave us some great recommendations for places to eat in the area!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tamera's place was super nice and chill. We had business at the convention center, and her place was perfectly located and easy to get into and out of. We had our own parking space and her condo was immaculate. If there was a draw back, it's only the elevator code system, but that's a first world problem.

Check in was easy and detailed, no issues. Tamara was quick to communicate & was a very friendly host!
The location was exactly what I needed as I was attending an event at Spectrum Center. Public transportation was easy to navigate (and definitely a plus that the stop was right outside the front door!) Lyft was affordable as well and usually only took 2-3 min to arrive.
I HIGHLY recommend & I would 10/10 stay again next time I'm in Charlotte 🤗"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay. Excellent location, an easy walk to many places in town, but when we got back to the condo it was very quiet and we felt a sense of privacy that we wouldn't have in a hotel in town. Also, the security was great and we always felt safe.
The space was perfect for our four night stay. Everything we could have needed was there, and the condo was very nicely appointed. It was spacious and modern, and even had an umbrella, which came in very handy during a heavy rain one night.
We didn't need the garage, but had we been driving it would be a major plus. Easily accessible and clean.
Tamara communicated easily and often, and we never felt as if we would be on our own if anything came up.
We would absolutely stay here again, and would highly recommend it."

Tamara is friendly and responsive. She clearly takes pride in hosting and I was sad to leave. Bravo!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Tamara’s place was great. Very clean and quiet definitely will stay again. She was very helpful and easy to contact during our stay. Looking for a clean safe place while in Charlotte definitely check her place out.

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place and perfect location!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay in this beautiful condo in a quiet neighborhood. The access to the condo was a bit tricky first time or two but after that it was a breeze. In terms of location it’s not walking distance from the cooler parts of Charlotte but still overall a good quiet spot.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great stay. Definitely will book again
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent condo -- perfect for a couple to get away, or for a single person doing business or just wanting to visit Charlotte. The location is top notch in a great neighborhood. Check-in is a little tricky, but the directions were so precise that it all went well. Make sure to print out a copy of the directions so you have them on hand. Condo was super clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. The best part, and frankly surprising to me, was how quiet the building is. You will get a good night's sleep for sure! I highly recommend this place, and the owner is very communicative. Overall, I give it a five star rating!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely space in a great location. It is close to the city but in a very quiet and safe neighborhood. Privacy is very important to me and this space suited me and my husband wonderfully. The space was very pretty, comfortable, and clean. I also enjoyed the French press.
I know there have been some comments regarding operation of the elevator, but I was able to access the space with no problems simply by following Tamara's detailed instructions. If you travel with a ton of stuff like me, I would recommend bringing a cart to make things easier. I did not have one so I just had to make a few trips.
Overall my experience was a wonderful and I would recommend staying at Tamara's place."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great clean stay! Short distance from anywhere downtown. Would book again!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The pictures don't do this place justice. It is stylish, comfortable, clean, and has great natural light. The bed was comfortable and the shower was nice and hot. There was coffee and creamer for the morning. And I always felt safe. She also had a nice stand up desk where I could work. The only thing I will mention is that, altho it's close to almost everything, it's not as walkable as I was thinking. Not a huge deal if you're traveling with others, but solo travelers will probably want to drive or use Uber/Lyft if you stay out late into the evening. Tamara was a great host. Highly recommended."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great Condo. Good neighborhood. Nice and clean. Close to everything. Downtown is only about a 10 minute walk depending which part of downtown Charlotte you want to be. Short car rides to everything else. Would stay again.

We will be booking this place every time we visit Charlotte from now on.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable and clean condo. Lovely place to return to after a day exploring Charlotte. The neighborhood is very quiet yet in a convenient location.

The condo is in a great location-the neighborhood offers a quiet and calm space for morning/evening walks, and easy access to Uptown with an extended walk. I didn’t hear any neighbor noise aside from occasional footsteps of the folks living above the unit. Tamara was very responsive and helpful prior and during my trip. The check in and garage access directions are precise. Will definitely stay here again during my next visit to Charlotte!"

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and everything you need for an extremely comfortable stay. The instructions for the garage and elevator are a little complicated but follow them and you are good. Dishwasher wasn't working but Tamara was getting it looked at.

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This condo is at the top of our list for most favorite places ever to stay! We travel extensively and always choose this type of accommodation.
From the initial confirmation to our last communication with Tamara, she was absolutely wonderful to work with regarding any details. She was proactive in providing information and responded quickly to any questions that arose.Everything about this condo was perfect. It was so inviting from the moment we walked in and we found it had everything needed to meet our needs and more. Tamara even went out of her way to get us a cooler but not just one; she gave us two so we had options.
It is newly decorated and so clean. The location was perfect for our needs. The neighborhood is wonderful and most everything was within walkable distance. There are some beautiful parks in that location to enjoy. When traveling by car, the freeway was right around the corner yet you never knew it was there. I loved having underground gated parking as well.
I just can’t say enough about this condo except to say that we plan to stay there again if and when we are blessed to return. Don’t even think twice about renting this place...you’ll be glad you did!"

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow - This place is amazing! It’s not only stylish, it’s also in a great location. The directions to get in were also clear and concise, which is super important to me. Once you entered the home, it was not only pleasing to the eyes, it gave you a sense of comfort. From the natural light, the oil diffuser and the comfy seating, it’s was like we were home. This home was in a prime location to walk and explore uptown Charlotte, where there were shops and restaurants and it was very close to the Hornets stadium. That was a pleasant surprise, as my husband and I love to walk the cities we visit and this one did not disappoint. There is even a convenience store right next to the complex. All in all this home was a great choice and if we were to return to Charlotte again, we would definitely stay here again. Tamara was very responsive; she was an amazing host! Five ⭐️‘S across the board!! Stay here, you won’t be disappointed!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was our first time renting an Airbnb and I was very pleased with our stay at Tamara’s condo.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Outstanding!
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,My family and friends were excited about this house but our excitement soon turned to disappointment. The furniture is very outdated and the beds were really uncomfortable. They were more like cheap mattresses with a thin mattress topper. The carpets upstairs are stained and have not been cleaned in awhile. I understand that most of the price is for the pool and the size of the house but the pool furniture was even rusted. I will say host was very nice through messenger though. Would rate the house itself a 3/5 but the host a 5/5.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Such a great and peaceful place to stay. Very spacious and clean. Thanks so much!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My large family enjoyed this beautiful, spacious home. Everything was thoroughly cleaned and the house was well stocked with necessities.

2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Our stay was great. The owner was very helpful and willing to assist. I would like to note that the only tvs that worked was the one in the living room and the one outside. The one in the master bedroom would turn on but we couldn't get it to pull up any channels. We changed all inputs but still nothing. The other tv in the bedroom with multiple beds and cots would come on also but no service was connected so we couldn't watch either. The other two bedrooms have no tv at all. If you plan on swimming at night there isn't much light. I'm not sure if that is to discourage noise and swimming at night or maybe I overlooked a plug but that was unfortunate. Other than that the home was clean and the owner was great !!!

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was extremely clean and in a great quiet location, it was as advertised according to the pictures and amenities. There was plenty of space to accommodate 10 guests comfortably. Mike reached out to see if we had any concerns and responded accordingly with an immediate response. He also had the pool man there on the day we arrived to ensure the pool was clean for our enjoyment. We really enjoyed our stay, and I highly recommend them for your vacation stay."

The bedrooms were very well divided so that everyone had their privacy. The beds were comfortable, the home was well stocked, and the wifi signal was strong. The hosts were great, very responsive, and available to answer questions. We had a great stay, and we would definitely stay here again."
,,,While the home was clean and as advertised my daughter and I were unable to sleep well due to the temperature of the house. There is no thermostat in the unit. The heat came in and ran nostop all night. The windows were painted shut so we were not able to get any relief. We willnot be returning.
