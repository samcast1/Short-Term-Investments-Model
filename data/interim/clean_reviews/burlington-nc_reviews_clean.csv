2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our third stay at Cindy’s place and everyone was the same. The house was clean and easy to get to and close to Elon campus. I would highly recommend it over staying at local hotels as it was much more homier and fun.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Second time staying here. Just as great as the first time! Highly recommend…
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Everything was as described or better. Many little extras for our comfort. Cindy was very attentive & accommodating with allowing an earlier arrival for us which was a huge help with a busy weekend schedule in Chapel Hill. I’m pretty picky about where we stay & I felt as comfortable at this home as I do in my own!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second visit using Cindy’s place and both times have been wonderful. I think it is so much better staying here than at any of the local hotels. Cindy is a wonderful and informative host and I highly recommend her place for any looking to use it while visiting Elon or any place near there
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was the perfect place for us to stay for our family's visit to Elon. It is adorably decorated and comfortably fit our family of 5 plus two dogs. The deck and completely fenced back yard were great. Cindy is a fantastic host - communicative and responsive. She has thought of everything to make for a comfortable stay and provides coffee pods, creamer and snacks!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, great host - we can’t wait to go back!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely beautiful home, very clean with ample space. Perfectly decorated with very comfortable beds and lots of small touches including Keurig with pods, snacks, chocolate, toiletries, games, dog toys/bowls, etc. There was a huge, fenced back yard and it was so nice to have our dog with us."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family had a wonderful stay at Cindy’s place! It was very clean and had all amenities listed. The pictures of the property matched the house exactly. Home is in a great location in Elon, close to local restaurants and grocery stores but also in a private setting. Would recommend for a family traveling with littles as well!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place was as advertised and Cindy was extremely responsive. Clean and simple home with some nice welcoming touches. Will return again! A great place to stay when visiting Elon and other area Universities
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great place to stay near Elon University. We attended a wedding there and the location was perfect to meet our friends (4 min away) easily. Having a comfortable home is so much more appealing than a hotel with our pups! This place definitely did not disappoint!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Fabulous place and host, can’t say enough about how lovely our stay was. Accurate description, super nice amenities and responsive and helpful host ! Highly recommend"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was a beautiful and comfortable stay. Cindy was wonderful with communication and extending check out when our flights we changed at the last minute.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"What a wonderful stay we had at Cindy’s place! The home was pristine, inviting, and filled with amenities that made us feel at home immediately. We have stayed at ABNB’s many times and Cindy’s home is a favorite, by far. There were plenty of toiletries, toilet paper, and towels. We also loved the well stocked coffee bar and fireplace. Cindy is a great host and checked in with us multiple times during our 9 day stay. We will definitely seek out Cindy’s home for future visits to the area."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We love Cindy's place! Everything about it is perfect, so much so that it's beginning to feel like our second home! The good news: a lot of other guests feel the same way. The bad news is the same. A long line of people are always huddling around the calendar, trying to find a spot! Thanks, Cindy, for understanding what it takes to make us comfortable and happy. And by the way, the new blue rug is great!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very cozy and clean. Had lots of extras that most places don’t. Provided K cups, creamers, condiments, cleaning supplies, toilet paper, paper towels etc… Very quick to answer any questions."
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"Out of all of the Airbnb’s that I have stayed at this was the most comfortable, well stocked, clean, property with the friendliest host that I have come across. We had a fantastic day, and I would highly recommend this property to others."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Amazing! Amazing! Amazing!
Exceptional Experience!
You will be delighted and feel at HOME.
Cindy has thought of everything. You will be spoiled by all the thoughtful amenities and special touches that go above and beyond for guest, families and pets! I am already booking another stay.
From the ease of check-in/ access, to the beautiful furnishing and terrific location.
Privacy Fence, outdoor living spaces, fireplace, FULLY stocked kitchen and bath, great laundry and comfy beds. This home has it all!
Thank you Cindy for providing Home for a work-travel weary patron!❤️ See you again soon!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We wanted to find a place that was near Elon University, and Cindy‘s place was absolutely perfect. It felt like we were almost on campus. It’s clean and quiet and our family of four nicely. Will certainly be looking to return once school begins."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect stay with everything you need close to Elon's campus!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great Place and recommend it to anyone needing a place to stay in the area
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Definitely one of the best stays I have had. Clean and nice place. The kitchen was well stocked and so were the restrooms. Felt like home. Cindy was very responsive and reasonable.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,All of the amenities we wanted were provided (and more). The back yard was perfect for the dog to run around.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cindy’s is the first house in what seemed to be a quiet family friendly neighborhood. Although the road leading into the neighborhood is well travelled it was always quiet inside and out. The home is laid out well, clean, bright, and tastefully decorated. Kitchen was very spacious & user friendly. Lots of counter space and cabinets. Enjoyed the waffle maker and was pleased she had a mixer and mini chopper. Plenty of supplies ( kitchen and bath & laundry soaps, paper products, trash & storage bags, foil and plastic wrap and household cleaners. Bed was very comfortable with several blanket/layer options. The amount of quality fluffy towels a BIG plus. Plenty of hot water and great water pressure in the shower. Glad were able to extend our stay by an additional night. Cindy was very helpful and friendly throughout our rental process ."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What an absolutely great house! It was everything advertised! The location was fabulous. The backyard was amazing! It had a natural area with a glider and plenty of grass for the dogs to play. Cindy responded promptly when I had a question! This will be my go to when I need to go to Burlington! I have already booked my next stay!!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb was perfect for our needs. It was clean, well stocked with big fluffy towels and linens. The kitchen had everything we could need including a snack basket.the furniture was very nice, big tv’s in every room. There is a cute front porch.
Cindy was very responsive. She checked with us to see if we needed anything. We will definitely go there again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is exactly what it stated it was and what we were looking for. It’s immaculate and has a wonderful yard where my dogs were very happy. Cindy’s personal touches (dog treats, snack box, great selection of coffee and creamers, bottle of wine, NC magazines) made us feel like we were right at home. We will be back. Thanks Cindy!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was bright and cheery with plenty of room for the family. The back deck and yard are wonderful too. Cindy was a very friendly and responsive host. We loved the location and hope to visit again in the future.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is Spectacular! It is bright, fresh, airy, and comfortable! I stayed here for 32 days. It was absolutely perfect. The moment I walked in the door, it felt like home; every amenity one could hope for. Especially well stocked. I’ve already booked my next stay. If you have students at Elon, this is the place to get for visiting the kids. A 10 out of 10, without a doubt."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Southern Charmer was a wonderful place. We had a wonderful stay during parents weekend. We shared with a couple other couples and we all loved it rather than staying at a local hotel as we have done in the past. We had people over and the backyard was perfect for our gathering. We definitely will stay here again in the future.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cindy is everything that you look for in a host. Welcome snacks upon arrival, thoughtful in every way, wonderful backyard, every kitchen utensil you’d want to make a home cooked meal, amazing mattresses, super clean and just perfect for our vacation. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great weekend visiting Elon University and staying at this location. Incredibly convenient and a beautiful house. We had 4 adults and a toddler and had plenty of room. Highly recommend!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cindy's house only has one ""problem:"" It's so awesome that everyone who stays there agrees, which makes it hard to find open dates! We've stayed there twice, the first time for a vacation, the second to care for a hospitalized extended family member. We never even considered renting a place in Greensboro, even though it meant extra driving, 38 miles round trip; at least two and often more round trips a day. We preferred the nurturing comfort of Cindy's exceptionally clean, perfectly accommodated home to practicality. That pretty much sums it up."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely!! So close to Elon. We loved it.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cindy’s place was amazing- location is perfect- and home had everything you could possibly need as a guest. She was very responsive as a host and we are sure to stay there again!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really over-the-top spectacular. A lot of absolutely wonderful, thoughtful small touches. Extraordinarily great beds and linens!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cindy’s home was great. It had everything we needed for our short stay. Cindy even left a few treats for us and the coffee selection was great. We will definitely keep this home on the list for future visits to the area.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, very spacious, cut and cozy and neat everything"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely home! Neat, clean and a happy place to stay:)"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cindy’s place was perfect. Great location for a quick visit to Elon University. She had all the essentials which made my stay easy and hassle free. I loved the extra touch of a magnifying mirror in the master bath, over head fan and charging stations. She even had lens wipes for eyeglasses! Great stay"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We were in this air b&b for over a week, we couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay! The host is wonderful and takes the time to make the house extra comfortable for each guest. It was a blessing to be able to stay in a place that felt like home! The house was extremely clean and in a great location. I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"On a long road trip visiting Colleges for my daughter we found Cindy’s listing near Elon. It was clean, modern and very comfortable. Cindy couldn’t have been a better host. Communication was perfect. Will definitely be back if in the area again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our host Cindy made us feel welcome. The home is beautifully furnished. We appreciated our host providing wonderful amenities such as cold water bottles, multiple types of coffee pods, and a variey of snacks.
We enjoyed our stay very much and look forward to returning in the near future!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Look no further! This home is charming and welcoming and comes with an amazing host! Cindy is super responsive and willing to help. We experienced some crazy weather and she checked to make sure we were all ok and didn’t need anything. She has thought of all the little things to make your stay just like at home…need a lens wipe for your glasses? She’s got that! A ziplock for your leftover pizza? That’s there too! Forgot your salt and pepper for your morning eggs? You’ll find it in the cabinet!
The home is very clean and comfortable. The 3 bedrooms were perfect for traveling with multiple adults (our party consisted of myself, my sister, and my father). Everyone had their own space and never felt cramped. Huge fenced in backyard with a little squirrel friend living in the trees.
We will definitely seek out this home again when we return to North Carolina!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"IF YOUR READING THIS....LOOK NO MORE! Just book it. You won't regret it.
We booked Cindy's place for a tennis tournament at Elon University. As a family that travels every weekend, this rental stood out. Cindy was very communicative before arrival which made check-in simple and easy. We were greeting with wine and chocolate....WE KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO BE GREAT! The house was clean, decorated beautifully, and large enough for the 3 of us to really spread out. A thunderstorm rolled through for the majority of the day and this cozy home created a perfect atmosphere for us to hunker down and spend the rainy day indoors. We loved it so much that we have added it to our saved homes and will continue to book Cindy's place for our 2x per year visit to Elon."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Cindy was a fantastic host.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay here. The place was so clean and comfortable. We love the natural light all of the windows let in! It had a spacious fenced in back yard. We would recommend this place to anyone. Cindy, the host was so sweet and very communicative. We appreciate that!
We will stay here again in the future!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is the nicest Airbnb anyone could ask for and the hospitality of our hostess, Cindy, was exceptional. I felt such a warm welcome to North Carolina and would highly recommend family and friends staying in her beautiful home. The kitchen is well stocked, the towels plush, the beds comfortable. All you could ask for and more! Better than a 5 star hotel!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,Very nice stay at an affordable price.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great host! Great place!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great host

2023-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,The stay was great 🥰
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Xin’s place is just how it’s described. If you are looking for a clean and comfortable place to sleep and clean up then this place is perfect. We were there for a four day tournament so all we needed was a quiet, clean and comfortable spot! Xin’s place was perfect! Thank you!"
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I had a good stay at this Xin's place. The host was kind enough to waive the cleaning fee, but I was disappointed to find that the sheets were not fresh as they had crumbs and hair on them. Luckily, I had brought my own sheets, so I didn't have to sleep on dirty ones. I also found a toe nail under the night stand, which was quite gross and made me question the cleanliness of the place. Xin's place is peaceful enough to get a good nights rest but the doors of the rooms have a huge gap at the bottom, so I could hear other guests occasionally coming in and out. Parking was available on the property or on the street, which was convenient. The only thing I would suggest is to bring your own hand soap (and maybe own bedsheets.) Overall, it was a decent place to stay for a short trip."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,good place. worth it.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great host thank you for everything Xin such a beautiful soul 🦋💙

2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Xin was so helpful, friendly and quick to respond! Room had its own private bathroom and mini fridge, which was very nice. Xin always answered any questions I had and was so sweet and kind!
Definitely would stay here again when in the area!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I love the Broadway hotel. room B. It was peaceful, amazing, clean, private and quiet. I recommend this hotel to anybody."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful and charming old house with completely updated kitchen and bathroom. It’s very spacious and tastefully decorated. I would stay here again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and comfortable apartment with all the amenities. Centrally located in the heart of Burlington near Elon with plenty of parking. The apartment has historical details with modern upgrades. Would highly recommend!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,My second stay! Clean and charming as always!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was much bigger than we expected. It was very comfortable and homey. Major plus were the washers and dryers. I would definitely stay here again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"There is a reason that she’s called a super host, it’s too bad I couldn’t rate it any higher than five stars. I wish I would have a reason to visit the area again. It was a wonderful place."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely loved this place! Will definitely be back.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gayla went above and beyond in her place. She spares no expense from body soap to dryer sheets she had it all! One of the top 3 AirBNBs we’ve stayed in and we have stayed in them globally.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a cozy, cared for apartment! Comfortable king size bed, nice size bathroom with fabulous water pressure in the shower, spacious living room with a desk too! Beautiful artistic touches without over cluttering. Extra goodies such as two toothbrushes and toothpastes as well as k cups and creamer/sugar to make coffee. This was super useful for short stays where you don’t want to bring/buy everything you need."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gayla was a great host and the apartment was exactly as expected! She went the extra mile and had toiletries in the bathroom available if we needed them. There were laundry machines easily accessible too. It was a short walk to historic Burlington where we were able to get a bite and drink at local brewery. It was lovely and we would stay there again anytime. Already tried to rebook for parents weekend in the fall but sadly was not available. Thank you Gayla!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely Beautiful and Perfect! Gayla never misses anything, when you stay at one of her homes! The best host every time that we book with her. Gayla is also super friendly. Thanks again Gayla and husband for another perfect stay, at your home!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is one of the best airbnbs I’ve stayed at!!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Terrific value. The place was even bigger than I thought. I’ve stayed at nearby hotels and this was way better. Will stay here again for sure!
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"My only problem wasn't Gayla's places problem, it was mine. Most people love a memory foam mattress but because of an accident as a child it's not enough support for me so that was the only thing that wasn't great but again that's because of my particular, rare situation."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Simply fabulous. Inside you are emerald in old charm and modern beautiful house.
5 minutes inside and you feel like you live there !"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place was great! Very clean and nice, would stay here again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Phenomenal place to stay
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute and clean! Was a perfect spot for me as I had a week of outdoor class and needed a comfortable place at the end of the day. Being able to cook my own meals was great and laundry was a huge bonus.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great, hence we extended our stay!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Having travelled across 25 countries, we can proudly say that this was one of the best AirBnB experiences ever. The attention to detail to all the little needs of the hosts with such care was the absolute epitome of hospitality for us (which is so difficult to get even in top hotels)
Gayla has poured her heart and soul into every corner of this home and it’s really visible the minute you step in
Highly recommend to anyone in the area!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed at Gayla's property multiple times. We love this house and Gayla is a great host. No detail is overlooked and we have everything we need. Without a doubt, we will stay with Gayla again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is gorgeous! We had such a wonderful, relaxing time. The host was wonderful to communicate with, and all the logistics were super easy. We loved staying here and would love to come back again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The home is beautiful. I loved all the original wood from the floors to the doors to the crown mouldings. The kitchen and bathroom have some modern touches but didn't distract from the original feel. Both kitchen and bath had everything needed for a pleasant stay. Very homey feeling! Loved it!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So much better in person! The picture really didn’t do it justice. It was much bigger than I thought, super easy to find, check in and check out were breeze, especially that there wasn’t a giant chore list, thank you, Gayla!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place. Was very comfortable and roomy. I’ll stay there again.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Easy to find and get into - spacious, super clean, very comfortable bed, big kitchen - perfect for our needs while visiting our son at Elon. Will be saving for future visits."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for a great stay! Apartment had pleny of room to spread out and provided the perfect weekend home away from home for us.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to stay. Reasonably-priced.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A remarkable experience, the place was clean, every room was well stocked with appropriate necessities. The property itself reflected the historical character of the home and was decorated very nicely. I would highly recommend Gayla's place to anyone. Just a side note- we are accustomed to a sleep number bed so it did take a while to acclimate to a firm mattress. Minor issue. Location perfect, great parking."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Its a beautiful place to stay. It has historic beauty yet updated and modernized details to make you feel cozy and at home. I'm from NYC so I love that old brownstone/railroad apartment type of design. Exactly what I needed. I will be visiting again !!!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gayla is a wonderful host. The apartment is lovely. Comfy bed and lovely linens. I’ll definitely be back again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I stayed in Apt B at the McCauley House and it was absolutely perfect. The space was clean and comfortable!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,ANOTHER great stay at Gayla’s place! :)
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Don’t even know where to start. It was beautiful. The bed was so amazing my god. We had just gotten back from the craziness of blue ridge rockfest and as horrible as the festival was, the air bnb helped make it better. Will definitely stay here again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gayla’s place was wonderful. Apartment is equipped with everything you need for a long or short term stay. Very clean and tasteful. Pictures and description matched exactly. Gayla was very quick to respond and extremely kind. My husband and pups enjoyed our stay! We will definitely be back!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This home was full of southern charm and the hostess, Gayla, was genuinely interested in making our stay as nice as possible. The home is so lovely! You can see that a lot of love went into the restoration of this old house. Loved the super comfy bed and relaxing in the front porch in particular. One of my favorite Airbnb’s ever!"

2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"Love’s place was exactly as described. Perfect for a low-budget overnight stay. Future guests just note that you will be sharing a bathroom with 2 strangers. Be prepared to bring your own hand towel and wash clothes. There is no coffee but a water cooler, which was nice. Love was very responsive and the room was minimal but clean and comfortable."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ginger is a superb host! This was a perfect location and set up for our family as we traveled in for our daughter’s college graduation. Graham is a charming town and Ginger goes above and beyond to create a wonderful experience for her guests.
We especially appreciated her:
* responsive and proactive communication
* thoughtful touches throughout the home to welcome her guests
* comfortable furnishings and great beds and linens"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Ginger's Place was absolutely charming. The home was very clean and spacious. We loved all the board games and cards. We relaxed on the back patio. We enjoyed walking through the neighborhood. It is suburban but very quiet. The neighbors were friendly! There was plenty of supplies and essentials for everyday living. We were able to prepare meals daily.
Ginger was very responsive and proactive. She was the kindest, most helpful and friendly host.
We would be happy to stay again and Highly Recommend to others!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed for six nights in order to attend UNC-Chapel Hill's graduation events. It was a busy weekend and many places we had stayed before were unavailable. Plus we wanted affordable accommodations and a place large enough for four adults. Ginger's place was perfect! Not only did it fit our budget - it also exceeded our expectations. The location made it possible for us to try area restaurants on the nights we did not want to cook (even tho the well-equipped kitchen made it tempting to stay in!) All the bedrooms were spacious and had really comfortable beds and linens. The bathrooms were well appointed (plenty of towels) and included extras that even hotels no longer provide (loved the body wash). We streamed movies at night but books and games also were available. I know Ginger will go above and beyond to make her guests feel special whatever the occasion. While our son will be leaving North Carolina for his next adventure, we might be back on one of our own!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I must admit, I wasn't sure what to expect at first in Graham BUT this place was OUTSTANDING!!! The layout of the space and all of the furnishings were impeccable.
I don't think we could have asked for a better host. She is proactive with communicating and so accommodating.
I will recommend this place to any one I know in need of a place to book! I will reserve this place for future family visits!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were extremely happy with our stay! The house was absolutely beautiful and the pictures in the listing were spot on. The hostess, Ginger, went above and beyond with communicating and was very pleasant to work with. We were in town for a wedding and the home was only minutes away from the venue and very close to restaurants and shops. The large backyard is wonderful for family and the house is spacious and is perfect for getting ready for a wedding! The neighborhood was very quiet and peaceful for relaxation time. We highly recommend this place!!! ♥️
P.S. I accidentally left my credit card and as we were traveling home Ginger messaged me and let me know in case I wanted to report it as lost or asked if I would like her to mail it to me instead. I so appreciated her getting in touch with me to let me know!!!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Ginger went above and beyond. if/when we come back this will be the place for us.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My family and I were in town for a youth soccer event and found Ginger’s place to be perfect for our family of 4. Her communication was great both before and during our stay. I would highly recommend this Airbnb as Ginger went above any beyond with many nice touches as well.
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"I cannot say enough wonderful things about this house! So warm and cozy, yet has so much space to spread out. Beautifully decorated and Ginger has added precious little surprises and touches thru out the house. Highly Recommend!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"We had a great stay at Ginger’s! Since Ginger is just getting started with this airbnb there were minor kinks to work out but Ginger was quick to respond and is making the minor changes needed to ensure future guest with a great stay. There’s a few things we look for in an airbnb and Ginger’s place checked the boxes.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mike’s home was a welcome respite! Only a 2 night stay but I would love to come back for a longer retreat!
The kitchen was fantastically equipped. We enjoyed movies in the den and the kiddos setup the Xbox in a bedroom.
The primary bathroom is a spa retreat, and the soaking tub is highly recommended! I had no problem relaxing til my fingers and toes were pruny, listening to music from the bathroom Roku TV.
We couldn’t take advantage of the lovely patio due to the rain, but I hope to in a future stay. We will be back!"

2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Mike was a fantastic host and great home. Appreciated the food and drinks that he had waiting for us. House was comfortable and clean. If I could give more than 5 stars I would have.
FYI - if you are short like I am or have children, note that the beds are higher than standard height. Not a big deal for me as this has happened before and I now travel with a folding stepstool in my trunk - but want to let others know."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,This home was absolutely gorgeous. The lawn and everything was perfect. This is definitely a top spot if I ever need to come back to Burlington. Mike was an absolute amazing host and kept in contact all the way up to checkout. He left very detailed instructions for everything. This home is definitely a hidden gem.
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"We returned for the second time and the accommodations were just as great as the first time! This is a very clean, comfortable, well-appointed home. Mike provides small details that make the stay more comfortable. The weather was better this visit and we were able to enjoy the great patio as well. This is a great place and we plan to return again in the future!"

The house is clean, very comfortable, well stocked for whatever needed, and a short drive to the Elon campus which is what we were looking for. It was great to be able to park in the garage, especially given the very rainy weekend we experienced. Although weather prohibited use of the patio area, it looks fantastic and would be wonderful to use. We would definitely recommend this house and Mike as a host!"
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"Amazing home! Beautiful, well-stocked and clean. We were in for a wedding in neighboring Elon which was so easy to get to. Mike thinks of everything for his guests, leaving clear instructions on all facets of the home. The master bath is luxurious; patio is so relaxing. There is shopping and many restaurants nearby. Check in/out was seamless and Mike is very responsive.
Probably the best AirBNB stays we have had!
De La Fuente Family"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't imagine a better airbnb in Elon/Burlington. Rented for my daughter's 21st birthday. Stayed for a week. Perfect location. The place is clean and very nicely furnished and decorated. It's stocked with anything you'd need. He even welcomes you to the food and drink he has in the home. TVs in every room, including the master bath. Master bath also has an upgraded shower with 5 nozzles. Great experience and worth the money."

Mike is a gracious, accessible host. Would definitely stay here again."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful place. Immaculately clean and a perfect layout to sit and relax after a long day. The host was very easy to contact and check-in/check-out was super simple. Would definitely stay again if I can get an opening.

2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect place great lighting, yard and house look so much better in person. The home is all on one floor so we felt close together with enough space for personal privacy. The house was clean, smelled fresh and in a great location with shops and amenities close by."

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mike's place is very nice and well equipped. Restaurants, groceries, and shopping are all a very short drive. The neighborhood is very nice for walking or running and there is a small city park within a mile of the house."
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,More amenities than you would expect. Backyard was amazing. Showers were updated and awesome. Use of garage to pull our car in. Clean! Clean! Clean!

We really enjoyed the newly redone outdoor area that has a fabulous grill, fire pit, and plenty of comfortable seating. The beds in all 3 bedrooms are very comfortable, and the master bath is incredible! Mike is a wonderful host who thinks of every detail for his guests and is great with communication. He even leaves some groceries to get you started, which is very thoughtful. Located close to many grocery stores, restaurants and Elon University. If you are visiting the school or the area, this is the place to stay! Highly recommend."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and house!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mikes place is beautiful; exceptionally clean with comfortable beds and linens and wonderful showers. The kitchen is well appointed.

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved our stay at Mike’s house. Beautiful back yard, spacious, clean and great location. Mike is the best host to top it off. Can’t wait to come back!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mike's home is nothing short of AMAZING! He went out of his way to have us feel welcome - adding special touches such as snacks and drinks and being available to us when we had questions with quick replies. We used the gas grill and fire pit which added to our stay. The location is superb if visiting Elon University. This was the best air b and b we have stayed in and only wish we found this gem 4 years ago when our Elon alumni was then a freshmen. Highly recommend!!!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have again stayed at Mike’s home. When you stay at Mike’s place you should expect everything to be top quality. And it always is.
Location, cleanliness, little amenities,comfort, all there.
Why stay in a hotel ?"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My daughter attended college in North Carolina for 4 years, if I knew of this beautiful location I would have stayed here every time instead of all of those hotels. The photos and listing description doesn't do the home or Mike's generosity any justice. You will definitely not regret your stay here. His backyard is far more beautiful than the picture and I enjoyed spending most of my time out there. He has instructions for every single thing and even if you're still unsure he's quickly available via text."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have done several Airbnb’s, Mikes place is by far the best! Beautiful house, great neighborhood, everything was perfect!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay here for the Easter holiday weekend was nothing short of perfect! We have stayed in this home before and enjoyed our stay again. Mike has added more to his already manicured landscape with a beautiful patio with fire pit and built-in barbeque. He is an excellent host. We feel very much at home here and will continue to book with him.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our 3rd stay at Mike's place. The location can't be beat if you, like us, are visiting a student at Elon University. Shopping, restaurants, and the University are all easy quick drives. Mike recently upgraded his backyard patio so it is beautiful to sit out there and relax and/or have meal. His home has all the amenities we could want, and we enjoy making a ""home cooked"" meal for our college student. Mike is very generous with the supplies, including having some food available when you arrive. The house is always clean, with plenty of towels and bathroom and shower supplies. There is even extra toothpaste!! We highly recommend staying at Mike's place, but please don't book it when we want to be there!! :)"
2020-12-01,5,Group trip,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this property! Thanks so much Mike for your excellent hospitality. The house is beautiful, clean, nicely decorated, and extremely close to food and shopping. The pictures don’t do the place justice. We will definitely make plans to stay again!"

2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place for visiting our daughter at Elon University. We were able to relax and feel comfortable in this homey atmosphere. Everyone had their own space for virtual learning/working. Plenty of couch space to binge on Netflix/Disney+. We took advantage of the fully equipped kitchen and cooked all our meals including the barbecue out back. Mike even had some fresh fruit, milk, orange juice, eggs and bread for us. Upgrades throughout house. Couldn't ask for more and hope it is available our next visit. Thanks Mike !"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mike’s house is a great value for our family. We would need 2 hotel rooms and for a reasonable amount more we get an entire house including the garage for our car and a backyard to relax. Having a fully functioning kitchen also helps save money and makes the house an even better deal. The house is clean and has all the amenities we need. The master bath is gorgeous and the sound system in the living room is fun to listen to. Mike is a great host. He cares about his guests. The location of the house is great for access to shopping and to Elon University. We have stayed there twice and will stay again on our next trip if it is available.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"It is exactly like it looks in the pictures. Mike provides everything you need and more including having some food and beverages available if you arrive late in the day and cannot shop. He is Superhost for a reason! The house is clean and comfortable. The master bath is beautiful and the shower is great and the towels soft. Nice area to sit outside as well. And especially if you need to be close to Elon University, the location can’t be beat. We would definitely stay again and in fact already booked our next stay."

2019-09-01,5,Group trip,"This is a great house in a super neighborhood. It’s close to everything! The amenities were far more than we expected. The refrigerator, pantry, fruit basket, and fresh flowers were just a few of the special touches that made our stay enjoyable."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, newer home with all the amenities. Very comfortable."
2019-08-01,5,Group trip,"Rented the home for family to gather and stay in during a weekend wedding. Mike was responsive, thoughtful and was so accommodating. The place was better than described. There was room in the fridge to put our groceries, TV trays for others if you needed additional seating besides the dining room. Instructions for everything was provided and it allowed our family to have a wonderful time together in a place that felt like our own home."
2019-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I have stayed in many Air BnB properties, and this is by far one of the best. It was spotlessly clean, comfortable, well-furnished and appointed, had comfortable beds, ample towels, nice kitchen appliances, neatly manicured yard ... no disappointments here! I would absolutely stay here anytime I am in the area. Thank you, Mike, for making our weekend a wonderful one. We felt well-cared for!"

2018-12-01,5,Group trip,Perfect
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mike was a most gracious host. He is on point when it comes to hospitality, and in all the small ways that make an Air B&B a home. The house had everything you needed and then some! We did not lack for anything and all our guests loved being in the home. The kitchen had everything one might need to cook. He was thoughtful in leaving us some items for breakfast. We enjoyed being in a place where all our family could make home base. Thank you Mike for your home away from home. We will def. be back. The Bakers"
2018-11-01,5,Group trip,Mike’s house was everything and more for a group of us traveling back for Elon men’s basketball alumni weekend. His house was beautiful and he went above and beyond to make our stay great! We will definitely be returning!

2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mike was a terrific host. We stayed at his home while moving our freshman daughter into Elon. Staying at his house was so much better than a hotel. Not only was I able to cook our daughter her favorite meal, but I got to do her last load of laundry! Mike also provided us with lots of little extras that truly made our stay, like plenty of water in the fridge, fresh flowers on the table and coupons for Bed Bath and Beyond. Mike even let us use his garage, which was nice for keeping our overpacked SUV out of the hot sun. I only wish I could keep his place my little secret!"
2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Staying at Mike's place is 10 times better than staying at any hotel. The home had everything we needed and more.
2018-07-01,5,Group trip,Place was beautiful and his communication was great. Awesome amenities.
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mike is a super nice guy, very prompt, organized, and flexible. His house is amazing and is in the perfect location to get to anywhere. We will definitely be staying here again should we return and we highly recommend!"
2018-06-01,5,Group trip,"RENT THIS HOUSE, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.
The Airbnb concept is to make you feel at home away from home, Mike nails it!
No hotel can touch what this home has to offer.
Our group of 6 adults had plenty of space, inside and out. Beds were comfortable and clean. Bathrooms were very well appointed and clean. Towel, soap, shampoo, it was all there. We did not cook, but everything you'd need in the kitchen was there, including basic herbs, spices and condiments.
The backyard patio was just the right amount of space, we enjoyed hanging out during the evening hours. Table and 4 chairs, plus several bag chairs were available, again, everything you'd need.
I could ramble on and on, but I'll wrap up by stating again, we were comfortable from the time we opened the door, Mike did everything to make our stay as carefree as possible. I recommend you not overlook the opportunity to stay here.
RENT THIS HOUSE, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED."
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Multiple generations stayed here for our daughter’s graduation weekend from Elon. The home is closer than most hotels plus we had a lovely kitchen which Mike surprised us by stocking it up some before our arrival. His home also has a spacious living room and a decent size dining room. Our family and some other guests enjoyed some meals together in this space. Mike communicated well with us prior and during our stay. His home is immaculate and beautifully decorated. The beds were very comfortable and his master shower was a big hit with its multiple jets. We all agree that we would highly recommend a stay here at Mike’s home.
2018-05-01,5,Group trip,"Mike’s place was perfect. The house was comfortable, clean and spacious for the 5 of us. He has thought of everything! From directions for the tv remote to beverages in the fridge to the garage door opener and more, all our needs were met. Thank you, Mike!"

2017-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great rental for us. My daughter was graduating from Elon and we wanted a space for our family. My wife and I had plenty of room for our daughters and a nice area for gathering/relaxing. The kitchen is well equipped and the cooking basics were all available. We use Airbnb often and this was well above the average in amenities. The owner was easy to contact and responded quickly to questions. We would certainly rent this again! A very nice home!!!

Thanks again Mike for everything."

Mike was an excellent and accommodating host. He guided us every step of our stay, leaving us a welcome note, detailed instructions for anything we needed during our stay, and local recommendations for food and entertainment. He was readily reachable by phone at any time, but we didn't need a thing.
The house was extremely clean and well kept, a perfect size and space for the 6 of us to stay. Bedrooms were huge and comfortable, kitchen was big and bright and well equipped, and the backyard was very big with a nice place to sit and relax.
Couldn't recommend this place more, very happy with our stay!"
2017-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mike's place was great! He had a number of toiletries, plenty of towels, comfortable beds, you name it!

The neighborhood was nice and quiet while still being close to shopping and entertainment in the area. We would definitely recommend to anyone who needs to stay in Burlington!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We booked the Loft a year in advance of Elon University’s graduation and had a great weekend stay!

Breakfasts downstairs at Suttons were really convenient, and the local bars, and breweries made for fun evenings. We’re sorry we didn’t find this place earlier."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Graham was such a cool little spot. The loft was so special. The decor was just my style and the fire escape balcony and location above Sutton's (great home made food) and Little Oblivion Brewery, just made it a great place to stay. The shops in town were a bonus. Always found a parking spot right in front. We will definitely look to stay here again if given the opportunity.

The location cannot be beat and is directly across the street from the best cocktail bar around (Fitzgerald &Faulkner), a fabulous record store (Hi Fi) & upstairs from a delicious diner! We were pleasantly surprised to discover breakfast at the diner was included with our stay and we left stuffed to the gills! The loft is well appointed, super comfortable and has everything you need for a trip away from home.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is an awesome loft space in the heart of Graham - a town I totally have a crush on. The space looks directly on the vintage movie house that sits across the street. Microbreweries dot the town square with ice cream shops, coffee spots (Press is my favorite) and boutiques.
The space itself is comfy and cool. Rooftop patio was a nice touch. Private parking spot is another huge benefit.
Graham is close enough to Elon University to make it our go-to stay while visiting our son for the next 4 years.
AAA+++"

2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jennifer's loft apartment was a convenient, last-minute booking for my one-night stay. It was convenient in driving proximity for my meeting in Burlington & another in Mebane. Very central. Make sure to park in the back as per instruction. Front entry to the loft would be accessed near front entrance of Sutton's. There is a back entry from the parking area as well after obtaining the keys in the fromt. Even though the loft sits above active businesses & had lively patrons on a Friday night, I felt safe & confident as opposed to that of a motel stay closer to the industrial locations I had to attend. This place is ideal for the young professional to host a dinner or fun night for friends. Guests who prefer quieter retreats would find this place a bit on the noisy side. Those who are not a fan of steps would find it difficult. It reminded me of a gorgeous listing in Valletta that the only downside were the steps. Great water pressure & temperature in the clawfoot tub. Restaurant recommendation would be ""The Verdict"" a few steps away. Nice bird's eye views of a wonderful, well-kept little town. I woke to protestors this morning but they didn't linger too long in the heat. Jennifer is a prompt host. Highly recommend."
2021-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"Lovely space with lots of room, games for kids, and a good location. Included breakfast downstairs was a nice treat, and we enjoyed shopping in the area. Only knock was a lack of hand soap."

2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a cool place! Second time staying :)
2021-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"Fun, retro vibe with a great view of downtown Graham. Easy walking distance to great coffee, a cool record store, a barcade, restaurants, and more. Directly above the barcade so beware the occasional loud drunks out front in the middle of the night. Two fights broke out the night we were there, making sleep difficult. No one was hurt, and fights there may be rare, but something to keep in mind. It's an older building, so sound makes its way in pretty easy. It also takes a several hours for the place to warm up. May want to bring earplugs and warm PJs, if visiting in the winter."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was a 12/10. Would recommend anyone to rent it. Unbelievable space.

2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This place exceeds expectations. Very retro vibe and beautiful furniture. The area is great and if you want lunch just go downstairs there is a great diner right there.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The noise was no surprise; sirens from local fire and police, and trains rumbling as they roll nearby and of course blowing the horn. Other noise was from drivers revving up their cars as they pass by the area. Other reviews had already pointed it out and we were familiar with the area. Nancy was a good host and like other reviews, she had snacks and coffee and ginger ale readily available. Provided shampoo and conditioner. Though price seemed high, it was better than surrounding competition. Nancy was very responsive with communicating."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have officially found THE place to stay when we visit our child at Elon. Perfect stay from start to finish. Nancy was friendly and helpful and the place was not only spotless but adorable as well. We walked a few blocks into downtown Burlington a couple of times for drinks at the Burlington Brewery. The apartment was not even 10 minutes by car to our child’s dorm at Elon so perfect location. So nice to be close to Elon but not in one of the awful chain hotels on the main drag. Thanks Nancy for everything! We will certainly be back!!

Beautifully decorated with warm cozy settings. And best of all dog friendly and welcomed environment. Lovely walks around beautiful historic Burlington with many quaint family diners to experience. That is if you even want to do anything beyond sitting on the big comfy front porch with your coffee. Thank you Nancy. We have your place on our radar for future visits."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautifully renovated 1920s home. The one bedroom unit is spacious with an excellent work space, lots of books and a great space to cuddle up with one. The kitchen is a “1 butt” kitchen, so you better really like anyone your cooking with 😉 LOVE the gas stove! And the farmhouse sink. Everything we needed and then some to whip up a gourmet Christmas breakfast.
Close to everything! Easily walk to downtown Burlington. We plan on coming back when the weather is better to explore. 10 minute or less drive into Graham .., The Children’s museum, Biscuitville, Cookout… some of our favs!
Yes there is a bit of traffic noise. Personally, I like the sound of trains and church bells.
Nancy is very responsive and accommodating… even found space for our trailer we unexpectedly needed to tote along with us.
Definitely will stay here in the future!

Thanks so much Stacey!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve stayed in numerous Airbnb homes, some of them very expensive. None have matched this home in providing absolutely everything a guest might need or want. This home is an incredible value. It is not fancy on the outside.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We came to Burlington to visit our families for Christmas and wanted a place that would be comfortable for our family of four. Stacey’s place was THE PERFECT fit for our family!! There was every possible creature comfort there and available for us. We were welcomed with a very kind note from Stacey and a bowl of snacks and water bottles for our use. I rounded the corner inside the house to find it beautifully decorated for Christmas! The entire space was immaculate and so cozy and inviting. We all felt like we were literally at home! It was the perfect spot for us and it will hopefully be available for future trips to visit family. Stacey was a wonderful host!!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stacey was the perfect host everything was exactly as she said it would be
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"First, let me start out by saying, sometimes renting certain spaces, you never know what to expect, and you're sometimes skeptical. Well, the space that Stacy provided for us was the best experience ever! She personalized some of the things in the home, like letters on table, notes on the dry erase board with snacks and keepsake water bottle containers all included! We didn't have to go anywhere but to our families home to visit because she supplied everything we could have needed to make our stay comfortable!! Home was very nice, clean and organized!! The well lit Christmas tree made us definitely feel like home!! Stacy, we really appreciate you, we highly recommend, and we will be back to visit this space in the near future!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stacey was incredibly helpful and there wasn't a thing that anyone could need that she hadn't thought of already. The house is very cute and quiet - it's a great choice.
2023-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Stacy was always very responsive. I liked that she labeled the drawers with the location to various items in the kitchen. The house was clean and matched the pictures in the listing. The neighborhood was quiet, I had no issues.
Overall, I would definitely stay here again. Stacey was very welcoming."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place! The host has thought of every detail to make you at home in this air bnb. Loved it! Definitely recommend!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stacey’s place is AMAZING! Easily one of the best airbnbs I’ve stayed in, and that includes properties around the world! :-) We stayed here with our children for a few nights after our local home got packed up by movers, and we just couldn’t be more pleased with the experience.
What I loved most was that it felt just like our own home. There were a ton of amenities, from condiments, cookware, wash powder and kids toys (clean ones!). There was nothing we felt was lacking. The place was spotless and every detail had clearly been thought through. The price and location were also unbeatable! This is the first place I will be looking up when we come home to visit."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We felt welcome from the minute we stepped foot in the door. Stacey put a lot of thought into this beautiful space. Loved the snack bowl and all the bathroom amenities. The kids’ toys were also a hit. Lots of games to choose from. Stacey was very friendly and helpful. Quiet and peaceful neighborhood. We will stay here again if we’re back in the area.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I recently returned for a second 4-night stay at Stacey's place, and once again, it was an exceptional experience. Stacey's home is not only impeccably clean but also exudes warmth and a welcoming ambiance. From the moment you step inside, it genuinely feels like a home away from home.
One of the delightful surprises during my stay was finding a white noise generator in the master bedroom. Just like at my own home, it provided a peaceful and uninterrupted night's sleep, which I greatly appreciated. Stacey's attention to detail is evident everywhere in the house, ensuring that you have all the comforts of home right at your fingertips.
I wholeheartedly recommend staying at Stacey's place. It's a fantastic Airbnb experience, and I look forward to returning in the future."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Arrived at the rental and was amazed at how clean everything was and all the random items she supplies. It was like having a small grocery store in your house. Snacks, water, and random house goods were provided. About 30 minutes after our arrival, the AC/HEAT went out. Immediately, an HVAC person was called, but they were not able to fix the problem during our stay, but Stacey did everything possible to make sure we were comfortable during our stay. I don't have one single complaint about the stay and will be staying again without hesitation. Give it a shot. You will NOT be disappointed in any way."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great organized home. Loved my stay.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Stacey’s place was by far the best airbnb or Vrbo we have ever stayed in!! It was spotless and full of snacks and anything and everything we needed! It felt like home as soon as we walked in and I wish she owned houses all across the US! She should train others how to be organized and very hospitable! We loved it and even loved the quails in the yard!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy and clean! Stacey is an amazing hostess! We will return.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We only stayed for one night for a softball tournament but it was perfect for what we needed. Nice, clean and comfy. We were so happy they already had coffee at the house so we didn’t have to go out searching for it that morning. Thanks!"

She had everything we needed and more. She won my college daughter over with snacks on the kitchen table. It felt like home. I highly recommend this air b n b.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stacey's place was perfect for our college visit to Elon University. We were close to campus but had plenty of space to spread out in a clean, comfortable duplex.

Stacey is so sweet she has the cutest little nic-nacks around the house and she has just about ANYTHING you think of in there to accommodate your stay as little as hair clips so if forgot something at home, no worries, I promise you Miss Stacey has you covered. There are soooo many unique wonderful things we enjoyed about our stay and Miss Stacey that we can't name them all. House is emaculate, beds are comfy. EVERYTHING is labeled so no searching for things here. Excellent stay"

Stacey ALWAYS goes above and beyond to make you feeling at home."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stacey goes above and beyond as a host! We were treated like family from the moment we reserved her place until after we departed. This duplex is located in a great neighborhood in Burlington- lovely, private, peaceful and safe. We were picking up our son from Elon and this was a perfect location, only about a 12 minute drive! We had parking in a private driveway, the keypad was super easy to access, and we entered a comfortable, clean house that felt like home away from home. There were snacks in a basket on the kitchen table that was already set for a meal, new drink bottles for us to keep with a hand written welcome note, a wonderful spacious family room, two very comfortable bedrooms and 2 full baths. There are also family games, dvd's and toys for children, and Stacey's communication was exceptional! She is so friendly, responds to messages immediately and made us feel so welcome.

She has thought of every detail in the condo, from black makeup towels to coasters on the nightstands to a list of where to find things on the fridge. The place was immaculately clean and well-stocked, as well as very comfortable. We will recommend it to all of our family for future visits. I also appreciated that there weren’t onerous cleaning requirements so we could just take our stuff and go (other airBnBs we’ve had to get up extra early to make sure we had time to sweep, do breakfast dishes, etc. before leaving for the airport). Overall it was an excellent, stress-free experience."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"My daughter and I stayed at Stacey's place for a visit to Elon University. We were blown away by Stacey's hospitality and the way she has literally thought of everything a guest might need. We especially appreciated the bountiful snack bowl, unscented laundry detergent and portable air filter, but other guests will be delighted with other things. Decor is beyond charming and really makes the apartment feel like home. This is a special place where you want to stay and recharge, and we only wished we'd booked another night!

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stacey’s house is perfect, cozy and so accommodating for adults and teens! Only wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy all her accommodations, explore the garden and meet them in person!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed in Stacey's place in Burlington, This is a 5-star location with great detail and cleanliness. Best Airbnb that I have stayed at to date.
Thanks!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We have stayed in a lot of AirBnBs, but this one blows the others away. Stacey’s attention to detail is second to none. Comfy beds, room to stretch, well-stocked (an understatement!), and little touches that made it feel more like being at home than staying in someone else’s rental. My only complaint is that we usually have too many people with us when traveling through the area to Al be able to stay again! Every bit of 5 (and even more) stars!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything was so smooth and easy here. The cleanest stay I’ve ever had, everything you could possibly need was there, and the host was unbelievably responsive. Would definitely stay here again."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stacey is an incredible host. The house has everything you could possibly need and more. Even including delicious snacks and thoughtful extras throughout the home. The space was super comfortable and CLEAN! We can not wait to return.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Highly recommend 10/10. Home away from home. Stacey is amazing.
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,Finally someone who gets clean! Adorably decorated and has everything you may think you need! I would highly recommend this place! Stacey is very kind and helpful!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stacey has put together a cozy and welcoming place. Her extra touches and thoughtful organization make this a perfect stay. The area is very nice and quiet too. Rent from Stacey with confidence.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic place to stay when visiting Elon! We’ll be back! Again lol
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Always a pleasure staying
5 stars ⭐️"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stacey and her place offer the very best airbnb experience, and virtually the best lodging experience, I've had in 50-some years of life. Her hospitality is unmatched. Just one example: Upon learning we'd be in town for my daughter's Elon graduation, she decked out the inside and outside of the home with festive graduation decorations. (She said she'd had them around already, but it was nevertheless clear that she put a lot of time and effort into their placement and display.)
This was my second time staying at Stacey's place (the first being in Feb 2020 with 4 other people), and both stays were fabulous. Stacey is extraordinarily communicative, warm and responsive and goes out of her way to make herself available to guests. You really get the feeling that this running this home is a labor of love. Her pride in hosting is apparent at every turn.
The home is super comfy, beautifully decorated, and stocked to the gills. A/C was responsive and it was easy to keep the home at a comfortable temperature despite record heat wave during my visit. (A prior visit, in February 2020, offered perfect comfort during heat season as well.) I slept like a log in the comfortable bed, which I believe had been replaced since my prior visit. Stacey and her family are right next door.
Stacey has innumerable thoughtful touches throughout and the unit comes stocked with anything you might've forgotten--toiletries (not just a basic shampoo/conditioner but a huge variety of hair, skin, facial products from which to choose if you've left anything at home), first aid items, kitchen staples, a picnic basket & cooler, you name it. (Prefer Keurig to drip coffee? or vice-versa? Stacey has you covered either way!) She has provided all kinds of helpful instructions and labels around the house to assist with locating anything you might want or need, figuring out how to use wifi/TV, etc. She has seemingly thought of everything. One thing which may seem small but which I really appreciated was how clearly the house # is marked out front. No wondering if you've come to the right place upon check-in or when returning, exhausted and bleary-eyed, to go to bed for the night, as is so often the case with other private rental homes.
I availed myself of the umbrella table on the back deck (with view of her well-tended garden and a cute little herb container garden by my back door), fully stocked kitchen for preparing breakfast, the cooler for keeping drinks cool during scorching graduation day weather and packing up for move-out the next day, and a great assortment of welcoming snacks that greeted me when I walked into the house.
The living room TV is a nice size and offered a great selection of streaming channels, which was comforting when I ended up traveling unexpectedly solo on this trip and was afraid I too might end up missing my daughter's graduation and holed up with covid myself (which thankfully didn't come to pass!). I didn't use these, but there was a very nice looking laundry setup and TV in the bedroom as well, along with DVDs, games & books in the living room.
This time, I ended up having the place to myself after covid and other health problems prevented other family members from joining me. When she heard my spouse had stayed home with covid and that I was quarantining for my first day in town just to be on the safe side, she gave comforting reassurances about why I probably wouldn't get it, then kindly delivered a 4-pack of covid tests to my door.
Bottom line: I can't say enough about how awesome Stacey is. If you're someone who's into super fancy/formal, and don't plan to use a kitchen or laundry at all, I suppose a hotel might be a better bet for you. Or if you know you'll need to be in walking distance of campus or some other specific locale, then this isn't the place for you. Otherwise, I can't think of any reason to stay anywhere else on your next visit to Burlington, especially for parties of 2-5."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Five stars all around. This Airbnb is definitely one of the nicest we’ve stayed in. The descriptions are accurate. Stacey is lovely. The house is clean and I doubt you’ll ever find one more equipped with extras. We will be back whenever we visit our daughter at Elon (which is a mere 15 minute drive away). Thank you Stacey!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My friends and I had A FABULOUS stay at Stacey's. she has everything you need and more!! I love all the details, thoughtful notes, and the accommodations were PERFECTION!!! We will definitely be staying here again in the future!!! Until next year......THANK YOU again!!!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the best host and Airbnb I've found.

We will always try to book this Airbnb first when visiting the Burlington area. Hands down FIVE STARS!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stacey's place was perfect. She has absolutely everything you need plus thoughtful extras. House is very clean and comfortable, and communication with Stacey is seemless. We will definitely stay again when travelling through the area!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a must stay Airbnb! I’ve never had a more pleasant stay. Stacey treats you like her personal houseguest. Everything you need is there. She even provided delicious snacks since we arrived so late at night. Beautiful comfortable and clean!

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Always 100% perfection
Couldn’t ask for a better host and a perfect place to stay
Had an awesome Easter dinner with my son and his roommate and as always Stacey came through as a gracious host"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfection. The location, communication, and booking were all seamless. The house was incredible- everything you could have wanted was there. Wonderful all around - extremely clean, quiet, and comfortable. Highly recommend!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stacey's property has everything you need and more! It felt like home away from home. My daughter and I were in town for just one night to tour Elon University. The location was perfect. We were both able to get a good night's rest in comfortable beds. The house was clean and in a nice, quiet little neighborhood. Stacey's communication was clear and thoughtful. If we return to the area, I will definitely look to stay again. Thank you:)"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stacey’s home is what every Airbnb experience should be like! From communication, hospitality, amenities and charming home, this was such a great experience! I stayed with my son and his friend who were both looking at Elon University- it was close and convenient. Comfortable, clean, friendly and safe- you can’t get any better- thank you!!"
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,The house was great the host was very responsive to messages
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"All I can say is wow. Stacey made sure our experience would be everything and it was. The little touches such as the welcoming touches, snacks, already cold glasses, and etc. was very thoughtful. The location is also beautiful. We will definitely be back!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow! Stacey’s place has it all! Cozy beds, full kitchen, laundry, and all the extra comforts one could ask for! And by far the most organized (and labeled) Airbnb we’ve stayed at. We’d love to visit again!"

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay! It has everything a family would need when traveling. Stacey the host is very responsive and her communication, excellent."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stacey's place is absolutely amazing and it just seems to get better every time I stay here. Very comfortable and quiet. Full of amenities. You could probably show up with nothing and be absolutely content. This is my favorite place to stay in Burlington and I wish it were always available. I plan my trips around openings for this Airbnb and it only seems to be getting harder to book as she is such an excellent host with an amazing property and now everyone knows about it. Great communication throughout and such a unique gem. Couldn't recommend this place more.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stacey’s attention to detail is spectacular. Her place is adorable and just as described. The snacks were a great extra. We would definitely stay here again. I’ve stayed at a lot of airbnbs and this is at the top of the list for awesomeness! 😊
2022-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,Had a great stay. Stacey is a great host. ! I’m a return customer and will be again.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome host

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very easy to work with!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was the BEST airBNB that I have ever
stayed in. It was cleaner than a five star
hotel and the attention to detail and the
comfort of her guests was beyond all
expectations. Stacey was fantastic!! This
is a must stay at place. Definitely in my
favorites list if I am ever back in that part of the country."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stacey is a wonderful host and her place is perfect! So clean, comfortable and quiet. It was just what I needed for the week. I liked that it was in a very quiet area, but still so convenient to a lot of restaurants and shopping.
I really enjoyed everything about my stay and I can’t think of a single negative thing to say about my week there!
Thanks again Stacey"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our favorite place to stay while visiting Elon. From the snacks, to the well stocked kitchen-you have all of the comforts of home! Everything is so comfortable here! Thanks again. We’ll be back!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stacey is an excellent host! I was in the area to visit my daughter at Elon University and enjoyed Stacey's comfy, clean, and quiet BNB very much. Wonderful amenitites, comfortable beds, full kitchen and laundry. Very quiet, private, and comfortable. Highly recommend this AirBNB!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"A five star rating is not enough!! Stacey and her home deserve a 10 star rating!! This home is fantastic! It is located in a lovely area, close to town but also close to highway access. It is very clean, well taken care of, and full of all the extra details that make a house a home. Stacey is a PHENOMENAL host!! She has the home stocked with all the things you might have forgotten. She was very helpful and willing to answer questions about the area. Stacey even took the time to send well wishes for my children on the competition we were in town to attend. Her thoughtfulness was overwhelming. If you have the opportunity, stay here!!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This 2 BR, 2 BA place is great. Stacey was so accommodating. Tons of extra niceties like keurig pods, small snacks and water bottles to grab on the go, etc. This was a terrific experience."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stacey's place is by far the best Airbnb available. I will always choose it first when visiting the area. Everything was exactly as promised, but with extra unexpected amenities and surprises! We loved this place."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stacey is a fantastic host. This place had everything we could imagine to be comfy and feel welcome -- pampered, even! I love this home and will always choose it first when traveling to Burlington.
She has labeled everything for ease of access; no guesswork! Also there were so many extra items and thoughtful gestures that were really nice. Our stay there was positively stress free and enjoyable!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Stacey’s place was perfect for my family as we were passing through on a long drive to Georgia. As Airbnb host myself, I was surprised to a perfect 5 star rating with as many reviews as she had, but she’s earned it! Her space was clean, very well stocked with everything you could need: food items, various shampoos and soaps, games, toys, laundry detergent, first aid kits, etc. she literally thought of everything, and she went through the trouble to label where everything is and left little notes for instructions on certain things too so nothing is difficult to find or figure out! We definitely recommend this place!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is very neat and clean. In a quiet neighborhood too. It is a duplex so have to be a little careful with the noise if you have children. But it is well stocked with all you would need for however long you may stay. Even has a few toys for children if you need. Beds are very comfortable! We had a very pleasant stay here over a weekend.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful place to stay—tastefully decorated and immaculately clean. Rooms are spacious and Stacey, the host, is friendly and helpful. Couldn’t be better."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,She is a great host. She's VERY considerate and has everything planned out to a t. You can tell she does it because she loves it. My friends and I shad a great time & the place felt like home.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stacey’s place was wonderful, providing a fabulous Airbnb experience. Stacey’s communication was exceptional, her place was clean and well stocked. The bedding was super comfortable, and the bathroom linen was super fresh.
This is definitely a 5 star experience, and I can clearly see why Stacey is a super host! I definitely recommend her place.
Thanks Stacey for providing a fabulous stay!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stacey's offering is why hotel chains all across the country are lobbying to restrict and limit Air BnBs. They can't compete or come close to the same experience that one gets when staying in a lovely, well maintained home. Stacey's condo is one of the most well maintained and stocked homes that we've ever had the pleasure of renting. You won't need a thing while staying here. You'll forget that you're on vacation because she has taken the effort to make your experience more like home. We will definitely return."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Stacey's place was great - it was very comfortable and had everything you could need! Our kids loved it - there were a few toys and it was decorated for Christmas with a tree and everything. Very homey, clean and convenient - would definitely stay again!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location, Very Clean, Everything you will need Is at your finger tips, comfortable beds and the hot water is the hottest!!!!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,This was such a comforting and beautiful home! Stacey has everything you can think of already provided for a warm and welcoming stay. She was such a kind and thoughtful host!! Will definitely give this overall experience a 10 out of 10!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"By far one of the best ABNB experiences I’ve had! Stacey is awesome, friendly and super accommodating! Her place is great and she has thought of everything to make your stay perfect. Hope to return soon! 5 stars across the board! ⭐️"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,Stacey is truly a superhost!
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,Best Airbnb ever! Everything you need and more. Such a kind host.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Stacey's place is simply the best! She is more than accommodating, and her love of her home and hosting is evident in every detail of the space. I would love to stay again!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Stacey was wonderful. She had the place stocked with anything you would need. She was very helpful, and friendly. We were very happy with everything. The only thing that wasn't perfect is the master bedroom bed was very soft and we are used to a very firm mattress, but that could have just been a matter of preference. Even on that, Stacey worked with me to try flipping the mattress. You won't have a nicer, more thoughtful host anywhere."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best stay we have ever had. We have been to BnBs in FL, Louisiana, Texas, and various places in the Carolinas. This place had a home feel with everything you need. I personally like to travel with food and stay in to eat, and I had everything I needed to make meals. Plenty of fun things in the Air BnB, and the surrounding area is beautiful. I have run in various places around the globe and Burlington is definitely top 3."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,perfect!!!!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful host who is very thoughtful about the needs of travelers.

We have done many, being retired, and this was certainly one of the best."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything you need for your stay will be there. A lot of notes left around the house that explains how to operate various appliances as well, so there will be little need for communication with the host during your stay."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Stacey has gone above and beyond to make her AirBNB feel like home away from home. Communication from Stacey was excellent and all the extras were awesome.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a fantastic stay in Burlington. Karen and all the hosts were super responsive and very friendly. Second the house is spacious, clean and very nice. It’s like new. Would definitely stay again when in town."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. The location was great and the house was perfect for our group. Described and looked like the pictures. Thank you for allowing us to stay.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Thank you so much for hosting me at your wonderful place! I had a fantastic stay and truly appreciated all the thoughtful touches and your hospitality.

2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Great location fairly close to Elon University- about 7-10 minutes. Perfect location for family to gather for graduation.
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,"The house was lovely…clean, spacious and nicely decorated. Just a few small things…we arrived late at night and there were no lights on the house so it was difficult to see the house number. Would recommend leaving the outside light on. The key was inside a lockbox. The instructions were not clear on how to retrieve the key. Finally, the lock on the doorknob is the only lock. We would have felt more safe if there had been a deadbolt or at the very least a a second lock in the inside."

We would definitely stay here again! We highly recommend!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Well appointed, very spacious, in a great location, for visiting our son and his family."

I would recommend this house to anyone looking for a nice place stay while in town.

Plenty of room

Thanks for sharing your home with my team again.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,awesome hosts. Everything was exactly what we needed. would recommend for any reason to stay.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I would like to Thank Otto & Fanny for creating an amazing space for me to feel relaxed and at ease. The place was easy to find. The home was beautiful and smelled amazing!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed staying in this home. Nice neighborhood with neighbors out walking. Great restaurants less then 5 minutes away. Quick communication with host. Extremely spacious. We'll definitely be back when in the area!
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful house and lots of space for the family to spread out and come together! When we come back to visit family in Mebane we'll definitely be back if it's available.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"excellent location and very quiet neighborhood, 100% recommended"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"There are not a lot of options in Burlington for a 4 Bedroom house w/ more than 2 bathrooms & this house worked out really well and we would possibly rent again. The location of the house to Elon Univ and our wedding festivities for the weekend was perfect. The home is also located close to various grocery & shopping. The home was fairly clean but there are definitely areas in which cleaning could be better. Similar to other reviews, we also encountered dirty dishes/pots/pans in the kitchen along with musty smelling towels. Nothing was insurmountable, just slightly inconvenient as we had to wash them all before using. We notified the host of the issues and they offered to send a cleaning crew over but we declined as it was a busy weekend and again, we could toss all in to a washer prior to using or wipe other areas. The shared driveway is tough to park in, yard needs work (but park close by) and the only thing that really needs to be done is deadbolts for the doors."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our stay was AMAZING! Worth every penny we spent. The rooms were clean and spacious. This place was perfect for a family of five. We had communal spaces but enough space to have our own quiet time. Check in and check out were super easy. It was in a fantastic location close to my relatives and Elon University. Otto and Fanny and Sonia were responsive and easy to work with. They got back to you right away. I would definitely stay at this location again. Thank you for an incredible experience!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place looked sketchy from the outside but the inside was great. Clean, modern, well stocked. Would rent this place again."

2023-06-01,5,Group trip,I love this place! Whenever I come back I will try booking again. The host was amazing. My guests and I felt very comfortable. Unlike most airbnbs we had privacy!

2023-05-01,4,Group trip,"This house is in a beautiful neighborhood with great access for walking and enjoying the local Arboretum. There were four bedrooms and three full bathrooms as described which worked great for our group of 6! The house is beautiful! We did plan to use the kitchen quite a bit and found that many of the pots/pans were dirty, and there were limited essential cooking items available (no oil/cooking spray, only one dish towel, no dish soap). We were also missing wash cloths. Overall the stay was good and communication with the co-host great!"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Another great stay. The master shower is amazing. Will definitely book again. Felt rite at home.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I visit this area often and I enjoyed Karen’s space and location. The place was clean and everything easy to find. This will be my location if available when I stay in NC.
2023-02-01,4,Group trip,Great home for a lager group traveling. Parking however was not good. Shared driveway with a lot of damage. We left a welcome mat for the homeowner as we did not want to ruin those beautiful hardwood floors. We would definitely stay there again

We often come to see family in Burlington and we would definitely choose this place again. Thank you"

2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"No complaints about the home it was absolutely beautiful, my family didn’t want to wake up this morning very comfortable beds. Thank you for having things for my kids at arrival. Close to food, gym, nice area to walk in, stores are close by. Convenient for me because it’s in between the hospital and my mom 5 min from my cousins home so the kids weren’t bored. Great communication home had everything we needed. I’m also an interior designer and also home remodeling. Nice lay out and decor. I will be staying here again! Thanks again"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I loved Otto and Fanny’s place ! This home is even more beautiful than in the photos ! Wonderful quiet neighborhood with a walking trail /arboretum nearby! Everything about this home is warm and inviting ! It is well equipped with everything you would need for your stay and was more than enough space for everyone ! The master suite is gorgeous ! Each bedroom and bathroom have their own special touch that makes it feel homey. Also , I’m big on smell so I do have to point out that the home smelled so good, and each room had its own scent which I truly enjoyed. I will definitely look to stay here again next time we are in town , and would recommend it to anyone ! Matter of fact I already have let a family member from out of state know about it so that she might consider it for her next trip to Burlington ! Thank you Otto and Fanny !"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Otto and Fanny are great hosts! We stayed here from July 31-August 7th. Check-in was breeze-they even gave us an early check in time which was greatly appreciated. Historical neighborhood near a beautiful arboretum! Ample parking-driveway is a little rough but we parked on the side of the house with no issues. The entrance to the home is magnificent! Absolutely gorgeous with its open floor plan-pictures don't do it justice! The rooms are big and airy. Otto and Fanny had the AC on when we arrived and it was just right. Most comfortable couch in the world-with a pretty street view. The neighborhood is so pretty-many historic homes, mature trees, many breeds of birds, and also nice and quiet at night. Friendly people everywhere! TV channels are endless. Bathrooms were well-stocked and had general supplies available such as soaps, lotions, and air fresheners. Huge walk-in closets-not too many hangers but plenty of shelf space and drawers in some rooms. Plenty of seating at the table-comfortable chairs. Laundry room has all that you need. Kitchen-kuddos kuddos kuddos!! Loved this kitchen-had plenty of counter space, extra snacks and goodies, big microwave, electric stove-not a fan but it worked very well-, nice and clean refrigerator, toaster, coffee maker, and plenty of dishes along with a compact dishwasher. The utility closet has some essential household items such as a broom, vacuum, etc.. Upstairs the 2 bedrooms and 1 bath were perfect. Only one bath tub located upstairs. We didn't use the backyard but it was cozy-had a hammock, a barbecue grill, and plenty of grass. I have to say that the gorgeous windows in the home just lit up the house! One of our favorite things about the house was the cleanliness-everything had its place and the decor was beautiful. The hardwood floors are simple gorgeous! Nice and cool! Otto and Fanny responded right away-with 10 minutes-each time I had a question. Impressive!!! Check-out was a breeze. Unlike many other AirBnB's, Fanny and Otto have simple instructions for check-out-not 100 different things for you to do lol. We loved our stay! Enjoyed a few days at the house just sitting around and relaxing! I would definitely recommend Otto's and Fanny's place! We'll return to North Carolina again soon and hope to stay here again. Fanny and Otto, thanks again for hosting our family!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was so beautiful! Amazing stay for our vacation my family loved it !
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a cute house! Spacious and comfortable. Definitely hope to stay here the next time we are in town!
2022-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,everything was great. some things could be improved such as exchanging the inflatable bed for a normal bed. I laid down and 15 minutes later I was on the floor 😅 cleaning was good but could be better with small detailing. also the washing machin was extremely slow so I had to leave washing over night to dry in the morning. communication was great. Fanny and Otto made sure we were taken care of while staying there.
2022-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful location on the most charming street. Communication was great and house was easy to access. Overall we enjoyed our stay, but the house missed the mark on a few cleanliness items."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The house was exactly what we needed for a weekend baseball tournament at Elon. The large living area was perfect for entertaining and the kitchen countertop space was fabulous for buffet dinners. The larger area meant our dogs weren't underneath our feet at all times, which was great. House was immaculate when we arrived. Linens were clean and plentiful. Air conditioning worked really well. When we asked for a grill, Otto produced it within less than 24 hours already assembled and ready to rock. Neighborhood is absolutely adorable and only 5 minutes from the heart of Elon's campus and the sports facilities. Would recommend to all."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Quiet neighborhood with a great place to walk nearby. Very comfortable bed and great kitchen. It has plenty of room. Our host was quick to respond.
