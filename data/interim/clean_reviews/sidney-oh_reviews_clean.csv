2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was a wonderful visit. It provided us with space and comfort.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay would recommend and will stay again when in the area
2024-03-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"The floors were all slanted and soft, the refrigerator door wasn’t able to open all the way due to the warped floor. Stairs to the upstairs were pretty steep so if you’re handicapped or older, beware, beds were very hard, it’s an older house in an older neighborhood, we wouldn’t stay here again. If you’re looking for basic this place is for you"
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The house worked well for us as we visited family nearby. Must keep in mind that it is an old house, but the furnishings are up to date and it is clean and pleasant. Would stay here again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice place to stay with my family while traveling. Plenty of space for all of us!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The owner was very responsive. I accidentally put the wrong number of visitors on the initial reservation and they did not get upset and even let us check in a little earlier. That was truly a blessing because we were coming off a 6hr drive. Thank you for your kindness as well as a place that felt like home. We will, when in town, be utilizing this place again. God bless!!!

2022-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,Great space! Especially enjoyed the outside patio in the evenings. It was a perfect stay for our small family of 4 while we visited family in the area. Nothing like having a home base with a kitchen and living area while traveling.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I love coming back to the Lake Cottage! This time several sisters joined me on retreat and we had a peaceful, restful stay. We enjoyed local restaurants and the well-equipped kitchen for meals at the cottage; beautiful walks around the neighborhood and lake; excellent sleep in the cozy beds; and the perfect space for quiet times, prayerful conversation and fellowship. Highly recommend."

We had everything we needed in the kitchen to enjoy simple meals in and the setting was absolutely perfect for times of quiet reflection, conversation and prayer. We can't wait to come back!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super friendly hosts. Really appreciated the peace and quiet and privacy. Great area and location.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a great stay! Very cozy cottage that made me feel at home. Definitely will be back in the future!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Kayla was so helpful and quick to respond to any question or concern I had. She made the stay as seamless as possible!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,Had a great stay at the lake!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I have stayed in many AirBNB properties over the years and Kurt and Kayla's place ranks at the top! Kayla is such a considerate and responsive host - she truly has thought of everything. I felt comfortable, peaceful and right at home. I love to cook and brought some of my favorite tools and spices, but was pleasantly surprised by the well-stocked kitchen. This was an ideal spot for a writing retreat. I thoroughly enjoyed the beauty of walking and writing by the nearby lake at Blackberry Island. I loved that there were bikes, camping chairs and hammocks to borrow. I am looking forward to returning this winter for my annual new year retreat!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kayla is a fantastic host in all ways. Her attention to detail with in the home is amazing and her willingness to share ideas of things to do and respond is fantastic. I would highly recommend the cottage!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful cottage! Great place to get away and relax. Can't wait to go back.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for a peaceful escape, look no further. Kayla’s attention to detail has helped to create a place for respite and relaxation. Have a question? She is extremely responsive - the best I’ve experienced. My girls and I went over to Do Good Restaurant & Ministry in Osgood for breakfast. Not only was it yummy and a good deal, but we loved their mission. Popped up to Celina and Grand Lake St Mary. If you have kids, their accessible playground was fantastic (we also found some great deals at a thrift shop there!).. We were able to enjoy sunshine sparkling on the lake, curl up in front of the fireplace during the rain, and kick through the leaves on a walk around Blackberry Island. It was exactly what we needed. I hope that we will have the opportunity to return!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely little house. Clean and well-appointed. Thank you for a great stay. Loved the offer to use the bikes, hammocks and fire pit. Unfortunately, the weather and our plans did not allow us to take advantage of them, but would have been great."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful home and cozy place to stay
2023-10-01,3,Stayed with kids,"The cottage was VERY cute. Bedrooms tiny, but the beds were very comfortable & the living room/ kitchen were open and airy feeling. We had an issue with the water that I was told might “sometimes have an odor.” The sulfuric smell of the water was so pungent that we could not brush our teeth with it. I showered and was told by my family I smelled like rotten eggs… for 7 hrs! When I contacted Kayla she sent her husband out to treat the water, which he did. There was a bleach smell after that, but better than rotten eggs. I’m sure the issue will be permanently fixed before others are going to book and stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kayla and Kurt have created a beautiful space! The amenities are wonderful, we especially enjoyed being able to use the bikes. An afternoon reading in the hammock was enjoyable and a bonus amenity we hadn't planned to use. Their recommendations for local restaurants was spot on.
This is a great location to have a peaceful, private retreat from a busy life...but close to wonderful food & drinks. Highly recommend it for a space for couples to reconnect with one another and soak in the small space together!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is a great getaway. Beautifully decorated inside and out! Quiet neighborhood. Quaint little lakeside town. Can’t wait to come back for longer.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, neat, well supplied cottage in a gorgeous, peaceful setting. I would stay here again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love this cabin! We have made this a yearly trip now! Always a reasonable price for a quick fishing trip and a peaceful getaway. Thanks again for another great experience!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed multiple times at the cabin at the lake and have enjoyed our stays each time.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,we booked the cabin for the solar eclipse and it is as perfect!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect lake spot for our small 3 person family. Will definitely be using anytime we come to town.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice weekend away, loved the town of Minster and we'll be back!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"another beautiful stay at Martha’s place, amazing cabin"
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,It was a great place to stay for a Birthday Weekend getaway. There are beautiful lake views from the front windows! It was also a great change to have a small kitchen to cook in.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This property is beautiful, and by far the best airbnb experience i’ve had. Thanks Martha!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great value for a small cabin. My wife and I took our 1.5 year old and felt very cozy. There’s plenty of parks in the area. Even though there was 6 inches of snow on the ground for our visit, it was still a great time. Will be returning if we ever find ourselves back in the area!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute, quaint and quiet. There is a very nice river and park across the road also. We went in February so we couldn't really take advantage of this, but I am sure it is amazing during the nicer seasons."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable and nice stay
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely peaceful was extremely clean had everything you would need in the kitchen nice views of the lake out front and walking distance to the state park and restaurant
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful and relaxing cottage. Tastefully decorated, comfortable furniture with a wonderful deck and spectacular views of the lake. Martha is a great hostess who pays attention to the details. We will be back again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Comfortable cottage, near state park. Expansive inside such a small footprint. Everything you need!"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We are from North Carolina and had come to Minster for a family wedding in the area. Martha's was a perfect place for us to stay. It was close to the wedding venue yet felt like it was too rural to be close to anything - which we loved. We had a nice view of the lake and loved to go on the trail around the lake. The cottage was small and cozy. It had everything we needed, although maybe not everything we wanted, e.g. The kitchen has a refrigerator and stove, but no dishwasher or washing machine and dryer. The bathroom has a shower, but no bathtub; The bedroom has no closet or bureau, but there are plenty of hooks on the wall for your clothing. The best feature of the house as the living room. It was very spacious and had very plush, comfortable furniture. When we had a question about working the TV, Martha answered the phone immediately and was able to solver the problem right away."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"This cottage is exactly as you see in the pictures and you get some striking views across to the park. It is right - I mean right - on the road, but I loved that as well. It wasn't a terribly busy road - more like a park road. In my 1 night stay I didn't see any speeders, but there were bicycles, scooters, a school bus and even a golf cart. It was also harvest time so several tractors with grain wagons passed by. All fun to watch from the porch. All the living room furniture was the ""sink down deep"" type - which works for some, and not for others. Bring more coffee if you're a more than 1 cup a morning kind of person. There was only one thing that caused me to pause and that is the window coverings. They're cute and fit the lake theme, but offer zero privacy at night with any kind of lights on. Be prepared to be on display or change in the bathroom which did have a privacy blind. LOL. A great place appropriately priced."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay after being at the Eldora races all weekend! Very short drive and relaxing place!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This is our second stay at the cottage. We've also stayed at Martha's other location. Martha is kind and responsive.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute little cabin on the lake. The cabin was clean and check in was very easy. There is plenty of room for 3 adults even though the bathroom was a little on the small side. We were in town for the Dream at Eldora and it was only a 20 to 25 minute drive from the track which was awesome. We will definitely stay at Martha's place the next time we visit Eldora.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Will book this place again
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice cottage in a great location.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"My wife and I had a great stay. Would recommend. Our adult children stayed at the campground, and we stayed in the cabin. The cabin is very close to the state park, so we got to enjoy the camping experience but got to retreat to a cozy little cabin at the end of the day. Great little restaurant just down the road. (Morries) Enjoyed a great breakfast in the morning. Clean and cozy. Great view."

2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This rental was just what we wanted—a cozy little cabin next to a little lake—to celebrate our anniversary. The kitchen could be better stocked, although most guests probably don’t do as much cooking as we do, and there were the basics (pots, pans, cups, etc.)."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at the cabin on the lake was wonderful! It is so cute and was just what my husband and I needed for the weekend away. Highly recommend!

2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Water smells. Rear lighting where you park needs improved. Small bathroom with one little mirror on back of door
2022-09-01,4,Stayed one night,we'll keep this place in mind if we're in the area again...
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stop for the night. shower water smelled, but other than that it was a nice little spot. convenient location."

2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,A cute small plaxe to relax. Good communication and clean facility.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great weekend get away!!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This location is great, right across the street from Lake Loramie. The interior is well-decorated and clean, with a fully-stocked kitchen of pans and utensils. There are signs to help you identify the cabin and where to pull in for parking, which was very helpful. Overall we really enjoyed our stay.
One thing to be aware of is that the wooden blinds are a bit of a privacy concern. We noticed that at night if we had the lights on it was very easy to see inside from the outside, even for the bedroom. We notified the host and she may change the blinds, but until then make sure to change your clothes with the lights off at night"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Definitely an awesome little place for a quiet getaway. I highly recommend you check it out! The view was amazing as well.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Thanks for a great stay!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This house was a little small but perfect for just 2 people! It was very nice and just what we expected. The check in and check out were very easy and there were signs that helped us know where to go in and where to park.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, great little cottage! We always enjoy our stay!"
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful cabin, well maintained and very clean. I would have gave this stay a glowing review. I checked in at 1:00 pm on Friday with a noon checkout on Tuesday. Weather was beautiful, cabin was awesome then it happened…I met Martha. On Tuesday, our departure date, a storm rolled in. It was pouring rain and Martha shows up at 11:30am. A half hour PRIOR to our checkout time and wants to know if we are staying another night. We said no we were waiting on the rain to pass to take our stuff out. She keeps looking at her watch and says she needs to clean the cabin. I apologize because I was thinking I must have lost time and was late getting out. No, she was early and was upset we parked in the wrong place (next to the walkway by the house). She was very rude. So, do be a Superhost … you need to not meet and talk to Martha. If she hadn’t stopped and spoke, she would have gotten a glowing review from us."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We had such a peaceful night. the cabin is adorable with a great view of the lake! would recommend 👍👍
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Martha's place was perfect for our stay in Fort Loramie! A cute well maintained cottage right across the street from the lake, equipped with everything we needed for a comfortable stay. Very clean. Our favorite part was the deck and picnic table outside where we sat in the evening and enjoyed the peace and quiet. We would happily stay again anytime we're in the area!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The cabin was an absolute delight. Martha has thought of everything. I might just come alone sometime just to recharge my batteries. Very peaceful.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little cabin, plenty of room for me and 2 kids."
2022-06-01,4,Stayed one night,This cabin is so cute and right across from the lake. It was very clean! I would definitely stay again!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice little home near the lake.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely great little cabin to unwind in, completely redone inside with all the necessities! Comfy living room to set and relax in an evening.
We also enjoyed the outdoor space and setting right on the lake, to watch all the nature as well as the world pass by your front door!
Just down the road is Morries Landing, a great spot to have a bite, enjoy a beverage, and a morning cup of coffee!
Great location!"
2022-05-01,3,Stayed one night,The cabin was very nice. However it’s right on the road. Also the surrounding cabins are not very nice. The area definitely needs some love.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a beautiful little home and perfect for a weekend getaway.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot. Right across from the lake. Very clean and cozy. Has everything you need and then some.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great find. Very clean and well stocked. We enjoyed our stay here. Would recommend this place to others.

2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,It’s great
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Definitely recommend staying here it's a beautiful place and great location for a get away
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stayed for a day but the heat was already on when I got there and a clear space to park, beautiful little place, will probably return in the summer!"
2022-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"Such a beautiful place and exactly what I needed!
I don't suggest arriving after dark as parking is a little tricky!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Martha was a great host! Everything was as expected, clean, and the space was cozy. When we arrived the heater was already on to warm up the space and she even made sure where we parked was good for the car. Getting into the place was very straight forward and easy, as was the departure. She had a very simple list of what to do to check out making the process very easy."
2022-01-01,4,Stayed one night,"This was a quick overnight for us. Very clean and ultra cute cabin. We are considering downsizing when we retire so this was a good trial run for us. Hiccups in our stay were that there were no coffee grounds available. Not a huge deal, but we have been using Airbnb for many years and have grown accustomed to coffee being available, as we’ve never stayed where they didn’t provided the grounds or a keurig with various k cups. We went to a store and bought a tub of coffee. Other hiccups were not hearing back from messages through the app, tried to text via cell number on app but that was a wrong number, then found correct number on a business card and also on the welcome sheet. Before dinner wife wanted a shower but shower inexplicably stopped running after about two minutes, then started back after about 30 seconds, then back off. Messaged about it through app but never heard back. Finally got a message this morning after we had left. So, to sum up: really cute place def worth the cost, but def need these issues addressed."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot for a weekend get away. Cottage was cozy and just right.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"The cottage is lovely and in a fantastic location. Beautiful views of the lake. The pictures don’t do justice to the decor,it is so nicely decorated. The family room area and kitchen are spacious and comfortable and it was a very relaxing, pleasant stay. I will definitely come back. I had a few questions and the owner responded almost instantaneously. You couldn’t ask for better support."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute and quaint cabin with a good view! Great for a quick get away!
2021-12-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"I don’t have complaints about the airbnb except someone’s half eaten ice cream left there and the old used shampoo in the shower. The rest was pretty good. There was some difficulty checking in since Martha’s profile says you have to pick up a key at a motel down the road and it was shut down. Her phone number was disconnected so we could not reach her. We finally figured out the key was in the lockbox instead of the motel. She did tell me ahead of time the lockbox code, but did not correct that we did not have to go to a motel first to pick it up. It was a bit confusing and took us a few hours to figure out. Other than that the stay was good."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Adorable little cabin with everything we needed. We will stay again next time we are in the area. Thanks Martha!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cabin was so cute and cozy! My boyfriend and I stayed for a few days during thanksgiving week. It was beautiful and clean on the inside and had all we needed during our stay. It was extremely quiet and peaceful the whole time we were there. The view of the lake was amazing! Martha is a great host and we hope to stay here again in the near future! <3
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great cabin. Clean, nothing needed, all extras thought out. Good location to get to local trails at the State Park. Not many grocery stores around, so prepare for that. But the cabin was perfect. Thanks Martha!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect place for a getaway trip! The place looks even better than the pictures. I look forward to going back when it's warmer out to enjoy the beautiful nearby outdoors even more.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I really enjoyed our stay here. This place was very well kept and clean. The heater is fantastic. Since it was chilly outside we appreciated that. Check in was really easy. The only negative thing I have to say is that the shower and sink water had a really funky smell to it.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were very happy with our experience. Very clean and cozy. it was furnished with everything we needed, felt like home. Highly recommended."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,The view and close proximity to the park is wonderful. The cottage is very clean and comfortable and I love the seaside decor. Definitely would visit again.

2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice tiny cabin right on the lake. View and location were both great. Look for the sign out front - we missed it the first time we drove by but its clearly marked just look for it. Driveway is around back.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,I enjoyed my night in Martha's cabin. The view is very peaceful and relaxing. The cabin itself was exactly as described and had everything I needed. It was very clean and comfortable. Check-in was very easy. Thank you for a great stay!

2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great little place to stay
2021-09-01,4,Stayed one night,S
2021-09-01,3,Stayed one night,"We agree w other review that the bed is too small and uncomfortable—its definitely smaller than queen, prob full, and two people will find themselves sinking toward each other to the middle all night (my wife and I are well below the average combined weight of a US couple). That said, most everything else was at par with the price, though there are other residences that are very close to this one that are very lacking in curb appeal. Prob worth it for those who can sacrifice a good night of sleep."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,awesome sunsets and sunrise beautiful cabin clean with all necessities and it was a perfect spot and wait to stat again
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great little place. Perfect location close to the water and campground. Restaurant, bait shop and ice cream shop also very close by. AC was very cold. Easy self check in. Would stay here again. Thank you!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nicely decorated. All new stuff. Super clean. Comfy.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,5 - star stay to celebrate our anniversary! It is a quaint little place right across the street from the lake. Had everything that we needed.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cute and clean cottage. We enjoyed sitting on the porch looking at the lake and relaxing. Next trip down we will bring bikes since that is a popular activity here. It is very close to several trails and beach. Thanks Martha!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location! Very Very clean! It was the perfect size for 2 of us.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Was nice ! If you’re looking to just relax.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect accommodations, very cute decor beautiful view of lake in AM. spacious and open floor plan. Clean and Comfortable!! Martha was kind and nice to us! recommended as 5 star."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great
2021-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,great for the price we had to leave early due to it being a handful with a child. the cabin isn't very child friendly too many open wires from lamps doors open at a tiny tap when closed all the way... alot of glass decor... otherwise great just wish air bnb would make better decisions when I filter child friendly cabin.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We were very happy with our stay at this Lake Loramie cottage. It was clean and had everything we needed for our short stay. The trickiest part is making sure you take the correct driveway to get to the cottage.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect little cottage with beautiful lake views! We can’t wait to come back next year.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent stay. Had a nice time fishing and it is a well decorated cabin.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed Martha's Cottage so much. It is very nicely decorated with a Lake theme. It is so nice to wake up and see the water. We had out coffee on the bench in the front and watched the ducks, then went for a walk out on a small jetty right into the lake. While the living room is bigger than expected- as others mentioned the bed and bathroom are a bit snug for 2 people- but we managed. The cottage is separated from the lake by the main park road- we waved to joggers and bikers and boaters as they went by. We really enjoyed ourselves and would recommend the cottage to others."
2021-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"Very cute, clean and comfortable. There was some road noise but I would stay there again."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful clean cottage, great location to park, fishing, local bars/restaurants - will be back!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, well decorated cabin. It was clean and very comfortable. Even though I am pretty familiar with the area, I had a little trouble finding the road to the back of the cabin for parking. Other than that tiny glitch, which was no one’s fault, we had a lovely stay. We would definitely stay there again!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect for 2 people! Super cute! Great view of Lake Loramie. Clean, comfy and cozy."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"A cute little cabin right across from the lake! Simple, taseful and very clean accommodations. Quiet, picturesque location. The road in front has a 35 mph speed limit and traffic was not bothersome. I found a little road in the back so I could park behind the cottage. Had a couple of lovely walks at the lake. Great stay."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very well kept cabin in a great location. Would suggest brining bikes if possible, some things just a touch too far to walk but not really worth driving either so bike would have been helpful. Cute place."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful property with great views of the lake off the front porch. Clean, cold A/C, and comfortable couch and chairs. Quaint little home for a weekend getaway. We enjoyed out stay."

2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely beautiful stay. Very homey and inviting, had everything we needed for a romantic getaway. Woke up and had breakfast right on the patio overlooking the lake. Will definitely be coming back and would most definitely recommend!"
2021-05-01,4,Stayed one night,This cottage was the perfect set up for a quick stay for a work retreat. I enjoyed my stay. The only negative was the busy road and I was unaware of how to park behind the cottage until a few hours into my stay. I think having instructions for that would be a good idea. Thank you for the great place to stay.
2021-05-01,4,Stayed one night,It was a really cute place with a great location.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very quaint little cabin, with a beautiful view of the lake across the street. It is a perfect little getaway for an individual or couple."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great place to come for a quiet couple away trip. The sunlight comes in through the windows in the morning making it a great place to read a book.

2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute and clean, was a nice weekend getaway for my partner and I! The cottage had everything we needed and the lake was beautiful. We were a little closer to other residences than we would have liked and were woken up by the sounds of farm equipment. All in all we would visit again. We also checked out a local coffee shop set inside an old bank which had great coffee and breakfast!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute small cottage right by the lake.
2021-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Lake loramie its self lacks a little luster, but this beautifully decorated, squeaky clean cabin makes up for it plus some! Perect for a couple😊"
2021-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed the location being by river, lake and park. The stylish decor in the unit looks pretty in photos however there is no place to put your luggage or personal items. We had trouble opening the recliner. There are hidden pull handles tucked down between the seat cushions and arms. We enjoyed having a walk by the river and going to the park."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful little cabin
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect for a weekend getaway and Wapakoneta is only ~30 minutes away. Explore nature and then enjoy some downtown museums and antique stores!

2020-11-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Very cozy and cute cottage, had a few issues with the water and roaches that lead to an overall underwhelming stay. Once the issues get fixed it’ll be a very nice place to stay though. Martha was very understanding about the problems"

2020-10-01,4,Stayed one night,Great little spot clean cozy and close to lake
2020-10-01,2,Stayed one night,"The cabin is quite pretty and quaint and there is a beautiful view of the lake. We found there to be a very bad roach problem when we were there once night fell. We were forced to throw away a lot of food that had been on the counter and uproot our stuff mid stay. Martha did communicate with us quickly and offered us a room at her hotel in town to stay in more sanitary conditions. After a tense conversation we were issued a refund. The cabin is a lovely place and while we will not be returning, as long as the exterminator is called in, this place is lovely and a great value.
Also, please be aware that almost no one in this town or area is observing covid-19 precautions. We were the only people masked or keeping distance in the stores/picking up takeout from restaurants. Employees were not masked anywhere we went either."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice and clean. Great being on the lake.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Martha’s place is excellent. I have stayed a couple times and always have a great stay.

2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage is perfect for a simple, cozy getaway! It has a great view of the lake from the kitchen window!

2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great little cabin
2020-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is cute and cozy! Perfect for a couple. Breakfast is not included, but you can fix it yourself or drive up the road to buy it. I was disappointed that the cabin was so close to the road. Nice view of the lake!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place, hosted by awesome people!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We've stayed in more than a few Airbnbs and this place is one of the cleanest we've seen! Everything is as described and if you're a fan of organization you NEED to see this place. I learned a few tricks from how the hosts laid things out in the kitchen and bathroom! This was a fine stay!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,I had a great stay.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lisa was great host that was very responsive helpful. We had a great time and enjoyed this super clean and comfortable home.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay there, it was calm, cozy,safe and felt just like home. We went to see eclipse and downtown was like 5 min drive and was a beautiful place to eat and hangout. Lisa was very helpful throughout. We highly recommend her place."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"this was a really convenient stay to where we were, I'd recommend it to anyone staying in the area."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is a vintage jewel. We are blessed to have gotten to meet Lisa and she is warm and very friendly. We had a 90 year old and a 77 year old and the were delighted to be there and very comfortable . The beds sleot beautifully.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,very nice accommodations
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I’ve stayed at 5 AirBnBs in the past 6 months and Lisa’s Vintage Jewel apartment was by far the best! Lisa was very responsive and friendly, and she has gone the extra mile to make her guests feel right at home. The decor’ was lovely, the furnishings plush… nice bedding and luxurious towels. Extra amenities and quality products provided were the types of things I would buy for my own home. The kitchen was extremely well outfitted with utensils, dishes, mixing bowls, pans and appliances for preparing meals, as well as providing cooking supplies like oil, pancake mix, syrup, coffees, teas, spices and condiments to name a few!
The apartment was quiet and the neighborhood safe. This was a delightful experience and a place and host that will be my first choice for future visits to Piqua. Well done Lisa!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Place is nice, in a quiet neighborhood, and Lisa is awesome!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Book this place before someone else does. It’s great!
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"The property was everything as advertised, spacious, well furnished and private. Piqua is a small town, we weren't expecting a lot of activities, if the related question is not included, it would be a perfect score. The property was perfect for our family of 7 for a weekend to attend a wedding in Piqua. We wish we had an extra day to enjoy the outdoor grilling area."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"This is a very inviting home that is well equipped. It was spacious, nicely decorated, clean, and comfortable. It had a beautiful kitchen along with a very nice outside area. The host was very organized, available, and helpful. We highly recommend this property. You will not be disappointed!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,The place was spacious and private and perfect for our family outing. Mary and Tim were responsive and helpful and a pleasure to meet. We had a great time and would recommend
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I loved our stay at Mary’s home. She was an amazing host who checked in on us and helped us with what we needed. She was flexible with our schedule as well, which was incredibly helpful for us. Her home and property was beautiful, clean, and peaceful. We would love to come back again."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"What a wonderful stay!! We were in town for a family wedding at the Buckeye Barn and Mary’s place was the perfect place for our family and friends to stay. We had 80 year olds 50 year olds a twenty something and a teen and the wide open layout, lots of places to sit and hangout and everything on one level or one simple step made it perfect for our group!! Mary was very responsive to my questions leading up to our visit! Piqua too is a lovely town. If we are in the area again we would definitely stay here! Oh and did I mention the pool table and the outdoor pavilion, fire pit and swing. Be careful using gps to get there—it sends you to the wrong address. Trust the address and Mary’s instructions! Highly recommend this place!!!"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"Excellent stay. Comfortable, large, and quiet! Loved it and will stay again. Thanks"
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,I love the place so much space. Mary was very helpful. Her house was very beautiful loved her kitchen. For sure going back again
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,Today is my birthday and I wanted somewhere not too far spacious and comfortable for the weekend. Mary’s place just stuck out to me and the house was better than I expected. She was very helpful and responsive. Tim also was very helpful and a great soul to speak with. Everything about the house was beautiful and with the weather we were also able to enjoy the fire pit that Tim assisted us with thankfully! But I was so overjoyed and satisfied with everything the whole weekend. I was sad to go. My whole weekend was everything and more because of this house. And I thank you both for being so gracious in letting it be my home for the weekend because it definitely felt like home! I loved it!
2024-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We had a few issues with the heat and the water not working but they were very responsive and took care of the issue when it happened. Mary was very accommodating and worked with our traveling schedule. We really appreciated her attention to detail.
We would stay at this place again."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This Home was immaculate and looked just like the photos. We loved having a big beautiful kitchen with everything in it!! This was our 1’st Family Xmas together that included my 2 children, 3 grandchildren and 1 great grandson. It was perfect in every way. Or course Grandma (me) cooked a Christmas feast and surprisingly all the dishes, silverware, pots and pans were there! The fire pit outside was the perfect setting for the somewhat chilly evenings. With the huge family room, we were all able to watch movies together. Each of the 4 bedrooms were beautifully decorated and we all slept like babies. This is definitely a place I will visit again….. maybe next year at Christmas time!!
Thank you for a memorable holiday with family!!"
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"The home was big, clean and comfortable and felt like home. Our family of five had room to spread out and relax. The house had everything you could need and lots of entertainment. The host was friendly and responsive. We recommend staying at this lovely home."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"We needed a place that would accommodate several family members from several states attending a funeral in the area. This house exceeded our needs and expectations. The host made things simple and enjoyable, and was a much better alternative to multiple hotel rooms."
2024-04-01,4,Group trip,Beautiful home! Comfy beds! Lots of things to do in the area. Great for a family group.
2024-04-01,4,Group trip,"The house was phenomenal, beautiful, and in a great location. We stayed there for the 2024 Total Eclipse and got to watch the whole thing from the front porch. The hosts were helpful and friendly. the only issue was one of the upstairs showers leaked into the downstairs kitchen. Apparently the hosts were aware of the leak but didn't let us know about it ahead of time."
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,This house was beautiful and I would like to return .
2023-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great Host! Very responsive! If we ever have work again in the area def. would stay again at this property! Gave great advice for local spots to stop! Thanks again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Janelle’s place was absolutely amazing! It was exactly as the pictures described. Our entire crew loved the beds and pillows! You will get THE best sleep, hands down. Everything about their place, was exactly what we were looking for. Janelle and her husband are also super helpful and friendly, and super great hosts that provide a list of local things to do!"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location for our needs. Very comfortable beds and lots of space to visit with family in the area.
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,House was nice and clean. There were other peoples items left in the fridge and there were people that would drive by occasionally blaring music but other than that the place was nice and we would stay there again.

2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"All 8 of us were very impressed by Janelle's house. It is easy to access, has plenty of room for 4 couples, is located in a quiet neighborhood, has plenty of parking space, and there are a variety of restaurants close by (the best we found is called ""Scottish Thistle""). The house itself is a showcase of vintage home furnishings. The price is also very reasonable. Janelle and Tim are incredible hosts. We really enjoyed our stay and highly recommend this house."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Absolutely fabulous! From check in to check out, everything was perfect. The beds were comfortable, the house was beautiful, the neighborhood is lovely. We highly recommend the Scottish Thistle for dinner (and trivia on Friday’s). I will definitely book with Janelle again when we get down this way!"

2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"this place was perfect for the needs of my family and I while in town for a memorial. it was cozy and old-fashioned yet all current amenities. my only issue would be parking. since there's no driveway, we had to park on the street. it wouldn't have been a problem except church across the street had a fundraiser for 2 days and there are also multiple churches within a block, which meant no free parking."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable home
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,Love this house the last time I stayed in it. Loved the history on the house as well and learned it started being built in 1880 and finished 1885. Just a beautiful piece of history.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow this house is incredible!!! It’s like a livable museum. We love the antique feel of the structure and furnishings. My husband and I agree it reminded us of our relatives in Michigan and Switzerland that had homes like these. We will absolutely re-book this home if we are ever in this area again. With 4 bedrooms and 3.5 baths everyone had a place to be without ever feeling crowded. 8 of us stayed there and we had no issues at all. Also, the table in the kitchen was carved wood with epoxy. Absolutely stunning! The hosts were extremely helpful with recommendations and responses to my questions. The neighborhood was peaceful, and the front porch was great for relaxing on in the evenings. We highly recommended!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our time at Janelle and Tim’s home. We were in town for a funeral and they were very flexible and accommodating of our schedule. The house was pristine and had every amenity we could need. As a bonus, the beds were also incredibly comfortable. We would absolutely stay here again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved our stay. We met up with family and this home met all our needs. Large, spacious bedrooms. The beds were wonderful. Plenty of space in the kitchen to all eat together."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay in Piqua. My parents, sister and her children were all able to stay under one roof with plenty of room.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful Victorian home. Great location and spacious. Would love to visit again!
2023-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay. We were in town for a funeral. Tim was always responsive. He was accommodating after we had more people come stay with us than originally planned. Beds were comfy. Couches could be a little more comfortable. But overall great stay!
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,We traveled from MA to OH to attend funeral services for our Dad. The house worked out perfectly for us. Everywhere we needed to go was close by. The house was great. We loved the table in the kitchen. We spent most of our time visiting with each other around that table. Very nice!

2022-08-01,4,Group trip,"Your home is lovely and the neighborhood is fun to walk around and see the historic homes. I agree with prior reviews that the beds were comfy and well appointed with nice area rugs. Terry cloth robes were a nice addition. Couches are not very comfy for family get togethers, but time period appropriate. Would suggest adding at least one couch for relaxing. Thanks for sharing your home."
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,The house is in a great convenient location with plenty of room to spread out for the guests. We have family in town so had stayed a few times. (And will again!)

2022-07-01,4,Group trip,"The Broadway house was a wonderful gathering spot for our family. Lots of character and perfect location with a nice, quiet neighborhood. So many nice touches here. Hosts were quick to respond to a couple of issues! Many thanks to Tim and Janelle for providing our family with many lasting memories of our reunion in Piqua."
2022-06-01,3,Stayed with kids,"It’s a nice house very old which I love, unfortunately the ac upstairs didn’t work when we got there on Thursday the AC people could not come till Monday which they could not fix on that day but the host let us buy fans which they will reimburse us for them and that is very nice of them. Over all nice stay."
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"We really enjoyed our stay in this lovely big old Victorian. Lots of cool antiques. Good thought given to details aimed at comfort. It was a perfect place to accommodate our larger group. Terrific location in Piqua, with many beautifully preserved homes and buildings. It was fun to walk around and to visit the path by the river. We especially enjoyed our meals at 3 Joe's and The Scottish Thistle. We got supplies at Rosebud's Real Food for breakfast. We would not hesitate to visit again."
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful home. Spacious bedrooms with very nice bathrooms. We loved the big kitchen, dining room where we played games, “parlor” where could watch family videos on the big screen and many of the small details that were special: beautiful carved stair railing, lovely dishware in the kitchen and some of us especially enjoyed in nice terry bathrobes for our use. Janelle and Tim were quick to respond to questions. The house made our eight family members comfortable and made our special gathering so much nicer for being there."
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,"excellent accommodation, the beds are 5 stars, you can rest very well, the kitchen is large and spacious and the house is very comfortable, quiet and elegant. I recommend them."
2022-03-01,4,Group trip,Thanks
2022-02-01,3,Group trip,This historic home is very inviting & the beds & showers are very nice. There is no handicap accessible entrance & the bedrooms are all upstairs with one of those rooms entered & exiting at the stairs. We had a nice stay & recommended this home to several people that live local for family & guests coming to visit to have their own personal space when traveling into town.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a comfortable stay in Janelle's home. It was nice to have the dual zone thermostats which we could use to adjust the heat. I liked the long table in the kitchen! Check-in was easy and there was plenty of parking.

The Hartman Rock Garden in Springfield is just a short drive(approx. 30 minutes away) and definitely something to check out! Great bar within walking distance(311 Draft House).

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This home is amazing. You can tell right away all the detail this family put into this Air BNB. Each piece of furniture hand picked to fit the style home. Absolutely perfect. The Hosts are more than accommodating and super easy to work with.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Charming, classy and unique property, and incredibly comfortable and functional for a family or group (ex. Wedding Party etc). Has lots of style, and is very convenient. You’ll feel like you’ve had an “experience” vs. just a stay!"
2021-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,Excellent rental for large group and party. Kitchen was excellent.
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful and cool feeling home. Great for just lounging around and coming home to unwind in big rooms.

2020-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great old Victorian home nicely refurbished / renovated with just the right amount of modern touches. The bedrooms and kitchen were amazing and highly recommended for adult families or small groups needing a place in Piqua, OH. The hosts were great and provided special amenities that were not even mentioned in the listing. We will definitely rebook again for our regular visits back to town. A pleasant overall experience that I would recommend to others needing a place to stay around the Miami Valley."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I stayed here with a few of my bridesmaids the night before my wedding which was on the same property. This was the cleanest Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in! Super responsive hosts, and very unique design. I personally loved the antique nature of the furniture and decoration and thought it was cleverly coordinated with very modern updates, like a nice walk-in shower. Thank you for a wonderful stay!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great private location convenient to both Piqua and Troy.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved staying here and would come back in the future!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,We spent one night here and were extremely comfortable. We would definitely choose to stay here again in the future if we were passing through. This is a beautifully unique property that you won’t find anywhere else.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fantastic hosts and amazing place to stay. It was surrounded by warehouses and some industrial centers that I didn't initially expect, but they were not an issue. The grounds were beautiful and we walked around freely with our 2 year old who had a fantastic time watching the fountain. Overall a very pleasant experience. Some downsides were the old oven, and our 2 year olds ability to turn it on without issue and some of the couches, while matching aesthetically, weren't the most comfortable to lounge on for extended periods. But that kind of comes with the allure of the old world style. The updates in the bathroom and bedrooms were exquisite"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely guest house full of beautiful antiques

2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This apartmentis very conveniently close to the interstate and downtown Piqua. The grounds are private and beautiful. I loved the automatic gate on the driveway. I did not live the spiderwebs on the window casing and all the dust in the blue bedroom I slept in. I left after one night and didn't stay the other night I had booked. I know, I know, why didn't I say something to the host? Because I wanted to relax and enjoy myself and not have someone clean while I was there. It should have been cleaned thoroughly before I got there."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came and booked last minute for a funeral we attended in the area so it wasn't a typical vacation, but we really loved our stay! For being there for such a sad reason, stay at the guest house was a true bright spot! Janelle and Tim were great hosts!"

Everything was perfect. Will stay again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying in this unique guesthouse. We understand that it was built in 2019, but the furnishings and push-button light switches were from a different period. It was a beautiful blend of old and new. It was quiet, and the front faced the beautiful estate grounds. We loved our stay, and our hosts were very considerate and responsive."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,Quiet and peaceful place. Charming inside and out. Felt very safe with the locked entrance gate. We got Walmart to deliver groceries to the gate so we could stock the fridge for our week long stay. Restaurants and fast food are very easy to get to also. Having the washer and dryer in the house was very convenient. Hope to return on our next trip to Ohio.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,What a beautiful place. Private and extremely clean and comfortable. We felt very safe and secure here. Lovely stay!
2022-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Nice stay on a beautiful property. The antique furniture is a unique touch, but not the best if you are looking for comfort to relax. The bed was an exception - which was appreciated upon arrival after a long day of traveling. The hosts are prompt and provide detailed, helpful information."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,The house and location were beautiful. The only complaint I had was the No blinds/sheer curtains. I felt like during the night I had to go to the bathroom without the light on because it just felt weird with the sheer curtains. Other than that everything was perfect.

The bed was very comfortable, the kitchen well appointed, and the grounds quite peaceful. Located on the southern edge of town, it was convenient to go into the town or access the highway for longer adventures. The hosts are very attentive and the check-in process was easy. Can’t wait to go back!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"House was beautiful, clean and spacious. Host was prompt on communication. I think it was a little overpriced considering the living room furniture is antique and not comfortable for 2 couples wanting to enjoy a movie night. The couches are across from each other and one is under the TV. Bathroom curtains are see through. Had to cover with a towel. Made me uncomfortable. But the property is amazing. Nice quaint small town. Great food"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We stayed in the area for a wedding reception. The check in and out process was super simple and the property was beautiful. Zero issues at all :).

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As you enter the drive a gate slides back, you go up the long tree lined drive, Now you see the pond and the Mansion. Your fairy tale tower is to the left. The tower is decorated with beautiful antiques and has everything you need. We drove into town for a wonderful meal at The Scottish Thistle. A memorable stay.Thank-you"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place to stay for a few days. Gated access, parking at accommodation location, coffee and extra towels were good. Comfy beds, quiet outside at night was pleasant. House has character with antique decor- but is not lacking modern conveniences. We enjoyed!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,The guest house at the Orrmont Estate was the most charming and unique place we have ever stayed. The place was filled with historic touches and in a beautiful location.

2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is a hidden gem! Janelle and Tim thought of every detail in furnishing this historic carriage house, from the period furniture and artifacts, to the modern day, practical household goods. Everything we needed was at our fingertips. I'm pretty sure if there was something missing, Janelle and Tim would have been at our beck and call as needed. I'm afraid that if I say more, everyone will want to stay here and we won't be able to book it again when visiting family in the area!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Unique stay. Very clean. Communication was great. Wonderful stay.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything about this place was perfect!!! The communication from the hosts was top notch!

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came to visit family in nearby Covington for the holidays and thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Romantic Guest House, a tastefully updated carriage house on the Orrmont estate. The property is interesting in that it's tucked away in a very industrial part of Piqua, but you'd never know it because of the layout and seclusion. Very peaceful and serene.
Tim and Janelle answered all of our questions promptly, and we were very comfortable during our 7 day stay. Would stay here again, and would recommend this as a great place to stay during your visit to Miami County, Ohio."

I highly recommend a stay here!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This has to be one of the best stays I have had the host are amazing very accommodating they have thought of everything to make sure you enjoy your stay. Even if you forget something small they will most likely have it already there in the guest house. The note they leave for you in the house has great recommendations and everything you need to know about the property/area. The guest house is very beautiful well furnished and a peaceful place to stay not to mention the area surrounding the guest house is very secluded with great scenery highly recommended checking it out!!! Everything is well organized and setup to make you feel at home. Great place to have some alone time!
2021-05-01,4,Stayed about a week,The romantic guest house is a nice quiet place to relax and unwind. Not a lot of things to do around the area but the grounds are well maintained and very cute. The bathroom drapes could be a bit less 'see through' so you're not on display while doing your business though ;).
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"I only wish I had the good taste to decorate my house like the Orrmont guest house. Beautiful grounds, two bedrooms, a well-equipped kitchen, a neat floor plan, and very near the downtowns of Piqua and Troy. We'd highly recommend to anyone visiting the area!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great weekend stay! Beautiful and romantic estate!
2021-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This place is what Brits would call “posh” - everything is stylish and well-designed, and chock full of little thoughtful extras (wine in fridge, popcorn in the cupboard, spare essentials in bathroom etc). The perfect getaway!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The stay here again was just as great as the first. It is definitely a nice property with extremely cozy vibes.
The host here is responsive and does a great job checking you in."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a wonderful stay!! Quiet, secluded location that had everything you need. Owners leave a thorough note with everything you need to know for those out of town. Bedrooms were very comfortable! Wonderful stay... Highly recommend."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Extremely nice, I love the old fashion, it’s a great stay, and almost gives a haunted vibe.
Arguably the best thing about this place is the interior decorations, light switches, and the shower. Period"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great location. There are a lot of waterfalls.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a lovely, quiet hideaway! You really get to feel like you're off the beaten trail, but still close enough to pop into Troy's market district for some shopping."

2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,The place is absolutely gorgeous. The decor is stunning and The grounds were so peaceful.
2021-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This was a very charming location. We really appreciated the fine touches to the decor and the spaciousness of the living area. The beds were very comfortable. The water pressure in the shower was amazing! The view from the living area overlooking the pond was lovely.
The grounds that this was located on were beautiful. It’s on the land of an estate. However, there is no outdoor area or seating available to enjoy the grounds. You can walk near the pond, so that is charming. But exploring the rest of the grounds seems like he would be trespassing in other peoples private spaces.
There are so many lovely things about this location. The only thing that was a concern was that the place had not been cleaned in a while. There was a thick layer of dust on all the surfaces. There was broken glass on the floor in front of a nightstand in one of the bedrooms and it looked like the place had not been swept in a while.
The carpeting in the living room did appear to be vacuumed. However, there was a strong odor of pet smells in the carpeting."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Gorgeous & quiet - just what we needed for a little girls getaway

2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed a night in the guest house over the Xmas holiday, not for a wedding. The house is big and has plenty of room to hang out. The huge bathroom was great and we loved all the vintage touches. About as nice a place as you can find in the area."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,The Romantic Guest house was a perfect backdrop to one of the most incredible days of my life. A perfect experience!

2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,really cozy and neat place to stay
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If there is no wedding when you stay you'll have the grounds to yourself. The view from the house is beautiful. And the house is well appointed with comforts like a big shower, comfortable beds. Relaxing after a long drive. The hosts quickly responded to requests and questions."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a beautiful home. It was a night to remember, I loved all the little things that we’re there in case you forgot something.. I loved the walk in shower.. I loved opening up the door entrance and staring out to peaceful birds and drinking my vodka. Loved the cold ones and the robes that are available to use.. I hope when we get to come back next summer a outside swing for two and more little old trinkets to admire"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was absolutely amazing! Communication was simple and fast. The location is great, not too far out of town or too far in. It has easy access to the highway if you ever want to leave, however it would be easy to just stay in a very relax and peaceful place. I would definitely recommend anyone to stay here."
2020-10-01,4,Stayed one night,Great quiet getaway perfect for a relaxing weekend
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very unique space on a cool property. I would definitely stay here again if I was going to be in the area.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place to stay. The grounds and guest house are absolutely beautiful. Very peaceful and quiet. Loved it!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow! So many highlights. Turn off the main road and get transported to a magical secluded fairyland. The estate and guest house are gorgeous! We liked the multiple floors and the elegant charm. Waking up to a view of the sunrise is the perfect way to start the day, and having coffee on the balcony is every bit as good as it sounds! This place is a gem!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a must stay! Beautiful, private location! The host was very nice and communicated with me very well! Loved being able to come back after being married here and reminiscing. We loved seeing all that you done with the Estate. Thanks for a great stay!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Set in a beautiful and serene setting, this home is clean and makes for a lovely, quiet getaway. The hosts have stocked the kitchen with dishes and cooking necessities, and other little conveniences throughout the home. Our favorite part was sitting in the living room looking out over the Juliet balcony. Thank you!"
2020-09-01,3,Stayed one night,"Easy to get in, cold beverages waiting for you in the fridge, bed was very comfortable and we appreciated there were four usable pillows included as opposed to a pile of decorative pillows.
There's no curtains other than in the bathroom so you will wake up with full sun right in your face... I like that, Hubs built a sun blocking wall with the pillows.
The place is clean, but not sparkling clean. There's cleaning supplies included though so you can wipe stuff down.
We found and used the basics in the kitchen... one baking sheet, mixing bowls, utensils, oven mitts. No aluminum foil, but we had our own. Plenty of plates, bowls, wine glasses, etc.
Couches and padded chairs are very uncomfortable, but they're antiques so it's all part of the experience. Some creepy old portraits were added to the living room that aren't pictured in the listing and changes the vibe from unique and charming to ""is this place haunted?"" Happy to report there were no hauntings haha
Communications from host felt canned and transactional with a note first thing in the morning asking us to report as soon as we leave so they can prep for the next guest... felt like our stay didn't matter and they're in a hurry for us to leave. Maybe they've had a string of messy guests who are slow to leave.
Overall, it was an interesting experience... creepy portraits and all. Definitely a unique find."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is totally amazing! You won’t know until you reach the gate and then bam, it is completely gorgeous. The host was communicative and the place was super clean, we felt great there despite the virus. Definitely stay here!!"

2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful unique place with antique old world charm. A great place to escape and unwind! Perfect location for the dream wedding you have always wanted.

Janelle was also extremely helpful and responded quickly, which was nice! I would absolutely stay here again."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great space. Glad to see it. Guests were very happy. Thanks!
2020-06-01,4,Group trip,"Very clean, host is BUSY so you may not get a response for most of the day but once you do, she is nice. She is serious about keeping the volume down and WILL remind you! The place has a lot to offer!"

The place really is a great romantic getaway and the owners were very respectful of our privacy which I appreciated bc it was valentines weekend. The furniture and decor was well thought out and made the place that much more eclectic and special. Not to mention the fridge was stocked with beer and water which I thought was a great touch. I would recommend the restaurant the owners suggested, locktenders, if your looking for a great atmosphere with great service and food!!"

2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed here on a business trip for work in Piqua and the house was a nice alternative to an interstate hotel. The house was very clean and communication was great.
2020-01-01,5,Stayed one night,A getaway better than any resort or hotel after long days of traveling on the road. From the friendliness to the unique space it is something you dream about building one day. When I come back to visit my family i know where i will stay. Thanks for a piece of peace.
2020-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Orrmont home is a very nice option to stay when traveling around Miami County and near Dayton. The furnishings are antiques, and were functional and comfortable.

2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing building - even nicer in person than it appears. The view of the grounds and scenery from every room is incredible. Fully functional kitchen, plenty of room to dine, relax or socialize. Very clean and excellent communication from host."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved the quaint and scenic location. The gated estate environment, made me feel like I was driving back in time. I felt very safe and secure. The lay of the land and landscape was stunning. The gate house was brand new, but had a feeling of historic charm.

It is so beautiful!!!! From the moment entering the Estate it was a private setting with a very romantic feel. This property is NOT one to miss anytime your in the Miami Valley area!!!! Private setting but very close to I 75 for any day ventures you may want to go on. Very easy to get to the Dayton area from here.
The bike trail is very accessible and there is a very nice Covered Bridge a few miles down river which is a great spot for a picnic!!!!
The inside of this stay is so beautiful it has such a Romantic setting.
Janelle was a great host and we will be staying there again!!!!!
Ron Palsgrove"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed one night,A really lovely place! And Janelle was a nice and responsive host.
2019-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place. Clean and very peaceful!
2019-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a beautiful, spacious, immensely thoughtful and welcoming guest house. It was only me for only overnight, and I was so sorry not to be able to spend more time there, or to have brought along friends I could share it with. The pictures, while stunning, don't do it justice. If you're traveling north or south on Interstate 75, organize your travel schedule to land here, and try to give yourself time just to enjoy. And it's only 1/2 hour from Interstate 70 near Dayton, and definitely worth that extra time. Quiet, peaceful, open space, beautiful views, it was a surprise gift in the middle of a tough trip."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I was very happy with my stay here
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was clean and nice like the photos. All the extras was a nice sight. The fire pit and grill was nice touch.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our weekend stay was great. We came in from out of town for a goat show at the fairgrounds; West Virginia, Illinois, and northeastern Ohio. The house was in a peaceful quiet neighborhood, big back yard, off street parking, and house is bigger than the pictures make it look.

It's was very clean and to our expectations. Neighborhood was very quiet and conveniently located for our plans in the area. Lori did not bother us at all but maintained to answer our messages through out our stay in a very timely manner. Kitchen was very well stocked with utensils and dishes. Shower was perfect with good water pressure and plenty of hot water. Bed was very comfortable with plenty pillows. Linens and towels were clean and soft.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. It was so comfortable and we felt well taken care of. We can't wait till it gets warmer and go back to stay. The town is very enjoyable. We will be back.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I really can’t put into words just how perfect Loris place was! I had tears in my eyes as soon as we walked in. It felt like home immediately and I knew I was t going to want to leave! So cozy and comfortable! The bed was so comfortable! The kitchen was very well stocked with everything I needed to be able to cook meals for my kiddos! Can we also mention how amazing the water pressure was for the shower?!?! I will definitely be back! We are in Ohio from Florida every month and I’m glad we found a little home away from home while we are there! Not to mention how warm the house stayed during that painful 0 degree weather! 🥶 Huge thanks to Lori for thinking of all the little details to make it so comfortable!

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My daghters and I come back to Ohio every year for Christmas to take my grandma out of the nursing and treat her to the town. This house was actually a home I lived in for a year when I was a kid! It was great to share old memories with my children and make new ones with them and my grandmother!
The househad everything we could have needed and Lori was there if we needed anything!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always stay here when we travel to the area for work! Much better than staying at a hotel!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Highly recommended- great host and great house!
My family came to the area for a family wedding and this location was perfect. It was in a quiet, local neighborhood and was close to just about everything you could need. The house was very clean, well maintained, and exactly how it was shown/described in the listing.
Lori was very friendly and easy to work with and responded to any questions I had within about 20 minutes. She also made sure to add holiday decorations and those small things never go unnoticed in my mind!"

Thank you for making us feel at home! Can’t wait to come back!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori’s place exceeded our expectations! Super cute, quiet neighborhood, close to downtown, great yard for kids to play, easy driveway parking. Lori truly thought of every detail and put it into this home. A tray to kick off shoes upon entering with low tranquil background music playing, a welcome card on the table with a binder full of local attractions and food options, clean inviting kitchen and living area, bedrooms with the most comfortable mattresses and linens, the bathroom had extra toiletries and the best water pressure I’ve ever experienced in a rental, there were hooks to hang jackets near the front entry, night lights that were dim but bright enough to light a path from the bedrooms to the bath at night, a bonus room that had games for the kids and adults, a coffee station with a treat basket. I could go on and on about how wonderful our stay was. It’s very obvious that Lori puts a lot of effort into accommodating her guests and we so appreciated it. Thank you!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We have stayed at this location 3x. I tend to book our vacation around availability, we likebit so much. This place is truly home away from home. It is very clean, decorated nicely, located in a great spot. There is plenty of room for your family to enjoy."

2023-08-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Very lovely home, beautiful neighborhood. Quiet, yet very friendly. I enjoyed the open backyard a lot. However, the home has a very old basement type smell, that didn’t fade with time. The bathroom was nice and spacious but was a bit of an issue when it can to the tub, the shower walls had build up, as well as the faucet handle to the shower, there was not mat to prevent slipping but the owner supplied plenty of towels, so we made it work. Aside, from that the home is beautiful, cozy, and very comfortable. Didn’t have to bring much with us."

Inside & outside space to chill.
A great ""home away from home""!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Lori‘s place is always very special if you’re fortunate enough to be able to stay at her home it feels like your own home!!
We have stayed up several Vrbo and Airbnbs and hands-down Lori is the BEST!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, comfortable home just as it appeared in pictures. An added bonus after booking, Lori had informed us that she upgraded the main bed to king size with a memory foam topper! That was a welcomed upgrade! We usually have issues sleeping in unfamiliar beds, but fell asleep quickly and slept the whole night. This will be on our short list of places to stay when we return to the area again."

Thank you Lori for everything!! :-)"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,“What a great home! Everything was very clean and ready on short notice! We have 3 small children and this was perfect for our two toddlers to blow off some energy chasing each other around the spacious living room. An amazing experience and would definitely rent again!”
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori's house was definitely as described and was very clean and cute! Surely appreciated the spotlessness, and coziness. There is plenty of seating in the living room if you have several people. Really pretty spacious, which is nice. We definitely appreciate the reasonable rates, as you can't even find a hotel for rates like that. And it's a whole house! Very satisfied and it suited our needs great. The yard looked and nice and clean too. Kept up well. Communication was prompt and she is very friendly and easy to talk to. For sure a great place to stay."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lori was an amazing host! And her home was gorgeous! Would definitely visit again!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow! I stumbled upon this place because I was looking for a halfway spot between me and my mom for a girls' weekend. Lori, your Airbnb was SO welcoming. I had my two little kids with me, and the four of us were totally amazed by the attention to detail to create a welcoming place--right down to Christmas decor! Everything was cozy and comfortable, and the house itself was far bigger than I was expecting! It was a nice walking distance to the downtown shopping district and very easily accessible off the interstate! We were grateful for the fully functional kitchen as we made all our meals while we were there--there were plenty of dishes, cookware, utensils, etc. We will be back!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Second time we stayed here. Excellent value and nice accommodations! We were visiting family in the area.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I have stayed at Lori's place several times and love it!! Always clean, well supplied and always a special note to greet one!

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Clean, welcoming, cozy, large rooms, big bathroom, just enough space to move around. One of the cleanest places I have stayed and I would definitely stay again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Highly recommended! The house is very comfortable, and Lori is an excellent host."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute place in such a nice quiet neighborhood of Wapak! If it is available book immediately!! We will definitely be back.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed at this property many times. Lori is always so great to work with and the home is always super clean and has anything you need. Highly recommend staying here.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This house is great! We were in town for just a few days and loved our stay here! The house is very roomy and welcoming. I loved the music playing and welcome note on the table at check in. Very nice touch! Beds were very comfortable and the house was incredibly clean. Definitely recommend!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori's 707 was perfect for our stay in Wapakoneta for our WHS Class of '72 50th reunion. The location is easy to get to, on an improved side street far enough away from the sound of the trains, but close to everything.
The patio is private, but open and relaxing for morning coffee, afternoon relaxing, and evening dinner. The lawn is beautifully tended.
Don't hesitate—just book it . . .but don't take MY dates. I don't want to stay anywhere else. 😉"
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Lori was very kind at the beginning, and answered all of my questions. Was very hospitable and you could easily see the difference between someone you can feel comfortable communicating with, and someone you might wanna stay away from. The house was very nice and roomy. It was clean, minus some strands of hair and spider webs, and though they were not necessary for me personally, Lori did provide quite a lot for your stay. Towards the end of the stay, I stopped feeling that warm hospitality from Lori. Especially when check out day came. I worked night shift, and my hours were shared with Lori from the beginning. Just to be considerate of the security/alert system I figured she would have. Of course I’m sure Lori had other things going on, but I just feel like some consideration would have been pretty cool. I wasn’t sent any check-out instructions, so when I went to check if the 12th was still open, so that I could ask if it would be okay to check out a little later than 11am, even if it meant pulling sheets, doing the trash (which I did anyway), and just making her job easier in any way, I saw that just the 12th was crossed out and the rest of the week and following week were open. So I figured right there was me being told to wake up extra early😂 This morning I checked and those empty days are now crossed out, so I really didn’t bother asking what else I could do. Again, I’m sure it was nothing intentional. I just feel like giving someone more than 4ish hours to sleep after a 12 hour nursing shift, and communicating to them check out instructions would have been a lot more considerate. Not required by any means, just a caring and kind thing to do☺️And to my POC searching for a safe(r) place to stay, this area of Wapakoneta treated me just fine. Everyone seemed very chill and to themselves. It’s pretty quiet. There’s a Walmart down the street that I went to when it was dark, and no one paid me any mind. I felt no discomfort, and if anything…the ones who did speak seemed very nice. Only place I felt kinda uncomfy (more so annoyed because I was sleepy😭) was in Saint Marys at the Kroger Gas Station. Nothing serious, just an older man staring quite intensely. Things do close very early here though, so keep that in mind when out and about."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori is an amazing host who will promptly reply to any questions, before and after your stay! The house was very tidy and exceeded our needs. My friends and I came to the area for a wedding and actually helped the bride get ready there because the lighting and set up of the house was better than a hotel suite that she rented out for the day! I will definitely be back in the area to visit family and this place will be my first choice everytime. Location is safe and downtown has a fun, local atmosphere which is an added bonus!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori’a place is wonderful, cozy, and perfect location for quiet time."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super clean with thoughtfully spread throughout this home. Great stay and I highly recommend
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is very well taken care of, but the serenity of the neighborhood is what I fell in love with the most!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay, clean, functional! Would stay again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Have fun in Wapakoneta
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It doesn’t get better than Lori’s place in Wapak! It is an absolute GEM, with many comforts and amenities. It is so well-maintained and clean— a true “home away from home”."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great house, very clean and stocked with lots of items, quiet neighborhood, great patio area for afternoon or evening drinks.
Close to a lot of activities.
Lori was very responsive and gave recommendations for the area.
We will definitely stay again if our travels brought us to the area."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place. Nice friendly people in the neighborhood. Great host.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the good fortune of staying at Lori's place while working in Lima. We arrived late on Monday night and were so happy to find snacks and cold water after our flight and delays from Texas.
The home is very nice inside and out. The two bedrooms were very comfortable with high quality linens and bedding. Both were well appointed, very clean and everyone reported a great night's sleep.
The bathroom was nice and had good hot water. Water pressure was good and towels were plentiful as were amenities like shampoo, conditioner, etc.
The living room and den were well appointed, with comfortable seating. We didn't watch TV while there, but I'm sure it worked well as everything else in the house. We enjoyed the siri controlled music and AC.
We enjoyed sitting outside in the evening. There are several places where you can relax. In the winter, there's a fire pit. There was a very nice gas grill that I would have enjoyed using had we stayed longer.
The neighborhood is quiet and friendly. We saw kids out on bikes, walks, etc.
This is a wonderful place to stay. Highly recommend!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lori was a great host, she responded to my messages immediately, no wait time at all, had great seating for everyone outside, we didn’t use the fire pit, but that was a added bonus and the jet tub was amazing after spending 3 days at the country concert. Will recommend to anyone!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This a very clean, comfortable and well appointed home. Lori has thought of everything a traveler needs. The location was central to everything we needed to do in town. We'll definitely rent this home again."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Location is great , access to nice restaurants and cool title downtown ! Very quiet at night and immaculately clean with nice amenities! Beds soft, nice linens and bathroom supplies. We are repeat customers and will continue to come here ! Great parking and lovely outside area ! Excellent value !!! Highly recommend!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lori is a great host! The house was extremely clean and very well put together. If we are ever in that area again we would definitely stay at the house.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loris place is my favorite air bnb yet!! It’s so perfect for what I needed and cost effective! Lori was very flexible when I needed to adjust dates. Super close to all the places I needed to go in wapakoneta. So many good attractions. It was too hot for a campfire but that’s a great perk to this home as well. Plus a grill, patio for kids to ride scooters etc. the beds are very comfty and the house was really well supplied. I’ll def be back"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I attend the race at Eldora yearly. Before we had always rented a hotel room which was always crowded. This house allowed us to rest and relax with space!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lori is a wonderful host: kind and thoughtful. And the home is peaceful and beautiful. It's a great floorplan. There are even some storage containers provided for your leftovers! There are plenty of dishes. It is a very well thought through home. We are definitely keeping this place in mind for return visits.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"What a fantastic two weeks plus two days my parents had while staying at Lori's place! Everything was clean, the neighborhood was safe, all the amenities were wonderful and more than what was already described. Having a grill with outdoor seating was also highly appreciated. Off street parking was a bonus. My mother, who is legally blind, had no trouble navigating the house. before they visit from out of state again we will be sure to book available dates at Lori's house :-)
they were so many unexpected extras: from snacks and Keurig coffee pods, to both plastic and glass plates. Having lighting on a timer was a bonus for when my parents got ""home"" late from our house."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect all around ! Great house, cute neighborhood, total communication ! Nothing negative at all ! Would stay there again and again !"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Book it if you can.

The beds are very comfortable, the kitchen and bathroom has everything you need (including bath jets!), and some aspects of the home can be controlled via Alexa which is very cool. The five stars do not lie, the stay is quality and the price is a steal.
Our stay included more guests than normal and she accommodated us without a second thought. We even broke a couple of her wine glasses by accident but she was very understanding. If I ever need to stay in Wapak again, I will be staying here!"

Also, having use of Alexa is a SUPER nice touch. Convenient for temperature control and awesome to be welcomed with nice music.
I highly recommend!
Thank you Lori, for making our stay seem less!"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lori's place is exceptionally clean and check in is very easy. Will definitely stay again.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori’s place is the best home you can book, clean, cozy, comfortable; definitely recommend to anyone coming into town. Lori has exceptional communication skill and is always there to help and assist you with your needs. Couldn’t have found a better place to stay. Extremely satisfied!!!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This AirBnb is probably the best we've ever stayed in. An entire little house that is immaculate and beautifully decorated, with everything you need. We were able to do a little cooking and laundry, and the beds were very comfortable. We'll definitely be back!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Fantastic rental. Lori is extremely thoughtful and responsive. Our stay was extremely comfortable and exactly what we needed! Highly recommended!!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great house, felt like a home, not a vacation rental. Well equipped, great value. We really enjoyed our Wapak stay having a ‘home’ to stay in. Lori provided a personal touch with just the right amount of communication. A+ experience."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori is a great host, everything was great just as described, easy check in, she responded to my questions quickly and very accommodating."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lori does an absolute fabulous job with her Airbnb. I highly recommend this home to others. However because she does such a fabulous job we do not get to rent as often as we would like. Keep up the great work
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We give this charming home six stars out of five. This was the best AirB&B or VRBO we have ever found on our many travels. It was just perfect for our stay. Clean, comfortable, cozy and quiet oasis. All the extras - fluffy towels, snacks, 2 TVs, BBQ, lovely backyard for relaxing. Lori provided everything we needed and is very responsive to questions. Her decorative taste and attention to detail makes her home delightful. We would love to return in the future. Lynne and John Becker Colorado Springs CO"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had an amazing stay in this cute home!! Lori made sure we had what and more of what was expected!! Very clean, extra towels, toiletries, small snacks, and most of all COFFEE PODS!!! The home is located in a very quiet and friendly town! We will definitely stay here again if available next year when we visit…. Again thanks for letting us in a few hours earlier than check in, this was not an expectation, but was a PLUS for our family, as we drove from Florida overnight 💕❤️💕"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tom and I have traveled the world staying at AirBnBs, we are also hosts on the platform, and I have to say Lori has one of our top homes! So much thought and care has gone into the house we immediately felt at 'home'. Lori added little touches that did not go unnoticed like the cabinets were arranged to easily and logically find things or a fully stocked first aide kit or the universal charger by the bed. When we picked Wapakoneta for our Ohio adventure I wasn't sure what to expect but we fell in love with the Temple of Tolerance and Lulu's Diner. Without our streaming services we spent nights roasting marshmallows and talking, reconnecting. As a well seasoned traveler, I wish I could give Lori's home 10 stars!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and appreciate all the little details. It was very clean, spacious, and welcoming. A nice quiet neighborhood with easy access."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lori's house was like a home away from home. It was so comfortable and filled with games for my kids to enjoy and anything we might have forgotten to bring. We would definitely come back again!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem. Not only is Lori- the host - one of the most friendly and thoughtful owner, she is a great decorator and provider of comforts that made us feel at home. Can't wait to visit again."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lori is an excellent host. The home was perfect for our stay in Wapakoneta. She has all the little extras to make it like home. Thank you and we will be back in September.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic place to stay! Quiet neighborhood, clean place and comfortable bed and couches."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"If you’re in the Wapakoneta area and you need a Beautiful homie place to stay during that period Lori’s home is a wonderful option. It’s a perfect location for: cleanliness
attentiveness from owner
convenience
homie
And easy relaxation from ones travel.
I give Lori’s home a 5 star ⭐️ only because 10 was not an option! Definitely the best place I’ve had the privilege of renting! Thank you Lori!!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was amazing! It was extremely clean and comfortable. One of the best bnb’s we’ve stayed at. The check in process was smooth and we had the entire house to ourselves. Highly recommend.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I couldn't be happier with or more strongly recommend Lori's place! The host went ABOVE AND BEYOND with not only all of the essentials one may need while traveling, but also included countless extra special and incredibly thoughtful touches in and around the home. We came to Lori's for some R&R and family visits in the middle of a cross-country move, and truly being able to feel ""at home"" between homes was such a blessing. I'm glad we have family in the area simply for the fact that we can hopefully stay here again in the future. Ten out of ten!!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very impressed. This place exceeded our expectations. It was immaculate and fully stocked with nice surprises. Our stay was extremely comfortable. Would love to stay there again!

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property was a wonderful place to stay for location, value, and many comforts of home. Lori thought of everything as an air B and B host. We had room to relax and rejuvenate. Furthermore, Wapak is a historical small town with great restaurants, local shops, and a variety of summer family fun."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an absolutely perfect stay! Lori was amazing in getting the house ready and available before check-in. The house was clean and more than what we thought it was, so we were pleasantly surprised. Definitely will be coming back to Wapakoneta!!!!!!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the privilege of staying in this newly renovated Airbnb June 19-21, 2021. It was beautifully decorated and immaculately clean. The kitchen was well appointed with everything we needed for cooking and serving meals during our visit. There was a Keurig coffee maker - much to the delight of my coffee drinking family members! The dinnerware set was especially pretty and added a little something special to each of our meals. The bathroom was was well stocked with extra toilet paper and other bathroom essentials (& included thoughtful extras like a blow dryer, hair towel wraps & such). The tub had jacuzzi like jets in it (this was a nice treat after 10 hours of traveling). The towels were the large, thick, and luxurious. The bedrooms had new comfortable mattresses. There were a couple of extra blankets provided so that even the coldest natured person in our group slept comfortably. If we had gotten to stay longer, we would have definitely taken advantage of the fun family games that the hostess thoughtfully included. These are just a few examples of the many kinds of thoughtful touches throughout the home that gave hints to the owner’s thoughtfulness and hospitality.
The neighborhood was nice, quiet, and a great place to take an evening stroll. The back patio and beautiful backyard were very inviting places to hang out.
Getting back to the owner’s thoughtfulness and hospitality — she went above and beyond all expectations to make sure that this asthmatic guest could have a safe place to stay. In addition to making sure there were no plugins or other artificial fragrances, she actually washed of all the linens in unscented detergents and thought to change out the hand soaps & toiletries to unscented varieties.
The owner was also very prompt, gracious, and very helpful with her responses when we were messaging back and forth.
My family and I loved this home and all the many thoughtful, fun, practical, and beautiful touches that the owner included to make the guests feel extra welcome. As my husband aptly put it, this owner and her new Airbnb deserve a 10 out of 10!!! We would highly recommend this home to others!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay will be doing it again when I need to stay in town.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lori did and amazing job setting up this house. It was very comfortable and felt like home right away.

The house was impeccable and the pictures do not do it justice. We will never forget the hospitality and generosity we were given.
The beds were comfortable the pillows too! I personally used the down stairs shower and upstairs shower and main floor tub all were amazing. The kitchen had everything needed to cook with. The views were amazing it was such a private get away.
The hosts of this property were outstanding and again I could never sum up our experience into words. They literally feel like family to us.
