2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We traveled back to Decatur for a family trip and am so grateful for this serene place in the lake. We had family pizza night at the kitchen table, slept in almost every morning, relaxed of an evening with Netflix and loved the room overlooking the lake with two chairs while including our morning coffee.
The lake wildlife was a plus. Loved watching the fish and geese most mornings. Helpful that there was laundry."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Have been staying at a lot of Airbnb’s for work and Rebecca’s place was awesome. We’re roofing contractors so we have hectic days. Rebecca’s place was nice to come
Back to"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome house on a secluded cove on the lake. It had everything we needed and more!

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"My second stay at this property and just as wonderful as the first.

Looking forward to the third stay!"
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice accommodations.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We were in town filming a movie. It was very nice to come ""home"" after a long day on set. Will definitely look for this location on the next shoot."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I had a nice stay for work. FYI There are a lot of stairs if that’s an issue. This is a nice place to stay if you’re visiting Decatur.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful tucked-away lake cottage! The sunroom space is a particularly lovely bonus, plus a well-equipped kitchen (tho' you should bring your own tea kettle if that's your thing) and comfortable bed. A great place to stay!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the sweetest cottage, so relaxing. Purpose of our trip was stressful, so having this little haven to relax and unwind was perfect. We watched the birds, squirrels, chipmunks and ducks in our cove, enjoyed wine on the patio. Everything we needed was there, and Rebecca answered all our questions or concerns!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Hosts were awesome! Small hiccup beyond anyone's control the response and resolution was more than expected. Will rent again.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were in Decatur for a wedding and for many years we stayed with family while in town. This time, with two little ones, we decided we needed our own space. This was the best decision ever! The cottage was so beautiful and met all of our needs. A portable baby gate with the kids was a must for the stairs inside but we came prepared. It was clean and well taken care of. There were also a lot of extras to make it feel like home. We enjoyed kayaking and taking in the lake views with our coffee. Rebecca was a great host and very responsive to our needs. We will definitely be back!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,We were out in Decatur for 16 days and stayed at Rebecca’s home. This was entirely a work trip so it was wonderful to have a clean private and cozy space to go home to and not a hotel. Everything was as described. Great environment to relax at after a long days work. I’ll be back again in two years and would definitely stay again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quaint, charming cottage on the water! The hosts are very responsive. Very clean and comfortable. We enjoyed the view. It was a nice retreat for the weekend. The only negative would be if you can’t do stairs, it is t a good match for you.
Highly recommend this one!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed the peaceful setting. The house was clean and well stocked. Rebecca took care of everything we needed.

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Decatur Lake is beautiful, lots of little bars and restaurants to visit. Some of the area is a little run down, but then there are great areas to visit. This was a great weekend getaway choice."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rebecca was a great and super responsive host. It was one of the best Air bnbs that I have ever stayed at. It was a very well equipped house with beautiful lake view and an amazing sun room.
I had family along with me and cooking for them was so easy since I could find all the kitchen utensils and accessories available for use. The fridge was also stocked with water for drinking. Checkout was also pretty convent for us.
I would totally recommend this place, had an amazing time staying there and will definitely choose this place to stay in the future as well."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,Thanks for a very nice stay!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was amazing the pictures did not do it justice at all!! It’s on the lake, great place to fish we caught 16 fish total 4 was huge catfish!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Would stay here again! Quite cove with kayaks included.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Decatur IL is a nice place and overall my stay was very pleasant and peaceful. There is a lake right outside to fish and kayak in. The place was very nice and the house I stayed at is very clean.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great for a quiet getaway with lake view in the shade! Exactly what I needed and Rebecca helped me schedule it last-minute.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place with ""cottage feel"". Very well maintained and set up perfectly for AirBNB stay. Great location. Peaceful stay. If you are bringing kids, have them stay off the lakeshore drive. The City really needs to lower speed limit there as they drive too fast and secluded driveway/cottage road is kind of blind coming out of. Plenty of private outdoor space though around the property itself and on the lake. Rebecca left to Kayaks as well.
Rebecca was very nice."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing and very cool house. Very private but easy to find and get around town at. Lake was awesome to sit next too at night too.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Hosts were prompt with responses when we had an issue with blinds, they came over that same day! Friendly in communication as well. Would stay with these hosts again! Thank you!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This cozy cottage did not disappointment! My family and I stayed here for a few days for Christmas and it was perfect. Rebecca was very accommodating and was always quick to reply. She even left us a bag of Dell’s popcorn for us to enjoy! The cottage was very clean and had a fully equipped and functional kitchen. It also sat right on the lake so we woke up to the best view in the mornings. The sunroom was our favorite part! We will definitely be back!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Staying at the lake is a very nice. You oversee the lake and this is has a very relaxing effect.
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The kitchen had everything I needed to prepare dishes for a large family holiday gathering. My family of 4 had a nice quiet place to rest and freshen up. We enjoyed watching the wild life on and in the lake. It would have been a good place to drop a line in the water if we had a longer stay.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great Lake view close to everything in Decatur Illinois

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home felt like a fabulous treehouse! It was private, spacious, and cozy. Ducks came around in the morning as we sipped coffee on the back deck (so cute) and we grilled a fabulous dinner one of the nights and sat outside. Note that there are lots of stairs both inside and out so you must be ok with that. Rebecca is a wonderful host and I would stay here again."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The lake house was so comfortable and had everything we could have needed. Loved sitting on the patio right on the lake enjoying our morning coffee. Rebecca was as a fabulous host and quick with communications. Would stay here again in a heartbeat!!

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was just the relaxing getaway that we needed. The cottage was clean and had all the comforts of home (dishes, silverware, pots/pans, smart t.v. with very fast internet, dishwasher, washer/dryer, gas grill and more). The cottage is charming and quaint (hardwood floors, a quirky layout and fireplace) with more than enough room for a couple (or two). The bathrooms and kitchen are nicely remodeled. Rebecca was very responsive and even provided us with a welcome gift upon arrival. The only drawback is the noise from the busy road however you quickly forget about that when you take in the view of the lake. We had direct access to the lake where we were able to do some fishing. We genuinely enjoyed our stay and can't wait to get back to the lake next season."
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at this charming home. It was very clean and had good quality bed linens and towels. The kitchen is well stocked with pots and pans and nice dishes and glassware.
It is close to a great waterpark and awesome children's museum. It also had nice outdoor seating and eating area. Our only disappointment was that we were not able to access the water in front of house."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Penny’s home is more beautiful than the pictures and was a great peaceful stay. The proximity to Millikin University is just what we needed. Penny was a great host, proactively and responsive to contact with us. Had plenty of complimentary snacks for our son to enjoy and the home was clean and presentable. Would definitely stay again when in the area."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,If you’re ever staying in Decatur Sean’s place is an excellent choice. Everything is exactly as described and Sean went above and beyond to make sure our stay went well. We would definitely like to stay longer or next time around.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sean's place was extremely nice, quiet, scenic and secluded. Very comfortable, just like your own home and not the typical AirBnb modified home! Everything was exactly as he said it would be. Bathroom was fantastic.
I will definitely be staying there next time I am in town, perhaps squeeze in a little fishing next time!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"To put it simply, you can't find a nicer, better place to stay than this particular Airbnb! Bruce & Debbie's place has everything you'll need and more, including the 'breakfast' part of bnb :) . Our son just graduated from Millikin and we are actually disappointed that we may not be in the area again to have the opportunity to stay at Bruce & Debbie's. We've stayed there so often that they feel like family!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Of all of the places we have stayed, Debbie and Bruce provided the best food spread we have experienced.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We have rarely been welcomed so graciously by any of our hosts, especially in the states. We were treated to a wide array of comforts that made our stay unique. We could not have been more pleased or more surprised by our hosts."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great apartment in a historic home. It is beautifully furnished and decorated. The bed linens are crisp and fresh, the towels are fluffy and clean. There is a separate living room, bedroom, kitchen, and bathroom, and it is so spacious and sparkling clean. We were greeted with freshly baked banana bread, a charcuterie board, wine, English muffins, bagels, wine, and more. There were lovely fresh flower bouquets in the bedroom and kitchen. In addition to the gorgeous accommodations, Bruce and Debbie are absolutely the kindest and most generous hosts we have ever met. Thank you both for a wonderful stay. We will be back!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Friendly, kind, and accommodating hosts! Amenities provided above & beyond any other Airbnb you'll ever stay in. When it's available this is our ""go to home"" 😉 in Decatur!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We were so surprised to find this little gem in historic downtown Decatur, with five minutes to the best restaurants, Lincoln, theater, convention, center, and centrally located in both directions since you want to go to the Devon amphitheater and of course Millikan, who is our treasured university.
So we live in DECATUR and had frozen pipes and needed to find a place to stay while the renovation was about to take place. Our stay here at the Airbnb with Bruce & Debbie has been so wonderful. I felt like it was an extension of home.
You walk in to the most beautiful set table and decorations that feel like you’re in Europe.
Everything you need washer dryer, snacks, cheese, crackers, nuts, wine, beer, orange juice, coffee, everything that you need to be comfortable.
The shower is great, queen bed is very comfortable and it’s wonderful because it’s an apartment. Everything is so clean and the outdoor area will soon be filled with flowers and outdoor patio which is great. Thank you"
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Very friendly and welcoming hosts. They had a kind assortment of snacks for us when we arrived. The place was very clean and had everything we needed.
My one complaint would be that is was loud at certain moments. We could hear their dogs scampering across the floor at times during the evening.
Great location near the university and easy check in and checkout. Thanks for the hospitality!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful hosts!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Was pleased to find it was so spacious and had separate rooms, I thought a ""basement apartment"" would be just one large room and bathroom, but we had separate living sleeping and kitchen areas as well.
We were there in the winter so we didn't get to enjoy the backyard patio/pergola, but hope to come back again, I'm sure the gardens are lovely!.
Great value, we'll make this our base whenever visiting our family in Decatur."

Very impressed as a fellow host, and I would definitely stay here again. Bruce and Debbie were lovely and welcoming and also gave me privacy. Loved the homey touches and the extras. Highly recommend."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This Airbnb is our favorite place to stay when we come to Decatur for our son's Millikin music events. It is more than just a bed & shower for the night; it is a comfortable, cozy place to hang out in between whatever else you have going on in Decatur, plus you'll not go hungry with all the nice snacks supplied there :) The location is close to campus and not far from the downtown area which has some nice restaurants (some require reservations, though) and shops."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I’ve enjoyed numerous Airbnbs over the years and this one was easily one of the best I’ve ever stayed. For a one bedroom, the place was so spacious with a separate living room and full kitchen. Everything was sparkling clean with mostly new furnishings. But probably the best thing were my hosts. They were attentive and extremely generous in supplying not just waters but other beverages and plenty of snacks. Such a bonus! Simply an amazing place and one I’d readily book on my next trip to the Soy Capital of the World!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A lovely apartment! Beautifully decorated with many amenities—candy at the bedside, plenty of towels and linens, and a generously stocked refrigerator.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Bruce and Debbie were great hosts. We came in late in the evening and was greeted by Debbie that made sure we got parked ok(We had a truck and horse trailer) and showed us where everything was. The fridge was well stocked (Wine too!) with snacks and breakfast foods. The bed and furniture was very comfortable. We enjoyed our stay very much and as soon as we know dates for training for our new horse we plan on rebooking for an entire week in April. Thank you Bruce and Debbie for a wonderful experience. Janet and Katherine
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a spacious and beautiful rental. Everything was very easy, and the hosts go above and beyond in providing everything you will need for a comfortable stay. I will definitely stay here again if I come back to Decatur."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Every single item down to the pillows, extra blankets, toiletries, and fresh cut flowers makes you feel at home. Our hosts were extremely accommodating and went above and beyond to make us feel at home. When we arrived we had snacks, wine and treats for our dogs ready for us after a long travel day. Could not have asked for better hosts!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bruce & Debbie's place is our favorite -- it's like a home away from home, with extra amenities not found at any other airbnb we've ever booked. They define 'hospitality'!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was, hands down, the best Airbnb I have ever stayed in. They have gone out of their way to make everything super welcoming and comfortable."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Nice experience! We stayed for 7 nights. Greeted by a splendid array of fruit and other goodies, and a full refrigerator. Gracious lower-level living area with bedroom, living room, kitchen and bathroom, and washer/dryer, all modern. The home is well decorated and air conditioned, and is in a great central location. It was a bit challenging, though, for 6' 3"" person, because of some low ceilings and door heights. Bonus is that it's extremely quiet -- you cannot hear any traffic noise from inside. Host and hostess are very charming; even left us homemade scones on Day 5. Yum!"
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Bruce's suite met our needs for a one night stay. A very welcoming place. The flowers with bowls of chocolate on the nightstands were a nice touch. A variety of food, snacks and beverages were appreciated. Great hospitality."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Debbie and Bruce are wonderful and so is their fur baby and have a nice Airbnb apartment! Enjoyed the breakfast items and of course the wine and cheese/meat tray on the front porch! Weather was perfect for sitting out!
Can’t beat their hospitality!
😃"
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"As noted by the owners, the space is in the basement with concrete floors. We heard the owners walking overhead but it added to the charm of staying in an older home. The apartment is thoughtfully decorated and we appreciated the snacks and beverages they set out for us."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a very nice place that is comfortable and clean with several extras you won’t find just everywhere.

We were able to invite a few family members for an evening of an early ""Christmas"" together -- they loved the place, too :) ! Debbie & Bruce always accommodate their guests with amenities and niceties above & beyond any other typical bnb stay. Can't wait to go back :)"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I highly recommend this apartment for both short and long term stays. It is spacious, clean, warm and inviting. Debbie and Bruce are wonderful hosts. Couldn’t have asked for more! You will not be disappointed."

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Bruce and Debbie’s place. Everything is so welcoming, with a lovely French provincial ambience, and full of countless appealing touches. The soft, calm colors, the mellow light, the homey layout, the well-stocked kitchen, the comfortable bed... it is all very relaxing, created by hosts who genuinely want you to be comfortable and to enjoy yourself. When you arrive, you find your place has been invitingly stocked with snacks, fruit, a cheese and charcuterie plate, coffee ready to brew, chocolates by the bed, and even bottles of wine. There is a well-organized binder to guide you to good restaurants, shopping, and local attractions. Late in the evening when our ramblings were done, we would sit in the living room and watch a little TV, or just turn on the electric fireplace and read—so peaceful. The location is great. It’s a short drive to Decatur’s downtown and its nice restaurants and charming shops, and quite near Milliken College. Straight across the street is a pleasant leafy park and the Milliken Homestead, one of the region ‘s great historic mansions, and the neighborhood is full of beautiful historic homes, including two Frank Lloyd Wrights. (PS: Bruce and Debbie also have a rich knowledge of the history of Decatur which they share with those interested in architecture and American history.) 10,000 hearts for this gracious, lovely place."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"""Superhost"" doesn't do credit to Bruce. He is a few levels up from Superhost. His attention to detail is incredible. The steps down into the basement apartment lead you into the kitchen first. I felt like I walked into a room set for a party. Dishes were set on the table, breakfast food was laid out, and the fridge was stocked with snacks and drinks. The place is decorated very nicely. The lighting was amazing (dimmable switches throughout). The bath and shower were great. The entire experience was fantastic. Thank you Bruce."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay at this wonderful, quirky home was our best Airbnb experience yet and we've used Airbnbs for a decade when traveling. The hosts are over the top, so generous. Many thanks to them and that gem of a home. Carol and Tim from Florida"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The welcoming setup provided by the host was as good as we have ever experienced. We arrived from a long day of travel and didn’t want to go out and when we arrived there was a wine and cheese tray waiting for us with lots of goodies. It was over the top and very much appreciated. The accommodations were perfect for our needs, and it was even pet friendly. “Well done” to our host."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect and lovely space for my one night stay. I was quite pleasantly surprised
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Third time was as good as the first! I don’t think my reviews about this fabulous place and this fabulous couple will ever waiver… Stay here now!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This cozy space was so cool! The location was in a great spot, easy to get to the Devon Lake shore Amphitheater and local bars and restaurants.
Debbie and Bruce spoiled us! We arrived to a wine and a cheese board along with other snacks. We did not want for Anything! They were a pleasure to meet~ communication was on point. There is a charming garden that we sat in and enjoyed our wine at night and our coffee in the am:)
Everything about this place screams value! You will not be disappointed;)
Enjoy your visit!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"HIGHLY recommend staying here! Their home and yard are lovely and we couldn’t believe our eyes at the spread waiting for us when we arrived, they even included bakery treats for our pup! Everything was so clean and comfy, and I loved the Parisian theme throughout the space! After being on the road for 2+ weeks, the washer and dryer were a lifesaver and they have provided every detail you could possibly need (or want - like chocolates by the bed!) The bed was so comfortable and we truly did not want to leave. Wonderful hosts!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very kind hosts, they spoil you with a lovely spread of food and drinks! The basement apartment is very well decorated and comfortable. Wish we should have stayed longer."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful place to stay and great hosts!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Second time around was even more fantastic than the first… once again, a difficult trip made smoother! A well stocked fridge and snacks, coffee ready and waiting to be made, fresh flowers by the bed, easy chats with this dynamic duo and some good solid playtime with their fabulous pooch Bobo on their gorgeous outdoor patio…couldn’t have asked for anything more! Fortunately the only coffee shop in the neighborhood, Pure Coffee, is a fantastic place (fab coffee – fab smoothies – fab food!) where if you’re running late and cutting it close to closing time the fantastic Nick will most likely accommodate you too! The best thing about this place is it’s filled with super good vibes!! Bruce and Deb… needless to say we’ll always be returning!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This host is very generous, leaving snacks for me when I arrived. He communicated quickly and was very responsive. There were fresh flowers and chocolates on the bedside table. The place was immaculate, the bed comfortable (soft), the walk in shower had adequate water pressure, the shower head high enough for me to stand under it, with shampoo, conditioner and body wash provided."
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Needed a pet friendly place to stay for a few days while back home for a funeral. Bruce's place was perfect. Great location on the west side close to good places to eat, the college, and Fairview Park, which I I must say is being kept up very well. Will definitely check out Bruce's place again when in town!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great hospitality with thoughtful touches.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful place to stay. The home was beautiful and set up with all the amenities and more! We were amazed by the hospitality.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bruce & Debbie's place is the BEST! I truly felt welcomed to their home. There is nothing more wonderful than to arrive at one's destination following a long day's drive to find cold drinks & snacks, fresh fruit & cheese. There were even tasty snacks for by pup!
Bruce & Debbie have thought to provide everything one could need to have the most comfortable stay. There were soft sheets, a comfy bed, a gracious supply of nice toiletries and everything is stylish and clean, clean, clean.
Highly recommend!!!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I can’t say enough about Debbie and Bruce and people and their apartment! Wonderful wonderful stay! I will miss them!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful overnight stay and enjoyed the delightful treats that were provided for both humans and dogs! They were very responsive hosts and their attention to details in their home was impressive!
Thank you for sharing your beautiful home with us."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If Airbnb were the Oscars, Deb and Bruce would win all the awards!! I can't believe they make everyone feel as special as they made me, my friend and my pooch feel but I'm sure this dynamic duo do! It's in the easy welcome into their cozy space, stocked with fabulous people and pet supplies and treats that turned the end of a long journey a big beautiful exhale. Parking is safely off street and a few steps away from the private entrance to a space I seriously didn’t want to leave! Had it not been booked-and had my friend not talked me out of squatting-we'd still be hanging out in their heavenly garden patio... all of this a short stroll away from the gorgeous campus of Millikin University, Pure Coffee House (sooooo goooood), and an adjoining music venue we're hoping to experience next visit. This space has some seriously sparkly juju... we left with so much gratitude to Bruce and Deb and are looking forward to staying with/seeing them again!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Truly a little gem! A lot of attention to detail and hospitality with this place. The furnishings are adorable and comfortable, and there are lots of little extras and gifts that the hosts offer. When they found out we'd brought our dog, they immediately brought him some dog treats from a local bakery. It was totally unnecessary and absolutely appreciated.
The one thing I'll mention is that if you're not familiar with Decatur neighborhoods, you may be surprised that the area this Airbnb is in is a bit mixed. There are some really beautiful homes (this is one), some old houses broken up into student/low-cost apartments, and some buildings that have boarded up windows and trash in the yards. Nothing unsafe, but it's still worth a mention in case your expectations are different from that. I grew up in the area and knew what to expect, so we had a lovely time and look forward to staying there again on our next visit.
Absolutely wonderful and attentive hosts!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved our stay! It's within walking distance of tons of restaurants, and with a full kitchen at your disposal you have plenty of options for dining. The host left wonderful snacks and beverages that were a pleasant surprise. Check in and out is easy with a parking spot right off the private entrance. The space was beautiful and comfortable. We would love to stay again if we're ever back in the area."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Liked it
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I found Bruce and Debbie’s place absolutely amazing! I am working at Decatur Memorial Hospital and it is only 9 minutes away! They had such a beautiful setup for me when I arrived, and the apartment was immaculate! The bed was so comfortable! I just can’t say enough, One of the best places I’ve stayed at so far! I loved it so much, I went ahead and booked more stays through July, while I’m in Decatur working. Thank you both for such a comfortable stay, it was home away from home!
Martha"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful place to stay after our wedding. Bruce was so thoughtful and left us wine, snacks, and breakfast food. Very clean, anything extra you could have needed was provided (extra towels/toiletries/blankets/etc). Would recommend to anyone!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Bruce is a great host who will make sure your stay is enjoyable.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,You will find everything you need and MORE at this lovely Airbnb!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is our second extended stay at the 1901 House and it was even better than our first. The owners Debbie and Bruce run a wonderful bnb and it has quickly become our home away from home whenever we travel to the Decatur area. Great central location and the it is equipped with everything you need. The full kitchen and private laundry were extremely helpful. Again, the personal touches, little extras, ie. snacks, wine, stocked fridge and attention to detail is what makes this the place to stay when visiting Decatur. Thanks for another great stay!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Bruce’s place was a great stay! Clean, bright, and had lots of extra touches that made the stay extra welcoming. 10/10 would recommend"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was beautiful and adorned with so many thoughtful touches. I would definitely reccomend staying with Debbie and Bruce!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Another Great stay, Bruce and Debbie really go above and beyond to make you feel like a valued guest!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I stay with Bruce and Debbie often and the experience always goes above and beyond my expectations.
2021-02-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"This space has some really nice perks; the dedicated driveway parking, private entrance, full kitchen, large bedroom bathroom and living room, and all the added touches by The hosts. However, the noise from the space above travels downstairs too easily. It is an old house, so it’s understandable, but I could still hear people walking around at 1:30AM. They weren’t being noisy, but you can hear someone even when they’re causally waking around while you’re laying in bed (I even had a sound machine going but it didn’t help).
Also worth noting, you do not have control of the temperature in the space. Bruce was very responsive to messages and I expect he would be accommodating if you needed the temp adjusted so I wouldn’t list this as a negative necessarily, more of an FYI before you book"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Bruce’s place is so cozy especially with all the added features of yummy snacks and wine. Even my fur babies got treats. There’s also a crate and bowls for them. You will love the warm fireplace with the switch of a button. The pictures don’t do it justice. It seems both spacious and quaint with just the right decor. We will be back especially when the weather warms to enjoy the backyard. Thanks Bruce and Debbie!
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A beautiful space with great extra touches! So helpful that there was a dog crate already there so I didn't have to haul mine in from the car!
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cozy, clean and conveniently located. I’m in Decatur often for work and will be staying again."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great accommodations
Beautiful neighborhood"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful basement apartment. When we first walked in we were greeted by a tasty spread of food that was much appreciated after a couple days on the road. There was even a little something for our pupper. We would definitely recommend Bruce's place to anyone looking to stay in the area.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"By far the best Airbnb I have ever experienced. Bruce and Debbie left all sorts of amazing little treats for us, which was a nice surprise. They even had a surprise for my Yorkies. So clean and the perfect space for us! Will definitely stay again if I come back to Decatur."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My husband & I both highly recommend this garden apartment. It is very spacious and extremely well decorated. Very comfortable and offers every comfort & convenience needed. In addition there was wine & all kinds of snacks & munchies including delicious banana bread. Would have rated it higher than 5 stars if we could. My husband didn’t want to leave. We would stay here again when in the area.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The best Air BNB we have stayed at. So clean and lots of thoughtful touches. I hope we can stay there again if we are in the are.
2020-11-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"This apt is adorably decorated and the hosts are super friendly and communicative. They lay out all these snacks and they’re very thoughtful!
Things to keep in mind:
- there are some openings in the ceiling as the basement is not 100% finished. A massive creepy insect got into the bathroom and I had to deal with it. It made the experience a bit unpleasant.
- you can hear footsteps etc from the first floor in the above house very clearly. Light sleepers, be aware of this.
- a fuse blew in the bathroom from me blow drying my hair and it turned off the tv and fireplace. Not a huge deal but a tad annoying if those amenities are important to you."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Bruce's place was an excellent weekend getaway. The apartment was very comfortable and clean! I would highly recommend as a great place to stay.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I have never been so spoiled in an air bnb! From the beautifully decorated quarters, the comfy bed, the awaiting wine and appetizers, the frank lloyd Wright designed neighborhood.... this was such a wonderful treat! Easy to find and access, great communication, clean as a whistle, great food, I didn’t want to leave! Trust me.. this is the place to choose!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Was passing through for one night, was a great place to stay. Thanks Bruce!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amenities Galore! The space is stylishly decorated and very comfortable. We were greeted with a lovely bottle of wine and delicious snacks. Wide variety of breakfast, snack and beverage options provided. Easy and private entry into unit. Super fast and great communication. I highly recommend staying with Bruce and Debbie! You will not regret it"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed staying at the beautiful 1901 House. It had everything we needed and then some. You could definitely tell it was a labor of love created by the owners. Hosts were extremely friendly and quickly provided us with any information we asked for. The space was large and inviting, consisting of a bedroom, kitchen with dining area, living room, and bathroom. Very tastefully decorated. The central location in Decatur made it close to everywhere we needed to be. Goodies like wine, charcuterie, dips chips, fruit and drinks were all for guests to enjoy. All of the thoughtful extra touches were much appreciated. Best banana bread ever! Thanks again and we hope to stay there on our next visit. Dave & Penni....Seabrook TX"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bruce's place was outstanding! 10/10 recommend. Best AirBNB experience yet! Extremely generous and thoughtful touches. Good location. We will stay again on our future trips home! Such tasteful decor
Sidenote: we are not tall people, but if you are you may have to duck at times as the unit is a garden unit"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was lovely. The place is really spacious and comfortable and soooo many welcoming touches. We were visiting our son at the local university and it was a perfect base! Space for him to come eat dinner and hang out with us. Easy walk to campus and downtown. Would stay there again!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my favorite place to stay in Decatur. The space has everything you need for a comfortable stay, a nice bed, full kitchen, laundry, and living room. Like a home away from home. There's even a large workspace if you need to do some computer work. The internet connection is very good also. Highly recommend this listing, and I look forward to my next stay here."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Incredible !! After a long drive arriving to our own personal happy hour with appetizers & cocktails was top notch !! There was even boutique snacks for our pups !! The place is inviting with a european, boho vibe. It has all the creature comforts and breakfast for the next morning was a big plus !! The hosts are welcoming and excellent with communication. We will return if we pass through the area again."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bruce place is very private and spacious. The kitchen is well equipped and the fridge was already garnish with appetizers and breakfast
Will go back."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A lovely spot with very hospitable hosts. We would definitely book here again if we happen to find ourselves in Decatur
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As always, a wonderful stay. I always feel like a VIP when I come to Decatur because of the thoughtfulness of the hosts."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a lovely gem of a place. Plenty of space plus the gorgeous out door area and seating. Beautiful decor throughout AND laundry, wow. After moving our daughter in to her house we were bushed. How wonderful to find a caprese salad, wine and other things to munch on. We were happy not to have to go out for dinner. Breakfast of eggs, yogurt, bagels and the best banana bread was also there for us. Very friendly hosts who had tips about the Frank Llyod Wright houses across the street. Our only regret is that we didn't arrive sooner!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Bruce and Debbie are amazing hosts. Very friendly and welcoming. You'll get an entire basement (which is nicely modeled) all to your self. They are very responsive and accommodating to messages and requests you send them. I would highly recommend this place.
2020-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The downstairs apartment was not what I was originally expecting, but Debbie and Bruce provided an abundance of complimentary treats (bagels, coffee, chilled wine, orange juice, yogurt, english muffins, and a delicious cheese platter) that made the experience so very enjoyable."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,The apartment is so cozy and Bruce and Debbie are some of the nicest hosts we’ve ever stayed with! Thanks so much for the banana bread and the steady stream of fresh fruits while we stayed here! This place is truly a great value and in a central location for any stay in Decatur.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We came here to celebrate Becky's Birthday. This was our first ever AirBNB so we didn't really know what to expect. From the moment we stepped into the backyard, we knew we had found our weekend paradise! There was a serene pergola covered patio with water features and the cutest lighting.
We accessed the key, opened the door and descended the stairs to the most adorable little kitchen! The table was set and ready as well as various snacks (homemade banana bread YUM!), wine and breakfast items.
We made our way down the hallway to unpack for the weekend in a spacious bedroom. The bed was so soft and comfortable. I slept so deeply in it that the next day I didn't wake up until 1030am! There was plenty of space in the closets (there's also one in the living room area). At night we read in bed before going to sleep and it was so nice smelling the fresh flowers on both side tables. The arrangements were beautiful. Did I mention the chocolates?
My wife was excited to watch Hamilton the first night, so we got our computer set up and cuddled on the couch with the throw pillows under the soft lap blankets. We dimmed the lights, sipped on wine and had an amazing evening. The flowers on the coffee table added a nice touch and smelled wonderful!
The bathroom was well stocked. There were various body washes and shampoo available as well as body towels, hand towels and wash cloths. They were so soft! On the table in the bathroom were a couple different lotions and Q tips too.
We truly found a hidden gem! Whether you're thinking of an overnight getaway or an entire week, this should be your first choice! Bruce and Debbie are wonderful hosts who go above and beyond to make sure you are comfortable and you feel at home! We can't wait to go back to visit soon!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing space. I enjoyed staying there.
2020-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The host was incredibly generous and the setup was so sweet and thoughtful. The part that was upsetting was that we were going to have the place to ourselves. Where you stay I’m actually just their basement. We didn’t realize we would be sharing the house with the host. Despite us having a different entrance than them we were still very much sharing the home. When we sat in backyard we could see them in the kitchen, we could hear them cough and sneeze. We felt very aware of making any noise and it kind of ruined the weekend. It was also incredibly warm and we had no control over the AC. Not what we signed up for."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place!
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I would recommend Bruce’s place to anyone looking for a stay in the area. They provided more than anywhere I’ve stayed. From a stocked fridge and provided breakfast to shampoo and soaps, they had everything and more than we needed for our trip. The place was also very clean and cozy for a perfect stay."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wow. Bruce and Debbie are excellent hosts. You can’t not like their hospitality and apartment. It’s impossible. Hope to come through Decatur again!
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I cannot put into words how special this place is. Not only is the space itself adorable and more than functional- full kitchen, beautiful bath, cozy living room, SOFTEST bed- it feels like a home you never want to leave. Bruce and Debbie are the epitome of hosts. I can’t even list all of the thoughtful touches we saw in the time we spent there. The yummiest appetizers and delicious wine/beer would have been all I needed to write an amazing review. But that was just the start. Chocolates by the bed, the best coffee I’ve ever had in a loaded coffee pot that all we had to do was press brew when we woke up. Fresh eggs, fruit, banana bread, and English muffins. The bathroom had the softest towels and best smelling soaps. The TV is loaded with all the apps you’d ever need to enjoy. Their outdoor patio is an oasis. This place is heaven. We will be back, and we will be sending all of our friends and family here as well."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bruce and Debbie were extremely helpful and kind! They provided more than any host could possibly think of. There were a variety of fresh flowers throughout the space, along with fresh fruits and goods. Communication was direct and efficient. Homey touches such as a laundry basket and coat hangers were very helpful."
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Lovely home, lovely family!"
2020-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb is spotless, sparkling, and stylish. The decor is just as amazing as the location, and you feel right at home as you walk in. I would highly recommend to anyone."
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Bruce and Debbie are the most welcoming and hospitable host that you can imagine. I don't even know where to start with this experience since everything was beyond my expectations!
To begin with, it is a quiet little garden unit perfect for reflection and writing. There is this cute little writing desk where I write a lot. The location is perfect for daily exercises or hikes with the parks and nature reserves within 15 minutes drive. A lot of the furnitures are really unique because they are handmade by Debbie with so much creativity! They are very creative with the whole place and decelerations too. I was so surprised and touched by the real flowers. And she would change the flowers too if you are staying over a week.
Debbie is also extremely caring with the services they provide, daily housekeeping and fruits cut into pieces. There are also handmade cheese platers and selected drinks.
I really appreciated the stay and a private tour for the cute little town with its architectures! Look no further if you are trying to find a place to stay in Decatur."
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, very clean!! Great hosts!! I enjoyed all the personal touches.
Coffee, snacks, etc."
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow and wow and wow. We were a bit concerned about a basement apartment, but it truly felt like a Parisian flat. Everything was luxe and comfortable: the wine, cheese, and fresh flowers on arrival, not to mention the muffins and fresh fruit, etc for breakfast the next day. To top it off, right across the street is the Millikin Homestead and some Frank Lloyd Wright homes for a morning stroll. When your only wish is that you could stay longer... so much to do in Decatur, too... an example of how to do AirBNB superbly."
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great hospitality and a very nice and clean place.
Superb breakfast!
Really a great place to relax and spend a few days!"
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Both were sweet and kind. Came and restocked almost everyday i believe . =]
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is amazing and these people know how to make you feel at home. The convenience of the location puts you in walking distance of outdoor artwork, a funky little downtown area and amazing architecture. Can't say enough about how wonderful your stay will be. There are not enough words."
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I just need a spot to spend the night and wish I could have stayed much longer! Bruce and his wife were amazing hosts and really made the apartment warm and inviting. Very clean and modern and I would love to stay here again. We were within walking distance to downtown, a cute cafe, and also Millikin University."
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great hosts, their hospitality was outstanding! Perfect location in relation to Millikin University. We enjoyed the incredible variety of food and drinks made available to us. The apartment was clean and nicely decorated. Loved the motion sensor light when coming in after dark. Great recommendations with regard to restaurants and local attractions. Would definitely stay here again."
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What an amazing place! Private, quiet, spacious, with lovely decorating. Way more snacks and breakfast choices than we could possibly eat. Good shower, towels, bed - all the things we look for in a stay. Enjoyed our walk downtown, which was quite nice."
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay. Hospitality was above and beyond as usual.
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Bruce and his basement apartment need 10 stars!! You will not regret renting this place! So many thoughtful gestures for the guests - just not enough descriptive words for this place!! I wish I could’ve stayed longer and enjoyed this hospitality!!
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The best air bnb experience I've had. Well priced, one stop relaxation location with all the amenities you could hope for."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Their hospitality and thoughtfulness was like no other place I stayed. Clean, comfy, spacious, and everything you could want from beer and wine to a cheese plate with crackers or fresh juice for the morning. I would stay here over any hotel. Not to mention the beautiful backyard garden for the warmer seasons and a location right next to downtown."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place for your trip to Decatur.
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our hosts were very gracious and provided us with many sweet treats and local suggestions. The apartment is a newly renovated part of the larger quaint house amongst the historical neighborhood. It was very clean and comfortable. It's very close to the university, making it perfect when visiting for one of the many performances (Vespers in our case)."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very beautifully decorated. Nice and hospitable. Very accommodating. It’s in a basement so it can get a bit cold but they provide blankets and there’s a “fireplace” in the living area. Very comfortable.
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I absolutely loved Bruce’s wonderful apartment. It had many unexpected but beautiful touches. The hospitality was amazing. We will definitely look to see if this place is available.
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was sooooo cozy! It was so wonderful to have all the little snacks of cheese and breakfast options! She even brought us a tray down for our second morning there. It was very cozy and comfortable and we had a great time. The only problem we had is we prefer a firmer bed and their bed is very very soft so we both didn't sleep awesome, but if you love a soft bed then you will be in heaven!"
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We travel all fall following our 2 daughters separate collegiate field hockey teams and this was the best Airbnb we have ever stayed in. Great hospitality and darling accommodations. We will be back!
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"WOW!!! So many AMAZING things to say about this stay. We definitely did not want to leave after feeling so spoiled and special. This home was decorated so beautifully and everywhere you turned there were so many special touches. My favorite author, my husbands favorite candle scent, chocolates and our favorite real flowers, blue hydrangeas on both sides of the bed. So much space yet it felt so cozy. The food & beverage service was out of this world!!! All of our favorites were there, the coffee was ready to go, and she even had individually sliced each of our grapefruits. Don't get me started on how wonderful the bed was, the soft cozy blankets, and all the natural soaps, sprays and lotions through out the place. My favorite part was snuggling under the cozy blankets by candlelight, in front of the fireplace, while my husband watched his favorite movie, & I read a book. Thank you for such a dreamy & restful stay. We felt so spoiled!!!! 5 stars all the way!!"
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb is a lovely space. The house is located on a wide, brick-paved road. There is a huge off-street dedicated parking space right next to the entrance of the unit. The rental is in the finished basement of a house that has a lot of character. The entrance is separate from the rest of the home. There is a kitchen, living room, bedroom, and bathroom. Lots of closet and dresser room. The space is both rustic and modern, and VERY CLEAN. I have ridiculously bad allergies, and didn't have a single problem with them the whole time I was there. I couldn't find a speck of dust if I tried. The Kitchen is well-appointed and also very clean. There was no need to pre-wash anything before using it, it was all good to go!
The bed is comfortable, with high end pillows. The shower has nice hot water and lovely body washes. There are no windows in the bedroom, which is a PLUS for a good night's sleep.
Bruce and Debbie took such good care of me while I was there, always making sure I had everything I needed for a comfortable stay. They even made special considerations for my food allergy, which is really going above and beyond. I stayed in their space for about a week on business and it suited my needs perfectly. Hoping they have availability next time I travel to Decatur!"
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great host!

2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Charming and cozy! We stayed here while visiting our niece at Millikin. The apartment was perfect and so lovely! Truly home away from home and convenient to the campus and community amenities. And the hospitality was over and above what we expected. We had traveled all day and to gave a snack ready for us when we got there was a delightful and kind touch. Bruce and Debbie really made us feel at home.
Highly recommend! You won’t be disappointed."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,So many thoughtful and welcoming touches!

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely no complaints! First time using air bnb and will definitely use it in the future. The apartment was great and super spacious! It had everything we needed and so much more. Wonderful hosts - would highly recommend!
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was such an unexpected delight. We were just looking for a place to sleep on the road, but this apartment ended up being like a mini vacation. From fresh cut flowers to fruit and cookies and coffee already in the pot, just waiting to be turned on. We felt so pampered! There is no hotel for triple the price that is even half as spacious or filled with such personal touches. I would come back just to have a night away."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is a lovely couple, very accommodating people. The place was clean, they always put out snacks for me, they were a text away if I needed anything. It was a great place to stay, I recommend it!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,thanks again for hosting my guest and I!
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,It was a nice place to stay in.
2024-05-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was cute. The neighborhood was quiet and we felt safe. I did have to put a pillow in the bedroom window so people could not see in at night due to part of the window blind having a section missing. There was pet hair and maybe pet dandruff on the couch which made me wonder how well the cleaners did. Overall it’s not a bad place.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place! Super clean and nice and comfortable. Comfy beds. Well appointed bathroom and kitchen. And a quick 5-7 min drive to things like the Decatur airport, downtown and Millikin university."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,another great stay! looking forward to another one soon. thanks Miles!
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"We flew in early and communicated with Miles about trying to get us in early. He said he would try but had to allow his cleaning crew the window to get the cleaning done. Understandably, we had to wait for the cleaners to leave. We saw them leave and then tried to use the code that had been given to us and did not work. He could have let us in early but chose to send communication in the app that if we entered the property early we would incur fees. Mind you, this was less than a half hour until the check in time of 4 pm and after we saw the cleaners leave. The code would not work until exactly 4 pm. We previously stayed here and arrived early so I know he could make the code work remotely. It would not have hurt to let us in early, but he chose not to. I'm guessing that he got angry that we were messaging him asking to get in early. He just was not flexible and the fact that he purposefully made us wait outside with our granddaughter just to be spiteful was not appreciated!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful, cozy and very clean I had a wonderful stay, no problems, and everything I needed was close by"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Had a good stay, host is very responsive and proactive!"

The amenities were excellent. The kitchen was well stocked and the beds slept heavenly. It was a cozy, warm and inviting home away from home. We would most definitely stay again should we be blessed to do so.
Miles was excellent to respond promptly which I appreciate when staying in a new Airbnb."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Clean nice little house,small kitchen and bathroom,very welcome living room all rooms were bright and tidy,comfortable beds.Opposite the home was a large grassed/park area so had open views from the front.Would highly recommend if you find yourself needing some where to stay in this area.The only small thing I would suggest is to have some sort of grab handle to make it easier and safer to step into the bath tub to shower,other than that no issues and very happy with our choice of property for our weeks stay (4 adults)."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Miles house was a nice place for a reasonable price. Wish I would have booked it for the whole time I was working in Decatur.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Staying in this 2 bedroom house was really nice! It became a homey place after visiting friends and family each day. The kitchen was perfect for cooking our meals. Salt, pepper, and cooking oil was available which was an added bonus.
The dressers were nice and spacious for getting daily clothes out vs getting ready out of packed bags each day.
The water pressure was great in the shower too. Having a vent at your feet in the bathroom was nice when waking up to cold mornings.
Our dogs 🐕 seemed to like it too!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I really enjoyed myself here in the privacy of my own space. Miles was a very top notch host. I would recommend him to anybody. His place is well kept very quiet very comfortable and very relaxing. It is a true home away from home. I can’t wait to come back and spend more time here in the spring as well. That will be back in the fall.

The beds were comfortable with plenty of linens. Shampoo, conditioner, and body wash were supplied in a dispenser in the shower. The kitchen was supplied with all the dishes, pots, pans, and utensils needed.
The overall stay was wonderful. I will definitely be contacting Miles every time we go to Decatur to visit family."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super cute house!!! Very clean and comfortable! We were in Decatur for a concert at the Devon Amphitheater, and Miles' home was in the perfect location to stay. It's only about a mile to the amphitheater and less than a 10-minute drive to the downtown square, which has several boutique-type shops and restaurants. We really enjoyed our stay in Decatur and would definitely try to book this home again if we're back in the area! Miles is very responsive to messages and provides clear directions and expectations.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a nice stay at Dawn’s place! Everything was as expected/pictured/described. We were in town for a dog event in Springfield, so we were very grateful for a pet friendly place and totally worth the extra drive time for a yard for the pup to run around in. We didn’t spend a lot of time in the area but it was a nice spot to rest and relax in the evenings after long days."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dawn was great to work with. Every time I text her she talked within 5 minutes.
The property was beautiful and looked just like the pictures. The house was decorated very nice and it felt very home like.

You charge a cleaning fee. 🤷🏽‍♀️
But it’s a decent stay!!!"

She went out of her way to think of TONS of little extras that made the stay sooooo much nicer and easier. You couldn’t ask for nicer hosts!! If we ever need to move out of our house temporarily again I know exactly where we will check first!
Thank you again for letting us all stay for the week!!"

Will definitely recommend!"
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was a little dusty when we arrived. We mopped the floors with the provided swifter mop due to our 11 month old son crawling around. Overall, the beds were comfortable and it suited our needs for the weekend. The second bedroom was a little warm the first night but having the doors open with the air conditioner going overnight helped cool it down."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A very cozy and nicely updated place! Very comfortable if you have a baby or a dog. The crib was waiting for us and even had a tummy time mat ready for us. Very thoughtful!
Everything felt clean and there was a lot of nice touches around the place. Our dog had a chance to go outside in the fenced backyard and the bed was very comfortable. We will definitely consider this place in the future"

Cons- There was an extra fee added long after booking for pets and I didn’t see anything in the ad. If traveling in summer, there is window unit in living room and one bedroom. The rest of the house is warm. The furniture wasn’t very comfortable. The electricity is very outdated( a lot of outlets only have 2 prongs) I could have used more places for charging devices. She does have one area in living room."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Dawn was a wonderful host! Very responsive! Her place was adorable and perfect for my family of three! The home was nicely decorated and had everything we needed.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My family had a good stay at this place. This was our first experience renting an Airbnb and we had a much better experience than staying at a hotel.
We liked that this place is in a small town in the country, we felt the friendliness of the people in this town.
The house was roomy for my husban, two kids and my dog. We highly recommend this place."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks for letting us stay, we’ll hopefully be back again soon."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The home was charming! Very clean and nicely decorated. Dawn was kind enough to contact me and made an effort to help me retrieve my granddaughter’s stuffie which was left behind. Had she not contacted me promptly, it might have been much more difficult to get back once we realized it was missing."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Well, I put that it was 5 stars getting into the place. If I would have read the instructions, it would have been! So, make sure you do read them and all should be peachy. Poor Dawn had to explain it to me because I failed to read. What can I say? Some people learn better orally/aurally. :-) ~
The place was creatively decorated. You'll get a kick out of the sign on the bathroom door. Try not to make the same mistake we did. Don't accidentally lock yourself out of a bathroom with the original nob that has no key. But. if you do, watch her husband get it open. I've learned how to break in without leaving a mark! ~
Our dogs LOVED the back yard. We did too. Loved not having to walk them!!! ~ Enough kitchen supplies so that we could make some meals = saved us a lot during the trip. The cool thing is that there are several condiments there so you don't have to buy a whole bottle of ketchup, etc. ~
Dawn & her husband are good people. It's a safe, peaceful and clean space! Don't hesitate!!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The house is in a quiet, well-kept neighborhood. The house was clean and comfortable. I would recommend it to anyone else looking to stay in Decatur, IL."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I wish we stayed more than one night because the backyard was the perfect place to hang out and have a drink by the firepit! (Also wish we brought our pup because she would love the backyard and the hospitality treats as well!)
The place was clean, tidy and felt cozy. We had all the amenities we needed to feel right at home. It was close to town and a great location. Dawn was very quick to respond when I had questions before our trip and was very accommodating with getting the bikes ready before our stay. If you need a place to stay in Decatur, I would highly recommend Dawn's place!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The home was very cute and the backyard was beautiful. The bed was comfortable and I truly appreciate the tide pods and dryer sheets being an added perk as I travel for work and needed to do laundry. Thank you Dawn!!

2023-04-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,House was clean. Advertised as kid friendly but did not feel that way due to breakable knickknacks and pretty breakables. Neighborhood is not one where we felt comfortable going for a walk.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We LOVED our stay at Dawn's place!!
When we booked our stay and let Dawn know that we had a toddler traveling with us she actually baby-proofed the house for us! It was such a relief knowing I didn't have to pack all that stuff with me and my baby would still have a safe environment to explore. She even put up the breakable decorations before we got there so it was even easier for me.
The house is just as it looks on the pictures... super cute, clean, and cozy. Dawn describes her bathroom as spa-like (or something like that) and it did not disappoint. The tub is nice and big, she has bath bombs and bath salts, everything you could need to get clean, and even a big, comfy robe and fluffy towels. The house is totally stocked other than that, too. We had everything we needed and more!
The only hiccup we had was using the lock on the front door but Dawn was very patient in walking me through it a few times.
Thank you for making our visit so lovely!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Dawn was very accommodating and made my stay stress-free.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great stay. The house was very convenient to where we needed to be in Decatur. Dawn gave us a great recommendation on a local place for breakfast that we loved.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed spending the night at Dawn’s place. I love the authentic vintage details and architectural elements that they preserved when they updated the home. Neighborhood was quiet. We did not use the outside amenities as we were only there one night and it was cold out, but they looked nice. Dawn had lots of extra blankets, towels, and hygiene items in case someone needed them. A great stay for sure. Make sure to go to Krekel’s to eat if you visit the area"

We will definitely stay at Dawn’s house again if we’re ever in the surrounding area."

It is definitely the place to stay when you are in Decatur!!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This home felt more like a cute cabin in the woods with its amazing mid century modern fireplace and adorable boat dock.

Kitchen is well appointed with lots of spaces to sleep."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay! There was plenty of room for the two families that stayed (4adults & 5kids including 2 babies). We were able to have a number of other family members over for the day and there was space for everyone to spread out on the deck or the two “living” areas. Sean was very responsive to the one issue we had. Kid friendly with a basket of toys and a couple little fishing poles (I believe left by previous occupants). Perfect for our needs!
Side note: there is construction happening on a bridge across the lake. It was quite loud at times. Not a problem for us but thought it was worth mentioning in case you’re looking for a quiet retreat."

Kitchen was well stocked (the bottles of water in the wine fridge were much appreciated) and there was a collection of herbs, spices and sauces. Overall was a great stay and perfect position for our needs at the Farm Show."

2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"The air B&B was not clean when we arrived. We called Sean and he promptly responded and somebody came to clean the bathrooms and kitchens in 30 mins. The rest of the house was not cleaned or disinfected. The air B&B smelt very mildewy and we had to buy air fresheners and candles, the house didn’t air out or smell better until Saturday evening. Sean refunded us $140 for the cleaning fee."

The caboose itself was a marvel. Wonderfully restored, it maintained its charming historic essence while providing all the modern comforts. It was spotlessly clean and well cared for.
What truly sets this place apart was the warmth and coziness. The small touches made a huge difference; cups of hot chocolate, candy canes and s’mores kits for the kids added a delightfully homey feel. Furthermore, the hosts were kind enough to throw a log on the indoor fireplace and set the outdoor fire pit as well.
All in all, our stay (just for a night) was simply wonderful. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a unique and cozy getaway."

It was a super adorable place and surprisingly comfortable! It was authentic and a LOT of time and effort was put in by the hosts to make this caboose a charming place to stay with a much originality as possible!
Decatur is nearby with many options for dining.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had such a lovely stay at the Caboose! I loved all the little details inside; they made me so giddy. The construction of the whole place is restored so well with the floors, metal, little cafe seats, and the wood slatted walls give a woodsy scent to the place. The bed and bedding was comfy, soft, clean, and on theme.
We came in town to see Andy Grammer at the Devon in Decatur and it's a nice drive. Just under 15 minutes. It stayed cool inside even with the temperatures being over 90°F. We loved all the little thoughts put into the stay with the campfire, guest parking sign, etc. We really enjoyed s'mores in the quiet night out back. It rained and had the best sound at night. The wind can get a little noisy, but luckily that didn't last long.
Our host was very nice and didn't have too many clean up requirements. I feel like this place would be especially nice in the fall with the campfire. We spotted a bunch of baby deer playing close by too."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"All aboard... The Caboose is AMAZING! Feels like you're transported back in time! All the little touches make this a MUST-BOOK kind of a stay for a relaxing getaway.

The caboose was so darn cute, down to the special monograms on the pillows!
Loved the private back area where we could have a campfire.
We watched the deer from the upper lookout loft as we drank our coffee in the morning.
And slept so peacefully in the comfy beds.
We will definitely be back. Such a great get-away, and wonderful experience."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Just book the caboose! Comfortable and amazingly well designed...there is everything you need, including soft linens, good size fridge, and a comfortable bed. It's surprisingly roomy inside. The cupola is very special, and the overall experience is fun. We would stay again in winter for the indoor fireplace. We enjoyed the rain drumming lightly on the roof. Combine your train adventure with a trip to the Monticello Railway Museum. Would recommend heartily. Owner Aaron is very gracious."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Well, we never ended up staying here because our car broke down on the way. Aaron was very friendly to communicate with though and we hope to finally stay in the caboose on our next time through."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This caboose was very well redone to be very comfortable! We loved our stay and had everything we needed to disconnect from the outside world and connect with each other. We really enjoyed the thoughtfulness that was put into our stay. There were games we could play with each other, fun train related books to read, and we were greeted with a radio that we played during our stay. Overall it was tastefully done with modern conveniences that looked like they were from the 1960s when the caboose was in operation. Host was responsive and the place was better than the pictures and descriptions, which is saying a lot!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We - 3 adults and 1 child -stayed at Penny's place while visiting family in Decatur. From check in to check out, Penny clearly communicated everything we needed to know. The house is on a quiet street, there is a carport for one car which would be great during bad weather. Every room was exceptionally clean , comfortable and nicely decorated. The coffee bar is great for coffee drinkers, coffee, tea and filters were provided. The snack basket and water bottles were nice touches. We did not cook but there was a well stocked pantry along with a large variety of dishes, pots, pans etc. Internet speed was fast and there is a washer and dryer, great for long term stays.
My granddaughter left her"" special pillow "" in a bedroom and Penny quickly let us know and offered to mail it to us. Great customer service - that is how you keep guests returning.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Penny was very accommodating & communication was excellent. Nice, safe neighborhood (not always an easy find in Decatur) with large, mostly fenced yard, patio table & 4 chairs. The only negative comment or issue I had was that her cleaning crew hadn’t cleaned the microwave or oven for a some time it seemed. I’m sure if I had notified her when I arrived, she probably would have sent someone back over, but I just grabbed some cleaning stuff at Walmart & did it. (Cleaning is therapy for me anyway lol!) I did mention it to her when I was checking out, so I know she will be checking it from now on, so I wouldn’t have any concerns going forward. The furniture was all nice and clean. It really was a perfect spot for what I needed with my 2 & 4 year old granddaughters. There is a carport so you are protected if coming home in the rain. Washer/dryer clean & in good condition also. She had a nice assortment of coffees/teas/snacks. I would definitely stay here again without hesitation."

Penny is an amazing hostess and responds quickly to any messages or questions."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Penny is a great host.
I had the pleasure of staying in her home for 2 months. Yes 2 months would’ve been 3 but she was booked. My mistake waiting to extend my RSVP. I call it a home and not Airbnb because Penny makes her guest feel like home away from home. Cozy🥰 very clean, extra towels and blankets etc.. I mean she cover all basics! You really can tell she put some thought with a pinch of love in her home!!
I can not forget her promptness!
My son and myself locked ourselves out..lol.. on 2 different occasions!
Penny came right over to unlock door. I mean quick. No complaints no charge and it was cold outside . To some of us small gestures and others just caring means a lot nowadays! It was a snow storm in Decatur and before I could get my morning coffee. Penny was there with salt. She is an AMAZING HOST great person. It so much to say but not enough space. Sum it up I will only book with Penny in Decatur IL!
Thank you, Penny for you wonderful Hospitality. See you soon🙂"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clear communication and the home gave a country feel.
2024-06-01,4.0,Group trip,"It is difficult to find an Airbnb in the Millikin/Decatur area for 6 (to 8) people but this place provided just that. The beds were comfortable and the accommodations were satisfactory for our needs. This house is walking distance to Millikin and we felt safe in the neighborhood. We needed to pick up items from a grocery store and there was one in close proximity which was convenient. It was nice that there was room for 2 cars in the driveway, plus street parking. We also appreciated the separate receptacles for recycling!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Everything was good.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Dave was such a great host. Very communicative, friendly and helpful. The house is old and beautiful - plenty of space for the four of us to spread out and stretch after a long day on the road. The beds were comfy and we all got a good night's sleep. I would say I think it could benefit from a little spruce (some messy paint, maybe new/matching linens or a redo of the kitchen shelf paper) but it was very tidy and there were a number of thoughtful touches that counterbalanced any of that (mouth wash and cups in the bathroom, a recycle bin - which is weirdly hard to find in an AirBnB but a HUGE bonus for us!). Overall a great stay. Thank you, Dave!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great Home!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We were very thankful to find Dave’s place. Our power had been out for two days. It was very hot and humid in the area. We were delighted to find the comfort and coolness of Davies’s place. This was my first time in an AirBnB. I am so glad to have had such a wonderful experience. Dave thought of everything. We had no reason to reach out to him. All I can say even now is thank you for confirming our stay in your home. We would be delighted to stay again.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great one night stay. We were in town for a funeral so it was nice to have space to relax and recharge. Appreciated the necessities such as linens, shampoo/soap, etc being there so we didn’t have to bring with. Checkin was easy and instructions were well communicated. Wouldn’t hesitate to stay again if needed."
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"My family and I had a great time during our stay. It was very spacious and they provided lots of utilities to make our time more enjoyable. The effort they put in showed and we appreciate it! Throughout the whole process of booking, staying, and checking out, all went smoothly. The only thing I would change is the length of our stay, I wish it were longer!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our 2 families ages 4-48 stayed here over Thanksgiving. The kids loved the indoor back porch with hammock. Beds, bedding, towels all nice and comfortable. Be aware there is 1 full bath upstairs and 1 toilet on main level. We didn’t use backyard due to weather but it’s large and fenced in with nice back porch. Kitchen is original but with modern fridge. New full size washer and dryer units in basement were used and appreciated."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Dave was wonderful to communicate with and was a terrific host. The house was a cute older home and as I went to bed at night I was thinking about all the ways I would make the house mine if I had it. It has a lot of character and has the bones to be even more amazing one day. I stayed with 3 teenagers and they all 3 liked the house. It was so close to the university that we walked there to see my son’s friend preform in a play. I asked Dave if we could have his friend over to visit and he was happy to accommodate even though the friend could not visit. Friend went to a cast party instead. Either way, host was willing to allow us to have visitors if timing would have been correct. When we walked inside the house it was freezing and at 60 degrees. We turned the heat onto 70 and it was warm within an hour. Amazing considering how huge the house was. Thank you for our stay, and we will be back if my sons friend get a lead role again."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place stay!
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was the perfect place for us to meet up with friends at Millikin for Homecoming! It’s within walking distance of campus and has a lot of space to chill. The game room and Wi-Fi kept the teens busy so the adults could chat and reminisce about the good old days. Although we didn’t have any issues, Matt was very easy to reach and extremely friendly. While the house is pretty old, it’s still comfortable."
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay in this stately older home. Plenty of room for a large family. The memory foam beds were quite comfortable.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Clean and comfortable place to stay as we were passing through—hosts were very quick and easy to communicate with.
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Great place. 2 of the rooms connect with double doors. Wish we would have known.
2022-07-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"This property was just as described on the listing. We stopped over for one night on our way north and it was comfortable for our family. There were some basic amenities that were missing in the kitchen (paper towels or dish towels, etc) that we had to run out for, but otherwise it a comfortable stay. The mattresses appeared new and we're extremely comfortable."
2022-07-01,2.0,Stayed with a pet,"As old house lovers, our comments have NOTHING to do with the age of the house; but rather to do with cleanliness and poor presentation. (We live in a house older than this one and have stayed in other vacation rentals that are older as well.) Old houses CAN be clean and well ordered if effort is put in. The listing for this property offers the kitchen as an amenity and as stocked, ready to use. However, what we found was a dirty and ill-equipped space. The oven interior was so filthy we wouldn't even use it, the vintage metal cabinet doorfronts had been painted but were rusted and dirty inside, a few drawers had useable items but others were either empty or filled with junk. Simply glancing up you could see the thick layer of dust and grime on the ceiling fan blades. No paper products were offered - we had to go out to buy napkins, paper towels, baggies and plastic wrap. The smoke alarm was non-functioning - no cover or battery; there was no fire extiguisher either. Curtains were stained, pantry cabinets were grimy, warped and partially covered with a broken bi-fold door. No dishtowels until we found a few mixed in with bath towels in upstairs closet. Dishwasher isn't even securely installed - when you open it, it wobbles and lurches forward. This room needs some serious effort and work put in if you're going to advertise it as an amenity. We definitely overpaid for our stay. The unkempt front exterior of home with dirty windows and thick cobwebs, and untrimmed front walkway with established weeds had us wondering as soon as we arrived."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay. Comfortable accommodations with good location. Host is very communicative. Thank you for hosting us!

It’s roomy and clean. It’s not cluttered, which is a bonus when traveling with children.
The kitchen is well stocked for cooking and the beds are super comfortable.
The half bath is just a toilet and is in a very tight space, so anyone not able to use the stairs to go up to the full bath will probably not be able to use the half bath either.
Raymond communicates well and is overall a great host.
We would definitely stay again!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very impressed with the home and items it had available. The owner came very quickly to swap out the propane on the grill and everything was as described in the listing. I would suggest a more user friendly thermostat.

This does not change my five star rating, we were very happy with our stay and would stay again."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nestled just outside the city proper of Decatur, Il, Aaron’s place was perfect for our needs. He was an exceptionally good host! This place is beyond full of charm with two bonus retired and lovingly restored train cabooses right in the side yard, great for photo ops (thus the name for this charming cottage). The space is fully renovated with great modern amenities. While city folks would consider this place “in the country”, it is two minutes from the major route right to Decatur and very drivable. I would highly recommend this sweet space and if in the area again, would not hesitate to book with Aaron again! 8 thumbs up!"

The home is In the country but within five minutes to shopping and restaurants.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Caboose Corner was, perhaps, the cleanest AirBnB in which we've ever stayed - it was perfect.

We are sure it would also be a wonderful place to stay!! THANK YOU!!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,'The Hut' is such a comfortable place to stay and so much more spacious than one would expect from looking at it from the outside :).

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place! I really enjoyed my stay in this very welcoming, cozy hut house. Beautiful prairie views too!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The thoughtful design of this place impressed me - for example efficient use of space in the bathroom and kitchen. The view from front windows is ag fields to the horizon - something you appreciate if you have any experience in Central Illinois. However, I was not anticipating the array of windmills occupying those fields! We had a little bit of road noise from adjecent Route 121. However, the ""hut"" was much more peaceful that the hotels we usually patronize in the Decatur area. Although located on the edge of Warrensburg, it feels like there is plenty of separation from the neighboring residences. We never needed to contact the owners. The only minor issue we had was attempting to understand the high tech thermostat. Although slow on the learning curve, we eventually figured it out. Despite its relatively rural location, the drive to Decatur only takes about 10 minutes. Overall, very comfortable and peaceful."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved it!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had never stayed in such a unique lodging before. It was truly a wonderful experience. The Hut was spacious and airy.

Both were very responsive and accommodating. I have and will recommend this marvelous little Hut to anyone and everyone who has occasion to visit the greater Decatur, IL area. They will not be disappointed!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"From the moment I secured my reservation, when I turned the key in the door lock, and throughout my entire stay, EVERYTHING has been exactly as represented. Well, maybe the representation was a bit understated, as I have been delighted with the accommodations and the hospitality level of Joe and Staci. They both are truly Super Hosts and the Country Hut House is destined to please all who stay here!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,It was an excellent experience!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely LOVED this air bnb! Very nice and accommodating!

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay here while we were in town for the Midwest Tandem Rally. An easy, quick drive to the Decatur Conference Center. No problem leaving our bike on top of the car here at night. Nice and quiet (there was some occasional road noise with trucks going by, but that didn't bother us). We enjoyed sitting on the covered back deck on a rainy day watching the birds. While we were there, the internet was really slow, but Joe and Staci are working to fix it. If fast internet is important to you, you might want to inquire before you book."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Description is accurate, awesome stay. Highly recommend."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A must stay, whether a few days or longer. Everything is provided except any food/beverages you may want. Centrally located between the Amish towns of Arthur/Arcola, Decatur and Springfield. Pricing was much better than a hotel too."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"the little hut house is my favorite spot out of 3 different places I have been this far. the house seems to be in the middle of nowhere but everything you need near by. host was great and everyone was very friendly. a place a can definitely call a home away from home. I loved that everything that was needed was available including the adult coloring book and Simon. the windows were peaceful to look out too.
thank you for a fun relaxing peaceful and beautiful weekend with making changes for me to add another night!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wow! This is such a nice cozy place with great hosts! We saw some beautiful country sunsets! We will be back!😎👍
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This unique home is so cozy and comfortable! It was great to come home to at the end of the day. The only drawback is the traffic on route 121, but I would encourage folks not to let that get in the way of staying at this lovely home. Everything one needs is there, the bed is comfortable, the towels soft, and the fireflies delightful!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is AMAZING! Best place to stay close to Decatur without a doubt. I was traveling for work and needed a week long residence. After long hours, this place felt comfortable and cozy. The small town was the perfect contrast to work in Decatur and the diner in town had amazing breakfast. The local businesses were well stocked with surging I forgot, but the hosts have this place stocked so well it was hard to find anything missing. The in-house washer/dryer was essential and parking felt safe and was perfect for my vehicle. I’ll be back if I have another long stay in this area"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a cute hut! It was cozy and comfortable. Very clean.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Had to travel to area for a wedding so found Joe and Staci's place to be a pretty good fit for my needs. They have included everything one would pretty much need to cook, clean, bath, and even do laundry if one needed to. This was a nice gesture that you seldom find offered at many Airbnb stays. The bed was extremely comfortable so my back was appreciative of that. Many extra blankets were available as well as plenty of storage with extra things like a small fan and bathroom travel size offerings such as shampoo, conditioner, lotion, mouthwash, and toothpaste. The kitchen had some nice quality pots and skillets and utensils to cook many things and had many glasses, cups, and plates to use as well. I found the table was useful to dine or work at and the TV was a decent size with most streaming options and local channels as well. The setting is pretty rural but the house does sit on Hwy 121 right between a change from 40 to 55 mph so at times semi trucks could be heard downshifting or upshifting pretty loudly but I mostly got used to that and the vehicle traffic subsides a lot during the sleeping hours. Communication was great before check-in and instructions were clear upon checkout. They did a nice job fixing up and older building and I think its a great value for a private Airbnb stay."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An awesome, unique place to stay! Joe and Staci are kind and easy to communicate with. We especially loved seeing the windmills at dawn. 10/10 would stay again!"

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is at a perfect spot right outside of Decatur, with places to eat and shop just down the road. Very cute and cozy, with all the necessary accommodations. The bed is very comfortable, making this a perfect spot for a weekend getaway."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Among my favorite Airbnb accommodations and hosts. Pictures on listing are nice, reality even better.
Such a pleasant space and thoughtfully designed within a cabin concept, form and function both in great order.
Joe and Staci were even kind to remove snow from the property during a winter storm!
Interior aesthetics are very appealing while the views out the window to the open prairie are an incredible bonus.
Full kitchen was updated and extremely useful. Dedicated laundry room.
The house does reside on a moderately busy state route with frequent heavy truck traffic. However, the road sounds did not affect my sleep.
Worthy of longterm residency. Additionally interesting to inhabit a modified quonset hut!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Country Hut House is quite a find! It's larger than expected, quaint, comfortable and is like a ""home away from home"". We enjoyed our stay and look forward to returning when we have the opportunity."

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We came to the area for a wedding and had a great stay at the Hut! It truly is a cozy little niche in a rural area that you can feel at home and at peace in. It was true to the pictures, clean, and Joe and Staci (the hosts) were extremely friendly and quick to respond to us. The location is a little out there, but they provided information on activities and places in the general area, so we were able to go out and entertain ourselves. Overall, this was a great stay and if we are ever in the area again, we would definitely stay here again!

Neighborhood not so great!
Not Brandon fault!"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was generally a comfortable home with a full kitchen of supplies. Layout is fairly nice with decently comfortable couches and beds. Dining room with the family friendly place… We played games and had meals comfortably there.
Providing usable, head high, mirrors for hairstyling, etc. in the bedrooms would be helpful, and the bathroom was cramped in our opinion. But overall, it’s a nice Airbnb with a large backyard also, that I wish we could’ve used more.
Brandon is a friendly and responsive host. I would recommend this for other stays, and appreciate the opportunity to have rented here."

The house is on a quiet street. It’s a short walk to a cemetery that is a nice place to get steps in.

Brandon responded quickly to questions."
2024-04-01,2.0,Stayed with kids,"A week prior to stay, requested early check in. Communication was host needed to check with cleaning crew as ""guests"" were checking out the same day. Early check in was granted less than an hour before requested time(6 hour travel, not helpful) and informed the furnace was under repair and space heaters provided. Stay started with sticky floors, dirty counters and fridge, to trash and dirty clothes under the bed. Hair and dead skin were found in stained bedding. Host response to request for clean bedding took 10 minutes stating it had been 4 days since cleaning crew was there. Only 1 spare sheet set provided and was stained and had no pillowcases, only 2 shams, but 4 pillows on bed that needed changed. Pillows, including spare, had no covers, cases, and were stained. Host claimed he stayed prior (not ""guests""), trash was his, he did the cleaning, except sheets by cleaning crew. Denied refund. Story doesn't jive, dirty. Cannot recommend."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great place in a great neighborhood. Communication is prompt and friendly. Can't ask for much more than that.
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place, but a few things to note. The bathroom is between two bedrooms (Jack and Jill). It was not convenient if you are going to use Basement for sleeping. Note 1 bedroom is only a full-size bed. If you are going to use the basement for sleeping, note that it is dark, hard to keep warm and not overheat the upstairs, and the furnace is quite loud going on and off. It is very clean."

Just perfect."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Like others have said, great place and good location. We stayed for just over a week and the home met all our needs. I mean, three large screen TV’s in different rooms. I’ve been in sports bars with less. The beds and furniture are nice and comfortable. Bathroom was ample. My wife now wants me to install barn doors in ours…Good water pressure and no flimsy bath towels. The kitchen was nicely equipped if you like to cook and we do. All in all there were more extra touches here than many other places we’ve stayed in, and everything was clean. We plan to return. Thanks for making our trip to Decatur an enjoyable one."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Brandon’s house was the right location for our Labor Day weekend to participate in the Midwest Tandem Rally.

2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a cute little house with nice amenities. One thing to note, the only bathroom in the house is between the 2 bedrooms with barn doors on both sides. While you can sleep additional guests in the basement, if they need to use the restroom in the night, they will need to go through one of the bedrooms (also light shines around and through the barns doors into both bedrooms). This might not be the best setup for families with multiple kids but would be recommended for couples and smaller families."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was our second time staying here and it once again was absolutely lovely. It was clean & check in was easy. Things were well stocked in regards to toilet paper and things like that. Would love to stay here again!
