2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cottage was very nice and newly remodeled. Very clean. Owners responded promptly to questions.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Upon arrival there was a little hiccup but was quickly resolved. It was a great place to stay and the house itself felt quite comfortable. Parking was perfect with 2 spots easily available. House had HOT water which was great for showers. Washer/dryer was nice to have but the dryer took a long time to dry. These types of washer/dryer combos are know for it so it's not a problem due to the hosts. It was actually nice having the option so thanks for that!!
The house was great, hosts were great, location was great with a ton of things to do nearby! I'd book again if I were to come to the area.
Thanks for letting us make memories! üòäüòäüòä"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything was very up to date. Beautiful cottage close to the lake! Our kids (2&3 years old) had a blast looking at the map and going down to the beach. Very responsive with any questions or concerns we had. We are in Erie once or twice a year and this was one of our favorites places so far.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Nadia‚Äôs place, perfect house with all we needed, white fluffy towels, comfy mattress and bedding, kitchen supplies of great quality, tastefully decorated home, g-le speaker and smart home integration, great Internet connectivity throughout the house. On top of all Nadia was quick and easy to communicate with. Would stay there again!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great host and a well appointed property. It‚Äôs a great location for the price with convenience to Presque Isle and Waldameer.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Fantastic!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Out of all of my Airbnb stays this has been the best one yet. The home was clean and in a perfect location to all of the local restaurants and stores. We took a fishing trip to Presque Isle Bay and the home had more than parking to accommodate for my truck and boat. The hot tub was a huge bonus after a long day on the water. We will definitely be staying here again!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Quiet and lovely. Really good stay.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing place very peaceful
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cool spot and well taken care of! Great spot as it‚Äôs right by the highway and a good place to stop for long drives. Just note it‚Äôs a guest house, not that it makes it any less great!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A lovely space .. hot tub was amazing.. beautiful grounds!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Robin's place absolutely amazing, a small home with all amenities including a hot tub, fire pit and grill. The place was spotless and peaceful; would recommend."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place. Hot tub is brand new which is super nice. Cabin is also new! Lots of blooming potential after its all finished ! The cabin is located on the owners property which isnt said in the description. The owners were not a bother! But the back fence could be expanded a tad for more privacy away from the owners home.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here for a quick getaway for fianc√©s birthday. Everything was exactly as listed, house was spotless plus many amenities. We forgot our towels, Robin had everything available (towels which most places don‚Äôt have) coffee, sugar, ice machine‚Ä¶.hot tub was super duper relaxing, even a fire pit and gas grill available for use. Met Robins husband he was very friendly and welcoming as well. Overall a great stay, next time we‚Äôre in Erie (we come from NY where everything is way more expensive) we will def be looking up this place for a repeat stay!!!! Thank you Robin!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Extremely clean and cozy. Kitchen had everything we possibly needed, bathroom was gorgeous, and the bedroom super comfortable. Convenient location to local attractions. Robin made herself available (although we didn‚Äôt have any issues) and communicated clear instructions. Would stay with this host again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Spacious and extremely clean
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean and a nice place to stay because it was secluded but close to every and anything Erie!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Robin‚Äôs place was very nice. Way more spacious than the pictures made it seem. Would‚Äôve been nice to have a little guide book for the area, but all in all, a great stay."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Robin is definitely the host with the Most.
4 of us stayed here for the Total Eclipse.
Robin went above and beyond to make sure that we were checked in and settled before the big event ! Hot tub and campfire all ready for us ! The property is amazing to just relax and unwind, with plenty to do in the area if you feel the need ‚Ä¶.Will definitely be back in the fall ! ‚ô•Ô∏è"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We booked Robin's place for 1 night so that we could catch the eclipse the next day without dealing with incoming traffic. It was a peaceful and relaxing evening. I used the hot tub while my husband built a fire. Robin was so friendly and helpful. She was willing to let us stay on the grounds and use her bathroom after check out so that we could watch the eclipse there. And she notified me when I left my Stanley Cup behind. My only disappointment is that i only booked one night! We are looking forward to using her place again.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This little cabin was a perfect getaway with my Husband and Daughter. We were traveling from Niagara Falls back to Ohio (and with it being the weekend of the Solar Eclipse; almost everything was booked). This was a perfect break big point on our way home. We had arrived a little sooner than planned and were able to check in almost 2 hours early!! This place was absolutely gorgeous!! Very cabin-like feel;) We specifically picked this cabin for the hot tub! And let‚Äôs just say it was SO WORTH IT!! My daughter had a blast being able to play in the water. The only complaint would be how close it was to the owners home (although they didn‚Äôt bother us but some people wouldn‚Äôt like that). The hot tub was tucked away in a covered back porch and was not visible from their home which made things a lot more comfortable! We didn‚Äôt end up utilizing all the amenities as we had only stayed 1 night but everything looked gorgeous and cozy! Would definitely come back here again in the futureü•∞ü•∞
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Second time here was a great stay again
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Lovely little house with a full kitchen. We stayed nice and warm during the snow storm and watched snow fall in the woods through the big sliding glass doors. We went to Splash Lagoon which was a short drive away.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place !
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is our favorite place to stay when we visit family in Erie. it feels like a home away from home.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Extremely clean and very comfortable little cabin for a weekend stay while our family was in town visiting Mercyhurst University. The cabin is near the hosts' house, so they are close by and responsive if you need anything, but the cabin itself was set off from the house and felt very private. Great little kitchen so we could save a little money by cooking some of our own meals. Will definitely stay here again next time we're in Erie."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay in a very comfortable, well appointed cabin. Very large mall complex within a few minute drive and 15-20 minutes to anywhere you would want to get to in Erie, but still removed enough to not hear or see any of the city. An absolute gem if you want a quiet place to sleep and launch your adventures from!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My two young children and my mother came to Erie for a mini vacation to Presque Isle, Watermere, and other tourist attractions. Robin‚Äôs cottage was a dream and perfect to stay for my little family! It was the perfect distance from everything. It was great to come at the end of a long day out and about. The cottage is nestled in a peaceful neighborhood. Everything inside was utterly amazing. Every detail was taken into consideration from the kitchen to the bedding. My kids loved it and we would love to make it an annual place to visit!"

We only drove 15 minutes to get to Presque isle state park for an awesome bike ride and a nice score of beach glass my wife found. We had a great time and I highly recommend Robins place. There is a reason she has such good reviews , the place is extremely clean, beds are comfortable and she allowed us access to her shed for storing our bikes, that‚Äôs big for us as well as the late checkout!! Nice fire pit area that I was looking forward too using, but the weather just wasn‚Äôt right for that. If we ever trek back to Erie, I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to stay here again!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My GF and I stayed at Robin‚Äôs property for her birthday and although it was a short visit, we were both extremely impressed. Other commenters have mentioned Robin‚Äôs attention to detail and it certainly did not go unnoticed by us either, you can tell Robin is a fellow traveler and is passionate about her business. The property itself was beautiful and fit our needs perfectly. At first glance it reminded us of a Tiny Home(a style of home that I‚Äôve been enamored and excited about for sometime) but when we entered the property we were blown away with how huge it was and how well thought out the design was. Absolutely gorgeous. We had a few minor hiccups that I attributed to user error on my behalf and Robin was quick to respond despite it being a late night. The property‚Äôs location was a short drive from Presque Isle State Park and I would recommend anyone checking it out well worth it. Overall Robin‚Äôs property and her hospitality have us planning our next trip back and we already know where we will be staying when the time comes. Thanks Robin!"

She thought of everything. Extra towels, hooks in the bathroom, extra counter space, closet space and dressers, awesome coffee maker that can make a full pot or a single K-cup, Roku and tons of tv stations, fully stocked kitchen with top quality appliances‚Ä¶even night lights hardwired in for the staircase. I could go on and on. I felt like I just wanted to live there! And it was so incredibly clean and spacious. 10/10 just book it! I will for sure come back!"

We plan to stay here when we come back to Erie! Thank you, Robin!"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I really enjoyed staying here. The place was VERY clean. The bed was extremely comfy. It had all the amenities we needed. The view is woodsy and very pretty. Even tho you can see Robin's property from the cabin, it felt private. The cabin has many windows. We didn't use it, but here is a firepit on the property. There was a minor misunderstanding on our last night there, and Robin was very apologetic and personally came to apologize. Close to a mall, shopping centers, fast food places, and restaurants. If we are ever in the area again, we'd definitely stay here again. Highly recommend."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautifully crafted cottage tucked into the woods. Yet close to Erie's main shopping and attractions. Beds were super comfy. Kitchen is well-furnished. Plenty of towels for guests to use, too. We had hoped to use outdoor picnic area and firepit, but had to leave early due to illness. Robin was very understanding. She also was responsive to my questions before booking. Would definitely book here again! We were just a couple, but would be very suitable for parents with a couple of kids."

Everything supplied that one might need, however bring your own coffee, either K-cups or ground as coffeemaker is dual but coffee not supplied.

We would not hesitate to stay here again and are confident to recommend this great property!"
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and so much space! CLEAN. Love the privacy but would still recommend a few window coverings. Better than a hotel room, not far from restaurants and a short drive to Presque Isle. Easy parking."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a beautiful little cabin that is larger than it looks. Very nicely finished and extremely clean, located near the host's home, but still private.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Most beautiful, cozy & extremely clean cabin in Erie PA! Was even better in person! It was a little tricky locating key pad to enter as there‚Äôs 3 doors, but of course we found it! Full Bathroom down stairs was spacious and 1/2 bath upstairs was cozy and clean. Beds were very comfortable with simple modern bedding. Loved ceiling fan above beds upstairs! Different shaped rustic/modern windows everywhere you look! Kitchen was also spacious for a cabin, but we didn‚Äôt end up using it!
Hostess made our stay as easy as could be! Quiet off road cabin in lush wooded area! You really feel secluded even with residential home behind cabin! Will definitely be staying in again!"

The kitchen was clean and neat and had all the spices I use in my own cooking!!
I loved the shower with a wife shower faucet!
She also had all the doors surrounded by a nice tall fence so our neighbors couldn‚Äôt see in. Including the back patio. It felt cozy and private as well as open!!
We look forward to her finishing the house because we plan to come back with our entire family in August!!
Thank you Daci"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I booked Darci‚Äôs chalet for a Valentine‚Äôs getaway. We live here in Erie and this was the perfect place for a romantic staycation. The space was warm, bright, cozy and very well maintained. My husband appreciated the quality and comfort of the king bed as well as the couch. We loved the ease of use of the fireplace, the Bluetooth speaker in the shower, and the fully-loaded kitchen. One of my favorite touches was the personalized welcome sign for our stay, as well as a generous gift of local chocolates. We have stayed in many air bnb‚Äôs over the years and I can say that this was the smoothest stay we have ever had as Darci‚Äôs communication was proactive and eliminated any questions we had before we even arrived. I highly recommend a stay here and look forward to another stay here in our future!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Darci was an attentive and responsive host. Her unit was very clean and the living room space was super cozy, especially with the fireplace on. We enjoyed making tea every morning and evening using the nice tea kettle on the stove. The bed is on the firmer side, with one side more firm than the other. Sheets, towels and blankets were soft and felt expensive. An additional bonus was the sound machine available that worked really well to drown out any traffic noises while sleeping. I recommend this stay!"

I‚Äôm pretty picky about where I stay and I told my husband how much I‚Äôd love to have a warm and cozy little place just like this‚Ä¶it was the cutest lake house close to beautiful Presque Isle as well as so many restaurants and downtown Erie. We enjoyed seeing a show at the Erie Playhouse and had a really fun time at Kellar‚Äôs Magic/Comedy Club‚Ä¶such a cool place! Darci was very friendly and responsive to all of my questions .

The place is absolutely adorable, well decorated, and well equipped. The bed was super comfortable and the bed sheets so soft. There was everything in the kitchen to be able to cook. Everything was super clean. The bathroom seemed all new and was very spacious. Clean towels and super nice products were provided too.
We also appreciated the washing machine and dryer - a perfect way for us to do our laundry while doing our road trip. Darci was kind enough to provide clear instructions for us to use the machines in the best way. And she also provided amazing instructions about heating, AC and other equipment, as well as a lovely guide about the area.
Darci was super reactive, kind and helpful in all the ways. She kindly answered all my questions. She kindly suggested for us to leave a little later. Everything was perfect, we would definitely recommend and come back if we can!
Thank you so much Darci ü•∞"

The little touches did not go unnoticed... bottled water in fridge, variety of pillows to choose from, the sound machine to add to a relaxing evening, speakers in the shower, fire wood for the fire pit, birthday sign/note for my husband, tasty chocolates from a local store for husbands bday. We will likely return with friends and book two of the chalets!
We enjoyed having the tables/chairs on the deck to eat our meals and read in the morning.
Only about 20 min to Presque where we went hiking and biking..so beautiful there!
Thank you Darci for being a wonderful SuperHost!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I needed a home base for my daughter‚Äôs wedding, which was in her new home town and about five hours away from mine. Four night stay.
It was cheaper and roomier and quieter than a hotel. Comfortable.
It is small, with a living room, kitchen and bedroom only separated by archways. But we weren‚Äôt entertaining, just sleeping and making the odd meal.
Shower was the highlight. Rain type shower head.
I highly recommend it if you want a nice, quiet place."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is great. Easy enough to get into , safe, very comfy bed, the fold out couch bed was more comfortable than i was expecting. They laid out some snacks and had a welcome message specific for us when we arrived. The shower is luxurious, even if it really good be a little hotter. The shampoo/conditioner/body wash all smelled great. The firepit is decent and there is a lighter inside and actual firewood bundles if you want to light a fire. The indoor washer dryer was great when we wanted to dry our clothes after going in the water earlier in the day. The wifi was fast enough for two devices to stream at the same time.
Probably the coolest feature was the indoor gas powered fireplace. A few bottled waters in the fridge was nice.
It's a little off the beaten path so to get to presque isle is going to take closer to 20 minutes. Also the indoor table only had two chairs which required us to get a plastic chair from outside for 3 of us to dine.
A great Erie option!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our first stay at Darci‚Äôs place marks our 30th stay at an Airbnb accommodation and what an exceptional find it was! Not only the cleanliness, decor and attention to detail, but the attentiveness and kindness of the host brought this place to one of our top stays. It is quiet, peaceful and most cozy.
We are on a quest to ride our e-bikes in as many states as possible which brought us to this area to mark off Pennsylvania as we rode Presque Isle near by. (Great ride)
Overall this was a great stay as we made great memories. The chalet was wonderful, but the people connection with these hosts made our stay special and outstanding."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My husband, myself and our son stayed for the weekend to celebrate our ten year anniversary and we loved this place. Our host was sweet to offer us a pack n play and high chair for our son so we didn‚Äôt have to bring ours. Our place was clean and comfy with the cutest decor. The kitchen had everything we needed and everything was super functional. This place was about ten minutes from the zoo which was fun. This place was literally perfect! Thank you so much to our hosts for an enjoyable stay!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This little cottage is wonderful and is by far the best airbnb we have ever stayed in at Erie! We loved sitting on the back porch listening to the waves and enjoying nature. There was a nice little beach down the steps that we enjoyed everyday. The breakfast Joan and Jeff prepared was wonderful! I enjoyed talking about the local area with them especially talking about fishing! We will be back again to this cottage when we are in Erie next year! Everything about it from the hosts to the cottage was the best you could ever ask for!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. Place was exactly what the photos showed. Very clean. Sitting on the screened in porch looking and listening to the lake was so relaxing. Joan truly was a super host. The breakfast she made was delicious. Cottage was in a great location.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our time at the Cottage! It was clean, beautiful, and welcoming. The views, the sound of the crashing waves, and the stillness were just what we needed. Joan was tremendously thoughtful; we loved all her little goodies. Her communication was excellent. Our breakfast was Amazing!! It was difficult to leave.
P.S. Do we go to the Couples Cottage to be at the Cottage? Or, do we go to see Joan?.......üíõüíåüíü"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Joan is a super, super host. We love this beautiful, peaceful, private cottage. Didn‚Äôt want to go home. We are already planning our next stay. Can‚Äôt wait!!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the Couple's Cottage was absolutely lovely! Not only was it very clean and just like the pictures/description... but it was like a dream with a beautiful serene setting, a short walk down the steps to get to the water, and the constant sound of waves. We spent a good amount of time on the screened-in porch just taking it all in! Presque Isle park is a quick 5min drive & plenty of restaurants/shops within a short distance. Joan, the host, is nothing short of amazing. She was more than accommodating, very easy to communicate with, extremely friendly, and just warm & welcoming.

The view is so lovely and the sound of the waves make this this charming cottage the perfect respite. True, there is no formal kitchen but there is a fridge, toaster oven and a microwave. Oh and a great Keurig ‚Äî- you don‚Äôt want to spend your time cooking anyway! You want to relax and let Lake Erie work it‚Äôs magic on you‚Äî-"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay at Joan's cottage on the lake. Very, very comfortable and relaxing.

Would highly recommend the lakeside cottage to fellow travelers."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If it hadn't been for a cancellation, we would not have had the opportunity to take this trip. This is our second trip to Joan's Place in the last two years, and has now become one our favorite places to visit, and spend some time at the local State Park. Last year, the time spent was to celebrate a birthday. This year, the time spent was for a much needed get-a-way. Joan is a host who really makes you feel at home, and welcomes you as a good friend would. Top this trip off with a ""top notch breakfast"", and the feeling that we haven't stayed long enough. I guess that's a sign of a good vacation get-a-way! We hope to be able to visit again soon. Thank you Joan!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What cozy little cottage! Altho much of our time was spent visiting family, we loved relaxing on the screen porch each morning/evening, taking in the beautiful lake view.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Imagine, hearing the slap of the waves on the shore as you awake. You open your eyes, head still on the pillow, and the horizon greets you with iridescent blues and sparkling periwinkles. You make a cup of coffee and sit in a rocking chair on your private patio to allow the magnificence and magic of one of the Greats fill your soul. Sigh‚Ä¶
Lake Erie is pure magic and the Couples Cottage is the perfect place to stay when visiting Erie, PA. It‚Äôs nestled in an adorable, sweet and safe neighborhood and offers a gorgeous view of the Lake from practically every room, the parking lot and the road. The true treasure is your host, Joan, a sweet fastidious host eager to meet the needs of her guests and I was no exception. I am one lucky traveler blessed to find heaven on earth, or at least on Lake Erie, when I visit my hometown. I plan to make The Couples Cottage my go to accommodation whenever I return."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage is more than a place to stay. It is an experience. For those needing some peace of mind and soul, book a stay. You will not regret it.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cottage is in a lovely garden setting in a quiet neighborhood situated on a cliff directly above Lake Erie. So peaceful to sit in the rocking chair on the screen porch and listen to the sound of the waves.
Due to the location on the lake, WiFi is spotty. Joan apologized for this but reception is generally poor near the lake.
The cottage is close to everything you might wish to do when visiting Erie. As a native of Erie, it was a great trip back home for me. I very much enjoyed my stay in the cottage and look forward to a return visit."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful place to stay. It‚Äôs close to the park entrance and in a quiet little neighborhood. The cottage is charming and has everything you need for a peaceful getaway. A screened in back porch with two rocking chairs where you can sit and relax while listening to the waves crashing against the shore. A super comfortable bed with soft blankets and pillows (open the windows and fall asleep to the sound of the waves). NO TV! And a shower with great water pressure üôÇ.
And Joan. A super sweet host who made us a delicious breakfast in her beautiful home. Her personal touch and genuine thoughtfulness for her guests is what makes staying here extra special.
If we get the opportunity to return to Presque Isle, I wouldn‚Äôt want to stay anywhere else!"

Screened-in porch overlooks the forest and the Lake Erie below, we spent a lot of time there relaxing on the rocking chairs and just taking in the sights and sounds of nature.
Less than 2 miles from Presque Isle State Park. Biker-friendly community and wide bike lanes make it easy to commute to the park.
Our host Joan cooked us an EXCELLENT full breakfast one morning of our stay.
Looking forward to our next visit!"

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Couple's Cottage is a cozy retreat to relax, rest, unwind, or get busy and enjoy all the activities and beaches that Presque Isle has to offer. Joan recommended restaurants and shopping that we did appreciate. The cottage is immaculate but stocked with breakfast for a day or two - plus the scrumptious breakfast that Joan pampered us with the day before we (sadly) departed! There were also many little ""niceties"" and necessities that Joan thinks of in advance. The place is charming! and could not be more immaculate. The screened in porch was a delight - listening to the ocean waves both day and night was so mesmerizing. There are also great wineries not to far away. There is a short walkway to the beach . . . You will not regret booking with Joan - her fun and caring personality just glows from within."

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! This is such an enchanting place to stay while on vacation in Erie. There just so happened to be an unexpected cancellation which was precisely the week we were hoping to stay in Erie, and with wonderful luck we stumbled on this place and met the gracious host, Joan. The Couples Cottage was a tranquil little cottage tucked away in tall trees surrounded by cheery flowerbeds at each window. Between the trees you can see the lake and while sitting on the porch you can hear the waves gently crashing. Falling asleep to the sound of the waves was our favorite part. This is a perfect little getaway if you are looking for peace and serenity. Joan was a gracious host and gave us the history of the Gilded Eagle Inn when we arrived. She was very welcoming and warm and we really enjoyed talking to her and learning more about her love of hosting. She made us a delicious lemon/blueberry bread pudding and a very delectable breakfast, all the while chatting with us and making us feel right at home. We hope to visit again soon and look forward to seeing Joan when we return."

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A serene setting, a tiny, exquisite respite pitched over a maple tree covered bluff. Filtered glimpses of Lake Erie and the constant lull of the waves. The beauty a stay here is combined with the gracious hospitality of its lovely host. While there is no kitchen per se we found the the small fridge, microwave, and toaster oven more than filled the bill! This is our second stay in this cottage and we will be back but not soon enough!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place very quiet pace no noisy traffic or neighbors only noise is the peaceful lap of waves coming from the lake
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage is a gem and totally worth it. The location is spectacular, the bed is incredibly comfortable, and the sound of the lake waves crashing is lovely. It is wonderful to be in the woods and so close to the water at the same time! The cottage is appointed beautifully by Joan. She is a great communicator and made us feel so at home. She is a ray of sunshine that made our trip all the more special!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our weekend at the Couple's Cottage was restful and renewing! The cottage is privately nestled in a serene setting with a bird's eye view and the soothing sound of waves crashing on the lakeshore. The cottage d√©cor is beautifully themed and welcoming. The cottage itself is impeccably clean and no details have been left unattended. Joan is a lovely person and a gracious host! She goes above and beyond preparing for her guests. We were very pleasantly surprised to have the privilege of a delicious, homemade breakfast that was both thoughtfully prepared and elegantly presented. We are very appreciative of the comforts of the charming cottage and the unconditional kindness of our generous host!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying at this gem of a cottage and it was somehow even better than the first time. The sound of the waves and the vista of the lake through the trees on the back porch cannot be beat. Plus, Joan is a gem who will cook you up a delicious breakfast and treat you with true kindness and hospitality."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Joan really is a super host! She thought of literally everything and the cottage is darling! She made us breakfast one morning and it was so delicious!! We‚Äôll definitely be back...
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cottage is so clean and quaint. Joan‚Äôs hospitality is beyond the best ! This was our 3rd stay at the cottage. This is our favorite place to get away ! Home away from Home !!!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joan is an amazing host with the loveliest cottage. The space is perfect for a weekend getaway, and Joan was so helpful to make our stay the best - including an anniversary cake-in-a-mug! It was the perfect getaway from the chaos of 2020. We will definitely be visiting again!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful and relaxing
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of the best trips my husband and I have taken together. The cottage was beyond perfect and Joan was simply amazing. The view was incredible from the covered back porch. We didn't even miss a full kitchen in the space, the cottage is located near restaurants and breweries for everyone's liking. I would highly recommend staying at Joan's cottage. She creates a very peaceful and relaxing weekend (or longer!) away."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joan is one of the kindest people you will meet, and the best host you could ever hope to have- on Airbnb or otherwise!She goes above and beyond in every aspect, and the care and little details she has put into the property really shine through. The accommodations, the food, the recommendations, and the conversation were all excellent! We look forward to visiting again the next time we are in town."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joan's cottage is the perfect getaway for some much needed relaxation. She puts so much thought into everything she does. There was a selection of coffee and tea for the keurig. She put orange juice, milk, and champagne in the mini fridge and had fresh fruit and granola for us to enjoy. She even had a list of restaurants and places nearby. One of our favorite parts of our stay though was the back porch. We spent most of our time out there listening to the waves. Another special added touch was the breakfast that Joan handmade for us the day before we departed! Honestly the best belgian waffle I've ever had! We thoroughly enjoyed chatting with Joan and she's one of the nicest, kindest souls you will ever meet. I definitely recommend the Couple's Cottage to anyone considering. Can't wait to come back!"

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Joan is so very sweet and kind. She makes a delicious breakfast and makes you feel right at home. The cottage is sparkling clean and comfortable. Can‚Äôt wait to go back.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We return to Erie every year and have stayed in many, many different types of accommodations from grand lake houses in North East or Erie to homes in town. Joan‚Äôs place is perfect on so many levels. Perched above the Lake on a wooded hillside, the sound of the waves and the light through the filtered leaves help create a serene, beautiful environment. While there is no kitchen in this petite jewel box
There is a small fridge, microwave, toaster oven and hot plate. The bedding and linens are top quality. This is a special spot with a wonderful, generous host. Yes, like everyone else, we hope to return!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay here while in Erie. We were looking for a place close to Presque Isle that allowed some privacy, and this was perfect. Joan‚Äôs space was very clean, private, and comfortable. The back porch was the perfect place to relax and listen to the waves. Despite the heat of the day it was always cool with a nice breeze. While there is not a kitchen in the cabin, there are essentials like a microwave, mini fridge, and utensils for simple food/snack prep. Lots of great recommendations from Joan for restaurants in the area, which we definitely took advantage of! I would absolutely stay here again."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Yep, it's that cute. What a lovely stay!"

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joan‚Äôs cottage was exactly what my husband and I were looking for when we were wanting a short weekend away prior to the arrival of our baby. It was quiet, clean and within drive able distance of so many things! Joan provides so many thoughtful touches to the cottage and helped make us feel so special. She is also the most fantastic cook. Her breakfast was one of my favorite parts of the trip. I would recommend her place to anyone!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Couples Cottage during a pandemic
Joan is a lovely host who warmly welcomed us for our 2 nights in the Couple‚Äôs Cottage. She made us feel at home, providing bottled water, juice, and a small bottle of champagne for us along with fresh fruit, and served a delicious breakfast on the full day of our stay. These strange times of COVID19 can create awkward moments among friendly people, especially people who are meeting for the first time: I politely let Joan know that my husband and I were pretty strict about social distancing while she was showing us around the cottage, which she respected. We all were masked, of course, although less formal during breakfast which was served outdoors. We kept in mind that Erie County had had a very low number of cases at that point (July 2020).
The cottage is adorable, like a tiny house. The back porch, situated about 80 feet above Lake Erie on a wooded hill, is comfortable and enchanting in the evening, and furnished with two rocking chairs. The sunsets were lovely as viewed through the trees on the hill down to the lake. We walked down the steps the first evening to see the lake up close; the lake is very high this year so the small nearby beach is no longer accessible. We swam a bit at Presque Isle at on Thursday but the guarded beaches were packed with people who were not social distancing or wearing masks.
After our walk that first evening, well after dark, the deluge came! The rain came in through the screens as we scrambled to move inside and shut the glass doors. It was then that I wished there were a comfy couch in the main room in addition to the two folding chairs. The bed, however, was very comfy.
Thanks to other reviews and communication with Joan, we knew in advance that the cottage doesn‚Äôt have a true kitchen but rather a small dorm fridge, a small Keurig, and a microwave. So two days before our drive from Pittsburgh, we ordered a couple of trays (veggies, shrimp, cheese) from Erie West Wegman‚Äôs, a 10 minute drive from the cottage. We also had packed Tupperware to store leftovers; surprisingly the dorm fridge was roomy enough to hold everything, once repacked. The second night, we ordered Syd‚Äôs (based upon a suggestion from Joan) through Grubhub so I could devour some Lake Erie perch- sooooo perfectly fried!
The Couple‚Äôs Cottage provided a lovely respite from staying at home this summer of COVID19. We would happily take advantage of Joan ‚Äòs charming hospitality and lovely cottage again in the future. Thank you, Joan!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage is great for a getaway, very relaxing and pleasant. Joan is a great host, she met us at check-in and showed us the unit. She cooked a nice breakfast one morning. Cell phone service is spotty but the WIFI is available."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is the perfect spot! So quaint and local. Very close to the beaches at the state park! Joan is so friendly and provides the sweetest touches! I would 10/10 recommend her cottage!

We are already talking about booking another stay....this time longer than three days!! Highly recommend!!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cottage was right on the lake and could not be more relaxing. We were able to get to Presque Isle quickly and enjoy many other things around Erie. The screened in porch was so relaxing and great way to listen to the lake at night and first thing in the morning with a cup of coffee. Joan was so welcoming and we had a wonderful time.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You will not be disappointed by this cozy, charming, and peaceful retreat! Joan is an impeccable host!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a gem of a find! This was the perfect location for a weekend getaway and Joan is an amazing host. Highly recommend!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is such a great spot. The back porch cannot be beat (you can hear the waves lapping up against the shore) and you have easy access to the water down about 100 stairs (stellar sunsets!). Not to mention that you're just ten minutes from all the lovely beaches at Presque Isle. Would definitely recommend for a solo traveler or couple. Only thing to note is that there is not really a kitchen so you will need to cook super basic or order out.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely little cottage on a hill above the lake. The sounds of the waves will lull you to sleep. Beautiful landscaping on the grounds of a stately home. The hostess is beyond kind, the definition of hospitality."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Joan is amazing!!! The cottage is amazing!!! My wife and I had a phenomenal little stay at the little cottage. Joan served us breakfast!!! Who does that?! Joan does (at least to us üòÄ). We plan on returning here. Great stay!!!
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place for couples or people wanting some solitude for relaxation by the water. The screened in porch is such a peaceful place.

2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This cottage is just what you want from a lovely weekend getaway. We enjoyed the sound of the waves to lull us to sleep and the short drive to presque isle park. Joan is incredibly welcoming and helpful should you need any extra assistance!
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Joan is amazing and very accommodating! Her kindness and personal touches made our visit extra special! And wait till you have her homemade breakfast!!! Yum!
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There aren't enough things to say about this cottage on the water. All the details are thought of and available in this cozy and magical home. I can't recommend the couple's cottage enough for peace, nature, and escape.
On top of all that, Joan is the most hospitable host I've encountered so far. She takes so much pride and puts so much love into the space. I will be back."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Joan Thank you so much for another great stay in your cozy cottage! Your hospitality is beyond amazing. Can‚Äôt wait to see you again soon ! Joans Cottage is so quaint . Extremely clean. The screened in back porch is awesome. We loved waking up each morning and hearing the sound of Lake Erie. Or sitting on the back porch rocking in the rocking chairs and just listening to the waves. I could go on and on. This is our favorite place to visit. We hope to return a few more times this year ! Thanks again Joan :)
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very accurate to description. The cottage is cozy, and accommodates 2 people comfortably. A perfect location for a quiet, and restful retreat.

2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The experience was so fabulous and the cottage was so wonderful that I returned to stay at the Couples Cottage again the following week! I can‚Äôt get enough!
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Joans cottage was perfect for my wife and me on our anniversay weekend. It is close to everything that Lake Erie has to offer. The cottage itself is supplied with everything you will need. We loved sitting on the back deck listening to the waves and enjoying a cup of tea in the morning. Luckily we were there to witness two amazing sunsets. Joan is the perfect host. She goes out of her way to make you feel welcome. She also surprised us with the most amazing breakfest. Thank you Joan for making this a special weekend.
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Couples Cottage is pure magic! I visited alone as a restorative & healing getaway after loosing my best friend & doggie companion of 14.5 years.
Firstly, the cottage is exceptional! The back porch is heavenly! If you are into yoga or meditation be sure to bring your mat. It‚Äôs a perfect shop for blissful sunset yoga!
There are beautifully thoughtful touches all over the cottage. I felt truly cared for through all the special details. The cottage is full of love.
And Joan is an amazingly sweet & wonderful lady! As a fellow female business owner I can relate to her story of overcoming obstacles and not giving up her dream. And the result of that determination and creativity is this beautiful experience.
I will definitely be back to visit Joan and her magical cottage! I‚Äôm so grateful for wonderful experience I had there."
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joan is a host that truly goes above and beyond for her guests! There were so many special little touches in the cottage that made it feel so homey and comfortable. Breakfast on the last morning of our stay was absolutely delicious and she really made this getaway feel like a home away from home for us. Also, the view and location are both amazing. If you‚Äôre debating on booking a trip here, absolutely do it! You will not regret it."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This cottage was super clean, very private and relaxing. Joan was very accommodating and could not have been nicer. She is knowledgeable of the area and local restaurants and shopping. Would definitely recommend!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I picked this place because it was convenient to Presque Isle Park, where I was going to be running the Erie Marathon. This was the perfect place to relax and recuperate. Joan is the most excellent host! She greeted us with a smile and restaurant/activity ideas when we arrived. The cottage is perfect for a weekend getaway for two. We were able to enjoy listening to the waves, drinking coffee on the screen porch, and relaxing by the fireplace heater in the cool of the evening. Breakfast was provided on one day of our stay and Joan made the most delicious food! We enjoyed getting to know her over breakfast and were sad to leave. We look forward to another trip to Erie in the future!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joan is absolutely the sweetest little lady! I could have sat and talked with her all day! And her breakfast was phenomenal! I wanted to ask for her recipe for her French toast souffl√©!

We will definitely be referring others to her, and probably will be back ourselves as well!! This place was heavenly!"

Highly recommend this place!!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous cabin and location. The perfect blend of quiet and the feeling of isolation, yet so close to all kinds of activities and restaurants. Joan is a wonderful host too. She is very thoughtful and makes a yummy French toast. We'll be back!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cottage was great. Our host was amazing and made sure we had everything we needed and ensured that we knew where the best places to go were. Definitely recommend this place for any couples that want to get away for a couple of days and relax while taking in a nice view of the lake and listening to the waves at night.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice place! Perfect for spending time with each other

2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was beyond expectation. Both the cottage and the host made it the most relaxing trip we have taken. Joan‚Äôs knowledge of the area and general ray of sunshine attitude topped off the already tranquil nature of the cabin. I would highly recommend staying here and plan to return in the (hopefully) near future.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent location and space for a relaxing getaway!
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Quiet, private, intimate space. Seamless connection to nature - lake, forests right there. Great covered porch makes for peaceful times!"

2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joan was an amazing hostess. Such a beautiful, serene place to stay. Everything was perfect and the sound of the waves hitting the shore, put you to sleep at night. She even made us a delicious breakfast the morning that we left. I highly recommend staying here and we will definitely return. We left relaxed and refreshed ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,All around 5- Star experience!!
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sitting on the back porch was pure serenity. I highly recommend a stay at this very cute cottage for two people who are visiting Presque Isle.
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing!! It is perfect for couples for a romantic stay at Lake Erie or just a nice quiet stay. If you‚Äôre looking for something more special than a hotel room this is it. It is small in some places, but at 6‚Äô3 I still had enough space. The host is lovely. She took the time to talk with us and teach us about the area. She helped us plan our activities during the trip. The couples cottage is such a gem in every way."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"when visiting the cottage you will be struck with the convenient location yet private, comfortable, clean space"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a very lovely stay at the cottage! It was so charming and clean. The location was quiet and we loved sitting on the porch listening to the waves first thing in the morning and the last thing at night. The mini fridge was stocked with drinks and there was fresh fruit on the counter. A small vase with flowers on the nightstand was such a sweet touch. Outstanding hospitality from Joanfrom the moment we arrived until checkout.
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little cottage is conveniently located for anyone wanting to spend time on Presque Isle. It is clean and comfortable with a screened in porch that allows you to hear the waves of the lake, even tough you can‚Äôt see them. Don‚Äôt expect to be able to access the lake from here by walking, despite how close you are. The cottage sits on top of a steep bank with steps and a walkway down amongst the trees, but no beach access. The owner Joan is wonderful."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super cute, and just as described. A perfect little romantic cottage. So quiet and tucked away, but close enough to town. We loved it!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing time staying in the couple's cottages. After our first night, we were already considering the next time we'd come back. The private (and beautifully decorated) cottage is quiet and cozy, and you can hear the waves lapping on the shore. There's a view of the lake through the trees from the screened in porch, and a nearby set of stairs that leads down to the shore. The location had the best of both worlds. It's very close to a ton of restaurants, shops and the Presque Isle park - but it's also set back a bit from the main road in a quiet residential area.
The hospitality was top notch, we loved talking with the owner, Joan, who was extremely sweet and friendly. We had an awesome homemade breakfast provided by Joan in the main house, where we had some great conversation and received many recommendations for activities and restaurants that helped us have a fantastic weekend.
Altogether - the cottage, location, privacy and hospitality made this a far better value and experience than any of the hotels in the area and we'd highly recommend this to anyone looking for a place in Erie.
Thanks for a great weekend! - Christie & Jesse"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This cottage is truly a retreat to rest and enjoy life. As soon as you walk into this lovely home, you hear the waves of Lake Erie.

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow !! Where do I begin ? The cottage is absolutely perfect! Sparking clean. Decorated with a beachy feel. Joan was so hospitable. The breakfast was AMAZING!! We didn‚Äôt want to leave. Going to sleep and waking up to the sound of crashing waves .. it doesn‚Äôt get any better than that. The enclosed porch was the icing on the cake. Joan had so many recommendations of things to see and do.
They were all spot on ! We can not wait to go back. We can not thank Joan enough. Hope to see you again soon. :)
Thank you Eric and Chris"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great experience! The cottage was a 5-star experience, and will be our go-to when in Erie.

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The best airbnb experience I have ever had. Joan is the loveliest hostess. She cooked my friend and me breakfast the first morning of our stay and we all swapped stories of our lives. Along with this she gave us recommendations of what to do in the area based on what we liked. The cottage was cute and cozy with all the amenities you need for a relaxing weekend. The best part, next to hostess Joan, was being able to hear and see the lake from the back porch. I am greatly considering moving into the little cottage."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect little get away place. Nice view. Excellent screened in porch.

Holly and Bethany provided clear communication and were very responsive - excellent hosts. Easy check-in and check-out. Would definitely rent again when we come back to Erie.
Our recommendations for things to do include Olivers Beer Garden (live music), Perch Pirate fishing charter (walleye), Presque Isle State Park, and Erie Bluffs State Park."

2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a very clean, but minimalistic place to stay, this place is perfect! I will say the bed was not very comfortable and very noisy to move around in, and I found it a bit odd to go searching for a heavier blanket than just a sheet (all that was on the bed), but, the cleanliness of the apartment made up for it! This is most likely the cleanest airbnb I have stayed in!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This is a great stay! The host works with you if you need anything , such as an extended stay. The place is very clean and spacious! Would stay again!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The first thing I want to say, is that Nevena always answered my questions in a timely manner. I was a newcomer to Airbnb, and didn‚Äôt know what to expect so I had lots of questions.
Secondly, the place was exactly as described, and was clean and quiet. Sharing the space with the roommate who lived there was not a problem at all. And Nevena went above and beyond to help me with whatever I needed.
It was a very good first experience!"

The place itself is supremely clean. Perhaps one of the cleanest Air BnBs I have stayed in. Ever.
Add the unbeatable price for a solo traveler on business, this place is tough to beat. I will look for this place again when in town. A great experience all the way around.
P.S. the Erie Food Co-op is amazing. Be sure to check that out when you‚Äôre here."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I had a pleasant stay at Nevena's place for a month. Her house was kept clean, bathroom was nicely decorated. Closed to Bayfront and Downtown Erie. Nevena is timely responsive to my messages and kindly accommodated my requests. The only cons is there's no washer and dryer in house. Otherwise I would recommend her place if you visit Erie"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nevena was a great host; she was responsive!
The house was clean and always warm! The neighborhood is always quiet, day or night.
The only thing I didn‚Äôt like is the off street parking rules but it wasn‚Äôt too difficult to follow. Plus there is always parking spaces available so you don‚Äôt have to worry about the not having a space to park your car."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and had all amenities that I needed for my stay. Easy check in and check out. Plenty of parking on the street and the host responded quickly to my questions!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first time using an airbnb and I had some trepidations, as I am over 7o years. Still the accommodations were great and I had wonderful on going, as needed communication from both Airbnb and the Host. The place itself was nice, modest but spotless. I felt you could eat off the floor.
I did not have a car so finding a restaurant or supermarket nearby was a bit of a challenge. Still for the modest price of the accommodations met my expectations. I would book this location again on future visits to Erie, PA"

2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, clean, spacious place with everything you need! Nevena was very helpful, ready to answer questions and provided suggestions. The other guest was sweet, too. The beach is about a 20 minute drive, and you can rent bicycles, too. Be careful where you park on the street so you don't get a ticket. I'm definitely keeping this spot on my list!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Cozy home with great atmosphere. All the amenities you could need with very comfortable beds! Super easy check in process. Conveniently located between tributaries making it an excellent place to stay for a fishing trip. Also nice added benefit of having tavern within walking distance but parking can get a little tight on weekends. Overall would definitely recommend and hope to make it back sometime!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here over the Xmas holiday. Was very convenient t to family in Fairview. Was very comfortable and spacious. Bedrooms large and really comfortable beds. Jacquie was very quick to respond to any queries or concern. Parking is easy as house is right next to Avonia Tavern and entrance to house right there at parking lot. Wasn‚Äôt noisy as actually tavern was closed 3 out of 4 nights we were there. Food there is great and worth eating there. Not far to Wegmans and Walmart. Kitchen is fairly well equipped. House overall well stocked.- laundry detergent, spices and oil. She also left us a number of snacks as a welcome gift. Most everything is new. We did use the fire pit outside one night and that was lovely. Would plan to stay here again another time."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cathryne was an amazing host, and her in-law suite was just what my boyfriend and I were looking for! Even though the stay is attached to the home, we had great privacy and were able to go in and out with the private entrance. We were able to cook a whole meal in the kitchen, and the amenities were fantastic! Also, the location was great for us as it was a rock throw away from the local golf course, zoo, and grocery stores. It only took us 10-15 minutes to get downtown to the lakefront.
We'll definitely be booking her stay again next time we are in Erie!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house is beautiful. The pictures are 100% accurate, it really is that gorgeous. You are on top of the lake and you can hear it through the entire house with all the windows closed. The owners are also immaculate. They were super responsive the entire time & had no clean up restrictions which is super rare for AirB&B. Lots of gorgeous touches in the home. The only suggestions we could really give would be to add a projector to the downstairs bedroom & maybe another sliding door for bathroom privacy but otherwise perfect. Really exceptional."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Michael was an incredible host! We felt right at home as soon as we walked in, getting in was easy! The place looked gorgeous, spotless and smelled nice! We had fresh baked cookies waiting for us and all the toiletries that we needed! He was also very responsive when it came to questions and messages! We came here for my son‚Äôs soccer tournament which they have annually and we will definitely be back for another stay next year if available! Not a single bad thing to say!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable house! Beautiful neighborhood in a convenient location to all of Erie's best ""stuff to do"". Very clean.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family had a great stay at Michael‚Äôs house in Erie. It was our first time to the city so Michael helped with some recommendations while we were there. He was very responsive, with clear directions given for check in, and the house matched the description. I‚Äôd recommend the space to anyone who is passing through the Erie, PA area. We‚Äôll stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The host made some very welcoming gestures- fresh baked cookies, travel dental hygiene supplies, water bottles left out. He also left us solar eclipse glasses which came in very handy! Additionally he purchased an airbed, new pillows, and bedding. This was his time having rental guests, I believe, so there were a couple tiny kinks as expected such as the address and not knowing to hit # after the number on the keypad, as well as # to lock. But the overall experience was great and we would absolutely recommend it. Gorgeous neighborhood too!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"I enjoyed my stay.
I would recommend this place. Very lovely and peaceful. A wonderful place to relax and enjoy the scenery.
Hosts available by text or call."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was our third stay at this beautiful property. And it just gets better every time. The home lives up to the reviews here and everything is always perfect! Thanks again to Jeff for making sure we had everything we needed for a wonderful stay.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"While the pictures accurately show Jeff & Anne's place, it's not until you are actually there that you take in the beauty & peace of your surroundings. Their position on Lake Erie is breathtaking! The home was well cared for & updated, very comfortable! We had a wonderful time!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,As always great host
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was wonderful. Jeff and Anne were so responsive and accommodating! The water view is why I come to Erie and these were spectacular. The house and surroundings were gorgeous and they thought of every detail. Great location close to wineries and the cute town of north east - would highly recommend! Looking forward to our next getaway at this place - thank you!!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The inside was cozy and perfect. My kids had a blast having our own ‚Äúbeach‚Äù. Lovely neighbors and Jeff explained everything wonderfully.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Loved it. I‚Äôll be back!
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our second stay here, so that should tell you that we really like it. Great hosts, very responsive to any needs. Beautiful, peaceful property and the views of the lake are fantastic. Access to lake and water is an additional plus."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was amazing. My daughter and I, while swimming in the lake, were within 20 feet of a bald eagle fishing."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a very relaxing weekend with beautiful sunsets and views of the lake.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Gorgeous sunsets and great conditions for our paddle boards. Felt like home away from home. Left with memories we will cherish!
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful home! Perfect for our weekend getaway with friends! Jeff was extremely helpful, kind, friendly and accommodating!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"One of our best stays ever...the house is gorgeous but homey, extremely comfortable and cozy. Kitchen better stocked than my own at home! The house was incredibly clean, immaculate. Great space and so many areas to enjoy the spectacular outdoors. Even the outside areas were well stocked...right down to the cushions, S'mores sticks, and citronella candles. The location is ideal....close enough to Erie attractions but far enough away to be peaceful. Wineries abound, Niagara Falls only 90 minutes away. Jeff is incredibly helpful and responsive and you can see the pride and care he and Anne have for the home. The gardens and flowers are delightful and enhance the star of the show which is of course the lake! It was perfect having access to the small lake beach and the water. We took great advantage of that! If you want a little more beach space, there's a small public park and beach 2 miles away. We can't wait to return!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Excellent hosts, beautiful and clean house with beautiful view"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house boasts absolutely gorgeous views of the lake, which you can see from a large, wrap-around back deck and from multiple points inside. We had some inclement weather (and bad air from the Canadian wildfires) on a few days but even from inside, the lake views were incredible. The home is clean and comfortable and our two kids (5 and 8) enjoyed the upstairs loft with two queen beds. There are nearby houses but the neighborhood overall is quiet and peaceful. Highly recommend!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We wanted to getaway for a weekend to see our grandchildren. Jeff and Anne‚Äôs place was wonderful. We had a great time. Our only regret was we didn‚Äôt book longer. The place was clean and very comfortable. Our grandchildren loved playing the ring toss game. We will definitely book again in the future. Thank you very much Anne and Jeff.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a great house for our family vacation this year! The pictures do not do the property justice. The home, the view, and the magnificent gardens make you feel as if you are in an episode of HGTV Home and Garden. The most amazing sunsets can be seen from the decks. Jeff and Anne definitely bring the WOW factor to their guests. They have anticipated their needs and much much more. You truly just need to pack some clothes, and they have the rest handled! The kitchen was well equipped for meals like other reviewers mentioned. Jeff was communicative through the whole booking and I couldn‚Äôt have asked for quicker response times to any questions we had. The street is private (and quiet) and other homeowners nearby friendly. You are smack dab in the middle of wine country so while you have water views from the back porch, you have vineyards to view from the front of home. We will be back. I will echo others reviewers who have said ‚Äú10/10; 5 Stars; just book it‚Äù!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was an amazing stay. The home was exactly as advertised. Very peaceful surroundings and would highly recommend this spot to anyone looking for a relaxing lakeside getaway. Jeff and Anne we're very hospitable. The decor and interior settings were top-notch. The kitchen was stocked with anything you would need to prepare a meal if you choose. They have an excellent grill for cooking out and the patio setup is worth the rental all by itself. We will definitely come back. Loved it, 10/10, 5 Stars!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The house was lovely and provided amazing views of the lake. Very relaxing place to stay.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Jeff and Anne couldn't have been more hospitable and thoughtful. the view of Lake Erie from their house is stunning. we are looking forward to visiting again!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jeff + Anne‚Äôs place was breathtaking! The views were stunning and inside the home was very well kept and you immediately felt comfortable upon arrival. Jeff + Anne included everything you could possibly need during your stay, which we found to be very thoughtful. You could tell they designed their home so you could really enjoy yourself on vacation. Jeff was immediately available for any questions we had about the home and provided many recommendations to suit our family‚Äôs needs.
The walk to the beach area is through a series of steep steps. This was no issue for us and our dog + 4 kids. The kids had a blast digging in the sand and rocks, which provided endless fun for them. This has been our favorite home we have stayed at thus far. Don‚Äôt think twice - book it!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This property was even more beautiful than the pictures! Overlooking the water and a front row view of the sunset! It was gorgeous inside and out and was clearly well cared for. It was clean and had more amenities than a hotel. Jeff and Anne were kind and responsive and checked in on us via text to make sure our stay was going smoothly and offered recommendations for pup friendly beaches in the area. Our dogs, Louis & Piper, loved looking out over the deck to the water and running around the little pebble beach below. Such a relaxing environment they've created. We travel a lot, and this was our favorite airbnb property we've stayed. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Our family reunion at Jeff and Anne's beautiful home was perfect! The house is beautifully appointed and has everything one needs to make special memories! Thank you Jeff and Anne for another wonderful stay at your beautiful home!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jeff was a wonderful host and even came over and put out the hammock and cushions so that we could enjoy them in the wonderful weather. My in-laws enjoyed being on the main level and having their own bathroom. The views were spectacular; very quiet and peaceful. Very comfy and the kitchen was well stocked. We hope to plan a trip next Spring.
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Jeff and Anne‚Äôs place is a perfect place to call home! You don‚Äôt even have to step outside to enjoy the gorgeous view . Lake Erie weather can be unpredictable, but no matter! The gas fireplace makes for a cozy stay from the oversized recliner inside the floor to ceiling glass view of the lake inside!
There is not a better stocked kitchen out there‚Ä¶and the beds are all very comfortable!
The deck and porch area are covered and inviting w rockers, a table and chairs for eating, and chairs for lounging. We will be back to enjoy the well appointed home & location again in the gorgeous natural surroundings :)"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Absolutely stunning views. Great location to relax. Place was well stocked with everything you could need including an ample amount of booze.

There was snacks and drinks. We definitely recommend this destination. It exceeds expectation and worth every dime. Thank you Jeff & Anne."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Felt like we were at home, but better! The house was truly immaculate and the ambience was amazing - in every single room! There are so many beautiful touches that have been put into this home. House is quiet and peaceful. The owners Jeff & Anne are beyond generous! Stocked bar, coffee, snacks, ect.. Everything in abundance. Bedding was beautiful and super comfortable. In fact, every seat was comfortable! Views were spectacular from the deck and from inside, but you know that from the pictures. Even better in person. And the second bedroom also has a view of the water from the side window. There are televisions in all 3 rooms, but we never turned one on. The music, the views and our laughter were enough for us! When we are back in the Pennsylvania area, this is the place we will always stay. Thank you to the owners! You clearly care about your guests and it showed in everything you did to make our stay so very special!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Words can not do this place justice. This house is in the perfect location with views that are priceless. Jeff & Anne went above and beyond with their hospitality. I‚Äôve stayed in plenty Air BnB‚Äôs and hands down this was the best one.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We've never stayed at a lake house on lake Erie, this stay has made this now part of our annual travel. We stayed at the beginning of fall, it's a beautiful house with a gorgeous view and exceedingly generous host. The town or North East is quant and everyone is so nice. I didn't even touch on the wine, this is a stay you'll not regret."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second visit to this amazing property. Jeff and Anne have thought of everything you‚Äôll need for a wonderful and relaxing stay. The views of Lake Erie from the house and deck are incredible with beautiful sunsets and golden eagles soaring overhead. Comfy beds, beautiful landscaping, a huge family room and a well-equipped kitchen complete the picture! We‚Äôre already looking forward to our next stay!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jeff and Ann were great hosts! This place truly feels like a home away from home - it comes with everything that you would possibly need during the stay. The welcome wine, snacks, stocked fridge are cherries on top! The owners decorated the place with taste and love, would definitely love to come back one day!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Gorgeous views. Soaring eagles. English cottage landscaping. Propane fire pit along with wood burning fire pit, made evenings very enjoyable.
Beautiful master suite.
Great upstairs with two queen beds.
Beach access requires walking down 40 steps to the beach, but once there it‚Äôs amazing."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful home and everything is so tastefully decorated! The hosts truly thought of everything you could possibly need or want. There were tasty snacks, local wine, and even beer on tap! The views are incredible! You won't ever want to leave! The house is cozy and so special. We had a wonderful time there and can't wait to return."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jeff and Anne have created a beautiful and welcoming home in the most stunning location. We had a perfect week and created some amazing family memories. They have thought of everything you might need during your stay. The kitchen is fully stocked with quality appliances, dishes, utensils and cookware. The bathrooms are beautifully updated, living space is extremely comfortable and spacious and the beds/bedding are top notch. Truly our favorite home of all we've stayed in over the years. My only complaint is that time flew by and our week came to an end...we will definitely return to this idyllic home!!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying at Jeff and Anne‚Äôs place! The view of the lake was amazing. The house is adorable and cozy! We stayed during a winter storm and the fireplace kept us nice and warm - Jeff also went above and beyond checking in on us to make sure we were happy and had everything we needed!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jeff was the best! We had two questions while we were staying and he responded to our texts immediately. The house is absolutely beautiful and the view of the lake is amazing. Well-equipped kitchen and easy to follow instructions for just about everything you‚Äôd need.
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is an absolutely beautiful place, and Jeff and Anne have stocked it with everything you could need (and more!) for a wonderful vacation! We were blown away by the property and view, and Jeff was very responsive when we had questions. Check in was a breeze, and we loved that it was dog friendly! This is a must-stay if you want to check out Lake Erie and Presque Isle!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place in a fantastic location with incredible views. Super hosts who are genuinely interested in you having a great experience. Highly recommended.
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,We just had a Girls Trip to this Beautiful home. It is so welcoming and the view is just spectacular! We truly did not want to leave!! Beds were super comfy and they truly have everything you could possibly need!! We especially loved sitting by the fire at night! We took drove to Chatauqua Lake Institute which was about a 1/2 hour away and just had the best time there too! Would give it 10 stars if I could!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home with an amazing view. Immaculately clean, and feels like a home away from home. Would move there in a heartbeat. Can sit there and watch the lake from sunrise till long after sunset, and never tire. Owners are pleasant, helpful, and reasonable. Nearby restaurant, short drive to town for provisions, and reasonably close to Erie for a ton of activities. Also close to Niagara. Went to both, loved it. Would definitely visit again."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home and beautiful view. Highly recommend!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We've all heard the rule, if it seems too good to be true, it usually is. This is the exception to that rule. It looked too good to be true online, but when we got there, it was even better. The place is immaculate, incredibly well-maintained, fully stocked and absolutely beautiful. This is what every AirBnB should be. The hosts are friendly and responsive. It is simply not possible to say enough good things to convey how lovely everything was."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful house and location on Lake Erie. Loved the sight lines of lake views from inside and outside the house. Hosts provide good communication and ensure needs are met. Very nice area.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,You can tell Jeff & Anne put a lot of love into their property. Nice calming lakefront views for a quick getaway.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our second visit to Jeff and Anne‚Äôs place (first was last July) and their place did not disappoint!
The house is clean and well appointed. Our family of 4 (2 adults and 2 teens) felt very comfortable in their home. The views of the lake, from the downstairs and the upstairs, were breathtaking. The views give you an immediate sense of calm which is why we had to come back for another stay! There are also 3 TVs (1 in LR, 1 in MBR, and 1 upstairs). We didn‚Äôt use MBR or upstairs ones too much but definitely appreciated watching a family movie or playing some games in the living room (we brought our Nintendo Switch and hooked it up).
The outside deck space, garden, and lawn area makes you feel like you are tucked away in a private resort. You can also hear the waves from the lake which for me was an added bonus. We could watch the eagles flying by, other various birds like cardinals and humming birds, butterflies, and of course at night, so many fireflies. We enjoyed using their corn hole game and Kubb game on the lawn. Also thoroughly enjoyed s‚Äômores in their campfire area. The gas grill is really nice too and conveniently located to the kitchen and one of the outdoor seating areas.
Lake Erie was really refreshing and not cold! We enjoyed using the inner tubes we brought. (Didn‚Äôt get a chance to use their kayaks this time but enjoyed using them last time.) All of us enjoyed exploring the different types of rocks and of course, seeing who could skip them the farthest. Jeff and Anne have plastic Adirondack chairs you can bring down to the beach which we enjoyed using.
But, of course, the ultimate bonus of their place, is the sunsets. Despite a rainier kind of week, we had sunsets almost every night. Even got to watch storms blow through in the late afternoon, and then still got a sunset. We were sad to leave today but can‚Äôt wait to return."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Rarely are expectations exceeded, however this lake house blew me away. The views are breathtaking. The yard is gorgeous. The house is so inviting. I‚Äôve gotten more comments than ever before on Instagram pictures. Friends from California are amazed that this beauty is so close to Buffalo. I hope to stay here again next summer!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Just spent the July 4th weekend at this house and had the best time! The view and sunsets are gorgeous. The house is well appointed and comfortable. Jeff is a thoughtful and helpful host. So many places to sit and enjoy the flower gardens and the eagles. We appreciated the extra touches, too, from pretty bouquets to snacks to kcups and creamer. We‚Äôve stayed at a lot of homes and this one was just extra special. Thank you!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Couldn‚Äôt decide if it was 51 steps DOWN to heaven (or UP). Yep, we counted. It was BOTH.
Gardens and sunsets are incredible‚Äîviewed inside (by wall of windows) or outside by deck overhang, wrap-around porch or beach/kayaks below.
Indoor & outdoor spaces are far MORE than description or pics. A lot of unexpected extras. There are plenty seating options‚Äîboth inside and out. Comfortable bed, couches, Sonos, kayaks & dog-friendliness! I could go on and on.
Loved every minute! We typically don‚Äôt spend that much on any ‚Äúlocal‚Äù vaca, but SO worth it!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Jeff & Anne‚Äôs place right on the lake is absolutely breathtaking. It was incredibly clean, the beds were very comfortable & they had just about every pot, pan, dish & silverware available for when we cooked a few of our own meals. Their outdoor space is amazing. And we even ventured down into the water, which was great to cool off on a hot day. Could not recommend their place more. They were great hosts!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely breath-taking views, fully stocked bar + kitchen... beautiful garden, huge deck. All the amenities... You won't be disappointed staying at Jeff & Anne's gorgeous lake house!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This beautiful lake house has so many things that will wow you!! We loved the wrap around deck off the living room that gave us spectacular views of sunsets over the lake. The grounds are beautiful landscaped with so many gorgeous flowers. Located in the heart of many popular wine vineyards and other sights to see. We found the home to be beyond what we expected, so well equipped and so welcoming. We loved the sounds of lake singing songs to us. We invited a couple over for dinner one night and we had a fantastic time entertaining them. I cooked some delicious steaks on the Weber gas grill and they turned out awesome. This home really has the wow factor!!!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I spent a week to celebrate our anniversary at this phenomenal location. Everything was exactly as promised: The house was clean, the amenities (including beer on tap!!) were as promised, and the view is spectacular from multiple locations around the house. There's solid internet, WiFi and cellular service. It was a little pricier than we would normally spend, but well worth it. It was an excellent experience and I couldn't recommend it more highly!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,An amazing home with amazing views. Plus the added bonus of a lovely town just near by. Would certainly recommend this house.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous lake house with stunning views of Lake Erie. Even though our April visit was pretty cold (with even some snow), we enjoyed looking at the lake from every room in the house as well as from the deck."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If you‚Äôre considering this property, don‚Äôt hesitate... book it! Views, ambiance, comfort, all the right touches - it checks all the right boxes. Jeff is an exceptionally attentive, friendly, anticipatory host. We had a great experience with the home and host and highly recommend it!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jeff was a perfect host! The house is beautiful and the view is really breathtaking. Jeff has thought of everything - there was nothing we could have needed! Best way to experience Lake Erie, PA wine country and snuggle time with the family!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This lake view house is a dream. The living room offers a breathtaking view of the Lake. The house had thoughtful touches all around. Jeff was a pleasure to communicate with, providing all the guidance one could need. Highly recommend this property if you are in the area."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Amazing Host! Amazing Place! Amazing Views! This was a place I never wanted to leave and can‚Äôt wait to return. Most comfortable bed and sitting area. Largest TV I have ever seen. This place has everything. The hosts we so amazing and catered to any questions or requests. We loved sitting on the extended deck watching the sunsets and bald eagles. If you are lucky enough to book this place, do it immediately you won‚Äôt regret it!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"After months with family underfoot, I was in much need of a solo getaway. It had to be driving distance from home, and it had to have a view. Jeff‚Äôs place fit the bill perfectly. The house is well appointed, the kitchen is well stocked, and the house was super clean and inviting. But, the real star is the VIEW! Just sitting and watching the lake was so soothing. The outdoor space is made for entertaining, and I am already planning a trip back with friends! I‚Äôve rented all over the US, and this house might be my favorite so far. Don‚Äôt hesitate to rent this place, it will not disappoint!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Unbelievable view - the sunsets from the property over the lake are amazing. You'll love the house - many areas to relax indoors and outdoors.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family had a fantastic trip staying at Jeff's beautiful home. The house itself is well-appointed, thoughtfully designed, and comfortable throughout. Jeff has thought of everything guests need to be comfortable and enjoy the home - whether having plentiful towels for the beach, a well-stocked kitchen and pantry, or leaving a copy of the local paper and a bottle of wine from a vineyard down the road for us on the kitchen counter. The house was spotless upon our arrival. The furnishings are fashionable and fresh, and many pieces seemed brand new.
The real treasure for this property is the outdoor space and lakefront - outside the house are beautiful manicured gardens, various distinct outdoor areas for lounging or dining, a table with a gas fireplace and a handsome fire pit, a new gas grill, and lots of open space for corn hole or other games. We loved spending time outside, playing games, watching the sun set over Lake Erie, and having our morning coffee by the outdoor gas fireplace.
We spent a lot of time in the home, though Jeff also shared a number of helpful tips for places of interest in and around North East, and we were delighted by the area. The region is beautiful, with vineyards everyone; as you head towards the home you'll have great views of the grapes settling into the hillside overlooking the water. We spent a half-day at nearby Presque Isle State Park, and had an entire beach to ourselves, and also went to a vineyards, the ice cream shop in town, and the local beach 2 miles down the road.
Jeff and his wife were always accessible and communicative before and during our stay, and very gracious throughout. We had a great stay and were extremely satisfied - in all ways - with this home."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing! You cannot beat the view. I was on the porch for the majority of the trip. Jeff thought of everything to include in the place. We will definitely be back!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We approached this trip during a pandemic with anxiety. We wanted a clean space with lots of outdoor spaces easily accessible for our toddler grandson and dog. We needed to feel safe joining our son, daughter-in-law and grandson for the first time in 9 months so we needed two bedrooms and baths and good ventilation. Jeff's home met all our needs. We were able to cook at home and sit outside in various places as we watched sunsets, ate meals, and enjoyed each other. The lake breezes allowed us to keep air circulating when we sat inside and the lovely landscaping kept neighbors away. The views of Lake Erie and the eagles soaring overhead were spectacular. This was the perfect place for us at this time. We are grateful to have found it!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home, great views and great hospitality. Highly recommended"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing time here--it was exactly the refuge we needed during these times. The house is beautiful, the view and the Lake are beautiful and it's a lovely space you don't really want to leave. The house was clean and felt COVID safe with lots of sanitizer and disinfectant around, which allowed us to enjoy ourselves.
We spent time at the house, visited Niagara Falls for a fun change one day and played lawn games on the grass. The hammock in the sun is all it is cracked up to be, and building a fire and roasting some marshmallows was a fun, summer time.
And we had some unexpected glitches with some unexpected construction--not worth going into the details, as the point of mentioning them was that Jeff was a gracious, upfront host. He called us when he realized there would be some issues and we worked through them with him. We felt he was fair and honest and appreciated our situation as we appreciated his. It worked out, and we all ended the week feeling good about it. Credit to him for being straight with us and offering enough flexibility that we wanted to reciprocate in kind."
2020-07-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home, nicely appointed, great view/location and flowers throughout the property. However, the host was not clear on communicating several issues related to our stay, including the fact that he didn't abide by the AirBnB COVID-19 cleaning protocol (namely - there wasn't a 24-hour vacancy in between bookings; we had the house the same day another family had vacated it)."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Jeff and Anne‚Äôs place is like a dream. We expected that this would be a nice trip to just get away and have a different view for 8 days. Not only was it that but the pictures just don‚Äôt do it justice. Although there are neighbors you still feel like you are in a very private spot. The waves crash very loudly some days so you can‚Äôt hear anything but what you are doing. And even on calmer days you only hear very little from the neighbors. But the neighbors are sweet too and if you do encounter them you‚Äôll be fine too :-) The house is decorated very chic with beach/lakehouse vibes and the bar is very neat too. We enjoyed trips down to the rocky beach every day and the sunsets at night are breathtaking. If you enjoy star gazing‚Äîit‚Äôs fairly dark out there so the stars are extra bright without city lights to dull them. We didn‚Äôt want to leave. It was everything we hoped it would be and more. We hope to return!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jeff‚Äôs home is very charming inside and out. The inside of the home was very clean, comfortable, well decorated, and packed with amenities.
We enjoyed playing games on the front lawn and eating s‚Äômores by the fire pit. We also spent a lot of time down by the water. There is a flat/smooth slab of rock under a shady willow tree where we would sit in our chairs and watch the kids play, as the gentle waves came in. Also used the 2 kayaks to explore the shoreline. There were fishing poles and bikes in the garage but we ended up not using them.
The views of the water from inside and outside the house are breathtaking. The deck space outside is extensive. There are so many different areas to just sit and relax. The landscaping is quite beautiful and very lush. The grill on the upper deck is brand new and was put to good use. There is another gas fire pit on the upper deck and a separate table to eat. Our favorite spot was on the front deck in the Adirondack chairs watching the sun set. Our kids are already asking when we can come back!
In addition to a great house, Jeff was a fantastic host. He was very responsive via phone or text. And offered many ideas to explore the area. We even took a drive to Niagara Falls for the day, per his recommendation. Also stopped at Duff‚Äôs Famous Wings, along the way, in Buffalo, which we recommend doing.
Would definitely stay here again!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family loved all of the amenities and your home was spotless!!! We loved watching the eagles and making memories of collecting beach glass, family time, and the sunsets were an added bonus!!!!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had an excellent time. The home was beautiful, clean and full of amenities. The view was gorgeous! We want to come stay again!!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is not your run-of-the-mill vacation rental property. This beautiful lake front home located just minutes from North East Pennsylvania has every amenity that you could ask for. The interior of the home and the grounds that surrounded are beautiful.
Be prepared for stunning views every morning and every evening. And if you‚Äôre feeling adventurous and there are two kayaks and two bicycles available.
Visit the numerous wineries along Highway 5. A marina is located approximately a mile East with a restaurant and fishing charters available
We had a wonderful supper at the skunk and goat Tavern in town. The kitchen has all of the necessary features and gadgets if you choose to stay in and cook. A three burner grill is available as well.
If I could rate this place higher than 5 stars I would!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What treat! Jeff's place on the bluffs of Lake Erie delivered on all levels. The location puts you in the heart of wine country. And between the wineries and the awesome lake views we found ourselves staying close by. No need to go far when you are at a house set up for pampering and relaxation. There were so many little touches that made this place welcoming, from a bouquet of roses greeting us (picked from the rose garden) to the rockers overlooking the lake (perfect for the morning tea or evening wine) and the gardens tended to with care. Everything was beautiful, plush and picture perfect. I felt like I was staying in the home of a friend.
As an artist, it was great to witness and try to capture the many faces of Lake Erie (she can change quickly)! As avid bird watchers, we felt privileged to see so many eagles! It was also a great place to witness the fall migration of the Monarch butterfly. We counted well over 50 on the morning of our departure.
It was a perfect place for a getaway and I am feeling rested and refreshed from being there."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome experience! Beautiful home, amazing views, and pure delight!!! Jeff is extremely good at communicating throughout the process. The house is stunning! Very excellent, high quality, comfortable furnishings both inside and out. The landscaping is amazing. The views of, and access to Lake Erie, are also excellent. Jeff and Anne have thought of everything with so many extra amenities available. One cannot be ay this Lake House and not enjoy it! I am very grateful to have had the opportunity to spend time here. Thank you so very much Jeff and Anne for sharing your piece of paradise."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home on the lake where you can see the water right out the large front windows. Spacious and well equipped. Comfy bed. Big cozy rockers on the deck. Everything you could need. So relaxing to hear the water.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home, awesome view, we had a wonderful time"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This lake house is EVERYTHING we wanted for a long weekend escape! Spectacular views, amazing accommodations and so convenient! We can't wait to return! We have stayed on the lake in North East before, but this place is so welcoming we will be back!"
2019-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home and view! Had an amazing experience. Would recommend for any family wanting a couple days away!
2019-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome stay at Jeffrey's beach home. I highly recommend booking this place for all your Lake Erie's visits!! Oh, and the wine tours ROCK!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Jeffery's place is gorgeous, and idyllic. And that is not an exaggeration. It was beyond what I expected from the pictures and description. There are 3 beds (1 king, 2 queen) and I always expect the ""3rd bed"" to be a pullout. He has two queens beautifully arranged in the upstairs open space and a king in the master. Everything was clean, he invited us to use what we needed. The gardens are spectacular, and we saw 3 bald eagles. My first ever, and I grew up on the west side of Erie. There were six of us, all adult friends gathered for a reunion-type weekend. We had an amazing time and all highly recommend this place for a fun weekend of catching up and exploring the surrounding area (walking through the gardens of the St. Benedect monastery was a highlight.)"
2019-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Lovely views. An excellent spot for an escape to the lake. Gorgeous sunsets and a beautiful home. Extremely accommodating and helpful host.
2019-06-01,5.0,Group trip,This was my first Air Bnb experience and I couldn‚Äôt think of a better couple to do business with. Jeff and his wife have set up the most welcoming space and gave my family a vacation that we will never forget. We can‚Äôt wait to go back!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Mackenzie she was a very attentive host! Always responsive and made us feel right at home! 10/10 would recommend staying and we plan to rent again on our next trip!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Next level attention to detail, cleanliness, and convenience. Mackenzie, you're a pro! Looking forward to staying here again."
2024-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Fantastic, beautiful home! Updated throughout, with every amenity we needed and more! The home was organized and well appointed, with everything we could possibly need in the kitchen.
Hope to stay here again!!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mackenzie's place was just what we hoped for. We were only there 2 nights, but it was just as described and perfect for us. The house is clean, well lit, and has great instructions. The coffee bar was cute and appreciated! The shower had amazing pressure, too. It was a little noisy near the highway and railroad tracks, but inside the house the noise was softened and didn't disturb our sleep. Overall, it was a very pleasant stay and we would book again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"absolutely beautiful, seriously so worth it and so clean! The beds are amazing, best comforter I've ever used!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing property with all the amenities you need and beautifully decorated - incredible attention to detail throughout. The host was very responsive and we loved the house. Best property and experience I've ever had, and hope to return in the future."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a great location in Erie. The house was exactly as described and had all the amenities we needed and more. MacKenzie was very accommodating and always responded to messages promptly. I hope to stay hete again when we visit Erie again.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was perfect
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a short weekend to celebrate my Daughters 14th birthday. Her friend and her loved the house so much that they just wanted to stay and order in food. This was a beautiful stay and we wish it could have been longer!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything about booking & staying at The Cozy Cottage is excellent. The place is clean & very cozy. Enjoy the information you provide for the guests on what Erie has to offer. Thank You!!!!!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay in Erie! It was absolutely spotless and had everything we could have needed. Perfect weekend getaway for the family!

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had wonderful stay in Erie thanks to The Cozy Gray Cottage. It was the cleanest rental we‚Äôve ever stayed in, hands down. The house was beautifully updated and meticulously cared for. The accommodations were very comfortable for a family of four. Mackenzie was professional and incredibly friendly to deal with."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at the Cozy Gray Cottage. It was absolutely perfect for our family of four. It had everything you needed and more and very comfortable beds. The house is decorated beautifully. So much so that I kept asking the host where she got stuff. Speaking of host, Mackenzie was very responsive. It was Christmas and my kids were away from their home and she even decorated the house for Christmas, down to a beautiful tree. I booked another trip already for when we visit my family in the summer and this will now be our go to house to book anytime we come to Erie. Thank you for hosting us!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved the cozy grey cottage! My 5 year old wanted to stay. She loved the games provided. The home felt like a home away from home!
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Fantastic little cottage, enough room for 5 adults. I was so thankful Mackenzie even thought of stocking the house with a steamer! My dress for graduation did not travel well and I was so happy I didn‚Äôt have to be wrinkled! The holiday decore was a great touch. Beds are amazing!!!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Absolutely fabulous! Super super clean and cute! Loved all of the fabulous little touches. I would highly recommend the cozy grey cottage! Mackenzie responded quickly to my questions and was happy to help. We could not have asked for a better stay. Thank you Mackenzie!!
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"The cozy gray cottage was the perfect location for a girls wine weekend getaway to Erie! Perfect location, close to wineries, Romolo chocolates, the beach for walking. The communication with Mackenzie was so perfect, she was quick to respond to all questions. The place was extremely clean and well kept and had all the amenities you could possibly need. Would highly recommend and will definitely be back!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"A beautifully restored home with every convenience we needed for a mother daughter shopping weekend (we worried about only 1 bathroom in the home however, we managed just fine)! Super comfortable and larger than the pictures depicted; hopefully our newly found accommodation for our future annual trips! Thank you for a great experience :)"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Had the most amazing stay. Had everything we needed. Check in was easy. Communication was great. Definitely recommend üíØ
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was perfect for our little Family! Plenty of space, cozy, had everything we needed, and close

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As someone who does residential remodel as a job, this place is beautiful!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"The little gray cottage was perfect for our fishing trip and it was exactly as described. 4 adults, 2 teenage boys, and a 4 mo. old infant. The house was spotless and had everything we needed. Lots of extra bedding, pillows, towels, and super stocked kitchen. Mackenzie was proactive providing a lot of organized details from where to eat/shop to exactly what belonged where in every cupboard. The shower had great pressure and lasted long enough with hot water for several to shower after a long day. The only thing that may affect some groups is the single bathroom. If you plan for everyone to come back from a long day of being out and about...it might be difficult for all to shower and get ready to head out together for dinner. Wasn't a problem for us, because we ate all of our meals at the house and just relaxed there the rest of the evening! Location is minutes from Presque Isle State Park and a perfect central location for all of the creeks to steelhead fish. 15 m to Poor Richard's."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great house and location. Super clean and comfortable.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable beds and clean house.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family booked Mackenzie's home for a week vacation to Erie and we loved every minute! The home is warm and inviting, organized, super clean, and a fantastic location. The backyard was a fan favorite for not only my three year old daughter, but also my parents who loved sitting under the tree in the Adirondack chairs. The beds were so comfortable and naps were enjoyed by all throughout the week. Mackenzie was always super quick to respond to questions I had before, during, and after our visit. We will definitely book this home again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Adorable & immaculately clean space! Great host! Thank you! :-)
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful cottage and perfect for our family of six! Cute, clean, and cozy... this was exactly as pictured. Plenty of space with thoughtful touches such as snacks, waters, coffee, beach towels, plenty of hooks, hammock in the yard, comfy beds, and a great shower. Host was very communicative and friendly. We would absolutely stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Mackenzie‚Äôs place was absolutely perfect for our family getaway. It is minutes away from anything & everything. The state park was close by and had lots of great fishing for our son. The space itself is extremely clean and very comfortable. I‚Äôm a big stickler about beds especially and they were all extremely comfortable. Mackenzie was very flexible with us and allowed us to check in early which was very kind of her. She left us snacks & water which was very thoughtful. We highly recommend!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home was above and beyond what we expected. Beautiful decor and spotlessly clean! The welcome snacks and amenities such as paper products, laundry pods, garbage bags, etc were a wonderful touch and it was so nice to not need to pack them. The home is only a few minutes from the entrance to Presque Isle park which made it an easy drive to get to the beach. Mackenzie was very helpful in figuring out the park hours and quickly responded to messages. The recommendations listed in their in home and online guidebook helped us choose great restaurants. We will absolutely be staying again!"

A quick drive to Presque Isle beaches and they did not disappoint! I would definitely recommend staying here the next time you're in Erie!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"For a girls getaway it was perfect, we biked Presque isle and ate at local eateries she suggested as well as some wonderful wineries. We had the best time. We felt safe, it was private and mostly quiet ( some construction going on next door) but that's not typical. The only suggestion I would have is maybe putting in a bike rack (since your so close to Presque isle) so we could lock up our bikes there instead of carting them with us but other than that it was perfect."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Worked perfectly for our needs.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"So, we had a wide variety of reactions to our stays this vacation.
This place calls for your best Keanu-Reeves-in-the-Matrix impersonation.
WHOA.
Sort of a mix between an AirB&B rental and a ""World of Tomorrow"" (or today if you're tech-savvy) exhibit, this place was just cool beyond words. MIGHT be a bit overwhelming for the luddite/analog type, but I kept trying stuff out because seemingly every tech trick in the book was in use. Most fun I've had in an overnight stay in a while.
That being said, a LOT of old-school thought went into making this a comfortable and welcoming place to stay, even when you're not fiddling with the LED patterns. Corey is a host, not just a property owner.
Erie is a town where you want to know your neighborhoods, but this place is fine, on a secluded cul-de-sac next to the lake. Clearly, neighbors have your back.
Fully functional for those seeking more than an overnight.
If we're ever ending the day in this area again, this will be our first choice."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Corey's house on the hill was beautiful and inviting. Corey was incredibly responsive and helpful. If in the area again id absolute stay here again!

We made an incredible memory at this house observing April 8th eclipse, one none of us will forget. We all Thank Cory for this and being such an outstanding host! Cory was always there for us with a quick answer. He also provided some eclipse memorabilia, an added extra touch.
I would recommend staying at this house for any of your Erie adventures!
üôÇ"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Corey's place was wonderful! We chose this house while on spring break visiting Erie, PA. We enjoyed the short drives to Millcreek Mall, Play Port Arcade, Presque Isle and great places to eat.
Corey suggested that we park in the alley and use the back door entrance due to our luggage. He gave me detailed instructions and sent a photo to make it easy to find, which we did with no problem!
A ton of updated amenities and the 1st Smart house we've had the pleasure to stay in. Everything was as he stated in the description. Corey provided a binder with a ton of useful information. We loved all the personal touches, and the privacy was amazing! Our daughter loved the office! She was comfortable in there with her stuffed animals and tablet, cozied up with a blanket on the couch.
We felt very safe in the neighborhood and there were no disturbances during our stay. I would recommend Corey's home to friends, and we hope to stay here again in upcoming years!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed at Corey's place over New Years Eve after catching a comedy show at Kellar's so we wouldn't have to drive home on a night that's questionable. Everything was clean and well maintained! It was perfect for a quiet night in as the location is peaceful and is a short walk from the waterfront, but only a short drive to the offerings of downtown. I would highly recommend Corey's place to other traveler's, especially for people who have time to explore what Erie has to offer, since he so thoughtfully leaves a binder with recommendations of thins to do and restuarants to try as a starting point. Truly a great stay!"

Easy access to nearby eateries for breakfast or lunch. We weren't in the apartment a lot, but the beds and couches were very comfortable and the kitchen was cute, clean and well-equipped. Nice back yard also. Check in with code was no problem and Carly was attentive via messaging. Great stay."

,,,"When we first arrived, we loved the property. The cabin was beautiful and the amenities were amazing. The cabin is very spacious with a fully functioning kitchen and a cozy loft space to sleep in. Our first night was great, but on the second morning we noticed a foul smell. The smell lingered for hours and progressively got worse over time. By the late evening the entire house smelled like sewer gas. We tried opening all the windows and running the fans but the smell would not go away. It became unbearable and we had to cut our stay short, leaving at 1am. We all were starting to feel extremely ill and by the time we left, the smell was so strong we had to cover our mouths and noses to pack up our belongings, as it smelled like we were in a sewer. We contacted the host but were denied any sort of refund. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend staying here."
,,,"NO PRIVACY. huge windows facing renters house which is 10 feet away from cabin, when in description is stated 250 feet. They will look through your windows too, and in fact call the cops on you over cbd"
