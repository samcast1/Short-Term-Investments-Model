Two points to the potential guest - there is no door on the bedroom, and the door to the bathroom (sliding) doesn't totally cover the opening. My kids would yell, ""I'm going to the bathroom, no one go to the hallway"" to make sure they had privacy."

2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful and so cute. Very classic AirBnB feel. The only things we didn‚Äôt like was the 2nd bed was on the floor and the only access to it was through the only bathroom.

It was so much easier & nicer for us to have a house than 2 hotel rooms. Everyone had a bedroom that was their domain. The house was perfect, recently updated to currrent/modern appliances & decor. Every single kitchen gadget & appliances you could think of was there. We greatly appreciated being allowed to use some pantry staples, but tried to be mindful not to use it all. The butter, ketchup & whipped cream were used a lot. The Kerig was constantly in use & all of the syurps, creamers & toppings were so awesome, including sugar free/keto options. The host also left me a graduation present which was unexpected & lovely! The beds were super comfortable! The shower was hot, excellent water pressure. The house was spotless.

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"You'll never find a better AirBNB host than Andrelle! Andrelle's Place is clean, comfortable, and fully stocked throughout with everything you would ever find in a personal home. If you should need anything at all during your stay, Andrelle is super responsive and ready to help. Family ""whatnots"" in every room made the house feel just like home. And I could have eaten a baker's dozen of the heart-healthy blueberry muffins she had waiting for me on my arrival! I saw a group of deer going across the open field behind the house one day, a red-headed woodpecker on the tree you can see from the kitchen window, and redbirds on the ground right behind the house eating bird seed - a nice back-to-nature experience for someone who's been living in the middle of a bazillion people in southern California for many years! Definitely an excellent option for a home away from home if you need a place to stay in West Tennessee."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Warm, cozy, and inviting. Really neat little place with antiques and interesting things everywhere you look. All the info we needed was provided in a timely manner and Debbie was very responsive. Really close to restaurants. People who don‚Äôt get around well may find the floor and little step ups/downs and high beds challenging, but for those that don‚Äôt have any problems it adds to the charm. We would definitely stay here again if back in the area."

The creative ways they used to create updates in an older cabin was amazing!
Debbie was exceptionally friendly and helpful!
We really enjoyed her home!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very cute home at the edge of town. It was below freezing outside but when I arrived it was the perfect temperature inside. The cabin must be well insulated because I never felt a draft or heard any noise from the highway. Fun and eclectic decor, and very comfortable furniture. Would be good for a weekend family getaway."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super cute cabin loaded with character and charm. The price is really good. Extremely clean. I highly recommend this accommodation.

We‚Äôll be back .
Thank you soo much Debbie !"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Oh my goodness, where to begin? Mam‚Äôs Place exceeded our expectations in so many ways! The pictures don‚Äôt do it justice at all.
The home is tastefully designed and decorated, filled with old treasures which are both prominently displayed and also tucked into nooks and crannies. One of the best parts of our stay was exploring and discovering new treasures every time we turned around. Debbie says that each one has a story. We want to return and ask her to tell us about them. It is clear that a great deal of love and care has been poured into this home.
Debbie was very friendly and responsive and her place is very clean, comfortable and all-around good quality. The layout of some of the interior architecture is unique and an interesting use of space.
We travel often and have stayed in 55+ different Airbnbs and this is one of the best experiences we‚Äôve ever had. Highly recommended! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is the sweetest place! Comfy beds, absolutely awesome decor! Close to everything we needed. Debbie is amazing, so thoughtful! Will stay here every time we travel to Martin!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Debbie was precious! Responded quickly and even followed up after we checked out. Martin is such a sweet town and Mam's Place was like a walk back in time. Love all the antique finds and extra personal touches. She even had the exterior and interior decorated for fall.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I wanted a place to get away and unwind. I liked the location being just outside town. It was a very short drive into town and it was great to have Debbie's suggestions on places to visit. It is a beautiful town with plenty of wonderful places to eat, shop, or just view.
The owners wove an interesting history of the cabin I rented. Staying in a cabin that was built in 1819 was awesome. Two days was not enough to learn about the cabin, let alone, the city."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Mam‚Äôs House was a memorable trip! The house was very clean, in a great location (less than 10 minutes from UTM campus), it has a nice yard for kids to run, cold ac units, nice tv, comfy couch and it was decorated so cute. Was if the best nights sleep or the best shower I‚Äôve ever had, no‚Ä¶.but I‚Äôd definitely stay here again! The floors were a bit wonky so I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place to the elderly or anyone who isn‚Äôt sure footed, and it‚Äôs not really suited for toddlers either. Kitchen was pretty well stocked, lots of bath towels, extra blankets, lots of hooks, nice sized fridge, hangers in the closet area were convenient and the homemade soaps were a nice touch too! We enjoyed our 2 night stay!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a charming place! A rustic cabin with decor and touches from the past and extras like specialty soaps, it was a perfect place for our brief stay. It‚Äôs clear that Debbie, the owner, takes pride in Mam‚Äôs Place and wants you to have the best experience possible there."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I cannot say enough about Debbie our host and our stay at Mam's House. Not only was the place perfect for our getaway, but we had a family emergency during our stay and had to be at the hospital all night, only getting back to the cabin around 6 am. We called Debbie and asked if we could stay later to get some rest, and even though she had another customer coming in after us, Debbie was so gracious to give a few extra hours to get some much needed rest! She was so generous and gracious and put herself at an inconvenience to accommodate our situation. If anyone is in the Martin area, I highly recommend using Debbie as a host and staying at Mam's house! We will definitely be back."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved staying at Mam's. It was the perfect place to come back to after dropping the kiddo at college.

Thank you Debbie for opening up your home to us.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay at Mam's House! Debbie was extremely responsive and helpful with the booking process (this was our first ever Airbnb stay!). She even messaged to let us know we would be able to get into our place early, and also checked up on us midway through our stay. The house was decorated so cute - we kept finding new things to look at even on our last day there. I had brought some groceries for our stay, but I can't tell you how happy I was to see that Debbie made sure we had coffee there (and my kiddos were excited there was hot chocolate!). Would definitely recommend, and would stay there again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We felt right at home here. The cabin has everything you need and it is super cozy.

Highly recommend.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a wonderful place and friendly, helpful hosts. Absolutely everything about the cabin is amazing!!! The details, decor, the love and peace that are contained within the walls are spectacular. When visiting friends and family in Martin and McKenzie, this is our new ‚Äúspot‚Äù. I highly suggest this super homey, clean cabin to anyone. You will be so glad you chose Mam‚Äôs House and be so very blessed! I just cannot say enough wonderful things about this Airbnb.

I‚Äô m very grateful for Debbie and how she worked with me to make sure my visit was everything I needed it be.
I felt right at home with ample room to get my work done and crash at night. There‚Äôs a rustic charm to the house and it has everything you need for today. The WiFi was great. The kitchen and bathroom amenities were ample. And the bed was very comfortable.
To be perfectly candid‚Äîit very much exceeded my expectations. If you‚Äôre traveling to Martin, don‚Äôt hesitate to book Mam‚Äôs House. You‚Äôll be glad you did."

We will definitely be back to stay when we visit over the next 4 years."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I had a nice stay at Debbie's place. She kindly provided water and coffee. And she was very accommodating when I asked to stay a bit behind the normal check out time.
I had a little trouble finding the place because of the sign for her street was missing (or perhaps just very hard to see at night); consider printing a map of the final directions to the house, so that you can estimate which street is the right one, based on distance.

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to unwind after a long day with some back porch sitting and wake up in the morning to a mason jar of lemonade with the sun on your face.

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mam's Place was a quaint country get away. We were at Martin to watch the UTM College Rodeo, so Mam's Place was the perfect place for us to stay between the performances to spend time with our daughter (who is on the Southern Arkansas rodeo team). The creativity of the hosts in how the entire place is designed is unbelievable! Some memorabilia from a cabin in the woods, to the industrial look, to diy pieces...this place was adorable and fun. No problems with anything, and the hosts were wonderful. They checked in to see if there were any problems. We plan to stay here next year for the 2022 UTM Spring College Rodeo. We would highly recommend Mam's Place."
2021-04-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Have you ever been to Confusion Hill in California? Well if not you can the a similar experience in Tennessee. It house is ingeniously constructed, it is not however safe for small children or people who struggle with mobility as the floor are very uneven and there are multiple small steps that are not easy to see. I did not sleep well here, the beds an loud and there are insect deterants in every room that click constantly. Also the shower is like showering under a watering can, no pressure."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cleanest Airbnb I have EVER rented!! Decor was on point for rustic farmhouse. Communication was outstanding. Plenty of kitchen equipment. The tub was fantastic and there were plenty of towels. Basic supplies were plentiful-at some places the host leaves the bare minimum but not here.

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a wonderful place to stay in! The house was decorated so beautifully and sparkling clean inside and out! You can tell there was a lot of love and thought put into it during the renovation. We loved the exposed wood logs and original ceiling and walls. It is definitely one of the most unique homes we have ever stayed in. There are so many personal touches and she has made sure you do not lack for anything! The beds were very comfortable and nicely made.
She had Buff City Soap in the bathroom and we love Buff City Soap!! It is a very warm and inviting home. It was so cold when we got in and she had the fireplaces on and some lights turned on for us so we weren‚Äôt walking in to a dark house. So thoughtful!
In some of the reviews there was mention of the home being around ‚Äúhouse trailers‚Äú, do not judge a book by its cover. We got in late at night and did not feel unsafe at anytime during our stay. It‚Äôs on a quiet street, but so close to the main road.
I would stay here again if the occasion should arise."

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Debbie was a great host- very responsive. We loved the cabin- it was absolutely adorable and better than we thought it would be based off listing pictures. She took a lot of care to make sure the heaters were on for us and everything felt welcoming and cozy. We got in late so it was a tad bit hard to find at night- as there were no street lights, but we managed okay. The only downside to this property is the area- it was Very rural with mostly mobile homes Very close together, and we weren‚Äôt sure about the safety of the area, but I‚Äôm sure if we had had more time to discuss this with Debbie, she could have put our worries to rest. Overall it was a nice stay and we were thankful for Debbie‚Äôs hospitality."

2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Host worked diligently to resolve the dead battery on the lock, but required a delay getting in. This is an old home, in an older neighborhood, on a corner, that seemed to have more traffic at night than I anticipated.
The place is super cute & clean. The beds & pillows were comfy. I never heard a neighbor, if there is one, from the other side of the duplex. The place is cozy & what I expected from a West Tennessee college town. I'd choose it again over a local hotel."

2022-01-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"Living room Tv had trouble working, remotes didn‚Äôt work with it.
Wifi internet shut off continuously.
Kitchen drawer handles were loose, towels were a bit stained.
Ceiling fan in living room does not work, all rooms fan strings are cut off.
Porch light does not work
Denise did accept extra guests/our animals (with a $50 fee, kennel cage and yard pick up)
Cautious of loud neighbors and cops being called during the night.
Beautiful layout, but living room floor is painted over so be wary of anything touching it as Denise will request $200 from you.
Right downtown from food and shopping!

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a charming house! Kitchen is very well stocked with utensils and cookware. The house is also well stocked with cleaning supplies and paper products. Walter was a kind and responsive host. Note to those traveling with kids - the twin bedroom gets very bright in the morning, consider bringing something to block the sun! Wonderful stay overall."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We reserved the house for the Soybean Festival that got cancelled. We decided to just make the best of it and we're so glad we did. The house really made the difference. We sat down and played cards for the first time in years. We watched movies and fell asleep on the floor. We cooked a lot of our own meals. We'll be back again for next year! Thanks!!

2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great house with a fantastic location so close to the UT Martin campus.
2019-11-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"This airbnb is a small older house that has been nicely refurbished. We stayed in this house for a month. The kitchen has modern appliances, including a stacked washer/dryer. It is well-stocked with dishes, cookware, utensils, and nearly everything you might possibly need for preparing meals.
The large bathroom has plenty of storage for personal items, a large vanity with two sinks, and a large walk-in rain shower with good water pressure.
There are two bedrooms, one with twin beds and the other with a queen bed. We did not use the twin-bed room. We found the queen bed rather uncomfortable and probably in need of a new mattress. We liked the bedside tables and lamps plus plenty of storage in a large dresser and closet.
The living room has a large-screen TV with DVD player, and comfortable furniture. WiFi was good. The town of Martin is small, with limited shopping and a few local restaurants, fast food places, and two small grocery stores. Walmart seems to be the main shopping venue, but it is a place we do not patronize, so it was somewhat difficult to find certain grocery items. Larger grocery stores (Kroger) are located in Paris and Jackson.
We never met our hosts, but communication was good. There is a lockbox for self-entry. Off-street parking is available next to the house or in the garage of the house. The neighborhood is not well-kept, but seemed very safe. Overall, we would recommend this airbnb house if you have reason to be in Martin, TN."

Shower needs repair, no central air so bedroom doors have to stay open or it gets hot. Living Room furniture minimum and wouldn't be comfortable for multiple people. outside building is rough and gives false impression of what's inside.

2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The apartment was nicely remodeled and decorated. Check in could of been easier. The stairs are in desperate need of repair. They allow pets, which is very nice; but staying on a second floor with pets, with the stairs and rails covered in ice is not a good combination. They did not use pet friendly ice melt so we had to carry both dogs up and down slippery stairs. They did provide coffee, tea, sugar, and creamer; which was very nice! The beds were comfortable. Didn't like where they had the toilet roll positioned on the side of the sink, it jabbed my arm while using the facilities. Jesse was polite and communication was smooth."

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Cute, clean home. Cooking/prep area is bigger than it looks from the pictures because the butcher block countertops extend past the kitchen into the dining area. Clean fridge/freezer and bathrooms. Beautiful area with lots of trees.
There were a few items that we have come to expect at airbnbs that either were missing or we were unable to find: shampoo (there was conditioner), body soap for the shower, a can opener, and a colander. Otherwise, the kitchen had what we needed to cook a meal.
Communicative, friendly host."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We are originally from Martin and had to come to town unexpectedly and needed a place to stay. Many others were very expensive and as a disabled veteran on a fixed income, the house was amazing and very very nice. We haven‚Äôt used or stayed at many BNB but of the ones we have this one was the absolute best of them all. So nice and clean and had everything we needed to make our stay exceptional. The communication was lightning fast and so helpful. If you are looking for a place to stay last minute or somewhere for days on end, this is the place for you. If we end up going back home any other time and need a place to stay we will definitely look here first. So much better than a hotel and much cheaper than many other places.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Maplemere is a cute and cozy home perfectly nestled in a quiet neighborhood of Martin. Perfectly sized home with farmhouse vibes (beautiful butcher block counter tops in the kitchen), 3 bedrooms, 1.5 bath, and a large dining room area. I felt as if I had plenty of space to both work and relax while I was there. The added amenities of providing lots of coffee, toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, soap, etc.), and laundry detergent was a nice touch! What stood out was the host, she is just above and beyond wonderful as well. Not only were her instructions clear and thorough, but she even checked in with me when we arrived just to make sure everything was as it should be and to make sure we didn‚Äôt have questions or need anything."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The stay at Tori‚Äôs was exceptional. This place is a great place to choose, if you are visiting or bringing your college student to the campus of University of Tennessee at Martin, just stay here. Smells fresh, has plenty of space, plenty of room, great cold AC and all the amenities are in the kitchen that you will need to prepare meals. Large enough space for a big family, with gathering areas, cozy corners, comfy blankets, and throws, the beds were amazing, soft and fluffy. We slept really well. The house is easy to get to, on the corner in a very quiet and private neighborhood. It was such a great stay. Shopping near by, restaurants and fast food close too. We enjoyed The Grande restaurant, and Tori‚Äôs suggestion for local places were such a helpful addition to our plans. We also visited the museum in Union City, The Discovery Park of America which was only about 15 minutes away. So if you are ever in the area, this is the home to pick."

Couldn‚Äôt have asked for more, Michelle, thank you!
I‚Äôve said it already, but we‚Äôll certainly be staying here again, given the opportunity!"
,,,"The house is adorable and decoreated very cute but the moment I walked in, I could smell mold. I didnt get much sleep because the smell was that bad to me....I hate to give a bad review but I think others should know, because its not healthy to breath mold...
Its a shame because it is such a cute adorable house, but I could never stay there again due to the unhealthy environment. Im not sure if these types of rentals are inspected but they sure need to be before they are allowed to be rented."
,,,"I didn't like the house. The house smells funny, the beds are too high, the bath tub is dirty, the entire toilet area is not acceptable, no curtains and I didn't feel safe. I didn't like the property."
,,,Has no central air or heat. Clean on the inside. Nasty outside stairwell is in disrepair.
