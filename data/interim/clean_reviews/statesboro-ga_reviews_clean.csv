2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place close to downtown Statesboro! I‚Äôd recommend keeping the door closed at night as we accidentally let a bunch of flying critters in our first night but other than that the place was great.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our 3rd stay at the cottage.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had a lovely stay at Mary's. I was in town for business regarding my mother's estate, and when I am somewhere for only one night I usually stay in a hotel, which I did the last time I was in Statesboro, and it wasn't a very pleasant experience. Wisely, I chose Mary's cottage this time and had a much more enjoyable, comfortable stay. It's homey, cozy and quiet. I appreciated the coffee and tea options, the microwave and the fridge. It had everything I needed. I'll definitely be back."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mary's Quilt Cottage was exactly what we needed for our busy stay, a place to rest overnight before heading out again. The first night we saw two doe and three fawns across the way. Very beautiful and private around the cottage. The bed was comfortable and the room had all the needed basics for comfort. The nice touches for tea and coffee were greatly appreciated. We were very satisfied. When in the area, we would consider her cottage again. Loved Statesboro. Coconut Thai restaurant was awesome. Check it out."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Mary was a lovely host. I enjoyed my stay in the guest house. The space is simple and small, but well furnished and stocked. The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful, nicely wooded. I never heard any road noise from inside.The only thing I did not enjoy was the wi-fi. It's not that it's slow, it's that the guest house is just a little too far from the base, so connection is very spotty. If you have your own hot spot or unlimited data, then this won't be a concern for you."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"we always have a comfortable stay at Mary's cottage! clean, friendly, and quiet area!"

We were part of a wedding party, but we didn‚Äôt want in on a block of room, and we were fortunate enough to find this private, cozy and comfortable space. Mary‚Äôs personal touches to this lovely space added the southern charm that I had been telling my partner about.

It's close to plenty of dining, as well as the Statesboro-Bulloch disc golf course, which was my reason for visiting. We tried to make use of the fire pit, but unfortunately, it was too damp to get a fire going. There was plenty of hot water and good water pressure, which was invaluable given the chilly weather. Mary was very friendly and accommodating, and we had no problems with communication. Be careful with the gate if you have a large vehicle - it's a tight fit!"

I stayed here with a house full of family for a few days while in town for a reunion and here's what everyone liked best: huge fenced backyard (dog), well-equipped propane grill (husband), covered front porch (dad‚Äî he brought his own camp chair and set up here for the weekend), the coffee (mom), aesthetic choices (cousin). I personally appreciated the big fluffy blanket tucked up in the closet, the powerful a/c being set low, that every room had beds big enough for two, and the spacious layout which allowed room for a full house to spread out."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to relax. Quiet neighborhood. Very clean and neat home. Jeremy was responsive to all my questions and we felt at home. Thanks for a great first time experience.

Highly recommended!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time at Kaelin‚Äôs Airbnb. We were in town for the masters and needed a spot between Augusta and Savannah airport. Super convenient and comfortable space. Kaelin was super responsive and helpful before and during our trip. Great spot!

This was a home away from home and located right beside all of my favorite places in town: Vino 1910 , Pour House Pub, and Bull & Barrell! Cant wait to come back."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at Kaelin's Airbnb was nothing short of fantastic! From the moment I stepped into the space, we were struck by peaceful modern vibe that instantly made me feel at home. The place was impeccably clean and thoughtfully designed, blending style with comfort seamlessly. The location of Kaelin's place is unbeatable. Just one block away, I found myself spoiled for choice with a fantastic coffee shop that became my morning ritual, a great barbecue place next door, and a gym to keep up with our fitness routine even while away from home. Kaelin was an outstanding host, providing clear and prompt communication from booking to check-out. Overall, my stay at Kaelin's place was a highlight of my trip. It provided everything I needed and more, making it a spot I'd eagerly return to. Whether you're in town for a short visit or a longer getaway, Kaelin's Airbnb is the ideal choice for anyone looking for a stylish, comfortable, and conveniently located place to stay. Highly recommended!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Would stay again
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at the Downtown Loft. Kaelin‚Äôs place was a true gem - looked just like the pictures and description. The loft was central to all our activities and we enjoyed exploring the local shops and restaurants. The check-in instructions were very clear and we had no problems/issues during our stay. The living room was spacious and comfortable, and we enjoyed the access to the balcony. We look forward to our next trip back to Statesboro and Kaelin's loft."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay and close to everything we wanted to do.
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I had a love and hate relationship with this property, and I took a few days to figure out how to communicate that effectively. I am from the area, so I knew exactly where it was. The location was secure and very private, so that was a big plus for me. Kaelin allowed me to check in earlier than check in because my flight got in early, I ended up checking in just 20 mins before check in, but I appreciate the flexibility. I had to read the check in instructions about 4-5 times because there were a lot of details, and codes to all the doors, and the elevator.
I had to move my unit. There was a odor in my unit that was similar to sulfur. Kaelin was apologetic and accommodating for the inconvenience, which I appreciated. Kaelin put me into a larger unit, and it was nice. It was very clean and very neat, two floors.
I had to amazon a package to the unit, with permission, and the package never turned up. which was really frustrating as it was a grad gift , but the stay was pleasant."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kaelin was very responsive to all communication, and the unit was exactly as pictured and described. It was a wonderful space to return to at the end of our busy day to hang out in and relax. So happy we chose to book this loft instead of a hotel."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We rented this for GSU Graduation week and it was perfect - all the hotels were booked and I was able to score this gem and so grateful. Located right above Bull & Barrell, best restaurant in Statesboro, it was convenient, walkable to coffee shops, other restaurants and very close to the campus. I've stayed at other properties by Kaelin and they are all great and true to description.
Highly recomment."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the place .
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean and cozy place to stay. Great location, and convenient to town and college. Would recommend and stay there again. Kaelin was great to work with and very responsive."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay very much. The place was spacious, clean and convenient to everything!! We will def be back."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely and spacious property right in historic downtown Statesboro. We really liked it and will come again. There is a door to access the beautiful balcony that overlooks Main Street.
The downstairs living room area is huge and could easily be used for an extra guest. Not a sleeper sofa, but couch would work for one person. Love seat would accommodate a child. There is a half bath downstairs that I hadn‚Äôt even noticed until we left.
Notes for consideration:
No towel bars or hooks in upstairs Bathroom.
Bedroom windows that overlook the downstairs area need to be washed.
There is an iron but no ironing board.
Need a lamp next to bed.
It was cold while there; could have used an extra blanket.
Door from living room out to balcony has no lock on it.
These points are meant to be helpful, not criticism. This is a really nice place!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying downtown. Kaelin‚Äôs place is a tucked away gem. We walked to coffee each morning and walked downstairs for brunch. We loved having space to relax and not be crammed into a hotel room. Kaelin provided very clear check in instructions and we had no issues with our stay. Enjoyed it!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay at a great property with a great host. Location is great. Perfect for college parents visiting their kids. Cant wait to come back.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for a great place to stay for a few days.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This stay was absolutely everything we had hoped for! The location was perfect, and the loft itself was so quiet even though we were downtown. There was plenty of space inside the rooms, seating, and things to do. Everything was there that was needed and cleaned very well. Parking would be a little bit difficult at night sometimes due to the restaurants being below the loft. But, the highlight was definitely how responsive and friendly our host was during the stay! We will definitely be returning!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I booked two (2) rentals on the day of checkin for GSU graduation. Kaelin responded within minutes of my inquiry. The electronic lock on one unit was malfunctioning and he sent someone to look at it within five (5) minutes. The units were very very clean and looked just like the pictures. And my family did not have any issues with the noose from the restaurant downstairs. The only suggestion is the unit with stairs needs a handrail. I will rent from Kaelin again when we have guests again. Highly recommend!! Five (5) stars!!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice view. Not far from surrounding counties. Right in downtown of Statesboro. Host was very nice and responsive.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect quiet get away for anyone conducting personal / business away from home. Walking distance to exemplary food and cuisine‚Ä¶ Not what you might expect in a small town‚Ä¶ It is certainly a renovated loft, however very tastefully done will all the old character you should expect in such a property. The small price difference vs. a standard hotel room is definitely worth it."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The loft is awesome. It is in a great location downtown. You can walk to several nice restaurants and bars. The space is much bigger than the pictures appear. I would highly recommend staying here. Kaelin was extremely easy to reach and quick with her responses when I had any questions as well.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location. We‚Äôll furnished
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My trip didn't go as planned - it was really a rough one. However, walking into Kaelin's loft was truly the highlight of my entire week. She was very responsive when I was looking for parking and was very clear when instructing me how to access the loft. I happened to mention that I made smoothies and asked if there was a blender available. She said ""there can be!"". When I got to the kitchen there was a brand new blender in the box.
The space is open, clean and feels ""homey"". The location is right in the middle of what I call ""Old Main Street"" with shopping and a small coffee place a couple blocks away. If you're looking for a PEACEFUL place to call home for a few days, this is it!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,A great place to stay!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment at the Post building is fantastic for a couple. Lots of space, well-decorated and very comfortable.

2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This place was nice and comfortable. I would stay here again, even with a couple of items to note. Understand, these are the only items that were not perfect. The laundry from the previous guests were still in the dryer and were wet, so we rewashed them to be sure they would not get musty. It seemed like they were doing a little rearranging of wall hangings so some were on the floor, including a large mirror I was afraid might fall & break. Out of their control, but the building security was hit & miss in the fact that other guests/tenants would leave the exterior security doors open for anyone to enter the building. Overall, it was a great stay. The furnishings were comfortable. The space was large. The location was perfect to walk to coffee shops, restaurants, and other points of interest. Being in the center of town I would have expected lots of road noise, but it was mainly quiet."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best location in town. Right above the best restaurant on the area. Gym, coffee shop, bagel shop and a few places to get a drink all within a couple blocks. About a mile from Paulson Stadium. Not sure how many guests were in the building but we never heard anything! Really cool place."

I highly recommend Kaelin as a host and commend both their professionalism and exceptional service."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay in the walkable downtown area. Plenty of space and beautiful decor. The elevator was a huge plus and the handicapped ramp on the.

Convenient proximity to the university, stores, restaurants, etc. This loft is huge and looks exactly like the pictures. Three bedrooms (one upstairs with it's own bathroom). Plenty of room and we wish we were there longer to be able to eat at the restaurant downstairs. We did not want to leave and trust me, you will enjoy staying in this chic loft and won't even want to venture out."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our time at her airbnb, and definitely enjoyed the apartment style since we had other groups book other ones in the same space. It felt as though we were not equipped for a whole week's stay there, with many cleaning items only enough to last 2-3 days. Things were broken when we arrived, screen door & freezer, that appeared to be broken for some time.
The beds were too soft but that may be of preference, but we enjoyed our time."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful place‚Ä¶. A very friendly and responsive host!!!

2023-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The place was exactly as described and perfect for our stay. Kaelin was helpful and quick to communicate. The loft could use a deeper cleaning and upkeep of supplies. The blinds were dusty and the sink had some leftover grime. The soap in one bathroom had been refilled with water so not really soap anymore. Also, there were minor damages (small holes in wall, hand towel holder missing but bracket still on the wall). Not sure if this is to be expected in a college town but all were minor and didn‚Äôt hinder our stay."
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"Met all my families needs. The open layout was beautiful and allowed the chef to interact with others while preparing food.
The furniture and beds were comfortable. I enjoyed the lack of clutter and nick nacks and the amble room for my large family to spread out."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kaelin was super responsive! A great host.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Love the loft. We stayed the week before and had to come back and finish work. We did not hesitate to book the unit again. Everything is as described, clean, and comfortable. The only small issue is when the local steakhouse is open parking is sometimes tough to find in the evening. I highly recommend this property."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Home was very clean and comfortable. Restaurant next door and many options available by delivery as well. I would definitely stay again next time we are in the area.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"After a nightmare experience with Air BNB, Kaelin was a breath of fresh air and she went above and beyond to rescue my entire family. This space is amazing and is conveniently located. You will not be disappointed. The main level has 2 spacious bedrooms, a bathroom, a half bath and an open kitchen, living room area. The 2nd floor has a massive bedroom and a massive bathroom as well. There is also a laundry facility in the loft that is wonderful as well. The balcony overlooking the street is so fun to sit on and enjoy a cup of coffee. I was traveling with my parents who are 80 and 75, me and my boyfriend, my daughter and son in law and my grand daughters who are almost 1 and almost 2. This space worked amazingly for 4 generations. If you are looking for a clean space, open space, convenient location and a host who communicates, this is the space for you."

2022-01-01,3,Stayed one night,"This is a great place and a great location. The cool points are off the charts. Unfortunately for us the heat only worked in the bedrooms and the thermostat shuts off the heats every two hours. We were freezing.

Tate, Butter & BoopBoop are definitely highlight stars on the property! They are so enjoyable, entertaining and relaxing to watch as they play and graze through the pasture! The chickens are fun to watch as well, they occasionally grace the house in the evening roaming freely before bedding down at night! Perfect 10 out of 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚Äòs.

Morgan was a fantastic host, addressing all our inquiries promptly and catering to our every need, making us feel genuinely valued. Upon arrival, we were pleasantly surprised by the impressive soda selection in the fridge, a thoughtful and much appreciated gesture after a long drive. The cleanliness and comfort of each room exceeded our expectations. Meeting all the lovely animals who came over to greet us at the fence was a big highlight. We loved learning all their names!
It was evident that the love and care put into the home and farm extended to every detail. It truly felt like a home away from home, and we couldn't have asked for a more perfect spot."

We love just sitting on the front porch and relaxing to watch the horses, goat, dog and chickens. It is very quiet there and the perfect place to relax. I cannot say enough positive things about Morgan or her home."

2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"A PERFECT GETAWAY or meeting place for family and friends! Morgan not only made the booking and check-in process a breeze, she went above and beyond with extra touches to provide a warm welcome and a pleasant stay. The beds are very comfortable, and the space is perfect for large families, like ours. The home is secluded but just a few miles from shopping and restaurants, which was perfect. It was also fun to visit with the horses and goat in our spare time. We enjoyed our stay so much, we hope to meet up with family and friends at her lovely home again one day in the near future."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Oh my goodness, what a place! An absolute gem of a farmhouse - no detail was left out from the craftsmanship down to the hardware. Simply stunning! The farmhouse served as the perfect venue for our daughter's wedding as there was plenty of space in the yard to set up multiple stations for people to mingle. Morgan was super receptive to all requests and very responsive with communication. We will most definitely stay here again - it's beautiful, far enough out of town to feel private, and so peaceful. We loved getting to see Peanut, Butter, Boopboop, and Rosie run in the pasture. Just perfect!"
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Fantastic! One of the best homes we have stayed in! House was lovely and very clean. We thoroughly enjoyed the high end appliances and super comfy mattresses. The private outdoor sofas with the fire table were great for us to gather with a beverage and relax at the end of our day. We also really appreciated the extras like snacks and household items that were provided. The horses and goat in the pasture next to the house were fun to watch and the setting was very peaceful. We will 100% choose this place to stay next time we are in the area!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Morgan was an EXCEPTIONAL host. Very communicative and she went out of our way to make sure we had what we needed even bringing fresh eggs from her farm for us to enjoy. We also had the gas fire pit run out the first night and she sent someone out with a new tank at 10pm even though we communicated it was not a big deal. We will definitely stay here the next time we visit Statesboro.
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"My family had an amazing stay at Morgan's place. The house is absolutely beautiful and the location is perfect. So peaceful, yet not far from restaurants and shops. She had it stocked with things most places don't. You literally only need your clothes and tooth brush. My family had SO much fun in the game room loft and meeting Peanut, Butter and BoopBoop. We wish we could have stayed even longer to enjoy some coffee on the front porch rocking chairs or a nice fire around the fire pit. We will definitely be staying here on our next trip to Statesboro!!"

We definitely hope to stay at the house again for our next visit to Statesboro."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was everything I expected and more. The property was beautiful and very private. The furnishings and finishes in the home were perfect.

Morgan had many extras that we were not expecting; coffee, creamer, sugar, drinks and water in the fridge and fresh fruit on the kitchen island. She also furnished our toilet paper, shampoo, conditioner, bath wash and make up remover sheets. She has a beautiful farm, you can watch the goat and horses on the front porch and just relax. Morgan herself is very friendly and responded immediately to any question. We will definitely be back. We have stayed at numerous AIRBNBs and my husband said this was the best one of all of them. She is an excellent host!!!!"

All of our group loved the touches that Morgan left (water, some fruit, candy) and the whole house was well thought out and had all the right furniture and amenities (W&D, blowdryers, beautiful towels). We are all hoping that the golf tournament is in the same location next year, so that we can rent the facility again. Would be a great place for family and friends of anyone at Georgia Southern University to stay for a weekend or a couple of weeks. Hope to be back soon! Thanks Morgan (and hello to Peanut, Butter and BoopBoop)."

As if the beautiful scenery and clean well decorated interior isn‚Äôt enough, the exceptional perks of yummy snacks & a stocked fridge in the kitchen, makeup remover wipes & such in the bathroom, & the nicest towels & extra blankets make it that much better! Every detail thought of. THANK You! It was a busy wedding weekend and Morgan made it peaceful, easy and sweeterüíñ

The yard is small, but fully fenced in so the dogs could do their business without supervision. Our only minor complaint is that the kitchen didn't have a whole lot of equipment; we made it work, but some measuring cups/spoons, and a little more cookware would have been helpful."

The set up of the home was easily functional and made me feel like I was home. I was in town for a wedding weekend for a friend, and this little home was nestled in the perfect location from the wedding venue. The home was exact to the pictures online and that is a major bonus to me. There is nothing like seeing one view online and show up to your location just to realize there are some things that were totally different, thanks for keeping your pictures via online up to date Mrs. Alanna!! Now let's talk neighbors and neighborhood ....... The neighbors were ""what neighbors""???? They were so quite it appears that you are on an island by yourself, this was one of the quietest stays ever, and when I travel, I utilize Airbnb's versus hotel stays. This home/neighborhood is nicely maintained, clean, and would definitely recommend this home to anyone visiting."

It was very easy to get to, very clean, not too big or small, it was just right. The screen in back porch was everything, NO BUGSüòö. The neighbor & neighbor hood was very quiet. The only downfall was, no TV in the rooms, but she was kind enough to let me bring my own, which was a 35in. The overall rate for me was excellent.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I highly recommend this property!! We loved this place and felt at home as soon as we arrived! It is one of the cleanest Airbnb properties I have used. One thing that really stood out is that it did NOT have the unnatural scent of Febreze. This was a very welcome change from a lot of Airbnb properties. I have asthma and usually I have had to wash my clean clothes when I get back home from most other places. I am happy to say that my clothes did NOT have what I consider a nasty Febreze odor. We enjoyed the roomy screened porch as well as the back yard. Alanna was very proactive. Examples: telling us immediately when the Internet connection was out for a short while, dropping off extra trash bags in case there weren't enough. She also replied very quickly to my messages. She had some great functional/organizational items that made it very easy to find what we needed. The house is 4 minutes from shopping, which is a plus."

Lisa and Tom are extremely responsive to all communications. We‚Äôve never had a problem with anything regarding our stays and the Treehouse will always be our first choice when we visit Statesboro. I also encourage you to stop by Three Tree Coffee Roasters on South Main for a treat while you‚Äôre out and about during the day.

To the point, it is important to have soft & strong toilet paper and large soft towels. Tom & Lisa got it right.
Many places skimp on both: sad. Tom & Lisa understand a major point about both items!

The bungalow has a beautiful backyard to lay back and relax, a huge plus for us.
We will definitely be staying here again when we are back visiting in Georgia, we wouldn‚Äôt stay anywhere else!"

It‚Äôs close to campus and restaurants and the perfect place to stay when visiting your GSU student! Big fenced in backyard with patio furniture and a large swinging bench. You can even sit in the rocking chairs on the front porch. This is our second stay with Lisa and Tom and planning on staying with them again!

Fantastic hosts! Clearly available but not overbearing - the perfect combo!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second stay at the Treehouse bungalow and because 3 years have passed between visits, (they were booked last two times we needed a place) we had forgotten just how much we enjoyed their place. It is definitely our first choice of rentals in Statesboro and well worth paying a bit more vs. price of 2 hotel rooms. All of the amenities provided and having space to gather comfortably and relax is so nice!
Lisa and Tom are such gracious, accommodating hosts‚Ä¶ not that we have had needs during our stays, but little things like coming by to turn on lights when we were checking in after dark are so appreciated. I highly recommend the Treehouse and know we‚Äôll always check their rental first!"

The house was cozy and clean. The yard was a great place for my pups. The bed was cozy. Lisa and Tom even put flannel sheets on the beds for the cold temps and they were so warm!

I absolutely love the kitchen. The host provided plenty of household items as well, which came in handy.

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Not your childhood treehouse! This home is absolutely BEAUTIFUL! My husband and I found the house nostalgic from the homes of our elder relatives in our childhood. The original real hardwood floors were gorgeous throughout and the home was tastefully appointed with great antiques---just like grandma's house! And for the GSU Eagle fan, the hosts have added a few pieces of school memorabilia to make you feel right at home. The home has a fantastic fenced in back yard which was a great hang out for my family and our fur babies. Additionally, the central location makes the home a great place to stay for your next trip to the Da 'Boro."

2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I don‚Äôt think I can write a review that would do this place justice. This place is simply amazing. Everything about this home is perfect. I lived in Statesboro for 5 years and this home has got to be one of the best kept older homes in the town. I‚Äôm upset that we didn‚Äôt find this place sooner!

2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a nice, spacious house. It is comfortable with everything you need.

We were in town for a wedding and our host was very responsive and accommodating from the start. Have no worries about reserving this house. My first Airbnb experience was excellent. Thank you."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Our stay was excellent. We needed to basically relocate our family for a week, and we never missed a beat at Lisa and Tom's place. The house was spacious and SO clean - by far the cleanest home we have ever experienced in our travels. We were all so comfortable- super quaint home, comfy furniture and beds, linens - even towels were great (no kidding). Little touches from local coffee to the swinging bed/bench out back helped every day seem a treat. They are pet friendly but not so much as a sniff or hint of pets in the house.
We highly recommend Lisa and Tom's place!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved the location of the Treehouse and all the charm of an older home! We really appreciated all the extra power cords in the bedrooms and living room for all those electronics! Thanks so much for all your hospitality and I can‚Äôt wait to get back to visit!

2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,This house was such a treasure in a city I‚Äôve been visiting since birth. We visited Statesboro to lay my 90 year-old grandmother to rest and wanted a house over a hotel. The host allowed us to check in earlier than expected. This house has a fenced in backyard that reminds me of a retreat. The house is older but with charm. It‚Äôs extremely spacious and has enough room for every party to feel secluded.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place! A hike away from home! Very comfortable and family friendly. Nicely decorated and preserved the character of the Victorian bungalow. Great location close to GA Southern so we weren‚Äôt late for fall graduation 2020!
2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you ever need a lovely, clean and spacious home while you are in Statesboro the Treehouse is the perfect place!

Equal rates, but exceeds the expectations of every other nearby stay. Tom & Lisa were immediately available whenever we had to contact them.
