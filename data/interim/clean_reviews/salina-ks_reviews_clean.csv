2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful and comfortable place! Provided everything we needed, even after forgetting to pack a couple things. Loved the extra effort they put into the little details around the house, from the coffee and snack bar, lighted wardrobe spaces and luxury hair care products in the master to the beautiful private outdoor patio space. The design throughout the home flowed seamlessly and was modern and elegant with hidden gems throughout. It was not too minimalistic but not over decorated or cluttered, but in my opinion perfectly done. The kitchen was fully stocked if wanting to utilize. The place was also just a couple blocks from down town. Check in and out instructions were very simple and clear. I did not feel that the check out instructions asked of us were excessive. If staying in town again I will definitely be staying here. I would highly recommend."

Close to downtown making it easy to walk to dinner and activities. Close to the campus as well, just a short 5 minute drive.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This studio is above a theatre and surprisingly, it‚Äôs very quiet. There are restaurants and cafes all very central, to anything you could need and all in walking distance. I stayed here for a couple of days for work and really enjoyed my stay! This place was very cozy and clean. With large floor to ceiling windows, very high ceilings, large TV, and beautifully updated bathroom. Every bit of this place exceeded my expectations, even the small personal touches like: cookies, bottled water and k-cups for coffee. There is no kitchen ( which I didn‚Äôt need) but there is a mini fridge and microwave. Thank you Jane!!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We came to Salina for a concert and stayed at the Loft #2. The room was awesome and the place was very clean and well furnished. The loft is in the downtown area where there are quite a few restaurants, etc so you won't be lacking food options! We loved the place and if we ever find ourselves back in Salina we would definitely stay there again! The host is super responsive and had several suggestions for food (Martinelli's was outstanding). The only downside for some people would be the short climb up a set of stairs, not an issue for us but others might not be able to stay there because of that. Overall the place was 5 star! Thanks for hosting us, we had a wonderful time!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved staying here! We don‚Äôt live far from Salina, but wanted a place to sleep so we didn‚Äôt drive home from a bachelorette party. This was perfect.

2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pamela was a great host - very responsive, thought of small details to make our stay easy, helpful and available whenever we needed. The space was great for us having four bedrooms and a yard with a grill and fire pit worked wonderfully for our stay. Our standards might be higher than your average renter - it does feel like the property needs a deep clean and there are some small repairs that if completed, would bring my 4 star to a 5 star rating. Also, be aware that the hot water gets scalding within a short second of being turned on."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was located downtown and within walking distance to restaurants and bars. It was an older home but it‚Äôs been renovated and it‚Äôs beautiful on the inside. We enjoyed our stay in Salina.

It had ample gathering spaces, both indoors and out. Every room has small touches to help you feel at home. The bedrooms were large, the beds and linens were very comfortable, and each room was tastefully decorated. We slept great, and despite being in town for a sad reason, 100% enjoyed our time in her home. The home is also within walking distance of downtown Salina and has a front porch that just calls for you to stop and sit a spell. I honestly don‚Äôt think I can say enough good things about Pamela, or her place."

She is very responsive when questions are asked and we had ZERO problems. The beds were so comfy, the showers were amazing. She provided a whole binder of things to do in Salina, and everything that was within walking distance. She had so many things available that most people don't even think of bringing when they leave home. If i could give 10 stars I would. If I come back I am staying here again!!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our Salina stay was practically perfect in every way. Pamela keeps it classy in her spacious + meticulously CLEAN home. Every single thing was neat as a pin. Freshly renovated, the house blends modern amenity with sweet old house charms. Not one detail was overlooked as far as hospitality goes. Our family of 9 felt spoiled by all the included extras‚Ä¶ and I heard she has a very special blessing who helps with this part. Plenty of popcorn, hot chocolate, coffee, and creamers but Pamela‚Äôs thoughtful generosity went far above that. She delivered ibuprofen within minutes of me expressing a need, then we were so touched by the gift of a personalized snack basket which catered to our son‚Äôs celiac disease. Oh, I almost forgot to add- Pamela found the purse I left behind and immediately shipped it home to me. If you find yourself in Salina‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt get any better than this.

2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"We stayed here for a couple of days after a family member passed away. House was a large enough for 3 families to stay the night. Our in town relatives didn‚Äôt have a large enough house for everyone to get together before and after the funeral. So they all came to this house. Plenty of room for food, lots of different conversations and playing games. Our family was very impressed with the house and the all that came with it. Pamela was so kind and made check in quick and easy and sent us all the instructions. We so appreciate her hospitality. I would highly recommend staying here. You will not be disappointed!
Thank you Pamela!

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,First time back to Salina since my sons cancer diagnosed. This place was perfect for us stay and was even understanding when we left early due to a family emergency.
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,What a wonderful place. Perfect for 5 people. A walk to downtown and good restaurants. Pamela was quick to respond and clear with her instructions.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Pamela was a wonderful host and so very helpful. The location was perfect right in downtown Salina. My family and I visited for Thanksgiving and it was the perfect space to enjoy the family! We will be back for sure!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was a great home lots of room for the whole family. In a great location.
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,It's a very cute house in a great area. Host was very accessible and friendly when we communicated.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"By far, Pamela has been the best host I have ever worked with on a vacation rental site! Her communication up to our stay, during our stay, and even after has been excellent. She has thought of everything in this house, down to extra bags in the trashcans, labeling of light switches, and device chargers in every room! We didn't have to look for anything! The house is within walking distance of every great thing you would want to see or do in Salina. My family felt welcome, comfortable, and safe throughout our entire stay. Thank you, Pamela, for being an extraordinary host!!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a wonderful time! The home exceeded our expectations!
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"If you need space for a group this is it in Salina. Plenty of room for a group of 8.
This is an older house but you wouldn‚Äôt know it once you are in. Only cons are you must walk upstairs to the bedrooms and the 6:15am trash truck that picks up at the hotel down the street (Pamela can‚Äôt control that)
Now the good news- one of the best places we have ever stayed. For the price all guests get what they need- lots of towels, many chairs outside, grill, crock pot, excellent cooking supplies, big family room plus a coupe of tables inside to do what you need.
Pamela had a large selection of snacks ready plus numerous bottles of water and water filter pouring jugs (Salina tap water tastes different). Great stove and powerful microwave. Cooking supplies and a stocked pantry with aluminum foil and plastic bags. Plenty of parking on both sides of house. Keyless entry was easy. We didn‚Äôt use everything in the house but there are extra outdoor folding chairs, chairs on the porch, fire pit, plus outdoor table with six chairs. Location is great you can walk to restaurants, bars, a live theater (music and performing), plus downtown Salina businesses.
Pamela will communicate with you and replies back instantly if needed.
All in all a great stay. Thanks Pamela. Will stay again if in Salina."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in Salina!
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"WOW!! Pamela's place was awesome!! Her communication is spot on clear, easy and responsive. The home is loaded with amenities of all kinds. She's thought of everything -- all you need is clothes. The place is tastefully appointed--loads of thoughtful touches, and everything is just so COMFORTABLE. Pam went above and beyond to make us feel welcomed and made sure our stay was fantastic in many ways. The location is great for downtown events. Our group had a great stay here and I highly recommend her spot for families, groups or couples."
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house is in the best location in Salina, right next to downtown. Tons of cute shops, places to eat and things to do and see. The house was super clean and comfortable for our group. Pamela is a fantastic host. Looking forward to coming back."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable house in an absolutely amazing location. We parked our cars and walked to all the great shops, restaurants and theaters. We also spent a lot of time drinking coffee on the front porch and chatting on the back porch. The hostess is so thoughtful and has her guests covered (umbrellas, canvas folding chairs- great for concerts or parades!, snacks, the perfect glass for whatever you are drinking, comfortable beds, and so much more). We will return when ever we can. Thank you, Pamela!!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Our stay with Pam was awesome. Check in was a breeze, the house was immaculate, and our stay went as smoothly as it possibly could have. The house is very well done and is incredibly cozy. During our stay the house stayed a comfortable temperature considering it was 100 degrees every day. Pam was so attentive and ready to jump on any issues that could come up. She also changed our sheets during our 3 week stay which was above and beyond for a ragged group of guys like us. If we're ever in Salina for an extended period of time again, Pam's house is going to be our first choice.
On top of the wonderful house and fantastic hospitality, the house is located in downtown Salina which is incredibly close to most restaurants and grocery stores.
Overall Pam has outdone herself and deserves every star we could possibly give her and I highly recommend staying at her property."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great convenient location. Parks and rivers very close by. Spacious and very well supplied home. Everything you need is here. Pam is very accommodating and knowledgeable about the area. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home in the perfect location. Pam has thought of everything! This house has anything you could possibly need or want during your stay. Definitely our new home away from home.
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,I have stayed in pretty swanky STRs across the US. But this place is legit. What a thoughtful host! The house is super cute and well decorated. Stocked with more then you ever would need. 100% recommended.!!!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was our second stay! Just as wonderful as the first stay! Host is so accommodating and considerate! Goes the extra mile to make sure our large family has everything we need! We will be back!

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed for two nights and went to a Jackson Browne concert at the downtown Stieffel Theater. Everything was within walking distance, and the house was wonderful. Pamela has thought of everything!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was my second stay at the house. it's a great location for events near the Steiffel Theater or Tony's Event Center.
The house is as pictured.... very nice! Great beds. I think the host added labels on the light switches which was very nice in the evening to get lights shut off.
This trip there were four of us and two were new to Airbnb and were very pleased."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Pamela was one of the best host we've had. We had a water issue and was resolved ASAP. The house is in a really nice area and close to all sorts of restaurants, stores , ect. It was a really nice experience to stay there."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A clean older remolded house with a exceptional host! Very roomy, nice location, she has a what to do in Salina book, she has a best places to eat book, games to play, snacks, bbq pit to use, a nice front covered porch and back porch, upstairs lounge room, two eating areas, washer/dryer to use with the detergent and you can access upstairs two ways. This house is all you‚Äôre looking for and more. We came from Texas to see our daughter graduate from college and we were skeptical about the place but loved it once we got there.
This house is the true meaning of: Never judge a book by its cover! Open it and look inside! This was a masterpiece! Love you Pamela!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Pamela was very communicative, responsive and helpful. The only issue we had was the all the bedrooms are upstairs and only one bathroom up there. Some of our guests had to go shower in the second bathroom which was off the kitchen. Just a little inconvenient. But everything else was amazing. The outside space was perfect!!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Located one block of downtown Salina, this airbnb is great for family gatherings. Has all the stuff you need. Great backyard, porch, sunroom upstairs.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fabulous updated, immaculately clean home! Lots of room to spread out or gather as a group. The attention to every little detail was amazing! Water bottles, cosmetic wipes, shampoo, fluffy towels, comfy beds with charging stations on every side table, well stocked coffee, tea, hot chocolate and a snack basket waiting in the kitchen. Excellent communication from Pam. Will definitely stay again if in the area!! Only consideration is that the stairs to the bedrooms are pretty steep for small children/elderly, but there is a handrail and it‚Äôs split into two sections making it easier to navigate. So much better than staying in a hotel room!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great house, location, outside space! Host had any and every thing you could need and was super accommodating. Will definitely be back when visiting family for an extended stay!"

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Probably the best air b&b we've ever stayed at!! The house was very clean, neat, and well decorated; definitely has a very warm and homey feel! Pam also filled the kitchen with plenty of snacks and water, which was super great after the long drive! The area is also a huge bonus, though. A lot of places are just a short drive away or within walking distance, and downtown is especially nice. Thank you, Pam for such an extraordinary stay!"

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I am glad to be able to tell you about this wonderful home, there is room to spread out and many, many conversation areas. We were celebrating a four generation Thanksgiving, ages 95 to 10 months, family came from a few blocks away to as far as Michigan.
The home's kitchen was so well equipped, we fixed all our favorites and we had everything we needed.
The linens were of the highest quality.

The location could not be any better! We were able to easily walk downtown to enjoy several great restaurants & take in some wonderful local shops. The annual holiday evening parade downtown was a lovely surprise we enjoyed. Pamela was a wonderful host! She offered many great suggestions on what to do in Salina. She had camping chairs ready for us in case we wanted to go to the parade, which we really appreciated. Her attention to detail throughout the home was evident and her thoughtfulness and hospitality was top-notch. We definitely recommend her home and hope to visit again some day!"

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay in Pam's home!
Pam knew we were coming with young kids and she was so accommodating. We walked into her beautiful, immaculate home to find a well-stocked basket of goodies for the kids.
Pam left a detailed manual with clear instructions and a list of menus from local restaurants. We were very impressed with the local offerings, food, and art. There are tons of shops, restaurants, markets, and a huge park within walking distance. We only moved our car one time during our stay! We would highly recommend Pam's home for anyone staying in Salina."
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"This home is wonderful...warm, cozy, and makes your heart smile!

The house is perfect too. Beautiful outdoor area, super functional and well put together interior, clean, and every little thoughtful touch or thing you could need is there for you! I‚Äôve never stayed at a place that has everything this property had to offer - hands down the most well thought out property you‚Äôll find!
And obviously this place is in a killer location! Walking distance from so many restaurants, bars, and shops downtown!
Cannot say enough good things about Pamela or this property! Cannot wait to stay again!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"As great as this home and backyard is the hostess, Pam, was over the top accommodating.

The backyard is huge and great for enjoying the evening with family. Definitely will stay again and would highly recommend it."
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great home and fantastic location! Pamela was wonderful to work with, and the home was simply perfect. Not only did we have all we needed for our stay, but the house is full of so many thoughtful touches and guest-friendly features.

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Five or even six stars would not be enough to describe the exceptional experience one encounters at Pamela's home! It is truly exceptional. Pamela has thought of most everything. AND, she continues to think of new amenities while you are on property. If you are in the Salina, KS area, this is THE PLACE! And, Pamela is an exemplary host. If it gets better than this, I have yet to experience it. THANK YOU, PAMELA!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Great host
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house is definitely the gem advertised, located in the heart of updated downtown Salina. We were able to walk to The Temple, shopping, and restaurants. The house is spacious, clean, and filled with amenities that are above and beyond what we expected. We felt at home there and Pamela was immediately responsive to all of our questions and needs. Traveling with young children isn't always easy, but a home like this made it possible for us to relax and have the space to move around. I would definitely recommend Pamela as a super host and her home as the perfect place for a family or group. We will definitely stay again when the opportunity arises."

2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"I almost don't want to give Pamela's house the review it deserves because I have a feeling I'll rent it again. üòÜ
The pictures were amazing but the house didn't disappoint at all... Pamela has done an amazing job of setting the house up! The rooms were great and so is the outdoor space. Pamela was great to work with as well. I really appreciated that she checked in the first morning (well after we'd been in and out of the house) to make sure everything was going well.
We enjoyed the basket of snacks üòÜ I also liked that both bathrooms had makeup remover wipes (as well as q-tips and cotton balls). That was a nice touch.
The location is great.. we were able to walk to a bar (Big Nose Kate.. it was fun and nice not to need a DD.) We didn't end up checking out nearby restaurants but we walked passed them and they were all busy.
If you're looking for a place in Salina I highly recommend this one."
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful home furnished with fabulous beds, towels and linens. She has nightlights and charging stations all over the house so you can find your way around even in the dark. All 4 bedrooms are upstairs giving you a nice open area downstairs to visit and eat! Loved our stay here. Top notch care!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our stay at Pamelas house was great! We felt right at home and enjoyed having the space to spread out as opposed to a hotel! The location was just right for our activities planned while we stayed. It is walking distance to everything downtown and sits central in Salina for a quick drive anywhere. The house was very clean and has been updated and remodeled very nicely! The rooms were good sizes and the living spaces inside and outside were comfortable and spacious. Pamela thinks of everything to make sure guests at her house have what they need. Pamela was available and wonderful to talk to throughout the weekend, though we never needed anything, we enjoyed our conversations! We will plan to book this next year for our annual family reunion as soon as the dates set!"

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Pam was available when we needed her, compassionate, and a joy to work with! When I had a need, she quickly responded and solved the issues. She took our needs and concerns seriously when they arose and we were completely happy with each resolution and her response. I appreciated that she returned our messages so quickly! We could tell from the moment we walked into the home that she takes extreme care of the house and has thought of everything, from safety measures (fire extinguishers, outdoor lighting, and alarms) to extra amenities (sewing kit, pool towels for Kenwood Cove or Kanopolis Lake, coffee bar, hampers and a cleaning station).
The house was beautiful! Well decorated and warm. It was so equipped and full of thoughtfulness. We did not find that we needed a single thing extra beyond what was provided. The kitchen was quite airy with plenty of space to host and cook, providing crock pots, birthday candles, bundt pans, and extra cooking supplies! We especially appreciated the option of plastic, ceramic, or glass kitchenware.
The games were a great touch and a hit with the kiddos!
There was plenty of room to spread out and relax and I felt like we didn't need a single thing! The backyard was cozy and well lit. We felt safe and comfortable spending time outside with our kids. Lots of places to sit and relax all over outside and inside!
We were completely happy with our stay! We felt welcome and as if we were treasured guests. Pam made our stay a joy and took the stress out of our vacation! We'd absolutely stay here again!"

2021-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Pam as the host was great! She was very accessible and friendly. We had never been to Salina before and found the downtown Santa Fe Street completely charming. Lots of independent businesses such as art centers, restaurants, bakery, bars, and clothing shops. The street had been completely renovated with sculptures on every block, lush landscaping, horse drawn carriage, and stylish lighting, etc. So it was just fun going basically across the street to walk Santa Fe and look at everything. Pam's house was all freshly painted and all new flooring, furniture and furnishings. The art work was all original and had a sophisticated aesthetic to it all. Kitchen and bathrooms were all stocked and new with everything you could need. There was lots of craftsmanship put into the living room ceiling to make that entertaining room more interesting. The backyard was huge, quiet, and neatly kept. It just worked perfectly to have a small gathering for my fathers 80th birthday party with relatives coming from Hays, Manhattan, Dodge City, etc."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location and layout to entertain a medium size group.

neighborhood. The place was clean and well stocked. The back patio and game court were a huge hit with the group of teenagers we brought.

2023-06-01,4.0,Group trip,"Very spacious and well maintained home. Great back yard and deck for outside time. Very quiet neighborhood with friendly neighbors. Note that the kitchen is sparesly stocked. If you are planning on cooking meals while there, bring your own cookware and knives. We did have storms late both nights while staying in Salina and were disappointed to discover that the garage doors had been disabled preventing us from moving our cars into the garages to protect them. Also, please note most, if not all, of the beds are rollaway beds as is clearly mentioned in the description. They are pretty comfortable in spite of this and none of our party of 6 was uncomfortable sleeping on them. Also note, there is no coffee pot (again as in the description) only a Keurig, which was a disadvantage for our group who enjoys a leisurely AM of coffee and visiting. We would definitely recommend to others looking for a relaxing stay in Salina."

It boasts not only a zoo but it also has a large and fascinating diorama museum. It is literally real and simultaneously staged. My kids are convinced this is the place to film a sequel to the Night at the Museum movies.
Karla & David were kind & understanding about our late arrival. Even at that hour they invited our kids to go out and play on their outdoor tennis and basketball court. It was a perfect way for the kids to run off some pent-up-road-trip energy."

2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Karla's place is great. We were coming off of a long days worth of driving and were so happy to get a comfortable, clean and welcoming environment to stay in. Karla and her husband were very kind and helpful, and the downstairs rooms offered privacy and quiet if needed. It was nice to have a warm cup of tea and Karla's home baked oatmeal in the morning before getting back on the road."
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"So much clean and quiet space! Karla and David are outstanding, gracious hosts. We will look for them again when in Salina. The exude top shelf attention and comfort."
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Karla‚Äôs home has the perfect amount of grace and charm. Plenty of shared spaces and very friendly. Had the best baked oatmeal!
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If you have the opportunity to stay with david and Karla you would be foolish . There house is very comfortable and accommodating. An amazing space that is by far the best value I have ever spent on accommodation any where in the world . I can only hope that if I ever am I the neighborhood they‚Äôre not booked as I know I can not find anywhere on earth with better value for money. Again if you need somewhere to stay in Salina their place is perfect for up to 6 people comfortably. Do not miss the opportunity of staying in their beautiful house if you get the chance . .
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was our first experience with Airbnb and we were very pleased with everything. Karla and her husband were so hospitable and we will gladly go back again.
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,tres ien
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I had a very nice stay at this location. It has ample space and is contained within a beautiful home. The hosts were very welcoming and made sure that I was comfortable after I had arrived.
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a kind and caring host. We will definitely stay there in the future.
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great comfortable space, and quick communication. Friendly and fun to talk with. I mentioned that I would be doing some work after supper and they made sure I had everything I needed to get it done."
2019-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Their place was perfect for us! We had to stop halfway on our way back to IL from CO and it was just a mile or 2 off of our route. They messaged me back promptly and had beds for everyone. We were able to check in at 12:45 AM. And they had coffee for us to take on the road
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very comfortable place with plenty of space for a family. Save some money and avoid the hotel. Stay here!
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very gracious hosts and clean and pleasant space. Highly recommended, thank you both!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family (4 littles 5yrs and younger) LOVED this beautiful ‚Äújungle‚Äù getaway! It is in a perfect location-private and woodsy, but still close to plenty of parks, restaurants, shops, &t! Our host was so kind to provide some toys and snacks for our kiddos, which they thoroughly enjoyed. Their favorite part was the disk swing in the yard and the star night lights. As the mom, my favorite part was all the ‚Äúlittle things‚Äù that made our trip easier- bottled water, high chair, fully stocked kitchen, laundry, and a lovely place to relax once the youngsters were in bed!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Don't pass this place up! Whatever you're in Salina for, the private and peaceful property is a sure way to relax in the evenings. Exceeded expectations property and owner alike. Amber was an amazing host!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A mile north of Salina proper, this nest in the trees is a proper get away! I was looking for a comfy place to crash a couple days and I was pleasantly surprised to find the much needed break from it all.
We were greeted by a dive into the trees and a winding drive that opened to an almost storybook meadow where our little weekend retreat sat gently atop a little hill. Inside was a basket of treats that would satisfy the health nut or the candy monster. The house was pleasant smelling, clean and welcoming.
All the amenities you could ever ask for to have a function temporary home were present, and then some.
My wife and I have been on the road with work for the better part of the last 20 years all of which has been spent in hotels, so I made some Airbnb faux pas, which Amber was both accommodating and patient. Going forward in my travels I‚Äôm definitely going to use Airbnb more and I will be staying here in particular, many more times in the future.
Best,
Anthony"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay for peace and quiet! Would definitely consider staying again anytime I'm in Salina!
2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"it's a cute place to stay, but has a big drawback. we arrived late in the day with our 2 kids and were beat and ready to watch a movie. it's not obvious this place doesn't have wifi until day before checkin, and I should have checked better but I also was told we could Hotspot the TV to watch movies, which didn't work at all, even though we had great service. when troubleshooting we were told the service isn't great but there are lots of dvds. not true, there's probably 10 or so, and they're all very old, or very mature movies. nothing that is kid friendly, which was surprising because there are lots of toys and kid friendly accommodations. it was a cute stay, but with 2 small kiddos who weren't feeling well, the TV situation was disappointing"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a fantastic place! Amber was so welcoming and sweet. The house was spotless and beds comfy. I loved all the trees and would love to come again when all the leaves are in and sip coffee on the balcony üòäMost definitely would love you stay here again next year!!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amber made us feel welcome the minute we walked in the door! She had a bouquet of balloons cheering on our girls wrestling team for state! The cabin was very homey and comfortable. We loved it being nestled in some trees and enjoyed the farm animal sounds.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved the theme in the house. The location and privacy was great. wished there was wifi as the TV situation wasn't great. other than that we would definitely stay again.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to get away from everything and just exist! I was able to work on a lot of my passions in life and not have to focus on problems that come with living in the city

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Several inches of snow came the day of our checking in, so we couldn't enjoy much of the outside. Inside was warm, clean, and comfortable. Amber has thought of a lot of details that most don't."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was an excellent place for our family of 4 to stay for the weekend! Everything was exactly as described. The host was very thoughtful with personal touches such as snacks on the table, a small vase of flowers, and toys and books set out for our kids. We loved being outside of town, but with easy access to everything that Salina has to offer. The outdoor space is a huge bonus to this place with chairs, a large shaded area, a creek, and a fire pit! We would definitely recommend this as a place for other people to stay!!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was my second stay. We travel to Kansas in the Fall to hunt and this is the perfect place for us. Location, location, and location for sure, but also all the amenities. The new washer and dryer are a great addition allowing us to wash and keep our hunting clothes scent free, and dry them after the rain.
As Arnold said ""I'll Be Back"" Hugh"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amber's place is very quiet and cozy, perfect for a romantic weekend getaway. The decor is very cute and different. There are a lot of personal touches and everything we needed was provided. The area is very peaceful, it was nice to sit out on the deck and relax. It was about ten minutes from downtown Salina and anywhere we needed to go. Amber and her husband were very responsive and quick to address any issues. We would stay here again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful stay. Perfect secluded location, yet right by town. It was cozy and beautiful inside and out. We loved the mural!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful place and experience!! My nephew and I spent a great weekend at Amber‚Äôs Airbnb. The interior is so much fun and so unique! And the grounds, the deck, the fire pit made for a relaxing getaway. I can‚Äôt recommend enough. We‚Äôll be back!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amber was a great hostess. She was very responsive to any questions. Her home was great. She added so many extras that I have never had in an Air BnB. Extra snacks, coffee, water, spices, appliances.. we were absolutely set for our mini-getaway! We really appreciated the extra touches she provided. The house was beautifully decorated. Very clean and organized. We had everything we needed! Thank you!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Our second stay a Ambers place. We love it! Great for our 4 legged kids. The place is clean and well stocked. Amber has lots of info on the local happenings. Amber supports her local venues providing informational flyers and samples for near buy places. Highly recommend staying here!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay at Amber‚Äôs! Her place was close to town, but felt completely private and peaceful. We knew we were coming on one of the hottest weekends of the year, but luckily her a/c worked even better than ours at home!!! Also, the shady yard provided a nice retreat from the heat and we loved her swing!!
Amber‚Äôs place was decorated very well, you can tell she‚Äôs put a lot of love and thought into the place and we were greeted with the BEST welcome package of local goods!
Amber is a great host. Very easy to get a hold of, but gives you space to enjoy your trip!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We so enjoyed our stay! Amber was such a wonderful host; she was very responsive and this Airbnb was one of the best stocked places that we‚Äôve ever stayed at!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our peaceful stay at Amber‚Äôs place.

We will definitely stay here again next time we‚Äôre in Salina!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cute place with a Jimmy Buffett vibe. Updated, clean and peaceful. Plenty of room to walk the dogs. Will stay here again.!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amber's hideaway was very fun. I loved the jungle theme -from the linens to the cups and even the silverware! The wall murals were great.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We stayed in Salina in order to attend my niece's wedding. It was available for a great price and pet friendly so this was our choice. We travel with our pack of pups which includes a senior dog. This place fit the bill for us and it was clean! You can tell Amber put a lot of love into this place. We would definitely stay again and highly recommend this private spot to relax in Salina.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved, loved, loved our stay! We were in Salina for the wonderful Smoky Hill River Festival, so our days were full and we were only there long enough to sleep and shower each day. This would be a great stay if you are looking for a retreat. We will definitely stay here again. So many thoughtful touches to welcome us: music playing, fresh flowers, candy, a bottle of wine, and bottled water."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was such a great place to stay! Amber was very helpful in offering suggestions for things to do nearby during the weekend we stayed there. The property is so pretty and they have the most adorable sasquatch figurines to help direct you where to go. Overall great!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such clean, cozy, private place but not too far from things to do. I'm so glad I chose this one. The little extras were so helpful. Like a tooth brush my kid forgot. We will definitely be back!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This Airbnb is so cute and very well kept. My husband and I truly enjoyed our stay. We really appreciated ambers special touches she left for us on our wedding day.

She offered wonderful recommendations and was very quick to respond to any questions we had! Absolutely accommodating and friendly! My grandparents and I are already planning for our next visit once the trees and such bloom!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Amber's place for a mini ladies weekend with old friends. The location was perfect - in the country, but still close enough to town. The property was fun and funky with the jungle theme, but still felt like a country getaway. We had all we needed to cook, relax and catch up. If the weather would have been warmer, we would have loved to take advantage of the beautiful deck and fire area, but it was too cold! Amber was responsive and made sure our time was as pleasant as can be. We would definitely stay again!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"All the details and instructions were perfect and spot-on. When we walked in, right away noticed how clean it was and it smelled divine. My girls right away claimed the upstairs loft. We loved all the special touches and the beautiful surrounding. My girls also loved that it was pet friendly and that they were able to take their dog along."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great little private place just outside of town! Lots of little extras that made it feel like home. Beds were very comfortable and kitchen was fully stocked with anything we needed plus some! Amber was a fabulous host and we will definitely be back!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had such a wonderful and amazing time at our stay! It was simply magical. Amber paid so much attention to all the little details, and we truly felt so taken care of and pampered with all the little extra goodies. I loved the style and vibe of the place. The photos don't do this little Midnight Tropical Soiree any justice. This location is absolutely perfect for a romantic little getaway. Plus, it's just on the outside of town, so you feel secluded and yet it takes very little time to go ""into town"" to grab food and get back. We will be back sometime! If you're on the fence about it, just do it already! You won't regret it."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Why would anyone ever stay in a hotel? Place was perfect for our trip! Clean, well organized, and lots of ""extras"". Amber is a very friendly and responsive host."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Lovely, comfortable, and peaceful place to stay! Lots of charm and very thoughtful amenities."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. We‚Äôve done quite a few Air BnBs, hotels, BnBs, etc in Salina. this was one of the best. As consumers we have a choice of where to spend our money, and Amber is the top of our list in Salina Ks for a place to stay. The amenities were as described, but we walked in and felt at home after a long drive. The whole sty felt that way, and we‚Äôre appreciative of all the extras. Thanks to you, Amber. We‚Äôll be back."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amber was great, easy to communicate with, showed lots of care in the gifts she had for all four of us! Beautiful decor throughout. Lovely grounds for walking, exploring or just to relax. Anything we asked for we got!!!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My pup and I absolutely loved our stay at Amber‚Äôs! She was very communicative and made sure we had everything we needed before checking in. Including extra blankets for Odin (it was a chilly weekend for us Floridians), snacks, waters and a few other personalized welcoming gifts that made us feel right at home :)
The house was amazing and had even more character in person than what you can see in person. Though it‚Äôs not too far from a major road, it‚Äôs quiet enough to hear the leaves falling during the day and at night. There were a lot of little things there that must airbnbs forget; like extra spices, paper towels and plenty of kitchen utensils, which I really appreciated.
Highly recommend if you‚Äôre ever in the Salina area. It‚Äôs my new go-to for whenever I‚Äôm back in town
Thanks again Amber!!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had such a great stay here! Amber is an incredible host that truly looked out for us to make sure we had everything we could need while we were in Salina. The property is gorgeous, and the house is so adorable! I would most definitely stay here again!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ambers place is absolutey picturesque! Her property sits on land surrounded by lots of trees! Our stay was in October so we got to enjoy our mornings and evenings on her deck watching all the leaves come down! This was my husbands first trip to Salina and he LOVED his stay. We immediately felt right at home walking into a home that smelled clean and country music playing. If you are in the Salina area, this is hands down the place be."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an absolute gem hidden away in Salina, KS! The forest/nature theme is absolutely adorable and there's plenty of space to stretch out and relax. I couldn't imagine being cramped up in a hotel room with an option like this around. Amber is also a truly amazing host! The care and thought that she shows towards her guests is something you just don't get everywhere. Not only was she super flexible with my check in as I arrived pretty late at night, but she even left out a flashlight to help me navigate the property and an umbrella just in case it was raining when I got there. In short, Amber takes an already amazing stay and elevates it to a whole new level with her hospitality. I couldn't recommend this property enough!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here for a few days and me and my girlfriend couldn‚Äôt find a single thing we didn‚Äôt enjoy about our stay. Very clean, cozy and hidden away. Will 100% come stay here again if we‚Äôre town!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"it is an amazing little cottage! the hosts provide extras ( that we weren't expecting), snacks, water, ect! The communication is amazing, and they are always available to help. I would go back in a heartbeat! it's especially good for young families....they have games, dvds, a high chair, board games....it is just lovely!!!! it is a tremendous value!!!!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Highly recommend this property! This charming bungalow is on a beautiful tree filled property with space to roam and relax. The house was just as cute in person as in the photos. Amber was very thoughtful with the amenities included such as; salon quality shampoo, conditioner, body wash, extra toothbrushes, snack baskets toys for the kids, even star projectors! Amber was very responsive and easy to communicate with. There was a heavy storm during our stay and she was quick to make sure we were ok and had all we needed."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Such a great little place about 10 minutes out of town! It is so quiet and peaceful with plenty of places to relax outside or inside. We appreciated the special touch of snacks and decaf coffee! Wasn‚Äôt anything we could have needed. My pooch enjoyed the big doggie bed provided. If you are in the Salina area this is the place to stay!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great day at Ambers a frame Lodge. Myself and a few of my coworkers stayed together. We enjoyed using the gas powered fire pit that was available close to the lodge.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our time staying at this Air bnb. We appreciated the extra effort Amber went to for our daughter, like adding baby gates, plugs for the outlets, toys, blocks, rocking horse, and special animal cookies for her on a high chair. :) And we were provided fun snack baskets and pancake/waffle mix! That was so fun to walk in the door and see the snack baskets. I thought the lights around the deck were so fun, too. We enjoyed a lot of time out on the deck. There were goats that belonged to the neighbor that we got to see. That was fun for us and our daughter.
We appreciated the cold bottled water in the fridge. The midnight tropical theme was fun and creative, and it really felt like we were staying at a midnight tropical soiree because of the black curtains and black painted walls and mural on the walls. Amber's husband helped us get the fire pit started when we were having trouble. We had an enjoyable time at this air bnb.
It seemed like Amber wanted us to feel welcomed. We appreciated it! And her and her husband also gave us different ideas of what to do in the area and where to eat."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Both the place and the host was absolutely amazing! The house was in the perfect location, and you felt as if you were in your own little oasis. The host was amazing and communicated well. Definitely will be staying here again if in the area!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Amy was absolutely fantastic! This home is a hidden gem. It's beautiful and so peaceful. The house is really large and such a great deal for the price. Amy had decorated the house for Christmas which was an extra appreciated touch for my son and me. Beds were exceptionally comfortable and I'm usually very hard to please on that because I'm pretty particular. We had a simple maintenance concern our first day, and Amy was so responsive-- had her person out within a few hours and all taken care of. I can't say enough good things about this home and this host! Thanks again for a wonderful stay."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This home was perfect for our stay in Salina visiting relatives. The kids really enjoyed hanging out downstairs where the big tv and games were. We were super thankful for the additional air conditioner upstairs since while we were staying there was a heat wave!! The beds were really comfortable. I was super thankful for the coffee and snacks. The interior design was truly flawless - hats off to the designer! I loved the front porch seat although I could only last about 5 mins with my coffee out there since it was so hot! I would 100% recommend this spot if you are staying in Salina!

I‚Äôm so glad we did. It is well appointed. Love all the towels and wash cloths. We were traveling with elderly parents and so when I reached out to Tracy to find out about what levels rooms and bathrooms were on, she was super helpful explaining the layout. The home is quaint and very well updated with all the amenities you need. The beds and pillows were great! The home is very spacious and you can separate into rooms and then come back together in the living/dining room. It is located on a lovely tree-lined street.
If the occasion presents itself, we would stay here again."

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Clean house in a quiet neighborhood!
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Check in was simple and easy, while we were unpacking we found a crushed twisted tea can inside a dresser drawer. After a day of traveling we wanted to take a shower and were met with a stand up tub that had no door only a shower curtain so showering was a bit difficult in such a small space, especially for larger individuals. The bathroom faucet was loose and sprays in all directions. When we attempted to open some blinds in the living room we found that the ends were scotch taped on having been broken before. The bathroom door and a bedroom door were very difficult to get to latch. Our 21 month child was sitting in the chair at the desk and it collapsed on him, which we then learned it was broken. We were left with only 2 trash bags and 1 roll of paper towels. Other than that Frank and Amy were very responsive and friendly and were very upset to learn of these things. I would most likely stay with them again, however not at this location."
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,The hosts were very kind and responsive. Excellent hosts. The property was not clean at all. My family and I did not feel comfortable staying due to the lack of cleanliness and visible mold. Overnight there were people outside breaking bottles and carrying on. My toddler was woke up many times. The bed linens were stained and smelled awful. There was so much dust my family‚Äôs allergies were awful. The property is very old and the photos don‚Äôt represent how dated it is. The bathroom was not clean. Especially the toilet. I cannot recommend this place - even though the hosts seem like very nice people.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We moved away from Kansas a year ago and needed a space to meet with our three kids, their spouses and the grandchild for Thanksgiving. This was a great space for our purpose. Roomy dining room to eat our Thanksgiving dinner. The washer/dryer was a plus and allowed us to pack lightly for our long flight. I would say this is a great space for families."
2023-11-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Location was great- easy to find and easy to get in. Beds were comfortable. Charming older home with beautiful wood & character. My only problem with the stay was cleanliness. Some prior guest had cooked in the microwave & there was food splattered all over inside & it stank. I wiped it down a bit because I needed to heat up something, but gross. Also there was some food drips on the stove. Also found it odd that guests are expected to start laundry."

2023-06-01,2.0,Stayed with kids,"Probably wouldn‚Äôt stay here again. I didn‚Äôt realize there is only a geriatric whirlpool tub. Not feasible with two little kids which I had told the host I had a toddler and infant. Foul smell in kitchen and black flying bugs all over in our food. Impossible to eat. Ants in living room and bathroom. Felt like we were being bit while staying on couch. Housekeeping needs some instruction as the fridge was very dirty, hairs in shower and beds."

We will definitely stay with them again when we are in the Salina area.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This listing was perfect for my work trip. The kitchen was well stocked and the rooms were wonderful.
2023-02-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,A beautiful home built over 100 years ago. The floor plan was spacious and perfect for my kids to run around and burn off steam after a long road trip. The beds are two queens and a full across three bedrooms. Three TVs allowed everyone to relax and watch what they wanted. Hand washing the dishes was not ideal. The cleaning requirements were high but helped keep the price down so that the house was cheaper to rent than two hotels rooms.
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,This is a really lovely place to stay. It has the warm feeling of nostalgia as older homes do and has been very beautifully kept and restored. We only wish we would have been able to spend a bit more time there. The kitchen is very open with plenty of counter space. We only had time for morning coffee but we could see it would be very easy and convenient to prepare meals for a longer stay. The living room‚Äôs cozy sitting space was great for our group of five. The beds and linens were comfortable and clean. We will definitely consider staying again
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cute home! We would rent again from Frank!
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Franks place looked exactly like the photos showed. It was extremely neat and clean. There were 7 of us there, he made an exception for us which was greatly appreciated, and there was plenty of room for us all to spread out. We were all able to eat at one table and be support for each other during our stay there (we came for a funeral for a small child) and times were stressful. It was our home away from home for a few days and we were able to invite the daddy of the little one to join us for dinner one night and gave laughter and relief for all involved. Frank went above and beyond for us. So much better than the best hotel where we would all be separated and have to eat each meal out. We would stay there again in a heart beat if we ever had to go back."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The water got too cold before it filled the bathtub enough but other than that, great stay."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,No review
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Great homey place to stay while you are in Salina. We love this town and were there for an art festival. It was great to have a roomy home to go to and have family stay with us instead of everyone having a separate hotel room. It's a craftsman so all kinds of charm. Very clean too.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a lovely stay! We loved staying here rather than a hotel and we had plenty of space for our kids - the house even has plenty of games, toys and books that kept them busy. Clean, spacious, quiet and very convenient to bring your bags/belongings in and out since the driveway is right next to the entrance.

I was in town for a military ceremony. I had been having a hard time getting my shoes shined just right at home, and I knew a hair dryer would help (melts the shoe wax to help even out the shine), but ours at home was broken. I was really hoping they would have a hair dryer in the Bungalow when we got there and they did! It really saved me üòÖ

Loved how easy the keypad check in was. There's a kpod-style coffee maker and pods and a nice fridge / stove. The bed was comfy and the TV is a roku tv that hooks up to wifi for Netflix and stuff.
Frank and Amy were very helpful; the wifi had gone out due to wind (very common in the midwest) and they let us know how to reset the router. They also worked with us on a flexible check out time which was extremely helpful for us so I appreciated that.

I'm one of those folks who seem to be addicted to pickleball, and a message on the Salina pickleball group's Facebook page got me set up with folks to play pickleball at Oakdale Park.

Traveling alone on business, I didn't need a king size bed or free breakfast; just a safe place to rest my head, and close proximity to the event center. Favorite bonus: The luggage rack in the bedroom! Small caveat: You might want to pack an eyemask and earplugs. It is a quiet neighborhood, but there's not much soundproofing between the units, so I could hear floorboards creaking on the other side. Not a big deal, especially if you plan ahead. :)"

It was comfortable to stay in and get done what we needed to when in town to see family. We especially appreciated the use of the washer and dryer. Privacy is minimal, as the shared walls with the neighbors invite you to get to know one another more than in some duplexes, and there's no door between the bedroom/rest of the house, so noise travels easily through the space. Otherwise it was great, and we'll likely be back."
