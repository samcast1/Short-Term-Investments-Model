2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay in Jacksonville was excellent at this two bedroom rental. We enjoyed views of the woods behind the house, the well appointed kitchen for our meals, and the simple furnishings made for an uncluttered, restful time. The house is located near the road and railroad which made for some traffic noise at night. But over the weekend we stayed, it was mostly quiet. There is a great park nearby and lake to get in more outdoor roaming."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was our third visit to Jacksonville and, as usual, we had a great stay at Charley's place. The house is nice, comfortable and clean, and has all you need for a great stay. The lake was full, so we had a great time fishing, kayaking and canoeing. We need to start planning our next visit!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We are appreciative for our peaceful stay, and enjoyed immensely. Every aspect of our stay worked perfectly and gave us what we were looking for!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay! We quickly understood why Charley and his family call the lake house their ""happy place."" It became our ""happy place"" too while we were there, and we were sad to leave at the end of it! The house is tucked away among a forest of tall trees and pines, making it feel very private and secluded. It sits right on a lake and the views are breathtaking. We spent most of our time outdoors enjoying the beautiful view from the back porch, swinging on the tree swing, playing games, and enjoying the firepit in the evenings. It was so relaxing and we could feel the stress melting away. The house is very clean and cutely decorated. It had everything we needed for a comfortable and relaxing stay. Charley is a very responsive and attentive host. We would definitely come back for a return trip!"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,This place is very quiet and comfortable if you‚Äôre looking for a peaceful getaway.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing, peaceful setting. Our second time staying here and we absolutely love it!"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"Charley was an excellent host, and the home was literally spotless. You can tell they take pride in the property. We ran out of time, so didn't get to fill out the guest journal, but it was a joy to read the reviews of past guests.
You can't ask for a better spot on the lake. It's right at the end, very shallow, and even though you can see plenty of homes on the lake you feel completely alone. Nothing in this price range on Airbnb compares. Can't wait to return."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We have stayed at many airbnbs, and this was one of our favorites! The host was very responsive, and they had everything we needed for our 3 day weekend. We were wanting something quiet on the lake where we could relax, fish, sit out by the fire, play board games, and cook at home without having to go out. This place was perfect! The property was beautiful and peaceful. We only saw a couple of bass boats the entire weekend. Our daughter even caught a couple of fish! We look forward to returning again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful property, private, and perfect for us and our dog. The house was cozy, and we slept great in that bed too. We really werent there much but when we were, it was perfect for us. We did get to bring some of our fam back to just chill by the lake and we really enjoyed the afternoon there. We hope to stay again next year when we visit."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,perfect place to stay
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,We talked about coming back next year! The backyard was perfect for the kids to run around and play. Very beautiful and peaceful. My only wish would be to have more lighting outside in the back. Host was very friendly and was quick to respond to my questions!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Best Airbnb we‚Äôve ever had!
My wife and our four kids enjoyed it so much we stayed an extra night to take it all in some more. The grounds, lake, and home is more nice than in pictures"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a lovely stay at Charley‚Äôs place! It was exactly as described and communication was great. We hope to be back!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A beautiful home that provides tranquility to anyone who stays there . Pictures do not do it enough justice . Out of the days me and my family stayed there , not once did we get bored . From the beautiful view to the cozy home, there was always something to do. The hosts really provide you with all the essentials you need and more , you feel right at home . If you‚Äôre looking for peace and quiet go for this place , you will not regret it . I will definitely visit again , this was a beautiful experience me and my family will treasure . Thank you to the hosts !"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a gem! The hosts couldn‚Äôt have been better. So responsive, no delay at all! We air bnb all the time and this place was hands down the cleanest and coziest ever. Hate to brag too much cause I want a chance to book it again, HA! So many sweet touches in the house and absolutely everything you could think to need at your fingertips. There was almost zero cell service but we found it a plus to unplug from the outside world and relax. Decent WiFi for WiFi calling and texting. Hubby enjoyed fishing. Water was a little low but he still caught a few about 6 inches to a foot long bass. Comfy couch for napping and watching movies. Lots of fresh towels and blankets and plenty of pillows. Every cooking item and utensil needed minus a big pot for soup but who wants to cook real meals on vacation?! Fridge/Freezer was spotless! So many wonderful games and everything was so clean and house smelled wonderful. We plan to come again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Such a peaceful home tucked in the Piney woods with easy access to tranquil Lake Palestine. We loved sitting on the dock watching egrets perch while enjoying the quiet lake views. The best aspect of this home is the privacy and feels like you have the lake all to yourself because it ends in a shallow cove right next to the home. This place if stocked for a welcoming stay, and we appreciated the snacks and comfortable beds. Thank you for welcoming us with a kind note and everything we needed for our weekend getaway."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second stay at Charley‚Äôs. We like the house, its location, and having the lake right there. This time the lake was very low, so it was great to have the canoe and the kayak to go out fishing. The dogs had a good time running around and taking naps on the pier or the deck. We had one afternoon of rain, so it was Netflix time. Not bad at all."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The owners really went above and beyond. They were extremely communicative for entire month leading up to our vacation. They also had recommendations of things to do when we asked. The property is stunning and absolutely beautiful. It is very clean along with the inside. It is fully remote and you are not bothered by anyone.
We had to leave a day early because I was called back to work. This property is great for a family to go, or a romantic getaway. I wish nothing but amazing things for the owners of this property. They really have done an amazing job on making their guests feel welcomed, provided a nice property and above everything really are the kindest people ever! We will definitely be keeping this is a favorite in our list.
East Tx people in the stores and around in the city were also very laid back and kind. Positive experience all the way around."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Everything was nice and we had a wonderful stay. Lots of little extras and the gift basket was a nice touch, we appreciated it. They really did take the time to think about all the little things.
We will definitely be back.
The only complaint we had was there were other cameras throughout the property that weren‚Äôt included in the original description as the 3 listed. Made us feel a little uncomfortable, but overall a nice stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A nature lovers‚Äôparadise, from the misty morning lake fished by white egrets to the moonrise after dusk, the wonderful peace of singing birds and shady old trees frames the lake view from the back deck. The house is cool and accommodating. The kitchen is well stocked and all modern appliances make meal prep just like home.
We were close to town, with easy access to highways and stores when needed.
A huge,sloping yard for running and playing would be ideal for children, not to mention the tree swing and game chest inside and all the swim gear for water play.
We enjoyed our stay immensely! Thanks so much for sharingüíù"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This Airbnb was more than amazing. It was exactly as described and I can‚Äôt explain enough of peaceful it was to wake up and enjoy coffee with the view the backyard has. We enjoyed the lake and the animals and creatures that lived there. We saw many birds and lots of fish splashing up. The living room was so cozy for my family to sit and talk in.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The little home was just as described. This lake is fairly crowded with homes on the north side of the lake. Charley's is on the more secluded end. The lot is big enough to not feel like neighbors are next door. The water was shallow at this end, but the fishing was good. The house was very clean and the host provided extras such as: wood for the fire pit, a few snacks, bottled water, pantry with some supplies if needed, games, etc. We would highly recommend this house."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as described, very peaceful and beautiful surroundings. Close to town but very private, clean and peaceful!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our stay, super private and the dogs loved it. Lake was a little low but it didn‚Äôt bother us, just didn‚Äôt feel comfortable putting the boat in. Everything was great and such great hosts, they left a little note and snacks. Awesome place!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Went with my mom and sisters!! Had a great weekend!! Very peaceful and beautiful!! We‚Äôll come again for sure.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We had a wonderful stay at the lake house and felt welcomed by a personalized note and snack basket! The location is very convenient, yet private and peaceful! Charley was very responsive to any questions even checking in to see if any garbage needed to be picked up. Definitely will stay again!!!
Thank you for sharing your home with us!!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Charley‚Äôs lake house is truly the most wonderful, peaceful and beautiful place! The property is gorgeous, serenely peaceful and the views of the lake are stunning. The hosts so generously attended to all of our requests. The amenities were perfect in every way and the house was absolutely spotless! This is the first Airbnb where I had no need to re clean anything upon arrival as it was impeccable. We loved playing family games and my husband and 13 year old son really enjoyed fishing and swimming in this shallow part of the lake and taking in the beauty of nature surrounding us. Sitting on the deck, looking at the lily pads, listening to the birds chirp and catching a deer sighting on our walks was such a treat! We made the most wonderful memories at Charley‚Äôs lake house and are so very grateful for his welcoming hospitality and genuine kindness. Thank you for sharing your precious home with us and for the opportunity to help us make joyful family memories that will last a lifetime."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing little quiet secluded spot. Home was immaculate inside & out, with all things needed. The water is fairly shallow quite a ways out. Fantastic for swimming. A+++++++++"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"It was an exceptional stay. The place is beautiful, peaceful, and tucked away from the hustle and bustle. The cabin is neat, well-maintained, and equipped with all the essentials necessary for both short and extended stays. Charley was exceedingly helpful and quick to respond to any inquiries.
Highly recommended!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,My family and I had an amazing stay. Charley is a wonderful host and the lake house was perfect. The view is beautiful and everything we needed was available. The location is also great because it's secluded but not too far from the city.

We are already trying to figure out when we can return to our new favorite Airbnb!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The little lake house was perfect.
Clean, comfy, charming, safe and relaxing.
It takes me a bit to unwind when we finally get a chance, normally 2 days before I can rest but this place and it's ""end of the road"" solitude helped the 2 day excellerate so I was able to relax quickly.
The lake songs were beautiful.
Thank you for sharing your home with us."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful setting, peaceful, and super clean house. Hated to leave and hope to come back. Hosts surprised us with a kind anniversary welcome gift. House is well stocked and thoughtfully decorated. Jacksonville has some great places to eat for a smaller community and very welcoming!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an awesome place to stay and wish we could have stayed longer. Private,peaceful my dogs loved running into the lake. Didn‚Äôt catch any fish this time, but we will be back again. Charley was very helpful and responsive during the trip. Great place to take the family for a get away from the real world. The property has tree lines on both sides.. like I said private."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"After spending 3 days at the Little House by the Lake my wife and children and I all agree that our experience deserves 5 Stars across the board. (*****) The home is charming and impeccably decorated. Upon our arrival the home had been cleaned and sanitized. It comes furnished with all the essentials and it is cleverly decorated in the Lake House theme. The scenery and serenity are phenomenal, and the location is ideal. The home is situated on a large and isolated property on Lake Jacksonville less than 10 minutes from town where there are restaurants and grocery stores. The host families are dedicated to providing their guests with a quality experience and they are very quick to respond to your correspondence. They immediately satisfied all of our wants and needs. We intend to return to the Little House by the Lake and we would recommend it to anyone spending time in the Jacksonville vicinity. To quote my daughter, ""you will not be disappointed!"""
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay. Host was very friendly. Highly recommend.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If I could afford to have a lake house, I would like it to be like this one. The location was perfect: secluded but with excellent access. It was easy to get our canoe and kayak into the lake, and fine to cast from the pier as well. We caught 14 bass in the three days that we were able to fish (rainy, windy and cold the rest of the time). The house has all the amenities that we have at home. We had excellent communication with Charley from the time we reserved the house until we checked out. Our expectations were met and surpassed. We are ready to go back!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place and environment! Absolutely amazing!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The house, the amenities, the view of the lake is exactly what the listing states. The place is beautiful. The basket of goodies with a personal note welcomed us as we walked in. The kitchen, LR, bedroom, bathroom are all super clean. We went there to relax and loved the property, the view, and the peace and quiet, that we had to extend. Enjoyed having coffee by the water in the morning, and listening to the birds, and taking in the evening sounds. Next time we are booking for a longer stay. The house is far away enough from everything, but a short drive to Walmart if you need anything. Charley and Jess were very responsive.
Thank you Charley and Jess for sharing your lake house on Airbnb."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved it. Highly recommend.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We absolutely loved our stay here. We are on a 3 week vacation trek from N. NV. Out of 4 Airbnbs Charley's place was absolutely the cleanest most peaceful and friendly host. I only hope we did our part to leave it nice for the next guests. We can't be thankful enough for such a peaceful place that welcomed our dogs. If we ever get another chance to visit we would love to stay again.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This is a peaceful, amazing place to unwind and enjoy warmer weather. The home is cozy and comfortable and we felt at home. We enjoyed the view of the lake and were able to sit on the deck to relax and listen to the birds. This was our first trip to Texas. The people are friendly, the area was fun to explore, and we enjoyed eating great food. Our stay also allowed us to have a break from cold weather. We received 5 inches of snow in Iowa while we were gone. Charley responded quickly when we had a question and our hosts made us feel welcome. we highly recommend ""The Little House by the Lake""."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay for a little getaway! House is well taken care of! Will be back in town soon, will be renting again"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,Absolutely amazing place to stay if I could rate higher than 5 stars I would.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and well taken care of. Beautiful inside and outside. Host goes above and beyond to ensure you enjoy your stay.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was absolutely beautiful! It was so peaceful and you felt right at home only better because of the lake view. It had so many games and toys that were available to use. Instructions were very informative and laid out everything you needed to know about the property and the surroundings. We will definitely be returning to this place this summer. Thank you to the hosts for providing such a cozy, beautiful place to bring in our New Year!"
2022-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed Christmas in the house- there was even a lit Christmas tree! Charley was super helpful when we had a problem. We enjoyed our stay!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Everything was amazing. Very well stocked and now we know for next time we don‚Äôt have to bring much at all. House feels very cozy and has beautiful lake views and privacy. Beds and pillows are comfy. Lots of toys and games for kids.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The host was great and very welcoming. The house was very clean and very well taken care of.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This lakeside home is truly a hidden gem if you're looking to unplug from the world and enjoy your family. The property was beautiful and the home was clean and welcoming. Our five kids had plenty to do! The hosts were extremely thoughtful in providing many toys and games to keep the little ones busy. We also enjoyed fishing right off the dock!
The hosts are very accommodating and keep in touch with any problems. Our first day ran late b/c they needed to replace the water heater but our late arrival was mostly our fault and bad timing.
One of the days we were here, while playing on the tree swing, we found out our baby is extremely allergic to ants and spent some of our day in the local ER. So if you have an emergency yourself, the local hospital is great.
We do recommend the hosts install better outdoor lighting. A large animal would come out to the water making the fire pit unsafe to use after 5:30pm. Other than these few hiccups, this place really is great and we all had fun!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a great place to get away to for a few days. Look forward to going back
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"Love this place! It was very comfortable and worked great for our family of 5. They have a ton of stuff to make your lake stay fun, next time we will stay long enough to enjoy it all! Thanks for hosting and communicating so thoroughly!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay at Charley's lakehouse in Jacksonville, TX. Everything was very easy for us to do, starting with the booking at airbnb.com to getting to the property. We enjoyed the private setting on the lake. The house is as cute as a button and very clean and homey. We walked in to the most warming environment. We truly enjoyed the whole experience. We hope to go again in the near future. Thank you Charley for letting us stay at your lakehouse. Dennis & Jenny"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Robert and Christina's place is a hidden gem in Rusk! Beautiful surroundings, peaceful, quiet, cozy & comfortable! It is a perfect place to be at one with your thoughts or have a wonderful family gathering around the campfire or a fun movie night in the theater cabin! As it is a bit remote I would recommend trying to get there in the daytime as it was a bit of a challenge to find in the complete darkness (but once you get there there are porch lights & string lights that can be turned on if you are returning from your adventures from the day after dark).
We have family nearby so we will definitely be back! Thank you again for sharing your adorable cabin in the country!‚ô•Ô∏è"

We loved the quietness and nature. We spent 3 nights and enjoyed cooking food inside and outside in the grill; we also enjoyed playing different games, walking around the property, and watching movies. My daughter loved the upstairs bedroom. The bonus little cabin is also a cute addition too! I also liked that there‚Äôs a city about 25 minutes away with a Walmart and other stores and food places in case you need something. This is definitely the place to go if you want to be away from the city and just relax. WE DEFINITELY WANT TO COME BACK AGAIN!
Lastly, the host was great at communicating and responding, thank you for that!"

All appliances and the home itself was very well taken care of. Felt very secluded with nature all around. The ladder can be daunting for young kids. Our kids struggled coming down. Also, the half bath and laundry is separate from the main house. Must be accessed from the outside of the house."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very clean, private place that was in an absolutely gorgeous area. Wooded outdoors, just you and nature with plenty of fun activities inside the home as well. We certainly were able to unwind during our stay and Robert extended our stay when we reached out, wanting to stay longer as the place was not already booked. Do not let this one pass you by, stay here and you will be very well pleased by the home and the host alike; absolutely wonderful."

The cabin was beautiful inside and out - the design‚Ä¶ the details in the cabin itself‚Ä¶ the outdoor ambience ‚Ä¶ all of it was absolutely stunning. You can tell the hosts have worked very hard to create an unforgettable and one-of-a-kind getaway.
The property itself is so peaceful while still being easy to find. We even got to see a couple of foxes and a deer during our stay!
The beds are so soft and comfy! Everything was very clean and had all the amenities we needed - including laundry detergent. This was, hands down, the best Air BnB we‚Äôve stayed in yet.
My older kids loved the loft and the movie cabin. We also had our youngest with us who is 2 and she had a blast exploring outside.
Also, Rusk has a couple of really cute coffee shops to check out (less than 10 minutes from the cabin) and is close to Davy Crockett National Forest which is beautiful and fun to explore as well!
We‚Äôd recommend this cabin and look forward to visiting again!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful weekend away from the city. Amazing cabin in an unlikely place. Little town was small but nice. Mexican restaurant in Rusk was really good for a whole in the wall. I would love to go back! The customer service is next level, you will not be disappointed."

Firstly, Mr Robert and his wife‚Äôs hospitality and welcoming demeanor made me feel comfortable and welcomed from the moment I arrived. They attention to detail in ensuring the property was in immaculate condition and well-equipped with everything I could possibly need throughout my stay was truly impressive.
Additionally, The amenities such as the theater rooms provided a relaxing and convenient space for us to unwind and conduct my daily routines. I also appreciated the extra touches such as the fast responding and quick solutions provided.
I definitely will be back again!!!!!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You can book this property with confidence. The house & property is as beautiful as described and everything we had hoped for. The design of the property was very well thought out. Everything we needed was there and we never had a need to reach out to Robert as his instructions were very well laid out and everything was marked for ease of use. We absolutely enjoyed morning coffee on the porch and fires in the fire pit in the evening. We even got to see a few deer on the property on both mornings towards the back of the property. We will definitely be booking this picture perfect getaway spot again in the future. We only regret that we had plans all day Saturday and didn‚Äôt get to stay in and enjoy the property as much as we‚Äôd like to‚Ä¶. maybe on the next visit.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent stay at Roberts place. We wanted to stay longer! The place was so clean + designed with excellence! The beds are very comfortable + there is no detail overlooked! You will not regret staying at Roberts place except having to leave it!

I deeply enjoyed the artistic design of the interior, the beautiful details of this new construction, the setting amongst the tranquil grand trees, the unexpected path to the mini movie theater cabin (what!?), and so much more. I had a very quiet and connected time, and produced an amazing work that I am excited to share with the world. Thanks for creating such a stunning lodging experience."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,we wish we could have enjoyed it longer but was in town for a family reunion so we were on the go the whole time. we will have to make time to go back just to enjoy the peace and beauty for a relaxing trip.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great trip with the family. We arrived after dark on the first day, and our three year old described the cabin perfectly when he walked out on the first morning and gasped, ‚ÄúWOW! Look at the woods.‚Äù

While you are there check out Dogwood park in Palestine, and the fishing at the Texas State Railroad campground in Rusk."

2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"We were so glad to find this gem for the groomsman for a wedding in Rusk. It exceeded all our expectations and the guys raved all day about how great it was!

Sitting outside, you can hear the creek, while enjoying the fire pit. Early morning you can enjoy the deer grazing while moving to and from water. The small out building up the hill offers a quiet sitting area with a fireplace and an overview of the property. Really nice at night with the lighted paths. It was a great getaway for our anniversary. Robert was very quick to respond to questions. The home was clean and comfortable and had everything we could need for the weekend. So glad we came across this hidden gem!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was supposed to be a getaway for my husband and I but due to a change in childcare situation we had to bring our three boys. It was still a great weekend! The boys absolutely loved the property- the creek, the fire pit, the trees. There were many games that my boys played each night. My husband and I enjoyed the quiet and beautiful area. Wifi worked great."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had the best family getaway here. We drove from DFW and wanted to just enjoy a peaceful weekend in nature. This cabin didn‚Äôt disappoint! The kids (4 and 5) loved the loft and quickly mastered the ladder. The space was perfect. Cozy but big enough that we could all have our own space. The kids rode their bikes in the gravel drive in front of the cabin and ran up the big hill constantly. We roasted marshmallows in the other cabin and watched movies. And when it rained, it was so peaceful to watch from the porch.
If you‚Äôre looking for a quiet getaway that‚Äôll wear out the kids, this is it.
It was clean, had everything we needed to cook and close enough to restaurants when we ventured out."

2022-12-01,5,Group trip,This place is great to go and get away for a while. Great location surrounded by tall trees. Would definitely consider coming again with family. We were there to work in a couple of towns nearby.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the cabin views - secluded and very quiet. Great place to stay and very short drive into town.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the perfect cabin for a weekend getaway. It was just far away from town that you feel like you‚Äôre away from it all. The trees were beautiful and what made it even more perfect was it rained while we were there and we were able to sit on the front porch and listen to it rain without getting wet. The home had everything we need to cook our own meals and be comfortable. Plenty of games and movies. The home was clean and we would definitely stay again.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful house, super clean, everything was perfect. Nice quiet area with great local food."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at Robert's cabin. It's a great location away from the city but not too much.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Off the beaten path, had no idea what to expect really and I can say I couldn‚Äôt have been more pleased. This place is so nice and serene! It‚Äôs beautiful and well equipped yet has a nostalgic feel and is private and cozy!

Don‚Äôt miss out I promise it won‚Äôt disappoint!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,I cannot say enough about this place. Everything is perfect every time we stay! This is our 3rd but not our last trip out. It is in a perfect location for fishing enthusiasts. Darrell and Charlene are the greatest hosts. The Bungalow is absolutely adorable and beautifully decorated. Every detail is covered. Thanks for the perfect getaway. We will see you again soon.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay at this beautiful cabin. It sits right on the banks of a beautiful little creek that feeds into the lake. We were able to pull our boat right into the back yard which made things much easier for us. Everything was as good or better than Darrell and Charlene said and they responded immediately when we had questions. Definitely a 5 star stay.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I bought a weekend honeymoon for my daughter and her new husband, this is her review of the place-
‚ÄúIt was cute and peaceful. Exactly what we needed. We spent a lot of time just on the back patio watching the turtles in the lake, birds, and squirrels. We loved the record player too! Very romantic and cute vibes for anyone choosing it for a weekend getaway or anniversary or honeymoon like us. Biggest regret for us was forgetting the fishing rods at home! We would definitely return for another weekend getaway. Not to mention, Darrell and Charlene were so kind and excited for us choosing their place for our ‚Äúmini-moon‚Äù that they made it extra special! Thanks again! Chelsea and Christopher Mitchell‚Äù"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful stay we had! We loved being here for Wiggy Thump 2024. The little bungalow is so peaceful, and has wonderful amenities. the beds were insanely comfortable and we loved Darrell‚Äôs keen eye for ambient lighting. The guidebook was super helpful and had great recommendations. We tried out Stanley‚Äôs BBQ in Tyler and it was delicious! Midway package and feed was a fun spot to get local cheese/meat and breads as well as any of our liquor and beer needs! what a convenience. We loved this little slice we got to experience in Frankston and can‚Äôt wait for Wiggy Thump 2025!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,the best! Darrell & Charlene went above and beyond. The lake is beautiful with a fire pit to use. The home is stocked to take care of all our needs. This was our second stay and we are happy to have it available again. Looking forward to our next visit.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed at Darrell and Charlene‚Äôs for a few days to partake in the total eclipse 4/8/24. The Eclipse was spectacular, the room was great. Even caught a few fish out back. We will definitely book another stay here the next time we‚Äôre traveling through Texas."

Thank you so much for letting us stay at your place you did a fantastic job!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Charlene and Darrell are some of the friendliest hosts I‚Äôve had the pleasure of dealing with. The space was fantastic and absolutely beautiful. The back yard is a magical little oasis with fishing steps from the door! There are tons of little touches inside that make you feel right at home. The house is also equipped with everything you need to enjoy your stay. My husband and I both raved about how comfortable the king size bed was and how amazing our sleeps were. I would absolutely recommend this stay to anyone and everyone. 10/10!
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"We just had the most peaceful, relaxing valentines weekend at the lake house. Everything was extremely clean and well put together; just as pictured. Beautiful views and welcoming host. Everything we expected and more. Would definitely stay here again."

We're devoted patrons and will continue to make their place our escape as long as they'll have us. If you're planning a getaway in the vicinity of Palestine, Texas (plus or minus 200 miles), give 'em a shout!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay on the water! Peaceful atmosphere. Loved the record player with records. King size mattress was very firm-just a heads up!

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Darrell and Charlene‚Äôs place was great. The place was really clean and it‚Äôs a nice quiet neighborhood right on the lake. It was a very relaxing experience. They even had snacks that our kiddos loved and wood and fire starter for the outdoor fire pit. We stayed here after riding the Polar Express in Palestine, which was located very conveniently less than 30 minutes away. Would definitely stay here again."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is adorable, very clean, and perfect for a relaxing getaway. We enjoyed the stunning backyard with lake views and truly appreciated the care that went into making us feel at home. Darrell and Charlene left a lovely thank you card and checked in with us several times. We always felt they were available if we needed anything. The kitchen was spacious and had all the tools we needed for cooking, which was perfect as we planned to stay in for meals all week. It was unseasonably warm during our visit, so there were lots of mosquitos around, but that is to be expected at a lakeside property. Darrell and Charlene left the backyard stocked with spray and candle mosquito repellants, as well as traps, which kept us comfortable while enjoying time outside. Thank you so much for the incredible hospitality and for providing such a lovely and comfortable space to unwind!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My mom and I enjoyed this location very much! I have stayed in numerous AirBNB's in the past and I can say its one of the best!. I like the outdoors and not much for dining out or shopping. The location is tucked in a quiet cove with alot of evening wildlife to enjoy while out around the firepit. Some owls visited us and several squirrels jumped and played around the tree feeder.
The house is super clean and inviting when you walk in. The bathroom is a bit on the small side but cute! The kitchen and house had everything we needed including fast WiFi. AND, cold air conditioning!!
Thank you Charlene and Darrell for having such a comfortable home for others to visit and answering some last minute questions promptly.
I highly recommend this property if you are needing a place on Lake Palestine."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This getaway bungalow is stunning! Right on the water. The amenities were immaculate and we had such a great time here! We will be back! Not to mention, the hosts were so great! Very communicative and super friendly and in touch! If I could give 10 stars, I would!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As soon as you walk in, you are welcomed by a warm and welcoming atmosphere.

The house was very clean and we were provided with towels and blankets. We loved it so much, we extended our stay an extra night! We will definitely be back in the future. Highly recommend their bungalow!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a cozy place in East Texas with hosts that go above and beyond, the Lake Palestine Bungalow is for you!

An excellent experience in every possible way!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second visit to the bungalow and it was perfect as always. Can‚Äôt wait to come back!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I'm a little biased because I grew up with Darrell and Charlene, but the Bungalow was legit. Wonderful location. View was amazing. Caught a fish on the first night. The 4 Geese family were really cool.
It was way too hot out during this summer heat, but they left a fan outside for us and that made it bearable. We really wanted to be outside for that view and take advantage.
Kitchen had everything we needed. Comfortable couch and chair. We plan on coming back during the fall when it's cooler. Can't wait to get back.
I won't give away the special touches they did for the wifey and I, but there are always special touches upon arriving that first night that make you feel special. It's a must visit, ESPECIALLY if it's a romantic getaway.
For the golfers out there, you are about a 12 minute drive from Pine Dunes Golf Course off of 155. Best golf course in Texas and a must play. Thank you Darrell and Charlene. Love you guys!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We absolutely loved our stay. Darrell and Charlene have put a lot of time and effort into this home and it shows. It was very peaceful get away for a girls weekend. Darrell and Charlene were very friendly and we‚Äôre very easy to communicate with. Highly recommend. We want to come back!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our weekend getaway at the bungalow was AMAZING! Darrell and Charlene were fantastic hosts and made sure we had everything we needed. They created such a cozy spot with a fantastic backyard full of birds, butterflies, and other animals. Our stay was complete with small personal touches that made it even better than we expected! I will always recommend the bungalow and can‚Äôt wait to come back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The bungalow was well appointed and we truly enjoyed our visit. It was perfect for our needs and Darrell and Charlene were great communicators. If I‚Äôm back in the area, I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to book it again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I were at the Bungalow for a quick stay hoping to unplug for a few days.
Upon arriving the place was super cute inside and out. Beautiful decor and very clean. The yard, both front and back, was perfectly neat and so inviting. There were many thoughtful touches throughout, including chocolates and towels laid out for each bedroom, a citronella candle with lighter, bug spray, and a nice fan were set out for us on the back porch.
We had a quiet and peaceful time here. Husband caught several bass off the bank at the public area down the street. Loved watching the birds, butterflies, squirrels, turtles, ducks, and jumping fish‚Ä¶right outside the back door!
You truly have everything you need and the comforts you want. The owners‚Äô hard work and thoughtfulness in preparing and sharing this place make it one we want to return to and are thankful to have found."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Darrell and Charlene thought of everything. They went above and beyond compared to the other Airbnbs that we've stayed at. They added personal touches to their welcome. It was just awesome.
The bungalow was so precious and clean. Very spacious. We loved the back patio too. This place is a must!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A great location, super peaceful. We stayed at house most of our stay, but it was close enough to restaurants the night we wanted to go out. The hosts were super responsive and gave great recommendations."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and comfortable place! Could use a different shower set up! (small) Inside is very well done
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I just have to say, my family's stay at Darrell and Charlene's lakeside bungalow was absolutely amazing! I mean, seriously, it was one of the best places I've ever been to because of their efforts. From the moment we arrived, it felt like home and we could tell that they were such caring and thoughtful hosts. They even made sure to accommodate my dad, who uses a wheelchair, which was so touching. And to top it all off, they left us a sweet personalized note that made us feel so welcome. I can't thank them enough for everything they did to make our stay incredible. I feel so grateful to have had the chance to stay at their beautiful bungalow."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We felt right at home in this lovely and well-appointed bungalow. Enjoyed watching the wildlife and kayaking on the lake. Easy drive into Jacksonville for restaurants. We are definitely looking forward to coming back!
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Darrell and Charlene were such great hosts. They were so accommodating. They were very responsive and answered any questions quickly. The Bungalow was so welcoming. Every detail in this house was perfect. The decor was fitting and added to the ""at home"" feel. I cannot express how thankful I am that we found this place to stay while visiting for my son's collegiate bass tournament. The location was perfect and easy to get to. They had everything we needed to make our 3 night stay enjoyable."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We are beyond grateful for all the thought & care you two put into making our stay amazing. Walking in to all the welcoming touches & conveniences was a wow moment. Whenever we needed or wanted something it was right there. We made so many wonderful memories. My three girls caught lots of fish and loved watching & playing with all the nature from the hammack & rocking chairs. The neighborhood dogs were so sweet & my girls loved having them around. They loved swimming at the boat ramp and playing the games. You really have thought of everything to make the stay amazing & convenient. Everything was so beautiful! Thank you!!!!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was so beautiful. Had just what you needed and no extra clutter. The view was beautiful. My only issue if i had to list one would be the shower, the curtains were so long they kept covering the drain and blocking it and I was standing on them as well. Otherwise, everything else was great. The small touches the hosts left made us feel very special and I would definitely recommend this getaway!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a delightful bungalow. This was a great stay for our 20th anniversary. The view of the lake is beautiful, and there is so much wildlife to watch. We even saw two bald eagles!! That was amazing sight! I would absolutely stay here again. This host was a great host- very responsive and available to answer questions."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful and comfy bungalow. The beds we‚Äôre very comfortable and the space was perfect for me and my family. Darrell and Charlene were great host. We will definitely be back and highly recommend for your Frankston stay.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We cannot say enough great things about our stay at Darrell & Charlene‚Äôs! They are fantastic host who made sure everything went perfect! The bungalow was exactly what we hoped it would be. We were in town for my husband‚Äôs best friend‚Äôs wedding and needed a place close to Frankston. We were 10 minutes from the venue and my husband scored a bungalow that he could do some fishing literally out the back door while we were there! I was able to enjoy the peaceful early mornings on the back porch staring out at the water and the sunshine. The place is decorated so cute, everything was clean and smelled wonderful! We would definitely stay here again if the opportunity allows us!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here for Easter weekend and it was a wonderful experience. The house was beautiful, clean, and had everything we needed. Darrell and Charlene were responsive and always let us know they were only a phone call away if we needed anything. They were even kind enough to leave the kids a basket of treats, which they absolutely loved! We spent a lot of time in the beautiful backyard next to the lake, sitting around the fire or playing games with the kids. Thank you Darrell and Charlene for your warm hospitality and a wonderful family getaway!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Darrell and Charlene's place was awesome. Everything about the place was well thought out and unique. The landscaping, fencing and overall outdoor space was creative, beautiful and functional. Inside the home was warm, inviting, super comfortable but also had a lot of character and amenities. And the lake, oh let me tell you, if you like fishing (and we caught several crappie) is literally right outside your door. If your not a fisherman relaxing on the hammock or lawn chairs or sitting on the back porch playing your guitar (which I did) is perfect.
The wife and I are definitely coming back soon.
p.s. First Mondays in Canton isnt very far either.
Thanks guys, we enjoyed and envy your place. Let us know if you ever plan to sell! lol.
Sincerely,
Rudy and Alma"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was very pleasant, the house very clean and with everything you need to have a good time, outside lighting was excellent also. Love it!üòç"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Darrell and Charlene are fabulous hosts. Not only did they add great touches to the darling bungalow, they reached out to make sure we had everything we needed. We can only hope the bungalow is available on our return!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"this is a gem of a find. my boyfriend and I stayed here for a weekend. it's so private and tucked away, right on the water. there is a fire pit, bbq, and heat lamp so we stayed warm and cozy during the cold weekend. the home is adorable with thoughtful finishes and well equippedl, we cooked all our meals no problem. we fished a bit. the bedroom is so comfortable. I will stay here again if we ever find ourselves back in Palestine. highly recommend."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We wanted a romantic getaway for Valentines, and the Lake Palestine Bungalow delivered! A great experience always begins with thoughtful hosts--Darrell and Charlene knocked it out of the park. We'd have been pleased even if we *hadn't* arrived to find Valentine treats and Prosecco--wow! A great exoerience is amplified by a squeaky clean, well appointed place to kick back and relaxe--the Bungalow had everything. Tasteful decor in every room accentuates a property that has been manicured with details--every surface, from door frames to baseboards, walls, and cabinetry revealed something special about Darrel and Charlene. Finally, a great experience piques your interests and the things you find enjoyable--lighted patio, firepit, even a fishing platform from which we netted a freshwater drum and a large mouth bass! The only drawback to our experience is that 2 nights was too short! 5 stars for this little gem, hands down."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The property is a charm. Really enjoyed the sunrises in the morning with out coffee and the heater on. It was perfect for a nice relaxing time.
Was very pleased that Darrell and Charlene were so responsive and helpful with my questions."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is gorgeous and is a great place for a relaxing retreat. Homeowners are very kindhearted and hospitable. I love their amazing customer service! Highly recommended!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was a combination of delayed 30th anniversary trip and New Year's Eve get away. Darrell & Charlene not only made our stay memorable, but they also went above and beyond with lots of 'extras' that made the home very personal for my husband and I. We will always cherish the time that we had there and SO appreciate the very special things that Darrell and Charlene did to make it special for us. We would absolutely do this again!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Charlene and Darrell were wonderful hosts!
The place was so cute and cozy.
There were so many well thought out details like a heat lamp outside for enjoying the porch on cold nights and games in the closet for family game night.
It‚Äôs exactly like the pictures, if not better!
Check in and check out was super easy.
We would love nothing more than to be back and enjoy this beautiful airbnb again.
Darrell and Charlene was the sweetest hosts. They even came over the first night (at our request) to help us start a fire outside in the back. Could not speak any more highly of our hosts. You won‚Äôt regret your stay!!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Darrell and Charlene were super nice and made sure we were comfortable during our stay. I stayed at this Airbnb to visit family in the area, and despite being raised in Frankston I never really ventured out in this particular neighborhood before. I didn‚Äôt have any issues getting to the location, but I can see driving in at night for people not familiar with the area could be a little difficult because the roads are small and dark.
Don‚Äôt be fooled by the front of the Bungalow, the place is much larger than it might seem. Coming into the airbnb, we were greeted with a nice little Christmas tree and a beautiful decorated entryway. The place is very nicely constructed and decorated. All the amenities were present. The best part obviously were the two rocking chairs in the back with the view of the cove of the lake. It is a nice quiet little place that is great to escape and relax."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed my stay here so much and I can‚Äôt wait to book with you again soon! I really loved how cozy it was and how it was very well decorated!! I can tell that so much effort a was put into making feel like a home away from home. Darrel and Charlene‚Äôs are the most sweetest people I‚Äôve ever met! They made sure that we were settled in and made sure that we enjoyed our stay. We enjoyed the view of the lake so much!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay and it did not disappoint! This home is so beautiful and cozy inside and out! The host make you feel right at home and they are super helpful. We have stayed at lots of places and this is by far one of our favourites. You will not be disappointed.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place for a nice getaway. This was our second visit and well worth it. We came up with the kids the first time, and my brother and his wife came up to visit with us. We all enjoyed it so much that my wife and I decided to come back up for a peaceful getaway.
We'd been working hard and this place was a perfect way for us to get away and just relax and enjoy the quiet, and the changing seasons as the fall colors are setting in. Our hosts we're awesome as usual, and just like the first time, the place was beautiful and clean, and we definitely enjoyed sitting by the fire pit taking it all in on that cool fall evening.
Definitely plan on coming back, and plan on bringing my fishing rod with me the next time as those big fish were keeping up a ruckus back there in the cove...lol."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our weekend stay at the bungalow on Lake Palestine was one of the best. When we walked through the front door the first thing we saw was the beautiful Lake and from that point on it only got better. the cleanliness of the place was impeccable, from the appliances down to the toiletries that were left were top notch. sitting outside by the lake, drinking coffee and fishing did so much for our stress level it was truly amazing. We will definitely come back.
Thank you so much Darrell and Charlene for the hospitality that you showed"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time here! The house is so cute and charming and we loved cooking dinner listing to the old albums on the record player and drinking our coffee on the porch looking at the lake. The host were more then accommodating and very helpful. Great little place for a relaxing get away.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed the week we spent out there, clean and comfortable with really nice backyard. I was there for a fishing tournament and had plenty of space for parking. would 100% go back."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Lake Palestine Bungalow is one of the best kept secrets on Lake Palestine. It is a beautiful oasis. The bungalow is finely appointed. You can easily see that they put a great deal of effort and time into this home. We enjoyed the bedrooms. The beds were made up like a high end hotel, but the overall environment is conducive to rest and relaxation. The outdoor spaces are complete with a hammock, rockers, grills and shoreline highlighted by uplights on specific plants and then the outdoor string lights illuminating the outdoor space in the evening while enjoying the firepit. We look forward to our next stay at the bungalow."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a gorgeous place! Total peace and serenity on the lake!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful home in a very peaceful cove it was quite and everything we needed. Darrell And Charlene made everything easy even had a few snacks out which was awesome since we arrived kinda late. Spacious rooms and the back yard is the best they had everything ready for you to relax. Will stay here again.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place to stay, the hosts cater to your every need and will never be ignored."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place right on the water. Very clean, with comfortable beds and sheets. We usually don't sleep throughout the night when staying at other places other than our beds, but this place was very comfortable and my wife and I slept like a log.
It has great views of lake Palestine and the dam, nice shade and neck patio...just a very nice location to get away for some peace and quiet.
My kids fished out back and caught their first fish (blue cats), and the location is minutes from our family's 33 acre place that we take care of, so this is very convenient for when we're going up to check on things.
We definitely plan to make another trip soon and will definitely be booking again!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,We stayed here while we were in town visiting family. It is such a lovely house and has all the amenities you would expect from a well stock Airbnb. Lauren was just the absolute best host. We were so thrilled to get to stay at an Airbnb in Jacksonville. So much better than a Hotel. Couldn‚Äôt recommend this place anymore. If you‚Äôre coming to Jacksonville book your stay here.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lauren was very responsive for our Christmas trip. She even had the place decorated beautifully for Christmas, including a tree. She went above and beyond as a host, providing us with tape and wrapping paper for our presents. The place was adorable and amenities were just as described with 3 bedrooms, a fully stocked kitchen and even an air fryer, washer/dryer and more. We would definitely stay again with Lauren.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great experience. The Lily Pad was quaint and homey. The location was awesome. It is closer to the lake than the neighbors, so it felt like we had the lake to ourselves from the back deck and screened in patio. The later was my favorite space. Cool breezes made for a nice experience on the patio. I would just sit and stare at the lake. Very relaxing. All in all, we had a great time. Jody is an awesome host. Very responsive and friendly in her communication. Will definitely be back!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"beautiful views, had all amenities needed for a comfortable stay, will come again in near future."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home, exactly as described. The only negative was that we didn't have more days there (maybe next time).

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is our 3rd or 4th stay and we still love it here.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The Lily Pad was a nice getaway and home base as we explored the Piney Woods area. The king bed was firm but not uncomfortable. If you like a firm bed, this is the one for you. If you like a softer bed, select the queen in the other bedroom, but if in summer be aware the AC in that room is on the loud side according to my daughter.
The view out to the lake was beautiful even with the drought on. The earlier rains seem to have rigged up the road in so be careful if in a sedan.
The pack of bottled water in the fridge when we arrived was a lovely touch. The large screened in porch was nice to hang out in during the even and cooking on the grill. Some locals kitties, squirrels, and even a Texas River Otter visited us and were welcome visitors. Jody was always most friendly and always responded immediately to any questions we had."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great place on the lake, very quiet & comfortable, we would stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,All 4 of us want to stay here again next year about this same time for our golf tournament. The lake is peaceful and area is very private but still close enough for our event. Very comfortable for our needs. Just need a good power washing on outside due to webs and bugs but great otherwise. We caught 4 turtles but no fish but due to drought lake is down some but great time sitting out and looking at stars having a few drinks.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"the view was amazing, the home very clean. we will definitely go back. we can't say enough about how amazing it was."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jody is a gem to work with, and she was always responsive and kind. She is a super host!
The house is larger than the pictures portray, and the outside Patio is both screened and unscreened. During July -Aug it is hot though. The propane BBQ grill is fairly new, and met our needs to make a nice steak meal for our anniversary."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house and location is beautiful! If it‚Äôs dark, finding it might be a little bit difficult but other than that everything was awesome. Jody was very responsive and the house was cold when it was extremely hot outside. We caught a lot of fish but beware of turtles eating your bait and getting caught on your line. Overall, everything was great and will definitely come back some time."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,House was clean and well furnished. Very peaceful and have an excellent time.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful time away from the big city. Jody's place was peaceful and quiet. Nice to be able to see the stars at night. Jody's house was great.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a blast at Jody's place on Lake Striker @ The Lily Pad! We spent 3 days fishing, caught a cooler full of white crappie & catfish!

The kitchen had everything we needed to cook all of our meals, the internet was pretty fast, the beds were extremely comfortable and there was a ton of space for everyone to relax!

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at the Lily Pad! Aside from leaving once to eat out, we had no desire to leave the entire time we were there. Perfect quiet, clean, relaxing location for our ""babymoon"". We enjoyed reading and sipping tea on the screened porch, grilling steaks with the propane grill, petting the friendly local cats who came by to say hello, playing games and doing puzzles inside, and cooking in the spacious kitchen. Lacked nothing while we were here (lotion, extra blankets, towels, all provided!). Master bed was very comfortable, very large room with drawers and a large closet to store our things out of the way. Could see coming back with another couple or young family since there is plenty of room for everyone to spread out. Jody was a great host, very accommodating and responsive! Can't wait to come back!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This lovely home is bigger than it looks in the photos and has tons of spacious common areas. The setting is absolutely gorgeous and serene. We loved our stay here and will be happy to return if we get the opportunity.

I would highly recommend anyone to stay here."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,More space than the pictures show. This place is packed with ceiling fans. The two outside are perfect for the screened in porch. 93 and barely caught a sweat while grilling. Bedroom ACs will keep you as cold as you would ever need in the summer. Everything was spot on. Bring a inflatable boat or tube to float around and fish away from the dock. Don‚Äôt miss out on the drive thru safari in the area. Camel stole my bag.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lilly Pad was an excellent place to stay. Very spacious, clean, wonderful huge trees spectacular sunrises & sunsets. There were a lot of things to do & if you can't enjoy yourself here I don't think you could be happy anywhere. Didn't want to leave but was grateful for our time there."

Kitchen is large with full table and well stocked with essentials. Den is very comfortable and relaxing. Master bed is very comfortable as well. A very quiet location and a quiet lake.

Her place is amazing, so peaceful, the view was stunning and the house was perfect!! Highly recommend!"

It is very relaxing and enjoyable and a place to leave all worries behind!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I'm hesitant to be truthful about this place because I don't want everyone to book it all up haha! The Lily Pad is an absolute gem and the fishing was amazing. We actually fish lake Stryker frequently because we live near by and just needed extra sleeping space for visiting family. Yesterday my hubby and his buddy caught 53 fish there in case you're planning to fish while visiting. The house was cute, clean and cozy. An absolute hidden oasis, and Jody was beyond accommodating! Very quick to respond while booking too! We will absolutely be visiting again soon!"

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jody is absolutely delightful! I felt completely comfortable thanks to her warm welcome & offering to help with any accommodations we may have required! Super thankful for her hospitality! This place is quite a gem! One of my top favorite places of all my Airbnb stays so far! The refreshing beauty of the peaceful lake is hands down one of the greatest amenities; however, the overall aesthetic of the home in its entirety provides a comfort that feels completely homey from the moment you step foot in the door!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is great! Excellent location on a rural lake surrounded by wildlife‚Ä¶.. on a late night walk to the dock, I heard a large pack of coyotes howling nearby , saw raccoons, armadillo, nutrea all within a few minutes‚Äî-and a bobcat on the way out in the morning at end of driveway‚Ä¶ Place is well equipped and with recently remodeled bathrooms.

Jody had all the amenities needed for a wonderful stay. We felt like we were home, away from home. Her place is stylishly decorated, yet very comfortable. Our family loved hanging out on the back patio. We enjoyed staying up late playing board games, watching the sunset and then the full moon reflecting off of the water. The views were breath taking.
We took the kids to the drive through safari not too far away that our hosts suggested, and the kids loved it!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I were looking for a quiet little place to retreat and enjoy our individual hobbies-fishing for him and quilting for me; Lake House Cottage was a win for both of us! My husband fished daily off the upper and lower decks and I sewed in the spacious and darling sunroom. From both of our vantage points, we enjoyed a beautiful panoramic view of the lake. In the evening we enjoyed Malbec by the fire pit and in the mornings we shared coffee and mimosas in the sunroom. In addition to a beautiful sunset tour of the lake, Richard even helped us unload and bring our things into the cottage. The kitchen was stocked with snacks and things for us to enjoy for breakfast, Richard even had worms for my husband to use for fishing! Richard and Judy are delightful hosts and we will most definitely be back to enjoy all of the wonderful amenities Lake House Cottage has to offer!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely the best AirBnB ever! Beautiful setting and hospitality above and beyond! The place was stocked with everything you could possibly need.

The bed was so comfortable, the shower had amazing water pressure... these are a couple of my favorite things on a vacation.

Will 1000% stay here again!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Richard is a stand-up gentleman. In the midst of a family emergency he was extremely understanding allowing for a last second cancellation. We will book again for a visit as soon as possible. Thank you!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We gave a 5 star rating, because there isnt a higher rating but they definitely deserve all five stars. This place is peaceful, beautiful and relaxing, allowing us to recharge our batteries. The owners were angels who welcomed us with open arms the entire time of our stay. We look forward to returning as soon as possible! It was a blessing to stay here."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the best place ever!! Good fishing and the best host ever. He and his wife went above and beyond to make sure the experience was amazing! Even got a view of the whole lake on the hosts private boat! I appreciated the chance to go out on the lake and see all the beauty of lake Jacksonville! Was not expected and was a great experience! Will definitely be back. Price was less than you can get hotel room for and far better than any hotel I‚Äôve been to! 5 stars for sure! If you could give more I would top it out! We will be seeing them again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place on Lake Jacksonville was a great place to stay; right on the water with a wonderful view. If you love staying on the lake, this is the place for you. It is conveniently located just a few miles from town. It had great amenities and so clean! Richard and Judy were great hosts and I hope to stay on their property again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"we had an excellent weekend in Richard's beautiful home.
richard was very friendly, very responsive, welcoming and invited us on his boat.
the house is very nice with stunning views of the lake and with a very comfortable balcony to enjoy the sunset at the corner of the fire pit.
everything has been thought out so that visitors feel at home and don't miss anything. it's simple, if you need something, it's sure you'll find it in one of the drawers of the house.
we also enjoyed finding some treats in the house and fridge.
the possibility of canoeing and fishing is very appreciable.
i also really liked the little wood stove in the veranda.
i would have liked to have stayed longer
i would be happy to come back. thank you
Richard"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the best Airbnb we have stayed at and we‚Äôve been to a lot! So peaceful, quiet, total relaxation. The hosts were over the top. Genuine caring and so hospitable. Left food, bottled water and snacks for us.
Truly a place I hope you get to visit.
We will be going back‚ù£Ô∏è"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"There's a reason why I'm a loyal airbnbist and Richard's lake house defines it. We felt like we had come home right from the start and appreciated the stocked kitchen and comfy furnishings. The authentic 60's Texas lake house vibe brought back cherished memories of summer trips to my grandparents' home. The sunroom on the deck with its fireplace and panoramic view of the lake was perfect for domino playing. Although the grandkids were not with us this trip, we'll keep it in mind. The lake house is kid friendly with games and fun stuff for little ones. Jacksonville is only a few hours from Dallas, but it feels like another world: heavenly. Thank you, Richard, for being a wonderful airbnb host!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"That was an amazing experience for me, the cottage has a beautiful location and views, it feels like you home, Richard and his wife are really nice people thank you for this great hospitality. I sure I‚Äôll be back here soon"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful, charming & peaceful destination for a private retreat!
It was magical to walk in and be able to see straight back to the lake. The house was clean & smelled good.
The weather was a bit cold and rainy so I spent most of my time in the sunroom, cozy and warm with a gorgeous view to soak in.
Richard and Judy were so welcoming and helpful. It felt like I was staying with family, not Airbnb hosts.
Can‚Äôt wait to come back!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect for the mother needing to recharge or a romantic getaway for 2. This place was rustic lake house charm that will surpass your expectations. Secluded yet close to town, nestled in Sleepy Hollow windy roads and a kitchen that inspires French cooking. The 2 level deck beckons you to enjoy the provided toys and amenities but also summons you at dawn with gourmet provided coffee to watch the sunrise or sunset with your favorite Shiraz.
The hosts Richard and Judy are amazing, super accommodating and an absolute pleasure. I‚Äôm booking again before this place becomes too popular, you won‚Äôt regret it. They‚Äôve thought of so many awesome details (chilled wine glasses) plenty of throws and propane firepit for chilly nights to enjoy that amazing view!!!
I can‚Äôt say enough! Pack a duffel and get lost for a few days. Phenomenal‚Ä¶ üòò"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Richard was fantastic! Their place is on the water and so beautiful!
Looking forward to staying again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family had a amazing time Richard and his wife were so nice to us even after my son broke something very important to them they took us on a boat ride around the lake before we left on our last day and it was so beautiful and they made us feel right at home
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place for a weekend getaway or longer stay. This time of year offers the much needed peace and quiet from the business of day to day life. Owners are adjacent to the property should any questionsor issues arise. Great Communication. Awesome accommodations and very clean. Don't hesitate if you're looking for a quiet, stress free getaway. Look no further."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Host was incredibly accommodating and flexible. Place was peaceful and had plenty of activities to do. Will definitely be back!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,great place nice people
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A stay on the lake in colder weather was such an unexpected joy. The view was stunning; especially at sunrise. The two fire pits made early mornings and evenings extra cozy. Richard and Judy are exceptional hosts. They are warm and friendly and very helpful all while giving you full privacy. Taking walks on this out of the way road is peaceful and serene. The rolling hills provided just the right amount of challenge for me. I am looking forward to coming back this summer to take advantage of all the sun chairs and floats I saw downstairs. This Lake house is a hidden treasure!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing for a couples getaway. Beautiful view. Richard was amazing and gave us a late check out which was perfect! Thank you for sharing this place!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Richard and Judy are the best host and hostess. Their Lakehouse cottage is right on the water with amazing views even when it was cloudy. Richard provided great recommendations for all our meals! Legends truly does have the best burger I‚Äôve ever had! Richard took care of the wood burning stove for us. Everything was perfect! We can‚Äôt wait to come back.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the most peaceful getaway. I definitely will be coming back here! Richard and his wife were great hosts.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic place!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for the stay.. I absolutely loved it.. my b day was so memorable.. thank you sir and ma‚Äôam..
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Richard and Judy‚Äôs place has an absolutely gorgeous view. It is a very well remodeled older place with little hints of nostalgia. They are very welcoming and when you get inside you literally feel like they have left you in their home to enjoy EVERYTHING.
Bathroom and Kitchen had the comforts of home (the snacks from Bella and Dakota made me chuckle) the converted boat house downstairs made for an awesome place to sit with my morning coffee.
Be aware there is a sloped walk to the house but with a wagon it was not a problem at all and Richard was more than willing to help us unload when he showed me around. We are already looking forward to another STAYcation at this beautiful peaceful home."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is great! It is perfect for a smaller family or a couple. The property is really nice, and the lake view is beautiful. Communication was prompt and helpful. The fishing is really good right off the back deck/dock. I caught 5-6 largemouth bass. We would definitely recommend this place, and would stay here again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This lake cabin is our favorite Airbnb we have stayed at, ever. This is a destination, not just a place to stay. Richard was very responsive and helpful. The check in / check out were extremely smooth. The cabin was spotless. The place is exactly as it looks in the pictures. The cabin is stocked with everything we could possibly imagine and more. Richard has thought of everything needed from the kitchen to everything we used in and on the lake. We cooked on the outside grill several times. The Wi-Fi was excellent. Most days we spent hours fishing from their private pier, on the lake in the kayak, or swimming in the lake. The outdoor lights are beautiful at night. There are grocery stores a few miles away. There is a lot of outdoor space. The balcony is HUGE. The location of the house on (and over) the lake makes for amazing views from upstairs and downstairs. The air conditioners work great. The vibe of the whole lake cabin is awesome. We absolutely recommend staying at the lake cabin."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"it was great!!, glad I chose this place"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lots of love and creativity
was spent on Buddy's Cabin! Laura you are an amazing hostess!!!
From the time we drove to the cabin to our entrance into the cabin itself we knew we were in a safe, lovely and exciting place! Thoughtfulness abounds here! So many outside activities: feeding fish, catching and releasing fish; games to play and hikes to make!! Wow! The cabin itself is beautiful! There is plenty of room; ample supplies; fresh eggs; fruit; snacks; ect. I cannot say enough about Laura. She is kind, thoughtful, and near when you need her!
Thank you for your kindness and for all your help Laura."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is a gem hidden in East Texas! We brought our two boys here for a mini spring break trip. It was everything and MORE than what we could have expected. Laura was so gracious and pleasant, always responsive and went out of her way to accommodate anything we needed. The small gestures in the cabin were so wonderful and kind! It was incredibly peaceful! The pictures do not do this place justice. It‚Äôs a new favorite for us and one we hope to repeat soon!
Must have/dos:
- must try Laura‚Äôs beef and eggs harvested right on their working farm
- must do some fishing from the pier ( we caught a catfish, bluegills, a bass, and turtles)- evening fishing is better
- must visit The Cherokee Trace Safari and experience the camels ü§£ü§£ü§£
Very very minor Cons (if you could even consider any):
- smaller bathroom
- you will need an SUV or 4 wheel drive to get down the path (we brought our truck so we were good)
Thank you Laura! It was so amazing!! 5 stars all day!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great cabin! Too many extra details/treats to try to mention, but suffice to say, we were pleasantly surprised with all the thought and care that makes this place so relaxing and fun. We had a great time fishing and hope to be back again. I would highly recommend staying here if you want a five-star experience."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a charming cabin! My aunt and I were in town to deal with family stuff and it was so nice to have such a tranquil setting to come home to after long days.
I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù and I fit very comfortably on the bottom bunk, so this place works if you don‚Äôt want to share the main bed.
No wifi, which was probably stated and I just overlooked that detail, but it forced me to unplug and relax!
Also, there is a cattle guard to drive over and the dirt road to the cabin could be rough on a small car (we were in a large truck), so that‚Äôs something to just be aware of. But! Our host escorted us in a golf cart personally and opened the big gate for us, very kind!
Be sure to order eggs from their working farm, we will next time!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent stay and view! Cabin felt very private and secluded, even though it‚Äôs not far from town. For a group of four friends it was cozy and just right, great layout! Host was friendly, everything was extremely clean, lots of thoughtful little details - from s‚Äômores supplies for fire pit (thank you!) to welcome tray of snacks and drinks to well stocked kitchen. No problems with cell service or hot water. Bathroom was very small, not a lot of room to move around, but considering price and all the amenities was still very worth it."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,this cabin is awesome!! it is so private and relaxing. even the cattle don't get close. the fishing is great! the new decor is well designed. worth it all!!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The lake buddy cabin has become my favorite place to stay when I need a relaxing break. This was my 2nd stay and I definitely want to keep going more often. My 5 year old love this place, he got to hike, feed the fish, make some smores and play with all the games in the cabin! Laura is an excellent host, she make sure you have a pleasant time. The cabin is filled with snacks and drinks and even candy! I really loved the changes Laura had done to the cabin, the pictures make no justice on how beautiful this place is. I cant wait to come back!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"the place was amazing and peaceful, it's was more than I expected, and laura a amazing host the cabin was full off details and make me feel so special .

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My kids and I loved staying here! There were so many things for us to do on site to stay busy and enjoying nature. We enjoyed the trail around the lake during the day, and the fire pit and marshmallows during the night. Would 10/10 recommend and stay here again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"we absolutely didn't want to leave Laura's place. not only this place is a great value, but it is even better in real life. the whole cabin was spotless, full or snacks and treats and quality amenities. feeding the fish and being able to fish there was so much fun. the whole area is fenced so it feels very safe and private. highly recommend and I would love to be back one day."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an awesome weekend! Laura‚Äôs place was very peaceful and the cabin was very clean. We really enjoyed spending the evenings on the front deck.
Laura was a great host and very responsive.
We will be back again and highly recommend Lake Buddy Cabin to anyone traveling through Jacksonville."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We are in love with this place. We were visiting family and already have made reservations for next year. This will be the first place we look. Laura is an amazing host and the property is beyond beautiful.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Laura is so good to her guests. The cabin is loaded with treats and you can always get fresh eggs and meat from them. The cabin is decorated very nicely and has what you need for a relaxing time away.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The best AirBnB I have ever been to - nothing comes close to this! The cabin is located by a nice and private lake that has catfish, turtles and even a beaver. The place was beautifully decorated, and there was so many treats and activities. Laura was an absolutely great host, and she was super friendly both before checking in, when we arrived, and when we left.
I highly recommend this place, and I really want to visit again. 5 stars isn‚Äôt enough!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Laura is very responsive and you can really feel the warmth of her hospitality of how she put all the details into her cabin to make your stay a moment to remember. From the moment we got into her cabin we were like: WOW! I loved the summer-cool decor! The little details of putting some snacks, chocolates and s‚Äômores tray were indeed a wonderful welcome treat! Soft and very comfortable bed plus fresh linen. The cabin will truly give you that peaceful retreat since its surrounded with trees overlooking a lake. We enjoyed feeding the catfish and just do some trail walk around the lake. Indeed, it gave us that time to: Relax, Refresh and Renew! Would definitely book again and highly recommend this cabin to friends! Thank you Laura for sharing your property and for your warmth hospitality. One of the best hosts! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such and fantastic find! Outdoor wonderland, beautiful cabin interior, friendly host, thoughtful touches and reasonable price point, hoping to find ourselves in that neck of the woods again soon. Loved it!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed staying at Laura & Jeff's sweet cabin on Lake Buddy! The cabin is so cute, clean, and homey. This is a working ranch/farm, and we loved the fresh eggs, snacks, and country views. They thought of everything, plus more! This was our favorite Airbnb stop since we've been using this service. (Several years now.) I wish we could have stayed longer. There's a little drive to the cabin from their house, and they will take you right through the property to the little cabin on Lake Buddy. Ohhh....and be sure to bring a cooler so you can buy their beef, chicken, etc. they sell at their working farm.
Thanks so much Laura & Jeff!
Mel & Lisa"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay at the little cabin! Was beautifully decorated, had so many little extras! Peaceful & tranquil‚Ä¶exceeded our expectations! Can‚Äôt wait to go back with the family!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quite possibly the best AB&B we have ever stayed in, the pictures do not do it justice and everything in the cabin has been well thought out, if your looking for a place to just check out for a few days this is the place, it is glamming at its finest, the cabin is pristine, the bed and pillows are fantastic, fabulous coffee and snacks, wood for the fire pit, huge open windows so when you wake up you are staring at the pond and all the animals around it, you can fish in the catch and release catfish pond or just feed them, it‚Äôs completely private so you will only see other people if you choose to go into town, their is no way I can mention all the small things and attention to details Laura has put into this cabin and you would be hard pressed to every find a place this nice will all the little extras for the price, if you are looking for a action packed weekend this is definitely not it but if you just want to relax and recharge you will not find a better spot anywhere!!!!!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our peaceful post Christmas stay at Laura‚Äôs cabin. We will probably stay here again. So private and serene. A great way to unplug.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, cozy, comfy.
It was everything we expected and more. Perfect spot for a peaceful retreat. Husband felt so at home, he said he could stay there for a whole month! Laura was a wonderful host and made sure we were ok during our stay. We hope to be back someday."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I stayed here and we absolutely loved it! Actually found out we were pregnant while staying here! Best place to find out such great news! So romantic and homey! We loved the lake and all the animals that came with it! Laura was super helpful and very kind!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Laura was friendly and responsive. We especially enjoyed the view through the wall of windows out onto the pond. Feeding the fish and turtles was a surprising delight. We appreciated the coffee and snacks.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Laura‚Äôs cabin at Lake Buddy is so cute and cozy. We chose the cabin due to the location being about 35 minutes from the Palestine train depot for the Christmas train. We arrived early, drove through the awesome pasture, and settled in. We were able to make dinner before our outing. Laura did a great job with communication and the check in was seamless. The cabin was extremely clean and we had everything we needed (even a few snack extras). We only had a super quick overnight trip but would definitely reach out if tee are in the area again."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing stay at Lake Buddy Cabin! Words can‚Äôt describe the beauty of Laura‚Äôs property. She thought of everything to make our stay enjoyable from snacks, treats, and luxurious linens and towels. My boys had such a great time playing outside and feeding the fish. We would definitely recommend the cabin and be happy to come back!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time being at this place. My kiddo really enjoyed eating all the snacks and chocolates. Bed was comfortable and heater worked perfectly during our stay; 30-50s in temperature. This cabin was equipped with pretty much everything we needed so that was awesome! Cabin was clean, organized nicely. We had fun at the pond feeding fishes in the evening as well. It was nice to make some s‚Äômores at the fire pit that was also provided by the host. Laura welcomed us and made sure that we were good during our stay. Two thumbs up!!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing spot with true Texas hospitality! I wish we had the chance to stay longer. All the essentials (and more) were provided and that thoughtful piece made this my best stay at an Air BnB! This stay is perfect for those who want a glamping experience or those with little kiddos. Perfect just doesn't sum up our experience here. We truly appreciate the thoughtful touches that went into this stay - especially the treats for the pregnant momma! You'll thoroughly enjoy this cabin and it's surroundings.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great stay! Very private and peaceful. Our young boys loved the lake and getting to feed the fish.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I can not say enough about our stay at Lake Buddy! Such a great time! And Laura was sooo helpful! We bought a frozen pizza that needed a pan and she didn‚Äôt hesitate to bring one over. The stay inside is gorgeous and perfectly sized for our family. Also, I forgot a hairdryer and they have one tucked away beneath the sink! Thank goodness! Lol Outside is just perfection. So tranquil and relaxing. My son loved feeding the catfish, they were so cute! Even got to see a little turtle stealing their food üòÇ We can‚Äôt wait to book again! ü§©üèï"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I cannot say enough wonderful things about the host, the cabin, and our stay. (If you‚Äôre a Virgin River fan, this cabin beats Mel‚Äôs!) We will come here again and again and for longer. One night is not enough. Thank you thank you! A+++"

Check in was a breeze, and the cabin is well stocked with snacks, s‚Äômores supplies, and food to feed the fish in the lake. The cabin is very clean, has AC and a full kitchen, and there are farm fresh eggs in the fridge.
Came here for Labor Day weekend to get out of the city and work on a creative project and Laura‚Äôs cabin provided the perfect setting to let the ideas flow.
Would HIGHLY recommend staying here."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved this little cabin in the woods! Laura was a great host and supplied goodies for s‚Äômores, yummy snacks, farm fresh eggs and food for the fish in the pond! Very quiet and peaceful retreat if you want to get away and unplug for a few days. Unfortunately, the county was under a burn ban so we weren‚Äôt able to take advantage of her fire pit but the front porch on the front of the cabin was a great place for us to sit and relax, and eat meals as a family. We had the best time! I highly recommend Laura and her Lake Buddy Cabin!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Top notch, private cabin on a small lake with fish. What you see is what you get. cool and comfortable during peak 100+ Texas summer. I'm an early riser so it was not a big deal for me, but there are no window coverings. It's just you, the woods, and sometimes some horses. privacy was respected. highly recommended."

We enjoyed a hike, lying in bed watching the deer walk along the pond, and early mornings sitting on the pier drinking coffee. I definitely recommend this place and Laura."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, 5 stars is not enough to rate this cozy Lake Buddy cabin. Laura is the best, her communication was awesome and responded very quickly from the minute we booked through the time we left. She ensured we had everything we needed and more. We thoroughly enjoyed walking around the ranch and taking in all that nature and the country had to offer and the cabin was clean and pristine. The view from the large front windows opening up to the trees and lake was beautiful. We are hoping to make it back this summer and enjoy when the trees are fully filled out. Absolutely recommended."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Always a pleasure staying at lake buddy cabin. Will be back soon!

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a fantastically peaceful getaway! In this Covid time, it was wonderfully clean which only added to the overall peace. The windows were lovely overlooking the sweet Lake Buddy and there were fun treats to greet me on arrival. Though I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to open the gate, I enjoyed walking around the area where the cabin is located. The beautiful deck was my ultimate favorite place even though I seem to have chosen the coldest weekend ! üòÄ Laura even provided fresh eggs and cinnamon pastries for breakfast. I would totally recommend a stay here if you‚Äôre in the area or just need a place to get away from the craziness of everyday life!"

2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is a great place for a peaceful time with family! They had just about everything you could need already there! My family and I were very pleased and will most definitely be back!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,This cabin was perfect for our family! Nice and secluded with tons of room to explore outside. Our boys loved the games and s‚Äômores. Lots of tiny personal touches that made this place feel like home.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"During our stay, a storm blew in and the electricity went out. The hosts brought my kids and I donuts, kolaches, and coffee. They were so thoughtful. The cabin is adorable and such a beautiful location. We enjoyed it very much!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This cabin is so peaceful tucked back in its own little section of the property and has everything you need. Laura and Jeff were beyond kind and hospitable. The whole family enjoyed exploring the ranch and seeing all of the animals. We found this place while looking for somewhere to stay while we went to the Polar Express, but our stay at the cabin ended up being the real highlight of the weekend and we look forward to coming back another time!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The property was gorgeous and we absolutely loved this gem of a cabin. Perfect for a quiet, scenic getaway. The cabin was immaculate, with thoughtful and personal touches, snacks, and fish food, which our daughter loved. We visited in December and they even had Christmas decorations in the cabin. It absolutely felt like home. Laura and Jeff were communicative and super helpful. We would absolutely recommend this stay and loved our experience."

2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If we could add an extra star we would. The experience was amazing. Very clean very welcoming, privacy, excelent host. Words dont do it justice. Just come and make memories that will last forever."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Without a doubt, this place was perfect. Beyond five stars. I can't praise this location or the hostess enough. Miss Laura communicated perfectly - not too much and still quick to reply. She allowed us an extra night when we wanted to stay longer and she had no one else booked. The cabin by the pond was as peaceful and serine as I have ever experienced. It fed our souls completely. She stocked it with fish food pellets so you could go to the pond and feed the catfish and turtles.
It's sad we live in a time where cement jungles and steel animals pollute our lives. Stress and the hustle of life weighs me down. I needed a recharge, as did my girlfriend.
If you need your soul fed and your mind recharged - THIS IS THE PLACE! Laura is the hostess!
100/100 stars...EASILY!
If it's good enough - I'd give it 3 stars and that should be ok (but I know how these reviews work, so it's better if I don't give 3 stars). This place is worth so much more than five.
Miss Laura - THANK YOU! Sincerely."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely place!!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow! What a place and what an amazing host family. The cabin and location is GORGEOUS and clean and open and bright, the little extras made us feel right at home! My two-year-old had a blast meeting all the animals and running around and feeding the fish in the evening. We hiked and made a fire and listened to the symphony of nature from the beautiful deck. Laura and Jeff were so kind and we didn‚Äôt want for a thing. Definitely will stay again, this is A MUST! Cannot say enough about how grateful I am that we made the getaway here."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Buddy lake was absolutely a great get away for me and my boys! The owners are extremely gracious and made sure we had everything we needed. They even had some juice and cinnamon rolls in the fridge for my boys. Fishing was great and hiking the property with farm animals was a bonus. Pictures don‚Äôt do it justice. Buddy lake/cabin exceeded our expectations!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Laura was an exceptional host! She accommodated to all requests and/or last minute needs we asked for, was super communicative and polite. The cabin and land were beautiful and made us not want to leave, although we weren‚Äôt there long enough to adventure out onto their land, from what we did see, it was absolutely beautiful and well taken care of. I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to stay here again and I recommend this place to anyone looking for a beautiful and quiet place to stay."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was BEAUTIFUL! From the cute animals roaming property, to the beautiful little lake the cabin sat on, we couldn't have been happier with the place!

New Weber grill with charcoal provided. Cows, horses, wildlife all nearby. A real country cabin tucked away in the woods.. I plan on staying regularly when on business in the area."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location and great hosts! Perfect for a family of 4, or even just a couple of adults, who want to get away and enjoy the outdoors in a secluded area. Enjoyed the fishing pond and seeing all the animals as we drove out to the cabin. You won‚Äôt regret this stay if you enjoy nature and animals. Even better stay if you enjoy hiking, fishing and sitting around the fire. Fish were really biting during our stay (catch and release). For anyone curious, while there is no wifi installed in cabin, you have enough cell coverage to get what you need. So glad we found this lovely cabin!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I loved this place and only wish I could have stayed longer. There was a huge storm while I was there, so I didn't get to play outside, though it looked like there was a lot of fun to be had. I felt totally safe during the storm, and slept very well. The space had everything I needed and was thoughtfully appointed. The directions to get there and enter the property were very clear, and my hostess kindly greeted me and let me know to reach out if I needed anything, especially given the storm. I would absolutely stay again, only I'd bring my friends so we could play, play, play."

We must commend Christiane for her exceptional hospitality. Her warm welcome and genuine care truly made a difference and added to the overall charm of our stay.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay! Very clean and cozy tiny home in the woods. The hosts were very nice, helpful and welcoming. FYI - it‚Äôs secluded, but not exactly private as there are shared areas and 2 other tiny homes in close proximity."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second time staying at Three Sons Ranch and it was even more wonderful than the last. Christy is the absolute best host and accommodated our every need.

2023-12-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"We very much enjoyed our stay. There were a few slight hiccups but I attribute that more to my being picky than any fault of the host. This house is nestled beautifully in the woods of east texas, surrounded by nature and perfectly serene. It would be even better if visited in the summer or fall when the outdoor amenities can be enjoyed more easily. My children loved the hiking trail and the animals they interacted with. It can be a little intimidating, especially if you‚Äôre not used to staying in a country setting, but overall I felt very safe. We had perfect cellular signal the entire time, so there wasn‚Äôt any feeling of disconnection. Overall I would say this was a very successful trip for us and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful house, beautiful surroundings, fun atmosphere and amenities- my girlfriend, pups, and I couldn‚Äôt have loved our stay more. Christy went above and beyond for us to make sure our trip was wonderful. Thank you again! Will 100% be back!!!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Do not let the drive in discourage you, as you keep driving you open up to a little slice of wooded heaven. Even with 3 tiny homes together Christy has done an amazing job making sure each has its own private oasis.I initially was afraid the Dawg House would be too small for my bff and me but not at all we even discussed how spacious it felt.
As a country girl raised in this area when she mentioned walking trails I was not expecting the very wide spacious very well maintained trails she provides
I hope to return to visit the Beach house in the near future.
Again thank you Christy for a great stay, so glad you decided to make East Texas your home!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved the DAWG House!
It‚Äôs as cute as can be! It‚Äôs cozy and private set in the middle of beautiful peaceful woods surrounding it.
Very quiet with a super cool little porch to kick back on and have morning coffee or evening wine.
Beautiful walking trails right out the front door.
Christiane is a great host she‚Äôs very friendly and accommodating and we enjoyed conversation.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our rustic cabin getaway was exactly what we needed to escape the hustle of the holidays! The cow field was fun for the kids to mop back and forth. The pictures do not do it justice as far as space and country charm.

Super easy to find, close enough to a store but still out in the country. I wanted peace and quiet and that‚Äôs what I got!
From the moment I stepped on that large front porch I was in heaven. From coffee in the morning to adult beverage in the evening it was a very relaxing experience. ( if she had rocking chairs on that porch I might never leave-lol)
The interior was everything I could‚Äôve asked for! It‚Äôs almost like the cabin was built especially for me. Open kitchen ( with anything you might need), dining living room . Spacious bedrooms, very comfortable beds!
WiFi was a bonus! ( even though I didn‚Äôt work the entire time!)
Thank you Amy for designing this cozy farmhouse!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was seamless from start to finish. Being new to Airbnb, I was going in blind to much of the procedure, but after staying at Amy's place it makes me look forward to our next opportunity to go down there and stay again!
Btw, her beds make me realize I need new mattresses! Oh wow! I slept so well there!
As a host Amy left clear instructions, always replied quickly to questions, and was even proactive in answering some questions before I could pose them!
Amy's place is a Great place, she left great instructions, and is a top notch host! She is definitely an asset to the Airbnb community!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Amy's very much. It was clean and quiet - two things that are very important to us. We both grew up in rural settings, so we were completely comfortable with the surroundings with the animals. Sitting on the front porch at night and in the morning listening to the sounds of nature was one of the most relaxing things we've experienced in a long time.
Amy was a wonderful host who went the extra mile to make our stay enjoyable. We would definitely consider staying there again!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed the peaceful surroundings. Since I was raised on a farm I have missed watching cows and ducks. We sat out on the porch and enjoyed our coffee without being bothered or distracted. We'll be back!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Adorable little cabin. The duck likes to go hang out with the cows! I wish we had gotten in earlier in the day as it was dark when we checked in (my fault). Very easy to get inside and perfect instructions. We cranked up the heaters since it was pretty cold but they warmed it up nicely. I would like to return when the weather is more agreeable.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything was just as described. Peaceful. Easy to find. Super clean. Secluded yet a quick drive to town. Thank you so much for an enjoyable stay!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Always a great stay. We have stayed here many times while on business in the area.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amy was the best host for this last minute traveler. A spur of the moment trip almost assured me I‚Äôd be in a hotel but she was available for booking, responded immediately and make sure the place was ready for us in no time. What a cute, quaint little place this is. With views of open pastures, ponds and livestock. You barely hear a sound. Anyone wanting to really get away should check this place out. And only 10 minutes or so to three different towns with restaurants, grocery, etc. Perfect place for us. Will be visiting again very soon!! Thanks Amy!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful communication, beautiful area, extremely peaceful and quiet location. Thank you so much for our wonderful stay!"
2023-01-01,4,Stayed one night,Ask the host to drop a location pin.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Immaculately clean & homey! Any questions I had were responded to quickly. Would definitely recommend.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amy's cabin was a great way to begin the New Year and finish up our holidays here in the US. We had a relaxing stay. It was peaceful in the country and close to our extended family. We enjoyed sitting on the front porch, drinking coffee and watching the ducks on the pond in the morning, and watching the lightning storm roll across east Texas in the evening. Thanks Amy!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect! The space was cozy, the Christmas decorations were an added touch that made it special. We will definitely be staying again, and will be recommending to anyone who needs to stay in the area."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a great space in the country! Peaceful and private. The pictures don‚Äôt do it justice. Recommend highly and would definitely stay there again.
2022-12-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Wonderful rural location with good wifi. We enjoyed the quiet, the scenery and watching the cows. It was easy to find after Amy marked the location on a map, otherwise the description was a bit vague. The place is nicely decorated with a well-equipped kitchen and comfortable beds. The living space only has a couch so we brought a comfortable chair and moved two dining chairs over so we had a place to put up our feet. One of the bedroom doors is damaged and is literally coming apart, making it very difficult to move. We just left it partly open, but that wouldn't work if you are using both bedrooms and desire any privacy. There is a dresser in one and 2 dressers in the other bedroom but no place for hanging clothes or jackets. We ended up with jackets hung over chairs and on luggage. There are lights that don't work and abandoned screws in the walls and door. The front door needs some work so the deadbolt functions. Overall, a great place, albeit with some maintenance issues."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay was absolutely amazing. Loved the homey cabin.
The space was great, and the amenities were as well. A great little weekend hideaway with a porch, kitchen, 2 cozy bedrooms, and a great living room to watch the smart tv. Will be renting from here next time I come back to ETX."

A two bedroom cabin located in a quiet quaint area.
The cabin has every amenity we could have needed and was comfortable for our entire stay.
The are is beautiful with groceries, gas, food etc only 10-15 minutes away.
The cows, duck, and neighbors dog were all a welcome entertainment and not a nuisance at all!
This price is great and I would absolutely stay here again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely enjoyed my stay there. It was a perfect quant place to stay. If you love the country and are in the area I would definitely stay here
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This place gets better each time we visit!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family drove all the way down from Minneapolis with our little 1 1/2 year old and 3 1/2 year old, and this was the perfect stay! It is the cutest little hidden gem full of charm and comforts! Our little boys loved watching the cows from our front steps while my husband and I enjoyed our morning coffees! The sunsets over the pastures/land were breathtaking! The air conditioner and ceiling fans kept the house cool and comfy even during the 100 degree days! Plenty of room for a family of 4, and we can't wait to stay again!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely a great stay! I really want to keep this place quiet but want this person to stay in business.üòâ This is the cutest cabin-private and quiet but close to Jacksonville, Tyler snd surrounding areas. There is no lack of things to do within a 20-30 drive and drives are full of gorgeous hill country
vistas. The hostess is quick to respond and had everything we needed for a wonderful experience! Thanks Amy!"
2022-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,Don't judge a book by its cover..lol might look small from the outside but it is very specious we loved and enjoyed our stayed here.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cute little cabin in the country. Not remote but quiet. Very clean, very professional, very easy check-in. Only things were the crazy bugs at night getting in (keep that porch light off!) and the price is a bit more than I wanted to spend but I would stay again. Great host! Enjoyed my getaway with my two boys."
2022-05-01,4,Stayed one night,"This stay was very cozy! Located in a very quiet area, and a nice little getaway to unplug from the world."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,So grateful that we had the opportunity to find this wonderful little getaway. The location was perfect and secluded and we were able to take nice long walks on the road enjoying nature and all that it had to offer. The home was so cozy and comfortable and just the cutest ever. We felt so relaxed and peaceful. Amy was quick to respond and so helpful in many ways. I would highly recommend this little piece of heaven to others and definitely want to go back and visit again very soon!!!

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I‚Äôd like to say this place is horrible so we have as much access as possible. Unfortunately, the truth is that Amy‚Äôs spot is the best value, hands down. We loved everything, and were blown away by the attention to detail when it comes to the things we forget during travel.
Without question we‚Äôre going to copy the layout for our future AirBnB."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Super cute place! Amy was very fast to answer questions. Would stay again if we were back in the area.

2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"It was a very nice older home, very close to a small park. We had some difficulty with the front door but besides that it was a great experience. Thank you for hosting us."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Right beside a nice park to walk at too. Easy to get anywhere in town if needed. Will definitely try and stay here again next time I‚Äôm in town.

2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Right next to a park with walking trails kind of tucked back away from the busy part of town. Perfect place to stay!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had an absolutely perfect weekend stay at The Marilyn Loft House. From the moment we stepped inside, we admired the beautiful decor that exuded charm and comfort. The location near the park was ideal, offering a serene atmosphere and easy access to nature. We especially loved the abundance of board games provided, which added an extra layer of fun to our stay. The loft house had everything we needed, making it feel like a home away from home. We highly recommend The Marilyn Loft House to anyone looking for a getaway, and we happily give it a 5‚≠êÔ∏è review."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ryan,
I absolutely loved your place. It was so cute and cozy and very clean. It felt like home. It was the perfect location with only a 9 min drive for my dad and brother to visit. I also loved the park right beside it. I had morning walks there. I will definitely be booking all my visits to Texas there.
Thanks again for making my trip a comfortable one."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely home. Will stay again.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Just perfect!
Grab a book from the bookshelf and walk to the park next door.
Very peaceful, and just what we needed for our one night in town."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved this place! Perfect little getaway house for my little family. Will definitely book again if we are ever in the area!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"There is a line of trees/shrubs along the small creek that runs along the back side of the house which help provide privacy. I love that I can hear the small children playing at the park beyond that. The tree out front helped to shade the house and keep it cool during the unusually warm weather we had at the end of February. Lots of paved parking space very easy to park three vehicles if needed. Absolutely NO SIGNS OF BEDBUGS. So glad for that. Lots of windows to let light in and each had privacy blinds when needed. Range/oven and fridge, though both apartment size, worked perfectly. Livingroom is very spacious. I like that. Neighbors are quiet. Far enough away from the main highways that it is quiet of motor vehicle traffic. Trains pass by off in the distance about four times a day, just loud enough to hear the whistle blowing, not close enough to hear it rumbling down the tracks. Plenty of stores a mile away like Walmart, restaurants, drug stores, etc."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Clean, with good amenities. The vibe of the place was really nice and chill. Bath was definitely a plus. Would stay here again."
2024-02-01,3,Stayed one night,"When I arrived at the house at 930pm it was 40 degrees outside and the thermostat in the house was set to 56 running on cold. It was freezing in the house. It took over an hour to warm up downstairs. Then once I went upstairs it was so so hot.
The house was beautiful but water pressure in the shower was the worst I have ever seen. I have a lot of hair and the shower took me over 25 mins just to wash and condition due to the water pressure. Fix the heating situation from upstairs to downstairs and the water pressure and this place would be perfect."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful home. Right by newly renovated city park, easy road access, clean and quaint. Perfect."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Ryan and Ashley were the best of hosts!!! We are looking forward to staying there the next time we visit the quaint town of Jacksonville!!!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and I took a weekend trip to Dallas and Houston and it was the perfect location to stay. Right in the middle so you can do everything! The house was amazing. The only thing I would say that was bad was pulling in and out the driveway where front of my car dragged on the road.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to stay. Close enough food, drug stores etc. place was extremely clean and cute. Would definitely stay here again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,I messaged Ryan and Ashley very late last minute the SAME day to book. She did not know if she would be able since someone had recently checked out and it was late but she went out of her way to go that late and get it spotless and message me right after. SUCH NICE PEOPLE. it was perfect and she still gave me the cleaning fee back. This place is so worth the money and id book 1000X over again!!! thank you guys and we will be booking again soon.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Unique and comfortable stay! We loved how close it was to a local park and the hosts were super responsive. The bed was very comfortable and their eclectic design was appreciated by all. We enjoyed the board games and hammock too!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was needing to make an unexpected trip in town from Waco for one night due to a family emergency. I submitted to book around 3pm, ""Co-Host"" Ashley messaged me promptly explaining that they would love to be able to provide their space for me but asked if it would be OK if the room was not ready until closer to 6pm. This was perfectly fine with me, I was happy to get a place and I had not even left town yet. She messaged again that the place was ready around 5:30pm. I did not actually make it until close to 9pm that night due to hospital visits I was in town for.
This place was perfect! very clean! The decorations were really cool, and it had everything I needed plus way more! The bed was unbelievably comfortable, the same goes for the pillows. The kitchen has pretty much everything you need and the whole place was very cozy!
This was my first Airbnb to ever book. I hope that they are all this way and the same goes for the hosts as well!
I am very thankful for this experience!"

The house had been recently renovated and the owners did a lovely job on the renovation. We loved sitting on the back porch in the evenings and listening to the birds and enjoying the countryside.

Such a beautiful part of Texas!! We‚Äôll rent again next time we go to RR!"

2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute place !
Only things of note - we had a really hard time figuring out the heat , she responded right away and was great and offered help but even following the instructions it didn‚Äôt kick on for us , so we had a chilly day but still had fun keeping warm ! I wish the outdoor space was a little more private as there is another cabin close by. But overall very good stay!! And such unique little place ! Worked well for our short stay !"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really enjoyed the stay! Would highly recommend checking out the Offerings on the brochure, the s‚Äômores were very enjoyable! Would stay again if I‚Äôm ever in the area!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As a last minute booking, we really enjoyed our stay here. The scenery was beautiful , and Christiane was very attentive and responsive to our needs. The only issue we had was having to take our trash with us at the end of our stay, other than that it was perfect."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved our time at Christy‚Äôs little beach house in the woods. The place was very well designed with beautiful decor and had everything you could ask for in a tiny home. It was nestled in a secluded area with a cute little hiking trail through the ‚Äúenchanted forest‚Äù. Christy was very inviting and accommodating and made sure we had everything we needed to feel at home. Her three little dogs were super cute too! We enjoyed using the fire pits and the pool and she even had a projector available to use to watch a movie. We definitely want to come back soon!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great atmosphere, friendly hostess, and super clean & nice!! Loved our stay!! Would def stay again"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Christine was the most gracious host of anywhere that I've ever stayed. She went above and beyond and I don't say that lightly. I brought the pups and I think they spent more time with her and her pups than with me, she had the treats, of course. It was so peaceful and she's built a little oasis within her place. I'd definitely stay here again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Christiane was great. She went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable and had what I needed. She even offered to pick me up some stuff in town, if I didn't want to go. Great place and great host."

2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This Airbnb was extremely clean and very cozy. It had plenty of space for up to 2 couples, some kids, and had a great back yard for pets. This Airbnb felt like home but felt as clean and nice as a great hotel room. The neighborhood was great and the front porch was really nice, if there was a porch swing or some chairs out there I‚Äôd be tempted to spend the morning on it. Very nice experience overall, we would definitely recommend it to anyone hoping to stay in the area!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Melvin‚Äôs Place is simply beautiful. The well lit, generous front porch and beautiful entry door were only hints of what was inside.
The stunningly finished original hardwood floors set the stage for the impeccably crafted home. Every detail was perfect. This is a masterclass for anyone wishing to restore a home to its original warmth and beauty. There are no silly trends, just timeless grace.
The fixtures and appliances were a new but classic compliment. Sleek pewter blended with the simple classic style. The brand new appliances were a joy of efficiency and the new lighting accents the stunning decor with welcoming warmth and security.
Thank you, Susan, for your kind attentiveness. Our mission in the area isn‚Äôt complete so we hope to make Melvin‚Äôs Place our home in Jacksonville as often as we can return in the months to come."

2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Emily was very sweet and personable. Would recommend staying here!
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Our stay was a busy one. We had a girls weekend for our Bride to Be. We ate local, shopped local, traveled just a little north for a Bridal Shower and then wine tasting at Kiepersol. Our rooms were so welcoming. Everyone slept so good. The furnishings and decor were meant for this home. It was raining much of the time so we did not get to enjoy the back yard as we had hoped. The location is near several boutiques, casual coffee shops and local restaurants. For anyone planning a trip to Larissa House, be sure to check out and follow Jacksonville Chamber of Commerce for local events. Be sure to take the time to visit the stores and restaurants down main and Commerce Streets, you have to get off the Highways to see the true beauty of Jacksonville."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"If I could add more stars to this place, I would. This is a historic house with a tremendous amount of charm. I like how well the original 1800's feel is preserved here. It is a quiet neighborhood. I would recommend it to anyone in the area. You will be hard-pressed to find another place like it. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. It felt like a home away from home."
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,The house was amazing!! Everything inside was so beautiful and well kept. Family and friends that stayed couldn‚Äôt stop talking about how neat everything was.. we only live 30 min from this house but would stay again just to experience it all over.. it‚Äôs ‚Äúif those walls could talk‚Äù kinda feel. So glad it‚Äôs been kept in the amazing condition it‚Äôs in
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"My friend, Johnna Anderson, who is a Jacksonville native, recommended the Larissa Inn to us. She wrote a book about an historical event in the area, my friends and I read her book, and she planned a weekend for us exploring all the historical sites relating to her book, Beyond Killough Creek. It was a fun time, and we all enjoyed our time there. The Larissa House was the perfect spot for us to unwind and debrief."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful house! Very comfortable for a group of 10. House is so much better in person. The pictures do not do it justice.
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"We were in town for a few days for a family event. Ôøº We really enjoyed our stay! The house was large enough for everyone, with plenty of room to spread out as well as large rooms to gather. The kitchen and bathrooms have all been updated and are beautiful.
