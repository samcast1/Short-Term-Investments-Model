I had a couple of questions before our stay and Bridget was very responsive and extremely accommodating. Thank you for such a lovely experience."
2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, immaculately clean place. Just wish the host would have shared with us prior to booking that there was an outdoor high school party planned on the grounds. We were informed of this after we Checked in and told to let them know if it was too loud, which we did, but there was no rest/sleep possible until after midnight. We wouldn’t have booked here if we had known about the outdoor party."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"AWESOME!! There are not a lot of places to stay around family in southeastern Kansas, especially with a kitchen so we can cook for my youngest with food allergies (eating out is nearly impossible unless we go to Oklahoma). This was a dream for all of us! We could cook, kids (and mom and dad) loved the coffee bar, kids loved the popcorn, we all loved the dogs, and the kids LOVED feeding the baby goats and looking for chicken eggs. The place was super clean, super nice, and you got A LOT for what we paid. We will definitely be staying here again when we visit family. Don’t pay for a hotel when you could stay here!!!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The barndo was immaculate and comfortable. Despite being directly behind the owner’s space, it felt private and was very quiet. My kids loved checking out the horse and goats, and they made besties with the kitten who stopped by to check us out. The coffee and cocoa bar was so well stocked, and there were plentiful snacks, breakfast options, filtered water, and cooking basics. My kids loved making popcorn in the air popper and using the popcorn bags. Both beds were comfy, and the living room had three recliners, an electric fireplace, and some cozy blankets that made for a nice place to unwind and watch a movie after our drive. My kids loved playing the games that were available and I appreciated that there was plenty of space for them to get some energy out by running around outside. I can’t think of much I might have needed that wasn’t there, but I will say that my absolute favorite part was that the entire space was decorated for Christmas!"

Incredible visit, all around. Thank you!!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Fabulous home, perfect for our family of 5. Kids loved the board games and popcorn bar. Adults appreciated the FULLY stoxked coffee bar, and cabinet of groceries/snacks. We will certainly be returning when we are in the area again when visiting family!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house was wonderful. Lots of room to visit, a spacious kitchen, comfortable beds, large patio, plenty of places to sit inside and an awesome kitchen and laundry room. Our family was in town for a reunion around the entombment of my parents cremains. It was stressful but we were able to wind down together (4 adults, 2 young people) at the end of each day. Because of the location we had gorgeous views of the night sky with little light pollution and town was within walking distance. I highly recommend booking this house if you are coming to the Cherryvale area. There are lots of things to do in the area: Fishing, hunting, historic places, and cultural events are all within walk and/or driving distance. Our family came from California, North Dakota, and Alaska and we are in consensus: this house was perfect for us in every way."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beyond Perfect! It may look like a simple Ranch Barn from the outside but inside you’ll find an exceptionally clean, comfortable “home away from home”. Cleverly decorated to reflect the Ranch/Barn theme with upgraded finishes. Spacious with a well stocked kitchen and comfortable beds/furniture. We were welcomed with so many “extras” including a well stocked coffee /popcorn bar & breakfast/snack items. The patio is covered, festively lit at night and set up to enjoy outdoor grilling/dining or just relaxing by the fire pit. It felt peaceful & private.
We’ve already booked again for our hunting trip in Nov/Dec."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Bridget was an amazing host! The place was stocked with essentials we had forgotten about when we stopped by the store. Very quick response time and beautiful place. It was already decorated for fall y'all! Beds were comfy, kitchen was well equipped and the coffee/cocoa bar was a favorite! Definitely going to be investing in a Keurig now."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Rented the Kusel House for a family wedding held at the Cedar Tree Barn (right around the corner) that rolled into the Thanksgiving 2023 holiday. I don't think this review captures the gratitude and appreciation our camp had for the Kusel House. Truly home away from home. G-Maps doesn't take you directly to the house using its street address. Called Kelly to find it. Each room clean, fully stocked, and equipped with strong broadcasting Wi-Fi throughout the house (huge plus). Clean, comfortable, and maintained outside deck and yards. Many people commented on the possible business connection the house has to the Cedar Tree Barn around the corner. Thoughtful decorative touches and living comforts brought back lots of family memories from our childhoods in Southeast Kansas. I thought the downstairs (mancave and bar) is where the real added value was. A gracious and thoughtful host, Kelly was quick to offer, respond, and act on our needs. Highly recommend the Kusel House."

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You won't want to miss staying in the Eagle's Nest Cottage - and meeting the gracious hosts. The cottage was perfect for us - comfy bed, the location allowed was perfect for our travel plans in the surrounding areas.... with a vaulted ceiling, a well-panned open area and a large bathroom, it felt very spacious and cozy at the same time... and perfect for the 2 of us... the country setting was a breath of fresh air (literally) - loved the tulips in bloom and the birds on the feeder and serenading us in the trees...
Add to all that the comfy bed and everything we needed to make our stay... yes, perfect!
So glad we found this place! Since we have family in the area, I know we'll be going back if it's available!"

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was just what I needed - several days away to rest and relax after an exhausting couple of months!! The place was light and airy, very clean, well kept, spacious, private and peaceful. My husband and I were able to relax comfortably - watched football, did jigsaw puzzles, slept, read. We really enjoyed sitting outside to read and appreciate the beautiful flowering shrubs in the garden. During our stay we also visited some historic sites and local restaurants in Bartlesville (only a 25 minute drive), and went for walks around beautiful Copan Lake. Anita was very welcoming, friendly and willing to help any way she could. Thank you Anita, for providing such a nice get-away place!!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great tiny house, very clean, just what we needed!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing, peaceful & beautiful spot to BE!! I came to BE. I came to enjoy my first ""Personal Prayer Retreat!""This place was it! Anita and her husband, Pete, were the perfect hostess and host. They were responsive to whatever I needed, but I was also left to my own introspection. All the bases are covered! It's spotlessly clean, airy, light. One of the reasons I chose The Eagle's Nest is the coastal decor. Being a ""lake person,"" I wanted the coastal feeling, and the cottage delivered!
This is a perfect spot for an individual or a couple. Bear in mind that I was drinking juices while here, so I didn't need a big kitchen. If you are looking to ""cook up a storm,"" you'll want to save that for another location. However, having said that, the amenities are perfect for fixing food. Just make sure you note what they are.
I was so very satisfied with my stay that I plan to return again. I think the little birdies will still be flitting about the beautiful garden and coming in for landings on the bird feeder. What a joy to watch them through the great window facing the garden.
There's a lot of love that has gone into the creation of this oasis and I'm glad I was able to sit in the midst of it and return home refreshed.
Don't hesitate to book a stay. You will not be sorry. Don't wait for lots of reviews. This is a hidden gem that will soon have a long waiting list of guests! Get in while you can!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, as always! I love staying at this tiny home. It’s quiet and cozy, tucked away at the edge of town. Everything was clean and easy to find. I will always choose to stay here when possible."

Our dog Humphrey was able to run around and do zoomies while we fished and sat on the porch. The home was well designed and everything we could possibly need. Kimberly could have also been the best host ever! I most certainly recommend this trip for everyone who want to get away and we will be looking to make the trip again in the future.

2017-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super- cute, super-clean and super easy to find! We stayed here over a quick weekend to get away from the city- and it was perfect. We cooked several meals, but went out for a nice dinner (less than 10 minutes from the house). Many amenities close- but we only went out once. Beautiful setting (we fished - and caught) and had several nice walks. Recommended for couples needing a bit of down-time. Our dog 'Bubba' sure enjoyed having run of the place as well!

We pulled through the coded gate and parked under the carport. When we opened the back door and flipped on the lights, I thought, did we die on the road over here and this is heaven?! Oh my! The game room was the first thing we saw with the pool table, shuffle board, juke box, the coin shuffle game! Then we walked through the whole house snapping pics sending it to our friends and family! The last time I was in someone’s house snapping pics was GRACE MANSION! When Our family arrived to celebrate Christmas they were floored too! It could easily accommodate several families. This was our first Airb&b and it won’t be the last!
Thanks Mrs Debra !

2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"we stayed while working in town, house worked perfect for our team. crystal and crew were very responsive and helpful. property is beautiful."
2024-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Awesome place. Crystal was very responsive.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Crystal was very accommodating. We had to extend the stay a few times and she was quick to respond and was able to make the change. It was a very pleasant experience dealing with Crystal.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It is always such a pleasure to stay at Crystal’s place. We love it so much we’re repeat customers and will likely be staying here again in the future. Love how close it is to Independence but we always visit family in Cherryvale.
The lodge is more than what you expect. Each room has its own bathroom so it’s easy to stay with everybody without feeling like you’re in each other’s space. So much room to spread out. We love that the kids can be in one living room having a blast while the adults play cards and watch something else in the other living room. We love the mud room since we like to adventure on the property. It makes it so nice to leave all the filth where it doesn’t spread through the house. The porch spaces are both great and equally used to maximize the comfortability of the frequently changing weather and to accommodate the separation of groups during visiting."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Second time we've stayed at the lodge. Great place for a group and very comfortable. Looking forward to another stay!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The home was exactly what my family needed. My kids could run and play outside, and we had plenty of space to spread out inside."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful. Spacious surroundings inside and out! Just what we needed. Extremely private. Kiddos had a blast running wild in nature while we watched from the expansive back porch! Crystal was wonderful and we will be back in the near future!
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Great space with lots of room for the family but there were some concerns. Things differed a bit from pictures (no bunk bed and missing couch). Grass was overgrown when we got there and we had to ask if it could be cut. Owner was very responsive and it was cut that day. Some of the things in the kitchen were dirty. Coffee grounds and old coffee left in coffee maker. Instant pot lid was dirty and had mold on the seal. The grill was very dirty and there was no wire brush for cleaning it. Also found a dead mouse in a mouse trap behind the microwave that had apparently been there for some time. Only four coffee mugs available. No ice. There was a nice island that has been added to the kitchen that made serving meals helpful. But we hadn't realized there is no dishwasher there until we got there. Wasps were a bit of a problem in the back. Overall we enjoyed our time there and because the owner was responsive I would stay there again, but feel it was quite overpriced for what we experienced."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Tons of room. Great amenities. Good location to Indy.
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had such a great stay! The space was perfect for accommodating our large group, and everyone commented that it was even better than expected.

Two refrigerators were an unexpected bonus!! Clean, comfortable, close to our event, and well-priced….what more could we ask for? Owners were responsive and helpful by email and phone call. Hope to return!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"such an amazing place! booked this house for a group of guys working out of town and they couldn't stop talking about it. they raved about how simple and cozy and beautiful the place was.

2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"We thoroughly enjoyed our peaceful stay in this large home with 5 bedrooms and 5 1/2 bathrooms.
We enjoyed the extensive patios that surround the house and offer comfortable seating for outdoor enjoyment.
Wildlife was viewed from the property that offers LOTS of
room for outdoor activities.
We appreciated having two refrigerators and two living spaces."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Golden Timber Lodge was so relaxing. We were in Parsons for a family reunion weekend. The drive from Cherryvale to Parsons was easy. (We saw a deer with 3 fawns in the back yard the first evening and several other deer during our weekend!) We loved sitting on the back covered porch in the shade and visiting with relatives. The layout of the house is wonderful for staying with family/friends, with 2 living areas and an open kitchen. We enjoyed having our own private bathroom with each bedroom. We invited other family members over for games and fellowship and they all agree we should use the Golden Timber Lodge for our next family reunion!"

This is exactly what I wanted and expected, I also understand what comes with that. Crickets get noisy at night, might be various bugs around, including ticks. Not a big deal to me. Unit caters to hunting parties, 5 rooms of double beds, each with its own bathroom, two living rooms. Kitchen could use a dishwasher. Would definitely go back."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,I can’t thank you guys enough for our amazing stay. It was everything we needed. It was so nice having a place we could gather as there so many of us from out of town for our sons wedding. Your place was perfect and a blessing. Thank you!!! I would recommend to anyone
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Excellent and unique design.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The location felt secluded but was very convenient to where we needed to go. Watch fireflies with our grand kids. Was a great experience.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"House is large, clean and has quite surroundings. Excellent place for large group."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Love it!
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Wonderful place to stay!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were there from out of state for our great-nieces graduation. The house is fabulous, very accommodating. It was clean and we loved that each bedroom has it's own bathroom. We spent the mornings sitting on the back porch with our coffee and the evenings hanging out on the back porch with family, cooking out and playing games. The perfect location and so peaceful. Worth every penny."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A beautiful and peaceful place that made the perfect gathering place for our family. The layout and decor of the lodge was perfect. The host was accommodating and it was very easy to communicate with her. Highly recommend to others! Thanks for a memorable visit!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Crystal was very quick to repsond and very personable. Would definitely use this place again. Plenty of cookware and dishes for a large get together. Bathrooms for every bedroom was a great benefit.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We’re in town for a funeral. Had plenty of room/bathrooms for multiple adults (6) to get ready. Also there was room for 3 toddlers to run a bit. There were towels (we weren’t sure from the site) but needed to bring shampoo and soap for shower.
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"A great place to stay. Plenty of space, very clean. Will certainly book again if ever need a place in the future."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Easy to find, secluded, beautiful property"

2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our group loved this place. It’s spacious & secluded. Almost every room has its own shower, restroom and exterior door. Host worked with us on check in. 10/10."
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Oh my goodness, the stay, the building, and Crystal were all absolutely amazing. When you first pull up it seems a little smaller then you’d expect but when you go in you almost have too much room to do things! The stay was amazing and Crystal was quick to message me back with concerns I had. Overall it was a weekend to remember!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great property, great value, clean, comfortable, in a location that is close to town, yet out of town in order to enjoy the country."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This lodge had so much space, both inside and out. A great place for a large reunion or getaway. We wish our stay there had been longer!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Fantastic place! Best communication. Check in/out was hassle free. Crystal is very accommodating. The pictures don’t do this property justice. It is 5 bedrooms. 1 of the bedrooms is separated from the other 4 which made it very nice. Our ages ran from 3-83. So the “old” folks had a quiet separate area. Everything was clean. There is a map of the property which made navigation for the kids so easy. I can’t think of a single negative thing to say about our stay! I’ve stayed in Airbnb’s for 7 years and this is by far the best overall experience I’ve had. We will gladly stay here every year
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Would definitely seat again. Kim was a pleasure and was very responsive and helpful!

2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place for single person or couple to stay. Very peaceful and quiet. This is a tiny house and the bedroom is upstairs. Eggs and bagels in the fridge along with water are a nice touch. I didn't drink the hot coco, just because it was over 100 degrees during the day and still 80 in the early am hours, but mint chocolate hot coco sounds delicious. hoping I can find some here at home."

It’s a sweet little cottage; highly recommend if you’re looking for a place in this area or just to be some place quiet."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay! This place was beyond fun. Great cleanliness. To give such a feeling of privacy yet be literally 5 minutes from anything a person needed in town was a very nice aspect. The extras provided by the host (coffee, eggs, butter, etc) were a handy touch that was greatly appreciated. We would highly recommend to anyone and are looking for an excuse ourselves to be back in the area."

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great tiny home experience. We did it mostly to check out the possibility of getting a tiny home. Really efficient use of space while still feeling like a home. Very comfortable. Close to town, quiet and good walking neighborhood. We would return for sure."

2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cute, quite, quaint & peaceful stay! Enjoyed fishing in the pond, seeing the Armadillo sneaking into the woods, the Mississippi Kite & the Barred Owl, all right out the back door! Kimberly was such a wonderful host, leaving snacks, water & some potatoes & onions! Place was spotless (a big plus with me) & had all the essentials you would need! Will highly recommend this cottage to anyone & will book anytime we are in that area! Close enough to town (5-10 minute drive) but out far enough to enjoy the peace & quite. Thank you so much for the very enjoyable stay & experience!"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very beautiful living space with a beautiful view! Loved it!
2016-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The minute we saw the cottage, our entire family knew that we were going to love our stay. The house was beautiful and the location was perfect for our family! Loved the woodwork inside the house. It also felt spacious with its high ceilings and numerous windows. The décor was lovely. Kimberly was an excellent host! When we asked about her furbaby, she stopped by so that we could meet her and ZuZu! ZuZu played wonderfully with the boys. Kimberly was very considerate and made sure we had everything we needed for our stay. The pond behind the house was great for fishing. Area around the house was also great for kite flying, and hiking. We loved our stay and have already been talking about our next trip back. EXCELLENT place and would highly recommend it to anyone."
2016-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Kimberly and her husband Lon were wonderful hosts. Their Cottage was just what we expected and more. We loved the quietness of the area and simplicity of the week we had staying there. They supplied everything we needed and more. We have always stayed at hotels but our daughter happened upon this little cottage and we are now hooked. very quiet, peaceful and wonderful experience. we will definatly contact Kimberly and Lon again when we are in town. Thank you again for such a wonderful stay and experience. Shawn and Betty Anne"
2016-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Absolutely the best. The house is so cute and perfect. Right on a pond. My dog loved it. The hosts were the most generous and sweet people. Nothing could have been better. My sister wants to go stay and my mom wants to go stay there and they live in town!

I would definitely recommend to others.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great, clean, quaint location in the center of Independence, Kansas."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I gave the stay 4 stars ONLY because the front bedroom needs some type of drapes. My husband and I slept in that room and were blinded by the streetlight that shines through those white blinds at night. It was almost impossible to sleep because it was so bright. The place itself was clean, cutely decorated, smelled great, had a nice kitchen and washer dryer. The bed itself was super comfy. The house is at the end of a cute cul d sac. Great place for great $."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super cute!! As someone that does best with pen and paper, it was nice to have printed out instructions once we got there. The one minor complaint we had was there being no WiFi so I couldn’t do any work like I had planned."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a unique place in the country with beautiful bathroom fixtures and comfortable beds. The living room furniture was also very comfortable. We had some trouble with the plumbing but Jeannette was very fair and quick to try and get it fixed. There is no basement or storm shelter which can be a little unnerving when you’re surrounded by fields during a bad storm.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved staying at this farmhouse! The patio was so nice in the breeze. Comfy beds and furniture. Lots of room to spread out, but great places to come together!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This place is the perfect cabin to host a group of hunters/outdoorsmen. The secluded cabin is not far from the good fishing, hunting, and other outdoor opportunities just to north of the place. If you are in the area you have to check this place out, you won't regret it. I cannot say enough good things about this place. The hosts checked in often to make sure everything was perfect for us. They were very nice, helpful, and responsive! All in all, it was a wonderful experience!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A charming older home located in a quiet neighborhood that reminded me of my childhood home. Very clean with all the amenities. David’s home met all our needs during our stay to visit family. While we were only there to sleep and get ready for the day each morning, we found it to be very cozy and a convenient location. Bed was very comfortable! During our stay we only had one question and David was very responsive. He also offered us early check in and late checkout. Thank you David for making our first visit to Coffeyville a pleasant one :-) Should we come again we would love to stay at your place."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"David was the perfect host. Always on top of the property to make sure everything was in working order. Our son was an intern at Cessna and for future interns, I have to say if you are able to secure this property you will be the envy of all the other interns. The home was outstanding and there was far more to offer than David shares in his post. The screened porch and all the activities available to the renters were exceptional. If you are looking for a safe and peaceful location David has the spot for you. Thanks for a great stay David and making the internship stay a fantastic experience for our son and his intern roommate. Paul and Georgia"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time I've stayed in the Coffeyville Cape Cod and when I come into town to visit family, I'll never stay anywhere else again. It's decorated with vintage minimalist treasures, straight out of a digest - almost as if walking straight into a Mad Men set, and it's flawlessly cleaned and stocked every time. The beds are as comfortable as my bed at home, and we were greeted by a Christmas tree and vintage Christmas decor this holiday. What a treat. Thank you, David!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute house with lots of included amenities. Stayed with our toddler, appreciated the family friendly touches. Owners have done a lot of work to restore its original charm. Host was very easy to get a hold of, but we did not need to during our stay. Close to several local businesses and restaurants, walking distance to the hospital. Would highly recommend and we will be repeat visitors!"
,,,Was unable to stay in due to mold smell. Was only given half of our money back.
