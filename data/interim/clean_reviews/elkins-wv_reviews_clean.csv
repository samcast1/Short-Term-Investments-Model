Very nice house and yard. House was spotless. We had a lot of fun.
Thanks Angela"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Can’t say enough positive things about this house and the host. Clean, comfortable, great location, nicely equipped. It is a wonderful place to stay in Elkins. Clearly a lot of thought and preparation have gone into this property. Would give it more than 5-stars if that was an option. Will certainly stay there again."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Angela’s place was great. It was well equipped with new furnishings and tasteful decor. The kitchen had everything we needed and more. Angela was very helpful and timely in her communication. We would definitely stay again and recommend to others.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a gift it was to be the first to rent your lovely home! You were all so responsive to the things that are only realized when you are living a place for several days. Everything was beautifully furnished and comfortable. I'd suggest having a shovel nearby in the winter. The one I had in my car came in handy with the beautiful 8 inches of snow we got that weekend! I look forward to returning soon!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The cabin was super cozy and relaxing. The host was also super responsive.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very peaceful and quiet. We had all the information we needed to check in easily and quickly. Very relaxing weekend.
2024-05-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Loved the cabin, very cozy. Appreciate it being pet friendly. They even had dog bowls setting out for us. I wished the weather would have cooperated so we could have explored the area more."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great cabin near all amazing hiking spots and very peaceful!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great weekend staying at this cabin and loved all that the area had to offer! The host's guidebook was very helpful and pointed us in the right directions.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonderful weekend!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a peaceful little spot in a beautiful area. The house was the perfect amount of space for our group of 2 couples. The cabin feels remote but is still close enough to get to shopping and restaurants. Ashley left a wonderful guide full of suggestions. I will say if you are going with others, 'adult' private time isn't an option. There is no door to the upstairs loft, and you can hear every peep through the ceiling/floor anyway. Still had a great time playing board games, fishing, and relaxing in the hot tub."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here with a friend to visit some family in the area. Cabin is beautiful, area is safe, and the views are beyond description. Trout is plentiful if you’re looking to fish! Ashley responded quickly, even kindly answering my dumber questions. We loved sitting in the hot tub under the glowing lights after a long hike. We made dinner in the cabin and loved playing the board games Ashley provided. It was a little rainy when we came through, otherwise we would’ve made a fire with the wood Ashley left us. We had a fantastic weekend and plan to come back here!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this stay! Upon entering the place smelled amazing and felt perfectly cozy. Very clean, amenities were great and the hot tub was amazing. Not sure I would say private as it’s on the front porch and there seemed to be some neighbors out, but overall still a peaceful neighborhood. Ashley even had people over in the morning to shovel the front porch and sidewalk during our stay! We would definitely revisit this place. :)"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved this little cabin!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,All in all great stay. We were a party of 4 over the age 60. The spiral staircase was definitely an issue. We had difficulty navigating it but the overall cabin was great. Super clean and smelled wonderful. Overall 5 stars.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay at!!
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nice homey cabin. Very clean. Well supplied with linens and towels.
The spiral staircase was very pretty but not made for adults. I had to turn sideways to get to the loft bedroom.
Only real complaint was that both beds had super soft middles. So you constantly were sliding against your sleeping partner."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a peaceful Christmas away from home. The location was beautiful and quiet. Ashley was very responsive and helpful during our stay!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful place secluded by other cabins and an rv park area. The place was extremely clean and smelled amazing as well! Had a great time!

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The host Ashley was very helpful with any questions I had and always got back to me with a response right away! Easy directions that took you right to the cabin and it was very clean and nice inside and out! Great location far enough away from Elkins to be quite but not to far to want to go into town to grab a bite to eat. Highly recommend this cabin!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Definitely would recommend this place. There is a lot to do outdoors in the area. The host was quick to respond to questions and cabin was very cozy. You could definitely tell a lot of thought and work went into this rental.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"me and my boyfriend went for a quick getaway and we loved it! it was rainy since we got there so we stayed inside watching movies, very cozy. the place was really nice and clean with a very quiet neighborhood."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a definite hidden gem. I plan on making return trips here. We have the most amazing stay in this little cabin. The surroundings are so peaceful and just breathtaking. Ashley, is an amazing host and so receptive and quick to answer messages. If you are looking for some peace and quiet, this is your place. Most of the tourist stuff was closed when we were here so im not going to be very helpful with local stuff to do. We had plenty of stuff to see and enjoy though. I would highly recommend this place to anyone!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Ashley was amazing! She took care of us right away and was very accommodating to our needs! The cabin and community was beautiful. Nothing could beat enjoying the hot tub at night while listening to the river! We will be back to visit again!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for the stay!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for a weekend get away. It looks exactly like the pictures, it’s quiet and a peaceful area. It put us in the perfect location for all of the hiking destinations we had on our list, such as Seneca rocks and blackwater falls. It was easy to find the cabin and was stocked with everything we needed. We will be back! It was perfect."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Exceeded expectations!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at creekside cabin. The place was very clean and well decorated. It was nice having a washer and dryer and clean linens so we could pack less. Nice location, only about 15 minutes to gas stations, grocery stores and restaurants. Loved the hot tub and outdoor fire pit. One thing I will say is that this place is not very childproof. There are small things for children to get into, my son accidentally broke a coaster set but Ashley was very understanding. One door doesn’t lock from the inside so we had to place a table in front of it so our two year old did not get out while we slept. The internet was very slow which sucked, coming here was out of state for us and our phones didn’t work at all. Also the tvs couldn’t load so we could only watch tv on the main tv. Overall we loved our stay and would recommend it. Would love to come back again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent stay! Located in the peaceful valley along the Shavers Fork. Beautiful, well decorated, fully supplied, and comfortable. This was perfect for our much needed relaxing escape. It was like home away from home. We could have (and should have) stayed longer!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our 3 night stay in the cabin! The location was perfect and the amenities were great. We felt like we were right at home and would highly recommend!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"overall cabin was a beautiful stay. everything was clean and the amenities were wonderful. it was a little hard to locate and is not as private as it seems to be on the listing. it is smack dab in the middle of a giant campground, but everyone was super friendly and Ashley was very responsive. would definitely stay again"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"very nice and clean
centrally located to popular attractions."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Na
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Close to two of my favorite hikes, Seneca Rocks and Chimney Top. Jacuzzi was great after a day of hiking. Kroger nearby for groceries is convenient. Had an overall great, relaxing stay at the cabin, would visit again!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Loved the cabin! Was perfect for what my family needed to explore WV and have a safe, clean place to stay at for the weekend."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,great little retreat. I recommend for everyone. thank you Ashley we had a good time !
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This cabin is beautiful! I have no complaints whatsoever. This was my first time using an Airbnb and I couldn’t have been more pleased. Ashley is quick to respond and very helpful for anything I needed. She is professional and also kind. She has all the pamphlets of all the fun activities you can do in the surrounding area right on the table when you walk in and a binder with clear instructions for your stay. 10/10 recommend!
Not a complaint, but the stairs up to the loft are a little scary having toddlers and hard to keep them off of them. We put one of our bags in front of the staircase to prevent my 1 and 2 year old from climbing them. It at least slowed them down. Haha"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved the area. The mountain views are beautiful and it was so nice and peaceful. We liked that the river was so close and it's an easy walk to. The porch and hot tub were so relaxing in the evenings. And we thought the cabin was very clean and just the right space for our family. We loved our stay!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed for the weekend to celebrate our anniversary and we wasn’t disappointed. We pulled up and there was a ground hog and ducks hanging out in the yard, so nice and peaceful. Very clean place, ashley was quick to respond to my question. Would stay again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was really nice and we had a good time. The only thing I could suggest is to disclose more detail about the stairs going to the loft . As a 60 year old who is in good shape I had no problem using the staircase, I could see it being a problem for a bigger person getting up there. Other then that the place is great!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Ashley was an excellent host that went above and beyond. The property was beautiful and relaxing. We loved how clean everything felt and quiet the area was. We even accidentally left some articles of clothing and Ashley promptly contacted us and even offered to send them back to us, amazing hospitality. We would stay hear again in a heartbeat."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful get away. Will look forward to visiting again
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Ashley is a wonderful host, very friendly and gave us a wonderful recommendation for a place to have breakfast. The cabin is super clean. Seems like it was recently renovated and it has everything you could ask for in an Airbnb.
I have three issues - two of them are small.
At night, we couldn't find street addresses ; ended up guessing. (Guessed wrong the first time!)
The impression you get from the lead photo is that you are off in the woods. Not so. There are old buildings around it, many camping trailers, and railroad tracks right behind the house. Not sure if they are active; we did not hear a train.
The third issue is the circular staircase to the upper bed. I wouldn't let kids use it. Neither my wife or I could without banging our heads or squeezing and awkwardly twisting our bodies. There is something odd about the way it's built right next to the beam.
Great cabin for two people (maybe one more on the couch) and a dog, but not more than that."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the Cabin and the location! Ashley was beyond amazing, answered all our questions quickly and sent us information about things happening around us."
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely a nice place to stay! You are close to neighbors and campsites but it was still very quiet for us. Clean and cozy ,it was a perfect weekend getaway for 2 people. Ashley was very responsive and helpful"
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"the host is lovely, great response time. i didn’t expect the location to be close to train tracks and a trailer park area but it was surprisingly very quit. we got snowed in one day and had to book for another night, the host worked it out for us very smoothly. they also helped us out with getting food/any supplies we needed while we were snowed in. make sure to bring fwd if you are coming in the winter!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very relaxing weekend at this cabin. We used the hot tub and grill. The cabin was clean, comfortable and well appointed. Host communicated well to try to avoid difficulty in finding the cabin and proactively messaged regarding possible difficulties with the snow. Overall great experience."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Perfect spot for a last minute stay when we needed it and were passing through the area with our dog. Could not have asked for a cleaner cabin. Love this area having traveled the area roads yearly on a regular summer motorcycle trip. Beautiful area and plenty of outdoor stuff to see and do. Would definitely stay again. Oh and the bed was SUPER COMFY TOO!!!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Loved this place! We had such a great weekend. Beautiful area, the campground was adorable. Highly recommend for a little weekend getaway."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is gorgeous! It’s rustic and comfortable - and SPOTLESS. The cleanest place we’ve ever stayed. My boyfriend was blown away - he called it perfect (and he’s hard to please!). Ashley was so sweet and easy to communicate with. Virtually immediate responses. I can’t say enough great things about this place. We walked in and felt completely COMFORTABLE. We are already talking about when we can plan to come back.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ashley was a great and responsive host. She thoroughly answered all of my questions and concerns in a timely manner, which made the stay more comfortable."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My wife, two friends and I used Ashley's place as our home base for a weekend snowboarding trip. The cabin was exactly as described and worked perfectly for us. The place was warm, clean and comfortable with all the basic amenities - and as a bonus the hot tub worked, which proved to be a great way to unwind after a day on the slopes. would definitely stay here again!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for everything. Your place is awesome. We would love to come back.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute and comfortable cabin in a beautiful location. Highly recommend!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here during the winter storm Elliot and over Christmas. Any issues we had because of the storm they came out to take care of day of. They were very friendly, handy, and kind. We would absolutely stay here again. All issues we encountered were only because of the storm, not because of the cabin itself."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice spot, hot tub is clutch and place was super clean. Thanks !"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ashley's cabin is a perfect place for a weekend getaway to WV! We loved the bear and deer decor! The cabin is very cool and perfectly spacious for 2 people. She provided everything we needed for our weekend stay. Her cabin is a close 12 minute drive into the town of Elkins. The check-in and check-out process was very easy and Ashley responded quickly to any questions I had regarding our stay. The hot tub is such a nice addition!

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cozy cabin in a great location!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time at Creekside. The main living area of the cabin was spacious and comfortable. The kitchen was very well stocked. The entire place was very clean.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a cute, clean, cozy cabin. The staircase up to loft is extremely narrow/tight, so we were lucky the friend who had been planning to stay with us backed out - we were in town for a Strongman competition and there’s a good chance he would have gotten stuck going upstairs! It was really miserably rainy due to Hurricane Ian, so we actually left a full day early since weather was much better at home."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great Place to stay at, lots of scenery. Would recommend to anyone taking a weekend trip in the woods!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As several other reviewers mentioned, this isn’t a secluded cabin. However it is very quiet. You can hear the river from the porch, the ducks quacking in the creek and occasionally kids playing. We enjoyed our stay immensely. The hot tub was a great bonus. We would recommend this cabin to anyone planning to stay in the area."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"He is very friendly. I asked many questions while stayed, and he answered very kindly all the times. I definitely recommend this place. Hot tubs water is also very clean. It was great experience for us. But internet wifi isn’t working well when it’s raining outside."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful, mountainous get away! The cabin is quaint and cozy. It is located in the perfect spot. Ashley was a great host! I’d recommend staying here, it’s a great experience."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Stayed for a few days as we dropped our daughter off at Davis and Elkins College. A great location. Close enough to town for conveniences yet far enough away to enjoy walks and take in the beautiful nature.
Everything was very clean! Had all the basic amenities. Outside chairs and tables allowed for relaxing nights on the deck. Very generous with extra pillows and blankets. Ashley was great and easily reached and responsive. A wonderful place to stay. We will be back!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This cabin was very clean. Located in a camp ground which was cool. Wish the river wasn’t so rough because we wanted to go tubing. Quit place. Relaxing. Enjoyed very much. Ashley responded quickly when mentioned.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ashley’s place was amazing. The people at the campground were respectful. The lady at the little store was very knowledgeable and helped me and my brothers get everything we needed to go fishing. The hot tub is such a additional bonus. I would definitely recommend.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"House was very clean. There were plenty of bath towels and wash clothes, extra garbage bags, toilet paper, bounty towels etc. It was a cozy home and we enjoyed our stay. We loved the hot tub in the mornings when there was fog on the mountains."

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great little cabin for a weekend getaway!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was an excellent cabin!! Really well cared for and the host were responsive and timely even in a snow storm. The cabin is right next to a river for fishing and also an excellent central location for many great hikes and excursions in the area!!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great, very clean and updated. Located a stones throw away from the river, inside of a quiet campground. Wasn’t a deal breaker but the one negative for me was the pictures in the listing made me feel that it would be very private but there are two cabins located directly to the left and right. Definitely will stay here again, Thanks Ashley."
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Great little cabin. Very compact and was just enough for our family of three. We had a lovely stay.
The property is a little less secluded than I thought from the pictures (it’s across the road from an RV park). But in the winter it was quiet and still felt very private. Host was very helpful and communicative. They came to plow, shovel and salt when we got some snow."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A great, cozy little cabin! Kitchen was well stocked with all we needed to be able to cook/eat. The hot tub was perfect after playing in the snow all day!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the best cabin I’ve ever stayed at (and I’ve stayed at quite a few). Perfect for a weekend getaway. Ashley was one of the best hosts I’ve experienced with Airbnb. The cabin was flawless- clean, comfortable, great location. I would stay again in a heartbeat!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay! The cabin was so cute and had everything we needed for a comfortable and fun getaway! Would recommend to any skiers that want a private place to return after a day on the slopes.

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Quiet place to relax. Very clean. Great value.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin really is cute and cozy. While the interior was warm and inviting, our favorite part was hanging out in the hot tub under a thousand stars. The hosts were very responsive and kind as well."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This cabin was perfect for our girls trip! Try to arrive during the day in case you don’t have service and make sure to salt the stairs in the winter 😊

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is very clean and has everything. Linens, coffee pot, propane for the grill, kitchen ware. It's beautiful there and we loved it. I'm certain we will be staying again."

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are thinking of booking a room here - you should do it immediately! I could write a book about how wonderful our short stay was. The house is welcoming and filled with a wonderful historic and artistic energy. The space is clean, cared for, and guests' comfort has been prioritised with every detail thought of ahead of time.
To say our hosts, Alice and Joe, went above and beyond doesn't quite describe it. We enjoyed talking with them over farm fresh eggs and coffee, and enjoying some wine on the vast deck sheltered from the rain. We definitely have new friends in Elkins now.
You are centrally located to all the restaurants and attractions of Elkins all walkable, we recommend the train ride."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a great stay, and the host Alice is very accommodating."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had a fantastic stay with Alice, her and her husband were friendly and very hospitable and their home was beautiful. would stay with them again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Alice and Joe were wonderful hosts! They were incredibly friendly and made my stay very comfortable. I was the only guest, but the shared spaces were very clean and it wouldn't be an issue sharing them with other guests. The location is very convenient. I would definitely recommend staying in their beautiful old home if you're visiting Elkins!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,2nd time staying. This time Alice went above & beyond as I was working night shift at the hospital & needed to sleep during the day. She made check in/check out flexible & was quiet & respectful knowing I was sleeping during the day.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great communication, easy to find, easy check in"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Always a pleasure to see Alice and Joe! I’ve lost track of how many times I’ve been a guest at their lovely home, and I’ll be be back again ☺️"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Alice-Gervais was an excellent and very welcoming host. In the midst of Elkin's annual Forest Festival, she provided a convenient downtown location and even provided extra services to give us parking in the busy downtown setting. And when I returned after a busy day, I'd find myself welcomed to join the community on the front porch which included the Airbnb guests and other neighbors. It all made for a great visit to Elkins."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Alice-Gervias and Joe are incredible hosts!! Their home is beautiful and worth the stay just for a tour of the dwelling.
It is in walking distance to Elkin's downtown and all it has to offer. There is also a fantastic Venezuelan restaurant just a few doors down.
I would highly recommend staying here. One of the top Airbnb's I've stayed at."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It's always a pleasure to stay with Alice. This house is in a perfect location that's walkable to everywhere downtown and onto campus. The home is full of creative and welcoming energy as well as good conversation. Highly recommend.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This charming place was a great find! I felt at home the minute I arrived. Alice and Joe are wonderful hosts and know how to make guests feel welcome. Everything was very clean and comfortable, including the bed and shared kitchen. An exceptionally large, airy, and shaded front porch offers a great space to hang out, have coffee (provided by hosts), and talk or read. (There is also a lovely shaded garden in the backyard.) The historic house is architecturally grand with wonderful character and details, including artwork, and is conveniently located downtown (walking distance to Davis & Elkins college). At the price, it was also a great value. Hope to come back sometime!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful, wonderful wonderful on every level! Love their home and love them! Highly recommended ✨"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I stayed with Alice Gervais for seven nights while at a meeting in Elkins, and I would stay again without question. My colleagues staying in (and paying more for) hotels were jealous! Alice and her husband treated me like part of their family, but were respectful and left me alone when I wanted. Her home is so full of character and artwork! My room was large and comfortable, and I had the use of the whole house, including the kitchen and half of the refrigerator. They told me the bathroom was shared, but I never encountered anyone else using it, all week long. I used a work area in the room and downstairs in the dining area, but the nicest work area was out on the huge, airy, front porch. The WiFi was speedy, and Alice is a coffee aficionado -- a bonus for sure! Davis and Elkins College and downtown (restaurants, stores, etc.) are both within easy walking distance, although the street is leafy and quiet. Alice Gervais gets five stars from me!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a wonderful stay with Alice and Joe. I grew up in the area and was visiting with family. They provided a much needed quiet and friendly space. Beautiful home and location is perfect for downtown Elkins amenities.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Alice was very knowledgeable of the area. I was in the area for a rescue class and didn't have much free time and was on a tight schedule, so Alice made sure I had food and coffee. The place was gorgeous and artsy and so clean. It just seemed to be the perfect place for me, and it certainly helped knowing her and I had so much in common. I definitely look forward in going back when in the area again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I spent five nights at Alice’s lovely old Victorian house. The house itself has great character and charm and has many interesting artistic touches, as well as antique furniture and other features that I particularly enjoyed looking at. My room was nicely decorated and had a comfy queen sized bed with soft ironed sheets. Cleanliness is an obvious high priority for Alice, as everything was spotless. Alice was very friendly and helpful and we had nice chats together. I slept very well there and was delighted at how quiet the neighborhood was for being in a town. I look forward to staying at Alice’s again the next time I come to Elkins!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joe and Alice were the perfect hosts! Their home is comfortable, clean, full of character and their kitchen was fantastic. Whenever I’m Elkins you can be sure I will stay here."

Wonderful location in downtown Elkins and an easy walk to many restaurants and bars. Alice-Gervais is a pleasure to talk to and a wonderful host. Hope to stay again on my next trip to Elkins! Highly recommend."

Hosts responded quickly to an issue. Obviously unexpected. Hence the 4 star, but shouldn’t be held against the hosts nor the accommodations."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I highly recommend this wonderful historic home in the heart of Elkins! From the expansive front porch, to the beautiful interior, and chefs kitchen, this was a great place to stay. It's within walking distance of great restaurants, parks, historical sites, and plenty of fun shops downtown and in the restored railroad district. Just two doors away is an awesome Venezuelan restaurant which also hosts live music several times a week. Our host Alice-Gervais and her husband Joe made us feel welcome and comfortable and I really enjoyed their knowledge of the local history, culture of Elkins."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was lovely, rooms were clean and Alice is a wonderful host. highly recommend booking if you'll be in the Elkins area!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I stayed in Alice-Gervais and Joe's home with my partner and two friends and couldn't recommend it more highly. The home is beautiful and artistic—one of the most atmospheric places I've stayed in. Alice and Joe are really generous and accommodating hosts, who made us feel totally at home even though we booked last minute and arrived somewhat late. They are genuinely kind and hospitable people, who went out of their way to make us feel welcome and comfortable even though we made up a somewhat motley crowd! They let us to cook dinner in their kitchen, and use their charmed outdoor spaces; they had also done the bedrooms up really beautifully, and everything was clean and perfect. I would really recommend this Airbnb, and hope to come back myself some day."

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Alice was a phenomenal host, very social and accommodating. The room was comfortable, house had a lot of character and was decorated with several of her original artworks. Alice offered basics for breakfast and also included me in her family dinners, going well beyond the hospitality I had expected. I would be happy to visit this location again."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Alice's house is gorgeous and an easy walk to Elkins's main street. The house is decorated with an eclectic yet consistent aesthetic that really does reflect its history, and the room was clean and cozy, and stayed warm even when it was well below freezing outside.
Alice is incredibly friendly and communicative, and was able to work with me to arrange a stay on very short notice.
Highly recommend."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was an absolutely wonderful experience! Alice was a lovely host. She is very welcoming and thoughtful and made me and my dog feel so welcome for our stay. It was a lovely stay and I can’t recommend it highly enough.

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a great stay and great host! They should definitely ask more money for this place, it’s so worth it! It’s a beautiful and artistic house with a lot of history and the couple gave good recommendations for restaurants and hiking areas :). We felt very comfortable and would definitely stay longer if it would have been possible. We got a warm welcome with even delicious (birthday)cake! Besides, Elkins is a good starting point for hikes and sightseeing in the area.
I stayed with my husband and brother (27-30 years old) and we would definitely recommend it to both young and older people, way better than a hotel nearby. Thanks!!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I couldn’t recommend this place more! Alice’s home is so full of life! So much warmth and love in the space, beautifully creative, a home away from home. Her stories and paintings are amazing, so is the orchard in the backyard! Incredibly comfortable bed! I had beautiful dreams. The house has had many lives! It was a gift to pass through."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Really enjoyed staying at Katherine’s place in Elkins — very responsive host and fantastic apartment short walking distance to coffee shop and brewery. Parking was very easy to find next to unit. Very clean and well appointed apartment and would happily stay again!

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Eagles Nest Cabin! We felt right at home as it is so cozy. The firepit area and hot tub are a huge bonus that added to our relaxing trip! The communication was always quick and helpful. Highly recommend!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This cabin is amazing for people and pets. The hot tub, fire pit and yards are secluded and family friendly.
Our trip included 5-6” of snowfall and a power outage. Thankfully this host has her stuff together and communications were on point to get service restored after/during the storm.
Definitely a repeatable cabin to visit!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute little cabin off in the woods. Perfect for what we needed
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed the cabin, the peaceful seclusion, proximity to town, and most importantly the hot tub! We would definitely recommend!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had an amazing time at this cabin! We came for an early Valentine’s Day getaway! Super quiet, private, but yet close enough to things to do! We will def be back!! Very clean and cozy! Loved the hot tub, and fire pit! 10/10 recommend!"
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful setting, pet friendly, & responsive. You’ll definitely need 4WD to get out of the drive in the snow. E-mails, texts, streaming up to par. Phone calls hit or miss, a lot of dropped calls. Great place to disconnect and unwind."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very nice cabin retreat. Limited cell phone reception and limited WiFi, but not an issue when looking to get away to the mountains. Arrived during a storm with no power and the cabin already had a generator and power going, great hospitality. Definitely recommend AWD or 4WD if going during snow season, weather is vastly different from the valleys to mountain tops. Very clean cabin and peaceful surroundings. Definitely will be returning."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place was perfect for us and our dog. Very cozy cabin that is secluded. We really enjoyed the hot tub and views from the back deck. Highly recommend staying here. 30 mins from timberline ski resort which was a bonus for us.
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"My partner and I recently spent two wonderful days at this Airbnb in Elkins, WV, and we wanted to express our sincere appreciation for our stay. The cabin itself is absolutely beautiful and provided a very comfortable experience. Ashley, our Airbnb host, was incredibly attentive and responded promptly to any needs we had. I wholeheartedly recommend both Ashley as a host and this delightful cabin. I'm hopeful for the opportunity to stay there again in the future."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This cabin was great. Starting with Ashley, the communication was always fast. The check in was easy. The pictures matched the actual cabin. It is actually perched on a small overlook so it is very private; if you drive in through the campsite area, go up the small hill and it is on the right. Cabin is very clean, and all amenities listed are there. Plenty of pots and pans for our family of four to cook with. We enjoyed the hot tub but it appears a few of the jets do not function. I appreciate that all four of us could take hot showers after being out in the cold, and we never ran out of hot water.
The one downside is the fireplace is electric and not gas or natural. But I understand why due to the location. WiFi was good, certainly adequate for kids and I was able to send/receive work emails.
All in all it is a great cabin. Super easy five star review - everyone in the family feels that way too."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a great winter vacation! We are from Florida so we loved the snow. The cabin is in a great location. My family and I enjoyed our time in Elkins.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Took the whole family and everyone was charmed by this beautiful cabin. Cozy but still spacious. Full kitchen, hot tub, fire pit— we never ran out of things to do during our 3 night stay. Check out Blackwater Falls and their gift shop, weather and time permitting!
Ashley was the best host!"
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I got to Ashley’s place, which was exactly how it was described in the listing. It was clean, very pretty decorated and overall very nice. Due to a personal issue once I arrived I didn’t get to stay and Ashley was very understanding and accommodating.
I would recommend this cabin. Ashley was responsive and very sweet!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely stay, perfect mountain cabin getaway. Very cozy, well furnished, and equipped with everything one could ask for, including a large hot tub and fire pit.
Wifi connection was a bit spotty though (but we came here to unplug, so it wasn't too big a deal for us, just be prepared).
Location is great, right at the edge of the Monongahela National Forrest and a short drive from the nearby town of Elkins, and with tons of scenic trails and hiking spots within 20minutes in all directions.
And while the cabin is fairly secluded (no immediate neighbors) it did feel a little exposed at times, especially on the upper deck with the hot tub overlooking an RV campground and adjacent the quiet road you take to get there (note that we were there in peak winter so the trees were totally barren, could see it feeling more secluded in other seasons with cover).
All around great stay and Ashley was a great host, and highly responsive and helpful whenever we had questions.
Highly recommended!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ashley's cabin was the perfect place for my girls and I to have a peaceful, rejuvenating weekend retreat!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Well-located, well-equipped, and clean AirBnb within an hour or so of most of the best hikes in Monongahela. Easy arrival and check-in and a quick drive to groceries and other amenities in Elkins."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay. Close to Elkins. Nice and secluded. House was clean. Hot tub was awesome. 10/10 will return. Thank you!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ashley’s cabin was just what my husband and I needed for a weekend getaway! It was peaceful, quiet, the hot tub and fire pit were amazing additions! Her cabin was by far the cleanest cabin we’ve ever stayed. Pictures don’t do it justice. When one thinks of a cabin you expect some cob webs, dirt, not here! Her place was in pristine condition! She gave great recommendations and had excellent communication. Can’t wait to come back!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful place, great location. The cabin was very relaxing.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I've stayed in a lot of cabins and I think this was my favorite. It was super cute and clean and in a wonderful area. Everything is set up so well and it makes you feel very cozy. I would stay here again and recommend it to others. The host was kind and easy to communicate with.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Eagles Nest was exactly as described and perfect for an anniversary get away for my husband and I. We came to the area to hike all over from blackwater falls, chimney top, and Seneca rocks. Perfect location. Ashley had set out many recommendations and we really enjoyed smoke on the water for dinner and Big Timber brewing company for drinks and entertainment. The hot tub was a nice 15 minute break from the hiking and the outside firepit area was beautiful with the lighting and is very private. Highly recommend, and would come back!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything about the cabin was wonderful! Beautifully decorated and Very clean! We walked around all weekend barefoot and never got our feet dirty ...lol Kitchen was very well stocked with quality pots and pans (not the cheap thin ones most Airbnb have) Ashley was even gracious enough to allow us to enter early when we arrived a half hour before check in. Would highly recommend 🙂
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Ashley was amazing throughout the whole process.
Internet isn’t stable so don’t think you can work or anything there even with their wifi.
The place is absolutely stunning and the hot tub on the back deck was a nice touch! Wish I used it more"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Nice place to stay a couple days!
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Ashley was a great host and very responsive. When we got to the place it was a little smaller then we had expected but plenty of room to sit and relax on the ground floor. There was only one ""True"" enclosed bedroom with a door and walls. The other beds were out in the open on the top floor and in both rooms the beds basically were the entire space with minimal space for anything else. Other then the internet not working what so ever (After inspecting the router and internet speeds we found the speed tests were rather poor I assume due to being on a low bandwidth plan) When more then one device was connected everything came grinding to a halt. That being said, we came for a weekend away from everything so I do not knock the entire stay on that one flaw besides not being able to stream music when playing games and relaxing in the hot tub. The place was a bit tricky to find as I went right by it the first time and had to loop back. Overall would rate highly!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Ashley was exactly what I look for in a host. The cabin was a perfect secluded getaway for the weekend.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great cabin for a weekend fishing trip. Good location, clean rooms, and a well stocked kitchen.
Only issue - internet was very slow. So don’t plan on working remotely during your stay.
Would stay again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was as desribed and clean. The hot tub was hot and clean upon arrival. Checkin was so simple and Ashley was phenomenal at communicating. We loved our stay at her cabin and would definitely rent there again if ever back in the area.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Pretty great spot to getaway and have fun. Ashley was very nice and reaponded fast!!!
2023-04-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"The reviews help me decide whether to rent a place or not. That being said, I'm surprised previous guests didn't note certain things. 1) This house is on the side of a mountain. The house is severely out of level, from the mountain sloping downward. Doors/windows do not shut properly. The bathroom vanity drawers open themselves 6-8 inches due to the slant. After a couple days of sleeping in the bed perpendicular to the mountain, headaches/vertigo issues started, so we needed to change the direction our head faced. 2) All beds are upstairs. The bathroom is downstairs. There is no handrail on the staircase and it's open on one side. It seems unsafe and concerning especially for children in the middle of the night. 3) The freeway (4 lane road) runs less than a couple hundred feet behind the house, therefore you can hear constant traffic and semi trucks. Also, there was a mouse in the house for 2 of our 5 nights, which ate some of our sealed snacks off the cupboard."
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Description of the place was accurate. We had a nice stay and enjoyed the national forest
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little cabin. Beautiful area.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really happy we booked this place! Perfect for a weekend getaway. Ashley was also very responsive and helpful!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful cabin in the woods. Hot tub was wonderful and such a relaxing get-a-way. Ashley was so responsive up to and including the day we arrived.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ashley was a terrific host! We had some unexpected personal issues arise during the time of our stay; Ashley always responded quickly (usually within 15 minutes) to our various inquiries and was very flexible and supportive when we needed to extend our stay at the last minute.
The cabin is SO cozy and charming - and the hot tub was all warmed up for our arrival. It was everything we hoped for. Thanks, Ashley!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful cabin, very secluded and private. Ashley was a great host and very helpful. Loved that it was pet friendly as well. Will definitely be staying again :)"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place with a nice big hot tub we loved it!!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Just as was described
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful, modern cabin with charming and comfortable decor in a scenic wooded area near a river with lots of trails and outdoor activities. Enjoyed having our pups with us. Very quiet. There is no traffic noise nearby. The big hot tub was “icing on the cake”. Hope to return! We recommend Big Timber Brewery just about 10 min. away."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed the stay!!! Cell service was a little spotty and internet wasn’t the greatest. But being from the mountains myself you can’t really expect the highest speeds.
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,was a great stay!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Enjoyed our stay!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This cabin was beautiful and just what we wanted. We ate in Elkins and skied at Timberline. Great weekend. Thanks for being so responsive to my questions. I would highly recommend renting this cabin.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My group and I had a great time just relaxing and playing board games all weekend, went snow tubing and the hot tub was a wonderful addition to the cabin. The sky at night was absolutely beautiful and it was a very peaceful quiet location which is exactly what we were looking for! The cabin was very clean and cozy when we arrived, linens fully provided. Didn’t even need an extra blanket! The Wi-Fi is a little spotty but it still works- perfect for our remote retreat :)"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A wonderful getaway in the woods. beautiful views to accompany a beautiful cabin. Quick and easy check in and the hot tub makes it worth it by itself!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a nice stay in Ashley's place mid January. There was some snow and ice which made it hard to get out of the driveway, so we left the car at the top of the driveway and that worked out for us.
Upside:
At this time of year there wasn't a lot of traffic and busyness on the river, the RV parks nearby were relatively quiet.
Downside:
All the leaves on trees were down, minimizing the privacy. Seen from cabin was train track and RV parks.
Overall, we had a really good stay. Be aware that there are taxidermied animal products, including a small wolf when you walk in the front door. I didn’t see those in the photos. The feel is very ""hunting lodge"" and really well done.
We felt the kitchen was well stocked with pots, we could cook all the food we brought. Smoke on the Water BBQ recommended for lunch or dinner.
Would be a great place for fishing, hiking, drive to skiing. We wanted a cozy cabin, private with hot tub, and we got that. We enjoyed our stay."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,we absolutely loved the place! it was perfect for our little getaway. cabin was clean and well stocked. would definitely rent again!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We loved our stay! Would love to stay there again sometime! They are very accommodating!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The cabin was everything we could have asked for and more. We unfortunately visited West Virginia during a very cold time (-30 wind chills) but the cabin was very cozy and relaxing. Some reviews made it seem like the hot tub was very easily seen from the road; however, I'm pretty sure we only saw 1 car every 6-8 hours. We felt very secluded and it was overall very quiet. Our pups enjoyed the stay as well! We loved the addition of the dog bowls. Would stay again 😊"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Na
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was perfect. Ashley was very quick to respond. Overall it was great place to stay.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We LOVED our stay! The photos & description don’t do it justice. Our family spent thanksgiving here, and it had everything we needed from extra towels, flour, spices, utensils, space heater- everything! Very private & serene location. We loved the hot tub! There was plenty of hiking nearby. The ONLY thing we’d say is there’s no overhead vent for the stove, so we had to cook our steaks outside. But it wasn’t an issue!
10/10 recommend!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice secluded cabin for a reasonable price!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ashley’s place was accurately presented. The location of the cabin is right above a RV park, but it’s secluded and private for a true getaway experience. It’s clean and there were many touches that made it a very unique cabin experience. Water pressure in the shower could have been better. That was the only minor inconvenience, however my travel bros and I had a great time! Thank you, Ashley."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is the perfect place to stay in Elkins, WV. Cute little cabin that was tucked away and had all the amenities you could ask for. 😊"
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The inside of the cabin is beautiful. It is clean and everything listed is provided. Ashley is very quick to communicate.
If you are from the city and looking for something secluded this would be considered that in your opinion. My perception of secluded would not necessarily be this cabin. when in the hot tub cars driving by can see you from the road or RV park over the hill (there were not leaves on the trees at my visit). There is also two decently large within RV Parks view of the cabin as well which was not expected.
This cabin is close to hiking trails which we took advantage of and there are many resources in the cabin to help you decide where to go.
I would recommend this cabin to a friend or family member."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome Stay! Beautiful cabin and Ashley was quick to respond! Only wish was the fireplace was wood burning. Overall though… Highly recommend!!!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Place was great! Very great location!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything was awesome.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at this cabin in the woods was completely perfect!! The cabin is absolutely beautiful and has everything you need for the perfect stay!!

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great little cabin outside of Elkins! Check in was super easy and the hot tub was a great addition.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place with activities close by for the outdoor person
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great cabin! Super nice!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ashley and Freddie were amazing! The cabin is in a central location to many cool spots and is very cozy. We had a small issue getting connected to Wi-Fi when we got there ( which was our fault ) and Freddie came right out to help us and get us settled in. Him and Ashley were both extremely friendly and helpful!
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice and secluded! Perfect if you are staying with your dog. The highway traffic can be a little loud during the morning hours of the week if you are a light sleeper, but other than that this was a very nice place for a little getaway!"
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cozy and cute cabin. Love the interiors and the hot tub is just amazing.
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great cabin! Clean, private, great location."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved the secluded location and that the cabin was just a short drive/decent walk from the river! The area was really fun to explore and we just had a great time.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Loved this cabin! Can’t wait to come back !
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet and quaint. If you’re looking for a private weekend getaway to unplug from your phones, this is it! Very clean and cozy."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family had a wonderful stay at the cabin! It was located in a great spot for the places we planned to visit during our stay and it was only 10 minutes from a grocery store. The cabin was clean and comfortable, and the hot tub was perfect after hikes, horseback riding, and whitewater rafting."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awsome cabin and wildlife decor. Clean and hot tub cleaned. Close to stores, entertainment and all outdoor attractions within an hour"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Ashley provided great communication prior to the trip and check-in. The location is convenient to explore the surrounding area and the trees and foliage block out the road nearby. We really enjoyed relaxing in the hot tub and being able to take our dog with us.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host and a great house. Will definitely be bringing our kids next time!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very clean and quiet. Was in town for four nights hiking and fly fishing and found the cabin central to everywhere I went. Great communication from the host as well. Great stay.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Perfect size and great location near creek for fishing.
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Fantastic cozy little cabin. Access to the river and close proximity to a lot of things. The owners are def putting some time and money into the place to make it nice. Would come and stay again. Ashley was a pleasure to work with.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This cabin was great! Everything you could need and close to lots of activities! Ashley was wonderful to work with. We had a small issue with the hot tub, but they were more than accommodating in fixing the issue! It was a wonderful get away!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a quiet, clean, lovely cabin. Super close to hundreds of hikes. The kitchen has everything you need. We only ate out once, preferring to enjoy the cabin space. It is only a few mins from Elkins - easy to grab groceries there. We brought our two dogs and really appreciate the places that allow pets because we love to hike and vacation with them. The owners responded to any questions I had in seconds. Check in was easy with a door code. There is a queen bed in a separate room, then a double and bunk beds. The beds were clean and comfortable. Although a large road is nearby, the cabin is on a side road which is nice to walk on also. It’s very quiet, with views of the river below. We had a great time here and will return again. The internet is not super fast here, but is enough for our needs. This is about being in nature. Highly recommend this wonderful spot!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a wonderful place to stay. Ashley contacted me prior to check in to let me know the place was ready. The property was quiet, peaceful, and clean. I was near a number of natural spots that I wanted to visit. Location was ideal, close to parks and town. Hot tub, linens, bathroom, and kitchen were clean. Hot tub was private for early morning and evening relaxation. I was able to prepare breakfast in her kitchen and make coffee before taking off for the day. I would stay again."
2022-04-01,4.0,Group trip,Very small dinner table
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Clean and comfortable. The set up is lovely. The location is great. Would stay again.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very clean and very responsive host- had a great stay!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was impeccably clean and cozy! Just minutes to downtown Elkins, where we found restaurants and shops to explore. The deck-level hot tub was just what we needed to complete our cabin getaway!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Photos simply don’t do this cabin justice. The interior is gorgeous and looks just as a mountain cabin should in my opinion. We had a dog with us and he enjoyed the yard and I also enjoyed it because there is a bank there that will not allow your dog to roam into the road. The location is only 8 minutes from the nearest town which has plenty of places to eat and a Walmart. Ashley was an awesome host and was excellent at communicating with us. Would highly recommend.
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very quiet location, even though close to highway. Great location to see the area from. Hot tub was great and owners communication was great."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Ashley's cabin is very nice and comfortable. Check in was easy. Location was close enough to Elkins to drive there in roughly 15 minutes. Everything was clean and very well kept. Recommended.
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"All together we had good time in cabin and enjoyed our stay
PROS: - Rental rate is appropriate for cabin location and condition
- Cabin was cozy and perfect for two people + pet friendly
- Cabin is in close location to many attractions (skiing/hiking/fishing)
- Owners respond quickly with any questions or problem and were very
friendly
CONS: - Cabin is really NOT secluded , maybe “semi-private” is better description as there is no other house directly next to it, BUT its right next to two roads , local road next to it and its right under main highway . So you can hear heavy traffic noice in mornings. Also big RV campground right under.
If you travel with bigger dog, there is not much anywhere to walk your dog, except the road. There is no fenced area or much of yard to run , or play around cabin.
- Hot tub on porch is exposed directly to any road traffic, so anyone driving
by sees you
- cabin could use some deeper cleaning touch
- no smart tv , bad reception for tv signal if cloudy , internet was slower
- dishes needs update
I would give it 7 stars out of 10 ."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2022-02-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place for summer...slightly difficult for animals in winter. Overall nice size..
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent! We had an issue with the hot tub and they came out and fixed it in like 5 mins! They even shocked and salted the driveway. Thank you!!
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Solid cabin with a Christian/hunting theme. Hot tub and kitchen were great. Satellite wifi was too slow for streaming, but satellite TV was good. Friendly hosts were very attentive about replacing missing amenities and salting the driveway. The gravel driveway is a little steep, and snow/ice is frequent when we went in January. If you’re going in winter, your safest bet is 4WD, snow-tires, or chains. We have a 2WD Civic and couldn’t make it out one day due to ice, but some timely salting and cinder helped."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I spent a snowy weekend in the cabin and it was great! Views from the back balcony where the hot tub was were super pretty, especially the stars at night! The inside was cute and clean. Stocked with all the amenities you might need. We definitely would recommend to anyone! If you’re going during a snowy time of year, I would suggest a 4wd vehicle.. the driveway is steep!"
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice stay in this cute rental cabin! Not as remote as I expected, the hot tub is visible to the nearby road, but overall a great stay."
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a sweet and comfortable stay in this cabin for New Years. The weather was not in our favor so we ended up spending a lot more time inside the cabin than we had anticipated. The space was very clean and instructions were clear and accurate . I think the cabin probably feels more secluded in the spring /summer when the trees are filled in but enjoyable none the less.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ashley was so great to work with. Everything was easy and smooth, the place is a perfect getaway and as advertised! It was clean, comfortable, had everything we needed, and the hot tub was amazing to relax in. I highly recommend this stay!!!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great time with my family!! Place was so quiet and relaxing !!
2021-12-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is super cute but small. I definitely think it best suits a small group of friends or family— but certainly not 6-8 people. If you have pets, beware that there is NO fenced in backyard(let alone a backyard at all) like advertised which is super disappointing since we brought dogs along on our trip. The check in/out process was easy and the host was prompt with her responses. Overall, while cute, there were a few too many issues that I made the host aware of that were unsettling. Glad for the experience but would not return."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this cabin! Super clean, nice beds, easy to use hot tub, easy checkin- and out, great location ect. We hope to come back!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This cabin is beautiful and clean and went above my expectations. It was so cozy and relaxing and being able to sit outside and look at all the stars was breathtaking. The owners have out done themselves here and were so kind and made sure everything was taken care of before our arrival and during our stay. The communication was fantastic and there was never an unanswered question. I highly recommend them and will be using them again.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice cabin our family stayed here for thanksgiving and we absolutely loved it. Ashley was very communicative and has a fast response. Jacuzzi was working great and felt great! Overall I would recommend this cabin for a nice vacation away from home with family and friends.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great way to spend a kid free weekend with someone special. I am going to recommend this place to all my friends for a nice get away.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Thank you Ashley for being such a great host! Everything was perfect and my family really enjoyed your cozy cabin in the most beautiful state. We look forward to visiting again!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great cabin in a great location, close to a lot of hiking and fishing and still close enough to town you can easily eat out or go shopping."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great little cabin to stay in. It looks small from the outside, but it was more than enough room for the two of us. The decor is a cozy and charming log cabin vibe, with fun little touches throughout. The hot tub was our favorite spot- at night, you can see the stars and you feel like you’re in the trees. The full kitchen and laundry was helpful too.
Wifi was a little slow but def enough to search for a hike, text, whatever. Directv was nice to watch a show at night
We drove to go horseback riding and hiking too. Just a great little getaway!"
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The place was decorated nicely and had a cozy cabin feel. Unfortunately, perhaps because it was the weekend, there was a good amount of noise coming from the nearby RV park. We still got a chance to enjoy the hot tub and grill some food. For those looking to work remotely, the wifi was slow so just keep that in mind but you'll get plenty of uninterrupted peace."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very kind owners! Quick and efficient communication throughout. They gave us tips on what hikes to do and what to expect at each location. The cabin was in a secluded and quiet area. The view was spectacular and the cabin was extremely clean! We will be going back 😊
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Had an absolutely wonderful time at Ashley's cabin. Nestled in the woods with a hot tub on the deck, we were able to enjoy stargazing at night or a fire in the firepit out front. Ashley was really helpful and very quick to respond to any questions. We hope to be back soon!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a beautiful place to stay at! Very clean and well maintained! Hot tub is a must do, so make sure you get in when you stay!!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place, friendly host. Will be back for sure."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you for sharing your unique space with us!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The place was very cute and cozy, very wonderful."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We spent four days at Hannah’s place and loved every moment of our time! The home was cozy but spacious, with beautiful decor and a very comfortable bed and couch! We traveled with our dogs, and they had a great time in the fenced-in backyard and enjoyed walks around the neighborhood.
This home is located in a very quiet area, within walking distance of downtown Elkins and just down the street from a city park. There is plenty of hiking and other sightseeing within a short driving distance as well. Hannah’s house is a great place to stay for your trip to Elkins!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,very clean!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfection
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Super cute home base from which to explore Elkins. Everything is within walking distance and hikes are a short 15-20 drive out of town.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hannah’s home was exactly what we needed for our weekend away. If you love old homes with LOTS of character, this is it! The town had lots to offer and if you spend some time driving, you will find God’s beautiful handiwork everywhere you look! Hannah was easy to communicate with and her home was extremely welcoming and cozy!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A wonderful place to stay while visiting Elkins. I would stay again and recommend to others.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Ground floor apartment of a house located in a quiet area in the center of ELKINS close to DAVIS AND ELKINS College.
You feel like a family guest there"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My parents stayed in this Airbnb and loved it! They loved walking the neighborhood and being able to walk to Main Street. The place was easy to find and check in. It was extremely cozy and cute!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Such a charming place! close to lots of great hiking areas. Downtown Elkins is quaint with nice restaurants and shops.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The house felt like home and was immaculately clean. Beautifully decorated and cozy. Had everything we needed and could’ve asked for. Hannah was very responsive and her recommendations were very helpful. Perfect place for our anniversary getaway. Would definitely stay here again!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hannah’s place was perfect for a mother daughter weekend! We were in town for an autumn train ride, and the home was only 3 min. away from the train depot. It’s also within 3 min. of restaurants and Tiptop coffee (definitely recommend for your morning coffee). Pictures really don’t do the home justice because it’s decorated amazing and is super trendy. Honestly, it reminded me of a popular designer’s home that we stayed in a few months ago. The home is also very cozy, and the bed was extremely comfortable. It’s also in a nice, peaceful neighborhood, and it felt safe. My daughter approved, and she’s a picky teenager, so that’s always a win! We would definitely stay here again when visiting the Elkins area!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Would absolutely recommend staying in this beautiful house while visiting Elkins. Very short walk to lots of great restaurants also.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My dog and I thought Hannah’s home in Elkins was an ideal place for us. The house was comfortable, stylish, and had everything we needed for a great stay. The neighborhood was walkable and quiet. Elkins was a great home base for our outdoor adventuring in the Monongahela National Forest. Hannah was a great host, friendly and accommodating in every way. We sure appreciated being able to stay in her dog friendly home."
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"The house is as pictured. The shower is great, good hot water, rain shower head. The bed is very comfortable and the home has a gas cooking stove which was a delight to use. Kitchen is stocked with decent pans, non stick and had utensils to work with to cook properly. Neighbors were nice, house has a wonderful deck on the back with a swing and privacy. However as stated: house is old and electric 3 prong outlets are few...be prepared. Thank you for a good stay, beautiful parks close by to investigate and train ride was fun. Lots of history in the town."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay at Hannah’s house. It was just as it was listed. It close to downtown a very easy walk. The park was very close and nice to walk through as well. The bed was very comfortable with great linens and towels. We did enjoy the the cat stopping by and saying hello. Would definitely recommend this to anyone staying in the area.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Hannah’s space was so peaceful and clean, also in a beautiful setting that’s close to shops and local spots, and a great deal overall. The bed was extremely comfortable and living space had many cozy elements. Definitely recommend!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Everything was great!
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely house in a good location. Only issues I had were amenities related (the remote was dead and the shampoo and soap bottles empty) but otherwise, a nice spot in Elkins."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This house is very nice, convenient to local restaurants and the city park. Back deck and porch swing are great in warm weather.
Hannah was very responsive and made us feel comfortable with fresh cut flowers."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was perfect for our needs! Conveniently located in Elkins, near to the event we were attending. Everything was comfortable and clean. Thanks, Hannah!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow! What a beautiful home in an ideal location. Really, it was a spectacular spot in a quiet neighborhood. It's an easy 8-10 minute stroll to downtown. The home is also located beside a large park. At night, I sat on the swing in the backyard and listened to the crickets chirp, not another sound to be heard.
And, again, the home is beautiful. Lots of space, a large and comfortable bed, great kitchen with a sizeable fridge, and a cute sitting area. If you don't mind small town living, this would be an ideal home.
As noted in the description, the only downside to this home is the dearth of electrical outlets. I got by just fine, but be prepared to hunt for outlets. This is such a minor issue, and it doesn't take anything away from the overall excellent experience. Bring a power strip if you're concerned.
Also, Hannah was quick to respond to any questions. She's a very gracious host.
10/10, I recommend."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay! The house was perfect for us and the dogs loved the back yard! The house is in close proximity to the park which was great to give the dogs daily walks. In addition, our family lives close by, so all in all, we were grateful to be able to stay! Thank you!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Hannah’s place was just as described and photos were accurate. Very cute house in a quiet, safe neighborhood near a park and downtown. Easy to walk around and a short drive to lots of places to eat. Friendly neighborhood cat greeted us outside almost everyday. Would recommend for 2 people only or with a younger child as the couch not really the type for sleeping on. Bedroom is next to living room and not private but that was no issue for us. The bed was ah-mazing! Big and so comfortable, with soft sheets and soft yet supportive mattress with topper. I looked forward to going to bed at night (which is rare when in a new bed). A/C worked great and rooms had ceiling fans that kept the space nice and comfortable. Bathroom was big with spacious shower and nice hot water. Although we did not cook during our stay the kitchen was large with good space for food prep/cooking and a large fridge. Would recommend Hannah’s place for a stay in Elkins!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house was just lovely and well appointed. The neighborhood was lovely and walking distance to everything downtown. I especially loved the grey kitty that slept in the outside back porch abd the black neighborhood cat that greeted me when I came abd went each day. Most importantly, I felt at home."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Pleasant stay, convenient to downtown Elkins and Davis & Elkins College. The bed was comfortable and the kitchen was very well equipped, in fact containing much more food/supplies than I was expecting. The house is quite spacious, although it’s really only suitable for two people (sleeping together)—there is no door between the bedroom and the living room, and the couch would not be fun to sleep on, though it was just fine for sitting. I was also pleased to find an active Netflix subscription on the TV!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice house. It's clean and well outfitted with the important things. It's walking distance to Davis & Elkins College and to restaurants and other city attractions. We stayed in July and the air conditioner and ceiling fans kept things nice and cool overnight and whenever we stopped in at the house. The WiFi is fast, and the neighborhood is very nice and walkable as well. Highly recommended!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,very nice stay - very clean - walking distance to alot of places of interest in the Elkins area. We had a very nice stay and would certainly use again if we are going back to the Elkins area

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,100% WONDERFUL stay. Cozy home in a great neighborhood - even the neighbors were super friendly! Hannah was a perfect host... always fast and friendly communication. Felt totally at home and would absolutely stay there again.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Hannah's place! We felt right at home and loved her attention to decor and furnishings. It is really a beautiful 100 year old house! It was more spacious then we imagined it being from the pictures. We loved the full kitchen, the dining room, and enjoying our coffee in the morning on the private back porch. The bed is very comfortable! The second bed is a couch and my brother said he was fine sleeping on it for two nights. The house had everything we needed, check in was a breeze and Hannah was very responsive to any questions we had. Also, the neighborhood was quiet and felt safe. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hannah’s place was cozy and great for a long weekend getaway. Elkins a great small town and in close proximity for snowboarding / skiing at Snowshoe Mountain (~1.25hr) and hiking at Sennica rocks (~45min).
Thanks again Hannah!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Full of charm and character! We had a great stay and the pup enjoyed the fenced in yard.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. Sorry for burning your decorative wood. My only complaint is that in the photos of the house there is a picture of a Mountain View. This is not a view from the house like we expected as the house is actually in town which makes the listing slightly misleading. Otherwise everything was great!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A charming home conveniently located in a safe, quiet neighborhood near everything Elkins has to offer. The home was immaculate and had everything we needed; our host Hannah was super communicative and helpful."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Hannah’s place was the perfect place for our family. We visited with our 1 year old & dog. The home provided great space for our daughter to run around & play. Our dog enjoyed the back yard. Her home is beautiful & cozy. We felt very at home in this old beauty!
The house is in the perfect location to be walking distance from the city park & downtown. After a long drive in, we enjoyed being able to walk to everything we needed. We visited during fall, and the trees in the neighborhood & park are especially beautiful in their fall colors.
Hannah was very accommodating of requests and always responded back quickly!
We would gladly stay at her place in the future.
-Troy & Penni"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is an absolute charm in a great location! Very clean and had all the essentials needed. Any questions or issues that came up, Hannah responded quickly. Loved my stay here!"

Also thanks for the awesome list of restaurant and local area attractions! It was super helpful and my stay was wonderful rest on my trip!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,What a wonderful place to stay! It felt like a home away from home. Perfectly situated in Elkins to enjoy the town or surrounding area. There was a friendly neighborhood cat that I thoroughly enjoyed sharing the back porch with. Hannah is a great host that communicates well and keeps the home clean and in good working order.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying at Hannah’s place! It met our expectations once again. We ended up keeping our reservation even when we knew we were going to have terrible weather during our stay because Hannah’s place is a getaway in of itself. It is cozy, clean, and has limited internet signal which is extremely refreshing. We spent our escape from the city watching classic movies and tv, walking around Elkins and eating the amazing food from the restaurants nearby:)"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,wonderful host and wonderful house!!! couldn't be happier!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My second visit and we will return again!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hannah’s house was above my expectations. There was lots of books, and pictures, antiques and a big kitchen. It felt like we were staying at a friends house. The location was good, super quiet neighborhood, nice park nearby and a ten minute walk to coffee shop and restaurants. Hannah has no internet available and we discovered there no Verizon coverage in and around Elkins. Texted Hannah and she advised us to try McDonald’s which solved our problem. She also made an emergency run for toilet paper. She was available and very quick to respond to any issues that came up. It was an excellent trip. We had beautiful weather, wonderful skiing and a great place to stay."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place to stay.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A very unique and cozy spot!! Perfect for our ski weekend getaway!
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We stayed for a month and it couldn’t have been better. All the necessary items were available, plenty of room for the dogs in the back yard, and Hannah was always available to answer questions or give advice. The neighborhood is perfect and easy to get around—even during the massive amounts of snow we had. We would absolutely stay again."
2021-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time in Elkins. Hannah’s home is lovely, with lots of thoughtful touches and a homey atmosphere. The fenced-in backyard was great for our pup, and it was nice being walking distance to the park and local restaurants."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures do not do this charming house justice. However, I found the listing confusing, as it led me to expect two beds. There is one bed and one couch, all in public space. As it was myself and my daughter, privacy was not an issue. The kitchen has everything you need to prepare your own food. The host's communication was timely, cordial and helpful."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Gorgeous home, super clean, great location, and a very responsive host, what more could you ask for?"

Our family made beautiful memories in this home! The location was great for the hiking we had planned! I will be referring this home to other friends and family members when they visit WV!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hannah has a beautiful home in elkins. We couldnt have asked for a better location to stay at! We came right at the peak of the leaf change for fall so our scenery was breathtaking. There are mountain views all around and an amazing bike path, the rail trail, right at the end of downtown elkins. Make sure to bring a mountain bike or a bike verstile enough to hold up to rocky paths! You wont want to miss the opportunity to explore the rail trail! there are great local restaurants near by which were exactly what we needed after a full day of outdoor activity. Her spot is also great if you are someone who visits snowshoe! She is only an hour away which might be ideal if you dont want to spend the extra for the convenience of staying near the resort. Hannah was also great at responding if we had any questions! Her house was clean, comfy, and a perfect spot to have a small fall get away. We also felt very safe in terms of covid. She washes everything thoroughly between guests. We are looking forward to visiting again!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You feel right at home at Hannah’s place! We had a very easy check-in, and were happy to see it’s on a very friendly little street, close to everything in town, and not a bad drive to lots of attractions. The house is very cozy, decorated beautifully, and has a great fenced in backyard where we really enjoyed unwinding in the evening after our hiking adventures."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cute little space! The bed is small (as listed in ad), but SO comfy. I loved the decor, like chic meets antique meets midwest. So unique. Overall location in elkins is perfect. The house was very clean as well."

2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hannah’s home is absolutely beautiful and chic. My girlfriend and I really loved the decor, plants, and overall ambiance of the house. The headboard for the bed is absolutely breathtaking, the bed is super soft, the TV’s are new, local food spots were extremely close by and delicious (especially Vintage), kitchen is fully stocked with cooking utensils and plenty of silverware, and most importantly the house was sparkling clean and smelled great. Hannah was also very responsive and was quick to answer our questions. Would definitely stay again!"

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay in Hannah's home - it was convenient to Elkins (walkable to most restaurants, and amenities), and we enjoyed sitting on the front porch in the mornings and watching the cute neighborhood goings-ons. An FYI for folks traveling as a couple - the bed is a double and is VERY soft! Thanks Hannah for your hospitality!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Hannah is a super host! I enjoyed my stay very much, the time is comfortable and clean with plenty of space. I will stay again when in town aka can recommend others stay with Hannah as well!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One step, easy access to the front door and one is drawn into the rich gem colored hallway of Hannah's lovely, welcoming home. Rustic meets Yesteryear antique artisanship meets ""Wyoming"" home. Not predominantly frilly feminine- nor overly masculine...a nice mix."
2019-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect for one. Double bed was tough for us, 2 average size people."

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hannah is a terrific host. Her home is lovely and filled with unique touches. It was truly a home away from home close to downtown. My canine companion was thrilled with the fenced in backyard so he could ""run free"" from a leash. I always enjoy the ""picking in the park"" on Wednesday evenings too! I will definitely return again next year."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautifully appointed home. Centrally
located to all. Grateful we found Hannah’s home!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I had an amazing weekend stay at Hannah’s place in Elkins. The home was a perfect, cozy spot for two in a central location in town. We were able to walk to a local grocery store and brewery. The house is nestled in a quiet, well-kept neighborhood and is beautifully decorated.
As clearly marked in the description, there is no Wifi, so expect to have a disconnected weekend. We enjoyed the chance to connect with one another and unwind. Other reviewers also noted that there is very little Verizon cell service in town and the surrounding areas, which I can attest to. If you’re planning to explore the nearby Monogahela National Forest, we would recommend getting a map, as GPS may not always work."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A great place to stay. Comfortable, clean and convenient to everything."

The Charming 1920 Brick Home was the perfect weekend getaway. We never once needed the car, walking distance to the Elkins Art Center, Elkins and Davis College, “Squirrel Park”, El Grand Sabor, Vintage, Mountain Rail, WV Railroad Museum and Big Timber Brewing Co.
Hannah the host was most helpful. When we visit Elkins or the area again, this is where we will stay."

The decorating is terrific, and comfortable, the kitchen has everything you need for your stay, the clothes washer is space age and works really well. The location is really cool!

My 81 year old father slept in the bedroom and I slept on the very comfortable couch. My little dog Sophie loved the fenced backyard and proximity to the city park.

It was like everything had its own story. And it was so clean. Kitchen had everything . We made a good pasta dinner with all the extras.The town of Elkins was peaceful. It's hometown America. Went for a couple runs in the morning, it was so quiet. Also hit up the Forest near by. This old house is special and you can tell Hannah has answered the call."

2017-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a gem of a find! Hanna's home is super clean and full of character. It's basically right on the Beautiful campus of Davis & Elkins College. Hannah was very responsive and accommodating. I hope to stay as her guest during my future travels. :-)

2017-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Hannah's home while visiting our daughter. She is a student at D&E and the location is perfect. There are not many lodging options for us in the area since we travel with our dog. We are so glad to have found this location! It's within walking distance of the campus, pet-friendly and has a fenced backyard. Hannah is a delight and goes above expectations to welcome you. She even greeted us with a delicious loaf of her freshly baked bread. The home itself is very comfortable, convenient and fully equipped for all your needs. We have two more trips booked and will always book here when visiting Elkins."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Charming, clean, and close to town! Scott was an excellent host - quick responses and so gracious to allow our dog to stay with us. He even left dog bowls! And our kids loved the complimentary s’mores ingredients and playing in the backyard creek! Will definitely come back!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The tiny house was fantastic - very homey and welcoming! There was plenty of space and all the amenities we could need. Scott did a terrific job of providing a full set of kitchen supplies and toiletries. He even provided the makings for smores and even included the firewood. On top of everything else, Scott is a master craftsman. I was extremely impressed with the way the tiny house was built and all the attention to detail inside. We would definitely rent again. Scott is a wonderful host!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"From start to fininish this experience has been nothing less than perfect.
First time using airBnB and Scott couldn’t have made it easier on us.
Starting off with location: we arrived super early in the morning (roughly 4am) and had 0 issue not only finding the grounds but navigating the property to the home.
Inside was exactly as pictured clean as could be. Property is plenty local to quite a few good resturants and plenty of trails making easy to find an adventure.
All in all would definitely stay again though I am excited to see whatelse he is building on the property!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Scott's place has a very nice homey feel. I enjoyed the modern conveniences mixed with antique decor. Climate control worked well; both to cool and warm the place. If you're looking for a little home to stay in the area, this is perfect. Thanks!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks Scott! We had a great time. Your place was wonderful. We will be back!!!!!!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Scott went above and beyond for my parents for the weekend. He was extremely responsive and more than generous with his time. I 100% recommend spending time in Scott's cabin.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable tiny home with plenty of space to move around and not feel like you’re in an actual tiny home. Laid out well and appointed. Would absolutely stay here again when in the area.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was incredibly charming, clean and cozy! I loved the rustic aesthetic, hand crafted touches like the shower and stairs to the loft. Scott is a great host - super helpful and responsive. I will definitely reserve again for future trips to Elkins. Take me Home Country Roads!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Scott truly thought of everything when preparing the place! The outdoor space and fire pit are right along the creek. Will definitely stay again!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Perfect weekend getaway. Tiny home well laid out with great use of space. Easy jumping off point for tons of adventures in the area. Scott was communicative and the check-in process was so easy. We would definitely stay here again. I was super excited to make a fire in the outdoor firepit. Right on a little creek flowing through the campground. It was beautiful and peaceful. Great weekend.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Highly recommend
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is great! Scott put a lot of thought into the place when he was building it and it shows. The shower might have been my favorite part, with the corrugated steel and stone combo. It sits right along the stream and close to the mountains. My only regret is that we didn't go prior to daylight savings time ending, so it got dark super early. Definitely worth a visit and I'm sure the grain silo home he's building is going to be just as nice! Thank you for a great place to stay!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Scott’s place is really lovely. If you are in Elkins to visit the college or do something else in town, it is very conveniently located but nicer than staying in a hotel. The interior is really upscale - nothing “contractor grade.” You have everything you need including kitchen, washer/dryer and great shower. We didn’t get to sit out at the fire pit bcuz it was raining but it’s right by the stream and lovely. Smoke on the Water restaurant is also closeby so we ate well also!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Scott is a great host and his home is beautiful. The bed is super comfortable and the overall vibe of the house is very cozy and has a great homey feel.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We loved our weekend stay in this cabin. It is beautifully decorated and we had everything we needed inside and out! The fire pit out back was a perfect place to relax at the end of the day and listen to the creek while enjoying a fire. I highly recommend this cabin and the host was great!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute home and great for our stay! Thanks for being a great host.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great Tiny Home in quiet campground. Great host and communication.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter and I needed a safe, comfortable and convenient place to stay while we were on our fishing trip. We found all of the above and more. Great location to everything.. Restaurants, convenience stores. Attractions such as Blackwater Falls, Dolly Sods, Seneca Rock and the WV Wildlife Center are all with an hour to hour/half away. I highly recommend Scott’s place."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Scott’s place was amazing. My family was very happy not only with the service but also location. We are definitely looking forward to visiting again….. and soon.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really cute place. Scott was great at communicating and accommodated us last minute.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Scott's place is wonderful! It was the perfect place for relaxing after hiking. The bed was comfortable, the shower was awesome and had great water pressure + the hot water lasted, no issues with the wifi, and the kitchen had everything I needed and more. Would definitely stay again!!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is nothing short of awesome and might be the most cozy and comfortable place I’ve ever stayed. The bed is large and cozy, with soft sheets and nice pillows to rest your head after a long day. I cooked a nice breakfast each morning in the kitchen, and the shower is spacious and water pressure is excellent. Here’s a tip: the sides of the couch fold down of you pull them towards you if you want to use it for napping!
I’ll be back next year!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Really well done place. The wood slabs wainscoting, handmade loft ladder, barn door, locally sourced creek stone shower floor, etc. Conveniently located within 10 minutes to restaurants, Kroger, and Walmart. Looking forward to checking out the silo cabin Scott is just beginning to build."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We met Scott our host and he was so friendly and wanted to know of our needs! Our rental was clean, awesome, loved the stone in shower floor a super nice stay !"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very nice and unique tiny home. Used this as our base camp to explore Seneca Rocks/Spruce Knob/Dolly Sods Wilderness (although still a bit of a drive to each of those areas- approx 40-60 minute drive depending on which one of those areas you’re heading to). We enjoyed the fire pit in the backyard and the wood that was provided for it. We also made use of the grill and cooked out and had dinner outside at the picnic table. Overall, a great stay and clean place with solid amenities. Would recommend."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house has a lot of love and attention put into it: local stone in the shower, handmade stairs to the loft, a vaulted ceiling with corrugated metal, attention paid to landscaping by the deck. The kitchen and bathroom were extremely clean with everything you might need. There was even firewood to make a fire in the fire pit by the creek. We could walk over to the nearby barbecue restaurant which was handy. Scott is personable and responds quickly if you have a question. It was the perfect landing spot after hiking and backpacking in the area! Would stay here again."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Scott's tiny home was perfect! The house accommodated 3 adults and a dog quite well as we were in town for a relative's birthday party.
We enjoyed spending time outside next to the creek listening to the water flow. The neighbors at the nearby campground sites were friendly.
We also enjoyed being able to walk over to Smoke on the Water, the BBQ restaurant right next door. Everything I ate there was delicious!
Downtown Elkins is also a short drive away and we enjoyed TipTop coffee and Byrd's House of Donuts for breakfast stops.
Thanks again Scott--we really enjoyed our stay!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The cabin was perfect for a weekend getaway in the mountains. The location was convenient to town and to the national forest for some great day hiking. The cabin itself was the perfect size for 2 people and a large dog. Scott was very communicative and hospitable. We would definitely come back again!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Scott was a great host who takes great care of his guests. Very nice house with everything you need.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome spot. Great location, tucked away and near a lovely creek but close to everything in Elkins. Wifi was really slow/spotty but it worked enough for what we needed and was a nice break from technology. Would stay there again."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very nice cabin. Well designed. Good location near town. Good jumping off point to Elkins, Seneca Rocks, Spruce Knob, etc. Easy check-in. Good communication. Definite recommend!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We went to this tiny home for relaxation and Scott gave us a full experience!
Scott: He was amazing. Answered emails very fast, left us a welcoming note with mints and origami, and complimentary wood. He made sure we were not lacking anything.
The tiny home: We loved all the details in this home. From the railroad nails used as door handles to the rock floor in the shower. So well done with a lot of attention to detail. It has a cabin rustic industrial look with a modern touch. The house was clean and smelled really nice. Although it is a tiny home, it feels much bigger and spacious. There are two bbq in the back with a picnic table, fire pit and Adirondack style chairs. But the best is the creek and the mountain in the back. It makes you feel you’re in the middle of a forest. We enjoyed so much listening to all the different birds and the water sounds. The area is so quiet and nice! Coming from a city this was heaven!
Surroundings: There’s a bbq grill place at walking distance that we can recommend. At close driving distance you can find the town of Elkins. If you stay there don’t miss the Audra State Park or visiting the surrounding towns.
Overall, the experience was great and we recommend without reservations this place. We do hope to come back for another stay."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The inside will blow you away. The details in this tiny cabin are amazing from the rail spike cabinet nobs to the stone floor shower it is incredible, Remote controls on the ceiling fans and a wonderful stove/microwave and fridge! The creek behind it was just wonderful and its very close to Elkins."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable little cabin, well stocked with all the essentials! The view out the front window was mostly the storage unit across the lot, but the creek and the fire pit in the back definitely made up for it."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very peaceful spot and a great home-base for day trips around WV’s mountain country. Thank you!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay at the Tiny House! It was perfect once again. Thank you!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, very well put together. Lovely wood trim and accents. Very nice kitchen and bath, comfy bed. The stone floored shower was a delight. Lovely view from the windows (and from the porch and grounds in warmer weather). The bbq at the restaurant next door was excellent. Very well placed for day trips around and into Elkins. Krogers is just down the road. I’ll be back!
It was also very quiet in March."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great little cabin/tiny house.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is perfect- easy to find, clean, very comfortable! Will book again! Only about 35 min to good skiing at white grass!"

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a fantastic little cabin! It is in a safe and quiet location, super easy to find, just a mile or two from the center of town. At arrival, it was spotlessly clean, with top notch furnishings, appliances and beautiful flooring throughout. We loved the style - a cool mix of wood, modern and industrial! The shower was terrific, and what a convenience having the stacked washer/dryer on hand. The main floor bed had an extremely comfortable mattress. We used the couch/futon for sleeping - also very comfortable. The kitchen appliances and fixtures were new and high-end and we had a full array of dishes, pots, pans and utensils. Every imaginable need was supplied-- soap and shampoo, laundry detergent, dish detergent, paper towels, lysol wipes, windex, garbage bags, the list goes on. TV reception was superb and wifi worked just fine. Our host was terrific throughout - quick to respond, friendly and helpful. Needless to say, we will recommend this cabin to our friends and family. Five stars all the way. Thank you Scott!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A diamond in the rough! Extremely comfortable, clean, updated cabin. Well located near lots of trails but very well
Secluded for privacy. Loved it!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay. The best place we’ve stayed in Elkins. I’d highly recommend it.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just as described. We got several great hikes in around the area despite having full days of rain. The trees are transitioning and beautiful. The rain meant the trails were empty. Scott's tiny house was perfect to come back to so we could warm up and rest up for the next day. Great shower, clean, comfy. Kitchen had everything we needed. Propane BBQ got some use as well. Seamless check in and Scott was extremely responsive. Internet was a bit temperamental but that was a plus for me. My dogs didn't want to come back home and neither did I."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, would definitely go again."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay at the tiny house. To be honest, it really isn't that tiny. :)
Extremely clean, seamless check-in, great communication. It was a great location for my weekend adventures hiking in and around Elkins and Canaan Valley.
Tiny house is located in a campground, which was very quiet and in cell service (Verizon). Wifi was a bit slow at times, but worked well enough! House had everything I needed, including drip coffeemaker to provide critical fuel for hiking. :)
Would definitely stay again."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My daughter and I had a wonderful stay. Brian was great at communication and even left us some firewood.

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Brian was an excellent host providing a free set of fire wood for us to use! The house is adorable and a great place to stay in! We loved the chairs and bench in the back. Convenient location to get to ether Elkins or Blackwater Falls!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay! The house was very clean and had everything we needed. The kitchen was especially well-stocked. We enjoyed the proximity to hikes/attractions in the area (Chimney Top, Seneca Rocks, Blackwater Falls, Canaan Valley chairlift)."

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a great place. Very clean and well appointed. The cabin had everything you could need. Easy check-in. The owner was very attentive and truly cared about our experience. Private spot along the creek but not secluded. Will definitely return.

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great house and a great host! You're getting exactly what you see in the pictures; there are no surprises or misleading photos. The house was very clean. It's about a 5 minute drive to downtown Elkins and within 30ish minutes of a ton of great outdoorsy attractions: Seneca Rocks, National Forests, Canaan Valley, among many others. The campground was very quiet when we were staying there, and everyone we saw was very friendly. Having a fully functional kitchen was also really convenient for a tiny home. There's a nice creek/forest right behind the house. All in all a great trip and we would be happy to go back."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little getaway. A little farther than we expected from Blackwater Falls but it worked out. Close to many food options, Walmart, but far enough away in the campground to be quiet.
Very clean, well thought out, and we would totally come back if we need to be in the area."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful and clean. Quiet and peaceful. We had a wonderful overnight stay. Brian was very nice and helpful. Will definitely stay again and recommend.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Brian was a wonderful host. He was quick at responding and taking care of little things. The cabin is very cute and neat and clean. It is very apt for upto 4 people. It has all the things one would need for a comfortable stay. Would definitely recommend.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful quaint cabin nestled up to a creek in back. (Creek is dry right now due to no rain, not Brian’s fault). It was everything that was promised and more. Brian our host was attentive and full of information. We will be going back."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I can’t rave enough about how perfect this little cabin was. It was impeccably clean. Everything I needed was there. The location was fantastic - very peaceful but close to town. I’ll definitely stay again….already looking at dates of when I can go back!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Well appointed house. Just 3 minutes to local grocery store. Outdoor area is great to cookout on either the charcoal or gas grill. It is next to other travel trailers but still feels private. Would stay again.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent location and host. I will definitely return. Super happy to have discovered this spot!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin at Smoky Bottom Campground was a nice get away for the weekend. For a small space, it was well-decorated and and we loved the unique style inside. There was plenty of room. The bed was very comfortable, and we loved the rustic look of the shower. Lots of space for a couple or a small family. The fire pit out back made for relaxing and peaceful evenings. Definitely would stay again!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place was the perfect stay for a friends trip to West Virginia for a ski weekend. We got a lot of snow the day before our trip and Jason sent a message the morning we were arriving assuring us that the road had been plowed and that the path and porch had been shoveled, which was so nice! The place was very comfortable and clean and we enjoyed cooking a couple of big group meals in the large kitchen and hanging out around the big island. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook and bake.
The bedrooms were comfortable and we had fun having a big sleepover in the bunk bed room.
We loved the outdoor space as well and had a fire in the fire pit at night after a big day of skiing. It was incredibly peaceful standing out by the river, in the snow, around our fire, taking in the fresh air, watching the little ice flows drift by on the river.
We are already making plans to come back in warmer weather. We loved this place, and Jason was a very accommodating host!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"We were two families (4 adults, 4 teens) & 2 dogs staying at Jason's beautiful cabin right along the river. I can imagine this is also an awesome place to stay in the other seasons of the year, but what a beautiful setting to see the river with the falling snow.
We had a lovely stay and were really comfortable. The kitchen is super well-equipped and we love to cook - so that was an added bonus! Would 100% stay again & recommend."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was our third time staying at the cabin, and we love coming back every time! We spent Christmas here and are already planning our next trip here. Highly recommend for a remote getaway, with comfort amenities like WiFi, full kitchen, tv, hammocks on the deck, fire pits, and nature walks!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful place to stay! Jason was very easy to communicate with and was flexible with what we needed. The home was beautiful, with the wrap around deck and river being the highlight of the home to us! We definitely plan to come back and stay here again when we have more vacations in WV."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We visited for the Forest Festival and had an AMAZING time. The river view is fantastic! We hope to return in the summer, when we can enjoy the water. We felt at home and had everything we needed. Jason was very responsive and even had the house available for an early check-in!
Thank you Jason!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location right on Shavers Fork. Very private but not too far from Elkins where there’s plenty to do.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place for a cabin get away with a group . The cabin is modern and private . Jason was great at answering questions.
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,This is an amazing place to stay in West Virginia. We did not know a lot about the area but Jason has pretty much textbook instructions on how you can spend your time there for the weekend. The place is gorgeous and about 10 feet off the river. I will hopefully be coming back here when I get the time.
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Jason’s house is beautiful and unlike any we’ve been able to find in such a rural setting. The location and amenities are amazing! We especially enjoyed the great room, well apportioned kitchen, comfy sleeping areas, and the river right outside the door. We look forward to coming back and spending more time."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed here twice and will definitely be coming back some more. Wonderful place to stay with family or friends and enjoy the nature and the river! Couldn’t ask for a better get away location!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing. It’s really private and on a really sweet spot on the water. The house itself is super nice and Jason was a great host. I would definitely stay again.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great location - Beautiful Modern Cabin !
2022-10-01,4.0,Group trip,Great place to stay with amazing proximity to the river! Wonderful views all around. Great fire pit for fires each night and wood was provided so that was great! Very clean and had most pots and pans for cooking. I would highly recommend this place if you are in Elkins.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The bungalow was perfect for what I wanted for my family vacation. The river was little low but that is not preventable. My son and son-in-law caught well over 100 fish, mostly small mouth bass, and mostly by kayaking from upstream down to the bungalow and from the bungalow downstream. We all enjoyed the river and the activities.
The house was very clean, and perfect for our family.
Jason’s communications to us were quick. The check in, check out, and location instructions were “spot on” as were the tips he left us for using the river and property.
I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for some fishing and family time that is private but not far from other needs like dining, stores, and other outdoor activities."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is magic. Jason always answer all the questions quickly. We have a wonderful and fun weekend with our family. Thank you so much Jason for everything. This place have everything that you need to have a great vacations. I totally recommend it.
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Place was very secluded and perfectly located just off the river. If you’re looking for relaxation and a stay that feels like home, this is perfect. Enjoyed fishing, canoeing, and golfing over at Canaan valley. Would certainly stay again."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our weekend at the house. Very peaceful, clean, about 20 mins from town. My 2 year old loved being close to the water, and exploring around."
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"House is as described. Made use of fire pit but too cold for water activity; but nice to have the river right there. Elkins is a great town…easy to get to Seneca Rocks, High Falls Trail and Audra, so much to choose from. Visit Tip Top on 3rd Street, coffee is excellent and decor charming…pizza at Mama Mias was excellent."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location, very relaxing, took a couple naps on the porch with rapids in the background! Dog friendly, they loved swimming. Campfire creek side under the stars was awesome! Wish we could have stayed longer…Hope to come back so we can utilize canoes/kayaks!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place and excellent host!
2022-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Really fantastic house in a great location. We used it as a base of operations for a ski trip, would absolutely come back again during the summer to take advantage of the water."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Jason’s place is even better than the photos. Such a stunning river view and wonderful accommodations! There was a bit of snow during our stay and Jason even plowed the driveway for us. Can’t recommend enough!
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Beatiful house really close to the river. Everything was great.
I will say though that the direction should include a big red cattle gate you have to open and close to get to the driveway."
2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Great property within an easy drive of snowshoe
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was amazing! Perfect for a getaway in wild wonderful West Virginia.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful cabin, beautiful river, excellent host!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a top-quality airbnb destination. Beautiful house and perfect setting. Jason was extremely communicative and helped us have a great stay. We barely felt the need to ever leave the house. The river, deck, kayakers and bridges on the property were great to keep my family entertained.
My only critique, as someone who loves to cook, is the kitchen was a little disorganized kitchen. It certainly had everything you needed, just hard to find and some cooking implements weren't in the best condition. But hey its a cabin not the set of Iron Chef - so no real complaints."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Super secluded and right on the water. The water was low when we were there but it was still great to go sit in to cool off after hiking. The fire pit is also right on the water and that made evening fires even better. House was very clean. Kitchen is perfect for cooking. Tons of space.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family enjoyed this house by the water. If you love animals, this place is great. There is a hummingbird feeder with at least 5 active hummingbirds. The neighbor farmers cows came over onto the property to greet us twice. We saw deer in the yard. Tip: When the sun is setting, walk down to the water and left to the right. We saw deer crossing there each night. We also heard many coyotes in the distance and saw one on property twice. If you love the outdoors, this place is for you. The place was spacious and clean, we enjoyed the deck area multiple times each day. The water wasn't high enough to kayak in (First week in August) and the rocks on the bottom of the river were too slippery to walk/wade in the water. Please note that the kayak, tube and canoe usage is NOT included in the cost of the rental, it is an additional $75. You pay via the app and the code is sent to unlock the items. There was plenty of firewood and Jason was a great host. We had no problem and enjoyed every second there!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Love this property! The location is the perfect spot to get away and relax. We loved drinking our coffee in the morning, sitting on the porch, just listening to the river. The fire pit was so nice just to hangout by in the evenings. The home was very clean! ( I’m kind of OCD when it comes to rentals and cleanliness ). Jason was so easy to get in contact with if anything came up or if we had any questions. He has some fun small trails around his property that we enjoyed exploring. The weather was perfect for kayaking and playing on the river. It has a great open concept kitchen which made cooking family dinner enjoyable. Highly recommend this rental!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Property was amazing and exactly what we were looking for.Jason gave great directions to house and was great at answering any questions we had. We weren’t able to enjoy the river because of the temperature. Might have to come back in the summer.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place for a mountain vacation. If you’re looking for a place to relax,enjoy the river and explore...this is a great place. House has everything you need and more, making for a great place to stay. We had two families and dogs and everyone had a great time. Definitively recommended this house!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful cabin, steps away from water. Extremely clean, allergen free, and perfect for our family of four plus two dogs. Very nice kitchen. We didn't see anyone the whole time except for the neighbor cows!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic time here! We did a quick 3 day trip, but enjoyed it so much! Having the river right out front was amazing, you can't beat laying in the hammock and listening to the water. Jason was super quick to respond throughout the entire trip! We are looking to come back in the summer and enjoy a longer trip! PS we brought our dogs, and brought a little doggy gate and just blocked off the wrap around porch so they could roam there without us having to worry about them running off anywhere, and they could still see us while we hung out in the bottom fire pit next to the river, totally recommend to anyone looking for a nice secluded place in nature, but its only 20 min away from a walmart for all your necessities!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Fantastic location! Was a peaceful weekend getaway right on the water and near great hiking. Highly recommend.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Jason was in constant communication with us and was super quick with responses. He Helped us out so many times throughout the weekend!! The house was super clean and even better than described. Our family had an amazing time and we were able to enjoy the West Virginia winter in complete comfort. We can’t wait to return during the summer and have some more fun!!
2021-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful house located right on a river. Great weekend retreat from the city life. Would highly recommend to anyone.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an amazing place. Even the drive up to the house is spectacular. Our stay was shortly after (and even during) a snowstorm, and the setting was great. Definitely a place to visit year-round! The host was super responsive and the place definitely exceeded our expectations!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Great stay beautiful space tranquil location right in almost heaven

2021-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Jason was an amazing host. His house & property were beautiful, clean, & made for an awesome trip with fun memories. I frequently communicated with him, & he always responded quickly & respectfully. He was very generous & helpful. I highly recommend using this location to make fun family & friend memories. We would absolutely come back. Thank you Jason!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"beautiful scenery, relaxing and clean place to have a winter getaway. thanks!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the cabin and Jason provided everything you could ask for in a weekend stay. He has cornhole boards and a few other games, camping chairs you can take down by the fire pit, and logs already cut for you to build a fire. The view of the crystal clear river in the morning was incredible. We definitely recommend and would love to come back!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The perfect secluded getaway by the river with fun bridges to play on. House was modern and clean.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is an exceptional location and a great house. I can't recommend it enough. Jason has everything ready for you to enjoy this special house on the river. We really enjoyed fishing and kayaking.
2020-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a nice time here! Jason was very helpful and quick to respond to messages. The view of the river is wonderful, right off the back deck. Great kitchen too!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is modern, well-designed, and lovely. Big windows so you can see outside and a great porch overlooking the river. And the bridges are pretty cool too. Jason was a great host and quick to respond to any questions."
2020-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"The location is stunning, right on the river, in the middle of the woods, and in an area where shooting stars may as well be guaranteed. The house itself has all the essentials and was great. Aside from some spotty WiFi (which is expected in this area), we were extremely satisfied with our stay here, and the fact that it was peak fall foliage weekend made it all the better. Thank you for a great stay!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, relaxing, and clean. Very well maintained."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We couldn’t have selected a better place to spend a week with our family in WV. You will never run out of things to do & not do ;) . Easily accommodates two families and great layout.
2020-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Fantastic! Great setting to relax and get away from it all. Very private setting. GPS will get you very close to the house but follow Jason's direction to get you the last couple of hundred yards down a private driveway. I look forward to staying there again.
2020-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Really enjoyed our stay, very private beautiful location that was tricky to find at night but Jason’s directions made it doable. Kayaking down the river is a must and the hiking in the area is great as well!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place, exactly as described. Would definitely recommend."
2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Quiet and quaint, this beautiful bungalow is exactly the break you need from the craziness and chaos of life! Well appointed, clean and contemporary, this home is the perfect combination of rustic chic - marrying the amenities of modern day living with the enjoyable back-to-basics sounds and sights of nature."
2020-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"This house is beautiful! Right on the river. The option to rent the kayaks and floats was super convenient. We put the floats in the river at Stuart Recreation Center and floated down the river to the house - took about an hour, but the river was high and moving quickly. It probably would have taken longer without the rain storms the days before. Would definitely rent again!"
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful location along the river with great outdoor amenities. Not far from Elkins, but you feel very secluded. Jason was quick to respond to our questions and was a welcoming host."
2020-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Excellent cabin with perfect amenities to unplug yourself from the rest of the world!
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The cabin is modern with all the amenities you could need. It is super clean and at a beautiful location!
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really a magical kind of spot where what you see in the pictures is exactly what you get. If you want a stylish, comfortable, pleasant little spot out on a river in the middle of absolute nowhere with ridiculous levels of privacy this is the spot. For my party, that was everything we were looking for and more."
2019-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Jason's place is heavenly, and very relaxing. Prepare for a weekend of solitude and peace."
2019-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Jason’s place was perfect for our relaxing family vacation. We spent most of our time on the beautiful deck watching the river, playing cards, and gazing at the most stars we had ever seen! The kitchen had everything we needed to prepare meals and when we didn’t feel like cooking we were just a quick drive away from delicious local restaurants. We miss the serene location already and hope we get the chance to visit again!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Jason’s place is gorgeous, spacious, relaxing, and fun. We enjoyed the table on the front porch, the fire pit, playing in the picturesque clear river, hanging out on the big sofas in the living room, and cooking in the well equipped kitchen. Jason was friendly and answered my questions before we arrived very quickly. While the river was too low this trip to use the kayaks and inter tubes, we look forward to a float trip next time! My eight person family group made a lot of memories here. Thank you, Jason!!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a wonderful place, a rare gem! We will definitely go back- house is gorgeous, scenery serene- haven’t had such a relaxing getaway in a very long time. Highly recommend."
2019-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house is very nice. Having access to all the extra spices and the fully outfitted kitchen was a plus. The kitchen is able to prepare pretty much any meal you desire, all you have to do is bring the ingredients. The big sectional couch in the great room is very comfortable. We enjoyed being able to sit on the porch and listen to the river and being able to have music through the outside speakers as well.
The kayaks were fun to get out on and put around on the river. If you are looking to have a vacation away from all the hustle and bustle of life, and still have some creature comforts... This is the place."
2019-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"If you want peace and quiet with friends this is the place! Thank you so much for everything Jason, we loved every second of our trip!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Place is comfortable, clean, and beautiful."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jason's Place was beautiful inside and out. We enjoyed our stay very much.
2019-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"I regularly do airbnb and I must this was one of the best houses I stayed in. The best word to describe the house is that is modern. The kitchen was amazing, the patio. Additionally we were able to use Jason’s water gear without any trouble. Its a very well maintained house and our group had a lot of fun. Thank you Jason for having us."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jason’s place is amazing. The place was super clean, well stocked with all the essentials plus extras like coffee and condiments. Not to mention it was just beautiful and in the most beautiful surroundings. Jason was also very quick to respond and went above and beyond when we had a special request. I would highly recommend his place and can’t wait to come back."
2019-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Loved the stay in this river house!! Our group of 10 had a great time!
2019-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"If you are looking for a private, peaceful, well appointed and CLEAN place to make some memories, check out Bailey’s Bungalow! Our small family gathered for a bday/Mother’s Day celebration on the river and despite rain, a good time was had by all. We love to cook and teach about healthy eating, so the amazingly well appointed kitchen complete with small wares, equipment, spices and cleaning supplies, made cooking for the fam a joy! The ring game on the porch overlooking the rushing river was also a favorite. Jason was VERY responsive, replying almost instantly to our questions. We plan to book again next year."
2019-04-01,5.0,Group trip,We spent a relaxing Easter weekend with family here that was enjoyed by adults and kids like. The house is in great condition and amenities and surroundings are as described. The kayaks/canoe/tubes make a nice addition. Jason was both responsive to questions and accommodating to a late request. A great get away that we’ll recommend to others.
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are staying in the area this place should definitely be your number one choice. The house, location, view, and amenities are excellent and Jason responds to any questions promptly."
2019-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Do stay! The photos don't do this bungalow justice! Jason is an amazing host, very responsive and also has included everything from things you might expect like blankets, to playing cards and even kitchen scissors. We will definitely return."
2019-01-01,5.0,Group trip,This place is a gem! Jason was also very helpful every step of the way. We had 8 people stay comfortably and we enjoyed the property very much. It is a great place to stay when you want to get away. We did one day of skiing at Snowshoe and otherwise explored the area. Thanks Jason!
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Bob was an amazing host! We absolutely loved the cabin and will definitely be back again!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My buddies and I did a motorcycle trip to West Virginia from Washington DC and we had a great time at Bobs bed and breakfast. The place felt very secluded and peaceful, tucked away at the bottom of the hill by the river. You have to drive on gravel road for about 10 mins before reaching the b&b. I’m looking forward to coming back sometime in future."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place is truly a getaway! The scenery is to die for! Bob was an amazing host! There was nothing we would change except for how much time we were there! We are doing a weekend road trip but would have much rather just stayed there! Our new bnb is so loud and not pretty we just want to go back. Make all your last min calls with in 15 min of getting there then put everything away and you will relish an escape from the urban world.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Bob and his wife were great hosts! Very friendly and hospitable. (Even made wonderful fresh, homemade strawberry, watermelon lemonade and had fresh fruit waiting in the fridge!) The cabin and location were stunning, even better than pictured. Will be renting here anytime we’re in the area."
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Sweet Annie was a great spot for our family to gather for the weekend. Beds were super comfy and loved the outside space.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Sweet Annie’s is a lovely and cozy home with plenty of space for two families. The beds were comfortable, shower was always hot, and the kitchen had all the amenities for a quick meal. John was always responsive to our messages. We had a lovely stay and the kids enjoyed the house as well."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,John and Ann’s place was great! We were able to visit with family and felt right at home. They were also flexible on the check out time!
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"This rental was so perfect!! With John and Ann’s permission, we hosted a small baby shower here and it was the perfect location and layout. The house was already decorated sweetly for fall which left little to do on my part - which was a welcome relief after traveling so far to host! The house was large, clean, and private. We will definitely be staying here again. The photos don’t do it justice."
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Great location for the train excursion. Had a great time.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always nice to stay at Sweet Annie’s for D&E functions. Great location and wonderful host!

2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,We have stayed at Sweet Annie’s several times. John and Ann are friendly and responsive hosts. The apartment is always immaculate. It has become our home away from home whenever we visit Elkins.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very spacious and comfortable. Elegant bathrooms. Everything you’ll need on a trip. Would gladly stay there again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Far exceeded our expectations from the listing to the actual house. Beautiful setting with a peaceful backyard and everything you need to feel at home. Walkable to not only the campus nearby but the town itself. John and Ann were responsive and kind and were really available if need be. The house itself is a very neat and peaceful place with a great set up for family time. We really didn't venture out much because it had everything we needed. Great place to stay and hopefully we'll visit again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Great house for a large family needing housing in Elkins. Thanks for a great stay!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Myself & my bridal party stayed here the night before my wedding. It was easy to find, very spacious, and that made it easy to have fun and relax that evening. John and Ann have a lovely place to stay and I would recommend it to anyone. It’s a great place for a large group of people in the middle of Elkins."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Sweet Annie's was a lovely home to rent! Very spacious, clean, and close to town. John and Ann were very responsive and helpful during our stay - with great local recommendations for dinner and shopping, in addition to helping with technical questions."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"John and Ann’s Airbnb was the perfect place for our family’s Elkins stay. Love the spacious home and vaulted ceilings and large windows, true mid century design. Location peaceful but walkable to downtown, the park and D&E. They were very responsive and made sure we had everything we need. Pretty obvious why they have such excellent reviews. We absolutely recommend staying here!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second time we have stayed at Sweet Annie's. The house was clean, quiet, and cozy warm. (That was a spectacular feat given it had been -8 degrees the day before and many people in the neighborhood had trouble keeping their places warm.) We were able to walk to 3 different relatives' places, YMCA, Walgreens, restaurants and CVS, as well as Kroger's and other businesses. Due to some scary wintry weather our travel got delayed and John and Ann were kind enough to allow us to move our reservation. They did NOT have to do that. At one point John was talking about another situation in which he'd done something nice for a client/renter and he said, ""It's not all about the money."" These Superhosts are clearly kind people with their hearts in the right place-- and a great place to rent as well!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Sweet Annie was absolutely perfect for our family. The interior is fully remodeled and was very welcoming and we had everything necessary to make our stay comfortable. John and Ann made sure we had everything we needed and checked in several times. Sweet Annie is in a great location in town so we were able to walk to all the festivities. I would highly recommend.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a sweet place to stay. One of these time I going to stay when I can also utilize the nice backyard and barbecue!

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place. We had 4 adults and 3 kids and we still had room to spare. John and Ann checked in on us frequently to make sure we had everything we needed. Also the house is central to the town so we took family walks to everything.
2022-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place with exceptional room. Clean bathrooms with rainfall showers and adjustable heat with numerical values on the separate valve (very nice).
very spacious living room where we spent the most time.
Great place and easy check-in. Right near a great restaurant a block away. highly recommend it (Vintage)."
2022-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Sweet Annie is a sweet spot, conveniently located in Elkins and the surrounding area. The house was so spacious and very clean! All the essentials are provided, plus extra thoughtful touches to make your stay comfortable. John and Ann are very responsive and made great recommendations, so we could make the most of our trip. We would absolutely come back and bring friends with us!"

2022-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Wonderful host, Wonderful property!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"John and Ann truly are Superhosts! They were immediately available for questions and answers, but let us have a COVID-safe, personal airspace for our household while we did our masked visits with family elsewhere. The house is an easy walk to trails, grocery, pharmacy, and a YMCA with a pool, weight room, etc. There is plenty of space for very thing in this house, the photos don’t do it justice!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Everything was perfect and we enjoyed the comfort of the home. They were very hospitable and allowed us time to check in early and late, it was very accommodating and very much appreciated during our time of need ( funeral memorial). Hope to stay again sometime."

Value was great!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved it! John and Ann are fabulous hosts. The place was really clean and no review of this place would be complete without saying how big it is. From the outside, you see the three units together and think it will be small but then you go inside and there is so much space! It's nice to be able to walk to restaurants."
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,House and location were great. House and backyard was more spacious than I thought. Great proximate to downtown and walking distance to most things. Highly recommend.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an amazing place to stay. The rooms are well furnished and large enough for guests and their stuff. There’s a wonderful private, outdoor deck and seating area and a side yard where we could play yard games. We had everything we needed and were very comfortable. John and Ann have done an excellent job of providing separate outdoor space for each unit. We will visit the Elkins area again and will stay here if it’s available."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"""Sweet Annie"" is a fantastic rental! We took my wheelchair-bound father to Elkins to visit family and the house worked perfectly for us. It's all one floor and very spacious. Everything is well-kept and super clean, and it's stocked with anything you could need on a vacation. It's also in a great part of town and John & Ann made everything simple and easy. We hadn't visited family in about five years because staying in a hotel can be uncomfortable, but after staying at ""Sweet Annie"" we're already thinking about out next visit to Elkins! We'll definitely book again."
2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Terrific home. Deceptively large compared to view from the exterior. Gathering areas are very spacious. The bedroom areas can be closed off from the social areas, which worked well for our party of 6 with different sleep patterns. Clean, comfortable, well kept, and well appointed. Definitely recommend."
2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Wonderful stay - loved it!!
2021-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"John and Ann are fantastic hosts and super friendly! We had a slight medical emergency and their recommendation to an Urgent Care facility was spot on!
Their place is really clean and big. It is located really close to a Kroger grocery store as well so picking up groceries was very convenient. They have lots of dishes/cups and cookware . The location is great as it was very close to some beautiful hiking places within a 30 minute drive. Definitely recommend this place for a stay!!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Sweet Annie was the perfect cozy home for our family’s long weekend in Elkins. The house is extremely clean and comfortable and located right in the heart of Elkins. John and Ann are excellent hosts, very easy to communicate with. We’ll definitely be back!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"John and Ann’s home is outstanding! My mother, brother, and I rented it for the weekend to facilitate a family visit with our clan in Elkins. The home is more than spacious. Wonderful for little kids, too. Anyone with accessibility needs - Daniel is wheelchair bound and we made it work. All one level and the kitchen and laundry are plentiful. Definitely recommend!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a great place to stay, especially for larger families. We skied at Timberline and Canaan and it was a great place to come back to. Very clean, well kept up, and very roomy for our group of 8. My adult boys said it was like entering another dimension because it looks kind of small from the outside but was quite big on the inside. It has a nice yard and deck as well, but we didn't take advantage of the outdoor area since our visit was in February. We will definitely book again for our next ski trip out that way. The hosts were also very responsive and helpful. Made us feel at home!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sweet Annie is spacious and centrally located to downtown Elkins. We could walk to different restaurants. The space is bright with gorgeous windows.

2020-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a group of six at Sweet Annie and enjoyed having plenty of space.

It was sparkling clean & easy to get to from both church & the reception place.. John & Mary

2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Anne and John were great- communication was very responsive and the checkin process was seamless. The house is very spacious! We were 2 families - the master has an open walk in closet area that was perfect for a travel crib. And with so many bedrooms we had plenty of space for everyone to sleep comfortably!
2019-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place truly exceeded my expectations. John and Ann have the place set up perfectly for a group to hang out. Two tables perfect for cards or games, a great dining table where we all enjoyed our breakfast together and a cozy couch space. I especially liked that there was a dividing door between the common spaces and the bedrooms so that those who went to bed early weren't disturbed by the rest of us who stayed up into the wee hours playing board games. Pro-tip, if you want to use the TV, you might consider bringing an DVI or HDMI cable to connect a computer to it if you wanted more than cable!"
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"John and Ann's place was wonderful. It was spacious and comfortable. There was ample seating for relaxing and eating and lots of linens and towels. The showers were excellent and bathrooms had heaters to warm you. Conveniently located near historic downtown and within walking distance of nice restaurants. Wifi worked beautifully. Lots of special, thoughtful touches (dryer sheets, spices,etc). Well stocked kitchen. We loved the Christmas decorations, especially the snowman tree. Hosts were kind and communication was clear and easy!"

Our group of seven loved their place and would stay again in a heartbeat! Really kind hosts:)"
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"great location, great space, you will love your stay here"
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"I don’t want to be that guy, but I was displeased with my stay simply because this Airbnb wasn’t up to my standards. The king bed was in a room that could only be accessed by going outside and up some stairs. The WiFi was available but didn’t work well, I couldn’t watch Netflix or even use my phone. There was a dog in the neighborhood that barked throughout the night and the bathroom didn’t seem as clean as I would like and the water had a funky smell to it.
If you’re going with the intentions of disconnecting and being in a cabin this Airbnb would be great. But I was in West Virginia for a wedding and this Airbnb did not suite my needs."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Carl is an absolute amazing host! I absolutely will be renting this every year from here on out if he’ll let us!! The place was exactly like the photos, he had clear directions on things to do and things they offered! The river was BEAUTIFUL and I love how you can hear the river from the porch and even inside! Carl and I had amazing communication from the time of booking until we left! 10000% would recommend !!!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really lovely Airbnb. New and fresh all around. Excellent use of space. Exceptionally clean. Host was responsive and helpful. Would stay again
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Blue Door Escape was a great home away from home while I stayed in Elkins for a 4-month work assignment. It had most everything I needed, and if something was missing, Rachel went out and got it. There was one issue with the water while I was there, and Rachel remedied it immediately and more than made up for the inconvenience. Blue door is walkable to everything you might want to check out downtown, D&E college, and two local parks. Elkins is an awesome little town and is a great base for many types of outdoor adventures on the Monongahela National Forest, Blackwater Falls State Park, Canaan Valley National Wildlife Refuge, three ski areas, and more. While I was staying there, several new Elkins businesses opened, adding to the food and drink scene. Make sure to check out live music every Friday at El Gran Sabor- it’s different every week and consistently excellent. A great place to stay with a very responsive host!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I want to take Rachel’s place and transport it to my daughter’s future town for graduate school. loved everything. fabulous mother/daughter getaway. We were so comfy that we didn’t want to leave. Rachel has a gift for detail. even better than the pictures. You won’t be disappointed.
about 40 minutes from Thomas & Davis. both towns very pretty in the snow and every person we met was super friendly. lots to do if you love being outdoors.
Book it. You’ll love it."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife, kids, and I have stayed at many airbnbs among the four of us for work and leisure from New York to Puerto Rico and out to Arizona and this was one of the best. The space was clean, comfortable, efficient, and well designed. It felt very homey and made the perfect base of operations for our visit to Elkins and the surrounding area. When we go back to Elkins in the future, we will look to see if this Airbnb is available as it would be our first choice for accommodation. Five stars!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,wonderful usual to be Rachel's guest

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I've stayed at many Airbnb's over the last few years, and in terms of cleanliness and attention to detail, this property is at or near the top. The owners have thought out so many little details it's hard to list them all. In no particular order and off the top of my head: chalkboard with all sorts of instructions and recommendations, welcome packet with some snacks and waters, super comfortable memory foam beds with awesome pillows, white noise makers by each bed, room darkening curtains, nice towels, full coffee bar, kitchen well arranged with everything easy to find, soaps and body wash, etc. I think you get the drift. Can't say enough about the thought put into the space.
All in all, the experience was great from beginning to end. House, price, communication, location to Elkins and surrounding area, check in, check out - all great.
I'd 100% stay at this property again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Rachel'splace is always a treat! very comfy and clean. Rachel is so responsive and helpful
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"BlueDoor Escape is a gem of a find in Elkins. Convenient location to downtown Elkins and local grocery shopping. Newly remodeled. Clean, clutter-free, and nicely decorated. The calming contemporary interior was even more appealing than the pictures. Rachel welcomed me from the start with clear and efficient communication. Love the recommendations for places to visit in town (coffee shop, brewery, shopping, etc), plus a list of emergency contacts posted just inside the door. Clear list of house rules, too. The kitchen was well-stocked with welcoming touches. I'll gladly sign up to stay at the BlueDoor the next time I'm in Elkins. Highly recommend this location."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is phenomenal and is as described. Rachel is quick to respond to any inquiries and I am looking forward to staying here again!!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Rachel's place was exactly what we were looking for! We normally stay in a hotel when visiting Elkins, but that will change now that we have discovered this gem. The apartment was exactly as pictured and fully equipped with everything you need, plus some special touches that made us feel so welcome. the location is quiet and not busy, but close enough to have the main drag a couple of blocks over. The place was also comfortable and sparkling clean, and Rachel was always responsive to any questions. We hope to stay here again on our next visit!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A gem in Elkins with a clean, modern vibe and attention paid to every detail. Fully stocked with everything you could possibly need: Keurig with pods, French press, dishes, pans, utensils, noise machine in bedrooms, luxurious white towels, makeup wipes, hair dryer, the list goes on and on. Beds are very comfortable with many pillows. Easy entry with a unique entry code for each guest. A great stay. Highly recommend!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. Many thoughtful touches. Very clean. Love that Rachel uses a unique entry code for the locks. Basic security but so few do this.
Will be my first choice in Elkins moving forward."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Blue Door was clean, comfortable and within walking distance of nearly everything Elkins offers. It was also central to all the natural attractions. Great property and great location and Rachel was a fantastic host!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were two Happy Ohioans whose roots are in WV!
We had not been back in several years since all our relatives have passed. So in a way , coming to stay at Rachel’s, instead of a hotel, made us feel we were back home at Grandma's house.
We promised to be back next year!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean , convenient and alot of little extras. surprisingly quiet given its location."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is an absolute gem! I truly don’t think the photos do Rachel’s place justice. It is spacious - we had a little one crawling around the living room with plenty of space to play - and we loved all of the details (decor and “extras” to make things feel like home). There are full length mirrors in the bedrooms, great lighting in the bathroom for getting ready for whatever you’re in town for, sound machines by the beds for white noise, a comfortable recliner, and literally everything you need in the kitchen for a great short or long stay. We loved this place! The beds were comfortable and the place is cozy and quiet. It’s walking distance from many of Elkins’s restaurants and stores. We enjoyed Rachel’s recommendations and would absolutely stay in her place again when we’re in the area!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was our 2nd stay at the Blue Door Escape and it did not disappoint. We were in town again for a goat show.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rachel and Lisa (her mom) was so helpful with my elderly parents in helping them with navigating their first AirB&B. They helped them find the place, was so hospitable in meeting them and answering all their questions. They loved it so well they want to stay there each time they travel to Elkins. It was truly a home-away-from-home experience! Above and over the top helpfulness, friendliness and amenities! Thank you ladies!!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house is wonderful and very comfortable. We had a great stay. We would highly recommend this house to anyone staying in Elkins.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The blue door escape b&b was absolutely beautiful. We had a great time, Everything was clean, and Rachel had gone above and beyond with all the little added extras to make our stay a great one.
Would definitely recommend to family and friends. We will definitely be booking with Rachel again."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rachel's place is absolutely beautiful. Everything is clean, cozy and comfortable. The decor is lovely. All the throws and linens all so cozy. I was in town visiting friends and this gave me a great little spot to come home and read, listen to music and relax in the early morning and final hour of the day. I was greeted with a generous table of snacks when I arrived and she gave great recommendations on nearby spots in town. I wish I had come in a night earlier and perhaps worked remotely that Friday so I could have enjoyed the space and got an even easier start to the weekend. I hope to stay here again the next time I visit."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place. Friendly owner and quick at responding. Highly recommend!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Blue Door Escape was a charming downtown apartment. Rachel was a great hostess and was always responsive when we had questions.

We look forward to our stay again at the end of the month."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent host!! The apartment was beautifully furnished, clean, and well stocked with necessary items — as well as some complimentary goodies.
She responded quickly when I accidentally locked myself out (!!) on my first day there.
She was a real lifesaver and I’m forever grateful that we found this airbnb!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and very comfortable surroundings. The unit is tastefully decorated with all needed amenities. Plenty of space to move around inside for a 2-bedroom unit. For longer stays the washer and dryer are an added bonus. It was a great stay and first Airbnb experience for my 83 year old mother. The Elkins area is WV charm at its best.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was great. We enjoyed the visit and feel Rachel went above and beyond our expectations. Will stay again the next time we are hiking/climbing in the area!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay in Elkins. We came to the area to do some hiking in the Monongahela National Forest and it was only about an hour drive from the Airbnb. Not only is it a beautiful town surrounded by mountains but it also had a lot of fun things to do in town with great food and coffee shops within walking distance and a great brewery right across the street. The place was very clean, relaxing and felt like home! Highly recommend staying here! We loved every minute."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice accommodations with quaint exterior & fresh interior.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This space was wonderful for a quiet trip away. It’s located not far from town and lies in a beautiful location alongside the River. The space is large for what is advertised and there is an additional room that gives view of the street and river. The bed is very soft and the place is just overall very clean. I will absolutely look to stay at this place again when I find my way traveling in Elkins again.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Clean, quiet and rustic area"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a lovely stay in Elkins! It was a beautiful area and the room made the stay feel like being a part of the town.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time staying here while on family vacation. It was the perfect size for us and in a good location for everything we wanted to do. Austin and Hannah were very responsive and great hosts. Would recommend staying here if you want to be close to the Elkins, Seneca Rocks and Blackwater Falls areas."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was nice and tidy. Beautiful location. The owners were great to communicate with and we had no issues coming and going.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We reserved our stay the same day. Austin and Hannah were extremely responsive and super flexible due to our short notice. When we arrived, everything was absolutely spotless. There were multiple books on different restaurants and things to do around the area. Kitchen was restocked soap was refilled. They even provided shampoo, conditioner and body wash if needed in the shower. Linens were extremely clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. We loved our stay."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Remote, quiet area with a lovely drive into town. Only the sounds of the river and the occasional cars driving by, mostly in the mornings. Cozy cabin with many spaces for relaxing and reading. If you're looking for isolation, this is a good place for a Get Away From It All."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay for a week long get away
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The cabin was just what we needed as we were in town for the holidays to visit family. The king bed was very comfortable and there was plenty of hot water for showers. Everything was clean and all the appliances that we used worked perfectly. Our two big doodles felt right at home and had plenty of floor space to relax as well. We enjoyed everything from having coffee (which was provided) in the morning to winding down with a movie at night. We received check-in and check-out information in a timely manner. We will definitely stay here again.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My kids and I enjoyed our stay at this location. We came in at night, so we were surprised with a beautiful view in the morning. I loved that the place was child and pet friendly. There were games to help keep the kids entertained, so that was very thoughtful. I booked this place for a Thanksgiving break getaway. We were still able to go grocery shopping and prepare our home cooked Thanksgiving meal with the provided kitchen cookware and utensils. I appreciated the brochures for the local things to do. That will help with our return trip. We look forward to returning and exploring more of West Virginia. Thank you for hosting me and my family. It was a very memorable trip, and Elkins is such a lovely place."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great cabin for a weekend getaway. Right on the river. Beautiful scenery and plenty of hiking and fishing near by.
Very cozy place. Fit me, my wife, and dog perfectly. Comfortable bed. Smart TV and good wifi.
I'd definitely book here again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is the second time we stayed here. Previous review in early August 2023. We loved the setting on Shavers Fork and the convenience of Elkins and the Mon Forest within a few minutes drive. Austin and Hannah continued to be A+ hosts - quick responses, proactive information, etc. The WIFI has been upgraded and it is now excellent (running two computers and a TV at the same time!) New recommendation of place to go: hike to High Falls, it's a bit of a hike, but well worth it. We'd stay here again. 5 stars isn't enough... this place and these hosts are 10/10!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,great place that is nice and quiet.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our time there. Great location if you like to fish. The river is just steps away with great fishing spots.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay here. We were here for 6 nights, and it felt like home immediately (even for our cat). Easy access through a key pad lock; premises clean; nicely furnished (and comfortable, which is a BIG plus); plenty of kitchen 'stuff' and other supplies. Hosts were very responsive and very friendly to our questions; and even arranged for a replacement of the one missing amenity (a hair dryer - LOL) immediately. The view of Shavers Fork was outstanding. We had our morning coffee and afternoon wine on the lovely deck that was right on the Shavers Fork. Our wonderful Mon Forest was only minutes away (Stewart Recreation Area is literally across the Shavers from the place) and the Forest Road drives were lovely! Restaurants: we went to, enjoyed, and recommend Beanders, CJ Maggies, and OF COURSE El Gran Saber (DO NOT miss this one). Breakfast at Scottie's of Elkins is iconic diner; and coffee/pastries at Tip Top are outstanding. 10/10 recommend hosts, place, Elkins, would stay again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was very clean and neat. The bed was comfortable. Hannah and Austin were responsive to any questions almost immediately. The view of the river from the deck was peaceful. The lightning bug show in the evening was quite pleasant. We will definitely stay here again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I ABNB 4-6 weeks per year in various places. This was the cleanest unit I've ever entered. Austin was really responsive to any question and local advice. Unit is very cute, super roomy for a studio style suite. The river front location was great. Clean, responsive and just plain nice!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A great time
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,I was extremely pleased with my stay at their cabin on the Forks of Cheat River.
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I (and our dog) spur of the moment booked this Airbnb to stay at and explore local attractions. The Airbnb was exactly as pictured and provided everything you’d need for a stay. However, the deck pictured was not at all private, it was shared with other cabins. It wasn’t clearly stated in the description so I want everyone to be aware of that. Beyond that, I know this is listed as pet friendly (and we did take our non-shedding dog) but there was pet hair on the carpet and some of the blankets. It was very clean otherwise, but this may be a drawback for those with pet allergies. Also, it is listed as “step-free” but there were steps to get in to the Airbnb and also steps within to get to lower-level rooms (one with couch and another few steps to get to reading nook). Otherwise, this was a super quaint little place close to all to explore in Elkins and surrounding areas. Overall, hosts were very prompt to answer and we had a really relaxing time! Cute little place to stay!"

It’s back a little driveway in the woods. Super quiet, peaceful place.

The cottage is fully equipped with absolutely everything and anything you would ever need. In fact we have never stayed in an airbnb so well equipped!

Thanks Ron and Jan for everything!!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,First I'd like to say thank you Jan for your helpful communication and the cleanliness of your space. It was exactly what I was looking for. The space was small but felt very cozy at the same time.

With that being said I'd definitely consider staying again if I was in the area
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jan's cottage is a fabulous getaway for those who like privacy, quiet, a nice clean house all to ourselves, and local to a charming part of West Virginia. There were also a number of nice upgrades. This was our second visit and we hope visit again soon!"

It was so peaceful! right in the woods off a dirt road lies this cozy home that has a yard with a fire pit and surrounded with woods. Jan was a great host. The place was clean, plenty of amenities. Jan also had pepperoni rolls sitting on the table for us (delicious) along with the back-story of the West Virginia pepperoni roll on the fridge so that alone had me sold on staying there haha. Audra State Park is close and is a good hiking spot, and Hometown Pizza is a couple minutes down the road and has excellent food. Overall, 10/10 experience for us!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful secluded cabin, great place to just get away from everything. convenient to several larger towns and shopping. definitely bring a 4 wheel drive to traverse the driveway. plenty of wildlife as well. will definitely be back."

The house located in a picturesque area, no people around the house this is what we need after crowded Brooklyn.. The house is equipped with everything you need, clean rooms and cozy living room. Our sons especially enjoyed roasting marshmallows on a fire. I strongly recommend this home for other people! It's really magical place! Thanks, Jan, for your rest👋"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very clean and private location, with plenty of space, fully furnished (including full kitchen, laundry, etc.) and at an affordable price. My only hesitation (thus 4 starts instead of 5 for location) is that the driveway was a bit of a challenge, even for our SUV. It is unpaved with small stones and a few potholes. We learned to steer around them, and so it ended up fine, although perhaps they could be filled with some additional stones. Otherwise, this was great and we would certain go there again."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,The whole process was a piece of cake and it exceeded my expectations.

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was exactly as described and even better with a welcome note and snacks including some amazing pepperoni rolls! Jan’s instructions were perfect and the self check-in was a breeze with info provided with the code to the key lockbox by the back door.
The place was more than enough space for a couple and could absolutely accommodate a family. The queen bed was comfortable and there were plenty of extra blankets and really anything we’d need - paper products, shampoo/conditioner, plenty of towels, and a kitchen with pots, pans, and cooking implements. The bathroom with shower was good, and the note that mentioned low water flow was barely noticeable unless running the washing machine at the same time as using the sink or shower. We appreciated all the info, enjoyed our stay, and definitely felt that the listing accurately described the place and what to expect."

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place! Highly recommend!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jan is a great host, going above and beyond providing snacks as well as homemade pepperoni rolls.
The house is clean and well-maintained and it’s truly secluded. If you have a vehicle with ground clearance you’ll have no problem getting there.
The back deck is a great place to relax, getting shade for a good part of the day.
We plan to return, as we enjoyed our stay!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay! Everything was clean, organized, and the little touches like conditioner in the bathroom and snacks on the table came in great handy after a trip with kids and forgetting my conditioner and having kids looking for food right out of the car. We will definitely be back! It’s off the beaten path but easy to find, quiet, and peaceful. Definitely recommend!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice get away from everyday life
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a great find! A super value and just a great out of the way place to take the family.We only stayed the one night but wish we had stayed longer.Jan left us some fruit and what appeared to be homemade pepperoni pockets which was very thoughtful! We will definitely make a point of going back next time we’re passing through!!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly what we was looking for! Beautiful, peaceful, quiet weekend escape we needed! Thank you Andi and Billy for sharing your beautiful cottage with us! We will definitely be returning!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a great time! Would definitely stay again. Being on the river was very peaceful and our dog absolutely loved the water!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Second time staying at this cabin and it’s always hard to leave. It’s such a nice cabin that sits right on the shaves fork river which is a beautiful crystal clear water. I love staying at this cabin and plan on coming back in the future!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Riverside Retreat is a no frills cabin that is cozy and clean with a comfortable bed and gorgeous view of Shavers Fork. The river is serene directly behind the house, but breaks to go around an island ~100 feet downstream, which causes small rapids on one side, so you always hear the river from the deck. There's also a small stream in the backyard that feeds the river with a couple of tiny waterfalls.
Elkins is a cool little town, and history buffs will get a kick out of Beverly, which is only a few miles away and has substantial historical significance. West Virginia is a beautiful place and this area around the Tygart River Valley certainly shows that.
Andi and Billy are accommodating and helpful. We really enjoyed our stay here."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Had a great stay next to the river. The place was nice, clean, and a great location to explore the area. Would stay again and float the river in the summer!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved Andi and Billy’s cabin. The view of the deck of the river is absolutely gorgeous and the house is located in a very quiet private area but still only 10 minutes away from stores and restaurants in Elkins. Check in was super easy and the hosts were very quick to respond to any questions we had. We definitely will be back again in the spring for some trout fishing right out the back door of the cabin!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to get away
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at the Riverside Retreat very much. The inside is warm and cozy and the outside is amazing. We’ve stayed twice now, both times with our dog. The cabin is very clean and decorated nicely with bears and trees just like a little cottage in the beautiful mountains of West Virginia should be. It is indeed right on the side of the river with very clear flowing water, any dog will love it! If you’re an older couple, like us, we also recommend the scenic train ride in Elkins."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Andi and Billy were very responsive and made sure that we made it safely and made sure we knew they were available for us during our stay
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Awesome place, lots to do at the cabin and in the surrounding area. Great place to stay will definitely stay there again and again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay was very peaceful, sitting on the deck watching the river flow by was just what we needed. The house was very clean and comfortable. I had a couple of questions and they got right back to me. I would stay here again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was so relaxing... had a great time hanging out... floating in the stream.. and chilling on covered part of porch when it rained.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Private spot on the river with easy access to float and relax. The inside is basic but in good condition with a comfortable bed. Very close to Elkins so getting groceries and take out was a breeze. Having the deck is nice although it could have used a hose down.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place on the water. Really nice porch to enjoy nature. Wish it was a bit easier to access the water but overall a really nice place to relax and get away from it all.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a great weekend getaway cabin! Had a wonderful time in the mountains on shavers fork river. The cabin was very clean inside and out with a great view overlooking the river. Definitely wanna come back in the future!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,My husband and I very much enjoyed our stay for the weekend. The area is beautiful in spring with wildflowers blooming. Nice view of the river and just steps to Stuart Park. Very clean and comfortable bed. So refreshing and peaceful. Would have loved to stay longer.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great retreat by the river. Great hosts. Thanks again
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Great location & very peaceful getaway.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed our stay and the view from the back porch! It would be nice to go there when the rhodendrons are blooming!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location! Everything we needed, very relaxing!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great stay at the Riverside Retreat. The deck and view of the Shaver's Fork were just amazing, and we loved spending time there every morning just taking in the beauty. The property has many old growth trees and birds to watch and listen to and try to identify. We love how the deck has been built around one of the trees. Very comfortable chairs on the deck and inside. The cabin was spotless and comfortable. Andi and Billy have gone out of their way to provision the cabin with anything you could possibly need. We'd definitely stay again!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great cabin in the perfect location. Very private and quiet ! Everything you need ! We loved our stay , even though it rained the whole time , it forced us to relax and nap more . We highly recommend this sweet cabin ❤️"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was a wonderful getaway! The cabin was perfectly located in a private setting on the river, but not far from town. Very clean and comfortable with an awesome deck!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had such a great time at Andi and Billy’s cabin! It has everything you need to have a nice, relaxing, peaceful time on the river. We spent our time fishing, hiking, BBQing, and walking the little stream…in my kids words “to see where it starts and ends”. We loved the location! It was so close to town/shopping but also right across the street from hiking trails and the most beautiful view from an observation tower 3-4 miles up the mountain ( the drive up was just as cool as the view). Seriously though that view is a must and you won’t regret it! Andi and Billy were amazing hosts and even went above and beyond by checking on us after a big rainfall the night before! We definitely recommend and we hope to be back soon!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place! Loved being right on the water, across the street from hiking trails, and only 10 minutes from a grocery store. We had a lovely time!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Lovely cabin on the river.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great area for tubing, relaxing, great views. Many other things to do."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had an incredible weekend at Andi and Billy’s river cabin. The hosts were very helpful and responsive, the cabin was clean and had everything we needed (and more!), and our dogs had a great time playing in the river and hanging out on the porch with us. There isn’t much more I can say that the other glowing reviews haven’t already covered. We will definitely be back!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a great family vacation here! Beautiful place! Spotless and has everything you need for a great stay. Owners were great to work with and the communication was perfect. You will love the privacy and beautiful deck overlooking the water!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect cabin get away. Cabin was sparkling clean and we were able to feel at home immediately. Being right on the water and still close to town was super convenient and relaxing. Will book again. Thank you Andi and Billy!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great location for my dogs! They loved the outdoor space ,playing in the river, and the seclusion!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, clean cabin on a beautiful river. What’s not to like!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This was a great spot on the river with a fully equipped kitchen. We spent lots of time on the deck and enjoyed the birds in the morning. Close to Elkins and to lots of hikes and other things to do. Very clean and perfectly located. Would definitely stay here again.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great riverside experience! Place is super clean & has a view/access that can’t be beat. If you’re a fly fisher, walk out only 100 yards or so to the rapids in one of the clearest waterway I’ve seen."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful weekend! The cabin was beautiful and our host was extremely helpful. The kids enjoyed roasting marshmallows at the fire pit and loved exploring the area. Everything you need for a great say was readily available, right down to extra blankets for the chilly weather! Highly recommend a stay at the retreat!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was a great retreat for a long weekend. Not far from Elkins but tucked away nicely in a small river valley, it's a perfect escape. Everything is well furnished, and the river view is really nice. Communication was great, and everything was as advertised. Wireless was excellent. Would definitely stay here again."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were hesitant to rent the cabin because of the outside pictures but relied on the inside pics, reviews, and the proximity to the water to make our final decision and we're so glad we did. We enjoyed the rustic look of the outside but the cuteness, utility of space, and cleanliness were perfect for our 4 day getaway. There were 5 of us - 2 teens and 3 adults and we were completely comfortable. Andi and Billy were communicative before, during and after our stay. They ensured we had the best information for our first trout fishing outing - even pointing us to the local bait shop and letting us talk to their son. Plenty of linens for all of us as well as cookware, utensils, etc. It's the first time in a LONG time that there was actual satellite TV and internet that we didn't have to use our own credentials. Cleanup at the end of the stay was simple. We would definitely recommend - the pictures are as shown - the water is right there and you could easily launch a kayak or tie a float from the shore."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time! Wifi has a strong signal and is super quick. Great place for anyone who works from home. Our dogs had a great time. Easy access to many hiking trails nearby!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a peaceful weekend away at the Riverside Retreat. The cabin was very clean and spacious and provided everything we needed. We spent our days at White Grass snowshoeing and crosscountry skiing and our evenings enjoying the stars from our cabin. We enjoyed eating breakfast each morning with a view of the river rushing by. We hope to return next winter!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was great and had a beautiful view, we would definitely come again."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The location on the river is incredible. My family had the best time being intentionally “snowed in” together during a winter storm. Can’t wait to come back and see it in the other seasons, too."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was exactly what we needed for a long weekend away to relax and enjoy the natural beauty of West Virginia. The location was perfect considering the ease of access to public land across the road and proximity to town if you needed anything quick. The cabin had plenty of space, was comfortably furnished, and even had a TV with cable so I could watch college football! Although the weather was cold I was able to use the grill and enjoy the deck space overlooking the river. The overall peacefulness surrounding the cabin combined with the views and ease of access to nature has me already looking to book this place next spring!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Was great - just what we needed, Forrest with trails across the street!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay. Everything was accurate and wonderful.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Secluded yet close to town. They have everything you need for a weekend (or longer away). The porch that looks onto the river is amazing and so relaxing. The beds are comfortable. Place is very clean. Our dogs loved it. Lots of outdoor stuff to do in the area. We will be back!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place. Highly recommend.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a relaxing weekend on the river with our 2 pups. From roasting s’mores on the fire down by the river to relaxing inside watching a movie in the most cozy environment. This cabin is everything you need!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a magical cabin. Everything was perfect. We really enjoyed our stay and didn’t want to leave! The river is fun to wade in, the area is so peaceful, the cabin was spotless, the bed comfortable, and the porch was a great spot to relax. I would recommend this to anyone. The hosts were very easy to communicate with and they even checked in to make sure we got there ok. Would definitely book again!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"As advertised! The Riverside Retreat was the ideal lodging for a low key, comfortable getaway. It was very tidy, clean, and very well equipped. The deck, river and fire pit were highlights for me.
Pro tip: Visit Bickle Knob Observation Tower across the street at night for a spectacular dark sky view!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a very nice, clean cabin to stay in with relaxing views of the river. The Staurt Recreational Area is directly across the street, where you can access a few trails and picnic areas and the Otter Creek Trailhead and The Bickle Knob Obersvation Tower. We visited Seneca Rocks also. It's about 2.6 miles to hike to the top and back with an incline of about 800 ft. and switchbacks but the views from the observation platform are well worth it. There's also a place where you can ride horses to the top if you choose to go that route. Much like the trails we hiked, the roads to get there were up and down and curvy, which is to be expected in the mountains. We loved relaxing on the deck in mornings, hiking in the afternoons, and playing in the river and sitting by a fire right out back. Closest neighbors we saw were across the river and to the left so fairly private as well. Excellent communications from owners throughout the whole experience and thoughtful touches at the cabin too."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It is such a nice and quiet place for a short getaway. Both me and my husband enjoyed our stay, and our son got the chance to fish as he always wanted. The house is neat and clean, it is a great place to enjoy some family time together. Also, very easy communication with Andi and Billy."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very relaxing getaway for my husband, myself, and our Golden Retriever who loved the waterfront cabin😊 We felt very at home and enjoyed the area😊Great host and first time Airbnb experience!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful cabin with every thing you could think of. We had such a relaxing time, and our 2 dogs had the best time in the river. We had some rain, but we didn’t let that damper our weekend."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great little cabin for myself, hubby and 2 kids. Right in the water, kids could play and we didn’t have to worry about them because it’s not deep! They had tubes, water toys and plenty of room for the kids! Fire pit and back deck was one of are favorite spots! Quiet and secluded! Loved it!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great setting right by the water. Tubes were provided, which provided some water fun. Very clean inside and many little amenities such as bottled water, soap, etc. We went hiking in Otter Creek Wilderness and Seneca Rocks. After those long days, the rental provided the ideal space for us to recuperate. The AC units in the main living area and bedroom were great. Always the perfect temperature. Plenty of cookware and dinnerware for our own meals. We all really enjoyed our stay."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Andi and Billy’s place is a pure oasis. It is right on the river so you can walk out and enjoy it anytime. They have a wonderful deck where we spent most of our time when we weren’t out doing other activities! The location was ideal for us. It was clean and comfortable:)
2021-06-01,4.0,Group trip,Wonderful cabin with an excellent location. So close to so much!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We wanted a quiet, peaceful retreat in a pretty natural setting. That’s what we got. Really nice. Coffee on the deck, watching the River in the morning, fire on the riverbank in the evening. The cabin is very nice and comfy and clean. Lots of great scenery and hiking in the region."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved our weekend stay at Andi & Billy’s cabin! The only downside was that we could not stay longer! The cabin was clean & spacious enough for 4 adults, a baby, and 2 big dogs. Having the river directly behind the cabin was fantastic! We are planning a trip back already!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin is very well equipped and very clean. Having the river just feet from the back deck was awesome…too bad the weather was rainy on for us on Memorial Day weekend. We’ll definitely be back for another visit!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a great space. This was my first time staying in an Airbnb and I’m highly impressed. All the essentials were provided (linens, towels, cooking tools/utensils, etc.) Even silly things I didn’t remember to pack, like qtips & floss. It’s right on the water & so beautiful. The cabin was absolutely spotless when we arrived. Communication was incredible also, highly recommend."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay close to area attractions. Cabin is somewhat close to the road but the way it is situated over the hill towards the river makes for plenty of privacy. The view of the clear water in the river is just awesome. We caught 15 trout on the weekend and got to enjoy a nice fire riverside. We waded the river behind the cabin and caught the biggest trout of the trip only to loose it after it jumped about two feet out of the water throwing the hook. Hopefully we’ll be back next spring.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, great location! Everything you need for a perfect getaway!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Group trip,This is a great location to be able to relax and fish right off the back of the property. Andi and Billy had the place extremely clean prior to arrival and even dropped off an extra tank of propane for the grill. Very close to some great hikes - both short and long hikes with some great views of West Virginia. Great stay and great hosts.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Best Air B&B I’ve stayed in, great place, clean, and has everything you need! Highly recommend."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay! Beautiful views, cozy cabin, awesome outdoor space (campfire spot, picknick table, river access, idylic trickling stream next to property, deck overlooking the river,...)! The hosts have thought of literally anything that you could maybe need during your stay. We felt very welcome and right at home. The property is very clean and we appreciated the precautions taken of providing disinfecting products. Definitely recommend it for a relaxing getaway! I bet it is also stunning in the spring time when all the rhododendron surrounding the property are blooming - we might have to come back for that!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful spot right on the river. Was a cozy cabin and perfect for our outdoor adventures nearby
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay - very close to great places to hike/explore even in the winter. Would definitely consider returning!
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, great cabin, great hosts!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful cabin in a gorgeous location with stunning views. The snow made for an enchanting experience. Hosts were unbelievably helpful and quick to respond to any questions. Highly recommend!
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family had a wonderful time staying at the Riverside cabin. The view of the river from the back porch was really peaceful. The cabin was very clean and had all the little necessities that were needed. The bed was extremely comfortable and my kids enjoyed having their own bed to themselves with the 2 pull outs from the couches. We ate at the families restaurant Beanders and the food was delicious! It was a short drive into Elkins where we also enjoyed some drinks at Big Timber Brewing. The snow tubing in Canaan Valley was a BLAST! It is highly recommended for something fun to do and Blackwater Falls was beautiful. We look forward to returning. The hosts were very helpful to us and responded quickly to any questions we had. Thank you Andi and Billy for the memories.
2021-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Cute little cabin by the water. Clean and well equipped with everything we needed. Andi and Billy were very helpful. Would like to come back when it gets warmer and can float in the water.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Andi and Billy's place is in an amazing location in Monongahela National Forest! Andi and Billy were super communicative and ensured we got there safely and we available if anything was needed. The place was clean, stocked with all of the essentials needed and a great place to relax for the weekend. We would definitely come back and hope to in the Spring or Summer!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful holiday visit to Andi and Billy’s cabin! It was spotless and peaceful. Our kids from the Deep South loved playing in the snow and it was only a 30 minute drive to Canaan Valley for snow tubing. We would love to return!
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Andi and Billy’s place was great- very much as described, rustic charm, beautifully located on the river near hiking trails, and very clean. We had some trouble with our 2wd on the driveway due to ice on the steep slope of the driveway, so would suggest at considering chains or 4wd if you plan to park near the house. Otherwise if you have 2wd, suggest parking on the road which is just a few feet above the house and very easily accessible. A lovely home for a weekend away!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Top notch! This cottage was beautifully clean, comfy and cozy! The dog loved it too! It was well equipped with everything you could possibly need-and more! Even dog treats :) We would absolutely stay here again!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If only I can rate more than 5 stars I would!!! Absolutely loved Andi and Billy's place in the mountains. It's so beautiful and quaint and in such a wonderful location. It was probably also the most comfortable bed I've ever laid on. We had to leave early to avoid a snow storm and absolutely heartbroken we couldn't stay longer. We'll definitely be back - hopefully when the time is right and when we can enjoy the river too. Thank you for your hospitality, Andi and Billy!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic location! Quaint and just enough of everything!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place right on the water! We couldn't have been happier with our stay.

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy cabin close to Elkins and all the attractions.
Fire pit, picnic table right beside river.
Couldn’t ask for a more peaceful location."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Riverside Retreat was BEAUTIFUL! A perfect space for my husband and I to unplug during a crazy year. Will definitely return!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was everything we needed it to be and more! Great setup, awesome deck with gate to keep pups in, beautiful yard by the river, very relaxing stay. Beautiful setting!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything I could ask for was supplied. Thanks for that!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Riverside Retreat was everything we could have asked for and more. The setting can't be beat - nestled in the woods with lots of privacy and the Shavers Fork river running through the backyard no more than 20ft from the house. Having the river so close was idyllic and so relaxing. We brought a camping hammock and set it up between two trees on the water's edge.
The house is perfectly sized (with a king bed to boot) for a couple. It was perfectly clean and well appointed not only with the essentials but plenty of other amenities and little touches to make for a great stay - inner tubes for the river, metal roasting sticks for marshmallows, bundles of wood available to purchase on an honor system, FAST internet, and A/C and heat in both rooms.
It's an 8 minute drive to Elkins if you need groceries or supplies and less than an hour's drive to many of the great hiking areas in Dolly Sods, etc. We can't wait to come back. Thanks!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great cabin right next to the river. Little stock of firewood (and some kindling!) are available. Short drive to Elkins WV and not far from lots of scenic wilderness areas.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A comfortable home to use as your anding pad and adventure base. We enjoyed being here as much as we enjoyed exploring the local area.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful and serene location. Clean and comfortable cabin. A true gem!
2020-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a very nice and cozy place. My girlfriend and I spent a long weekend here and had a great time. We would definitely visit here again!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is clean, comfortable and cozy. The view from the deck is fabulous and the deck is enclosed making it nice for dogs too. The cabin is stocked with necessities you may need while there. The hosts were quick to respond and extremely helpful. We would highly recommend this cabin for anyone looking for a place to get away and enjoy some of West Virginia’s beautiful nature."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little cabin right on the river is a gem for a couple looking for a quiet retreat. The deck and yard right on the river offer an outstanding setting for relaxation and contemplation. We spent lovely mornings and evenings there and then wonderful afternoons exploring and hiking many of the nearby wilderness areas. We loved clambering around Bear Heaven, catching a great view from the Bickle Knob tower, hiking the Otter Creek Trail, and visiting Seneca Rocks--all a very short and beautiful drive from the cabin. The cabin itself was very comfortable, well-stocked, attractive, and clean. Check-in and check-out went very smoothly. We look forward to going back there!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! My husband and I often stay at Airbnbs and this was one of our favorites. We didnt leave the cabin except to run iut and get supplies, as we were socially distancing. The cabin itself was sparkling clean and full of cute, personal touches. Furniture was comfortable and cozy. The deck was amazing and our dog loved sitting out there with us to watch the river. We were near a road but felt far away from civilization. Our hosts were extremely helpful the days before we checked in, making sure we knew everything we needed to know in terms of what to bring with us, directions and how to check in. We brought some of the provided chairs down to the fire pit by the river two nights in a row just to relax. I would highly recommend this cabin. My husband and I were cautious as we have not travelled anywhere since the pandemic began. However, we were reassured once we arrived as the cabin was well stocked and very clean. Our hosts obviously put a lot of loving care into this home."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely little cottage overlooking a serene water view. The deck was enclosed and allowed the dogs and humans to rest, relax and enjoy the view and sounds"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful weekend getaway at the Riverside Retreat! We used the fire pit often to cook some meals and of course s'mores! The kitchen had everything we would ever need. The deck was our favorite spot to hang out, it was nice having the little gate so we could keep our 2 yr old and dog in one spot and still enjoy the outdoors! Great memories were made, and we hope to make it back soon."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful cabin within a stones throw to the waters of Shavers Fork. Perfect location for nature lovers with the added benefit for all dog families to bring their pup along for the adventure! We cannot wait to go back next year!!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this retreat on the river! The location was amazing and the deck fronting the river was the best place to relax, grill, and just look at the beauty outside! The cabin had everything we needed and was very clean and organized. Location provided easy access to Elkins and the drive to Seneca Rocks, Black Mountain State Park, and other places is a beautiful one."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We spent a socially distanced vacation at this cozy, comfy, quiet cottage in a great location. There’s a huge deck right by the river which was only about a foot deep with crystal clear water, fun for wading and tubing (host supplied!). (Water level rises with rains.) Lovely view of mountains rising from the river. Comfortable bed, fluffy towels, good WiFi. House is shaded by trees and stayed cool even during a heatwave. Ten minute drive into Elkins for good takeout at several restaurants. National forest is across the road with some hiking trails and meadows, and nearby (quick drive) rail-to-trail for biking or hiking."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great cabin right on the river, clean, quiet, perfect for relaxing. The hosts were very responsive and provided useful information about the local area. We're talking about coming back in the Fall!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cabin was really nice. The river is prettier than we expected based on the photos - it's clear except for right after a big rainstorm and it's shallow (mostly like 2 ft. deep) so it was safe for kids to play around in. The bunk beds are pretty small - they were fine for my kids but I wouldn't plan to put teenagers or adults in them. Cabin is convenient to rt 33 and Elkins.
2020-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The back deck especially was our favorite part. Expect a 45 minute drive to Seneca Rocks and Blackwater Falls trail (many of the nature sites to see while there). We didn’t spend too much time in Elkins (the town) because we were more socially distancing.
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The river is the main character in the story of this perfect little cabin in the woods. It peacefully glides by the cabin beckoning you to throw in a line to catch a trout or just sit on the deck to watch the ducks practice their water landings.
The creek that feeds into the river offers a soothing flow of water that offers a perfect backdrop for a good night's sleep in the comfortable bed.
If you choose to leave the hideaway, you can be among stores and restaurants in about 5 minutes where you can find everything you need.
The hosts are lovely and do not bother you while you stay in their little piece of paradise. We hope to return again someday."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great little “retreat”! Close enough to town for a quick supply run and you just can’t beat being right on the river for fishing/enjoying the water. Anne & Paul were super communicative and quick to respond to our questions and the place was well-appointed and more than I could ask for. If you’re looking at places in Monongahela, I highly recommend their place- I hope to go back soon!"
2020-04-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Great view, close to town, and clean."
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful cabin, fantastic amenities, and perfect location. Gorgeous views, but close enough to Elkins to make a quick pizza run. :)
What a gem of a place."
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband I thoroughly enjoyed our visit at The River Retreat. Such an adorable place with a majestic view of the river. The deck is spectacular, even in the winter.
I highly recommend Anne and Paul’s retreat as it was spotlessly clean and so cozy and comfy. Can’t wait to go back."
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Very clean and well kept. Location is private with an amazing view of the river. Owners were always responsive and nice. Plan to stay again in the future.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is such a quaint cottage by the river. The back porch is amazing to have a cup of coffee in the morning and listen to the day starting. Paul knows a lot about the area and is willing to help out with areas of interest. I would recommend that you call them prior to your stay to ensure the check in address. Because of the remote location and Google maps not keeping up with rural routes it is inaccurate. Speaking with them directly will ensure you will not get frustrated checking in on your first night. Cell coverage is spotty at best coming into the locations as well as at the location but that is ok you are going to LOVE it. Anne and Paul also have a great Internet connection you can still stay connected if you wish once there. I hope you enjoy it as much as we did!
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location! Wonderful weekend! Beautiful area!
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location! Conveniently located near everything Elkins has to offer. Thanks, Anne and Paul!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful summer retreat. We go on a small family vacation every year and picked this adorable cabin on Shavers Fork. The rental comes with everything that you could need for a pleasant day. The hosts are extremely courteous and responsive. The riverfront access is the best. Elkins is a short trip away and there are so many beautiful natural sites to see. I highly recommend staying at this cabin.
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great view, comfy cabin. Perfect rustic place to sit on the deck and watch the river go by."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! The back deck was our favorite part of the cabin, we also enjoyed a couple fires just feet from the river. We can’t wait to come back!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Anne and Paul where exceptional Hosts .. Very private.. Owners never bothered us .. fallowed up with our questions Quickly.. A B&B with out being in same house.. House Close to everything , be adventures We still have much too see .. WE ARE DEFINITELY GOING BACK."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cool little cabin in an really amazing location. Hosts were very patient with us when asking for help with the final directions, and we're very warm and friendly. We would absolutely like to stay there again in the future. Book this cabin, you'll be glad you did."
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Neat cabin with super location. Extra comfy bed.
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The place is not too far from Canaan Resort so it was perfect as a place to stay while we spent a long weekend skiing.
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin location is absolutely beautiful. We stayed in January. It was cold and snowy. I highly recommend 4 wheel drive in the winter. It was beautiful overlooking the river from the warmth of the cabin. Unfortunately, we weren't able to sit outside on the deck but will hopefully make it back in warmer weather to enjoy the river. The cabin is in the National Forest and also just a few minutes from downtown Elkins. Across the road from the cabin is the bickle observation tower that I highly recommend. You can drive to the top of the summit (though a pretty tough drive in the snow). Also, a friendly heads up that cell service for Verzion is pretty spotty in all of Elkins (or all of West Virginia for that matter). Cabin has WIFI though, so, very helpful for getting around. We have stayed in an airBNB in downtown Elkins previously but much preferred this cabin. Paul is a great host and I highly recommend this cabin."
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin is very cozy. It was plenty warm on the cold nights. It’s right in the river which was beautiful. Would definitely stay again.
2018-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,A cute cabin right on the river. We were able to get to hiking areas on foot and within an easy drive of the cabin. It was in a good location.
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a gem of a cabin located within feet of the Cheat River. The outdoor porch is awesome and offers great views of the river and easy access for water activities. The cabin is fully equipped and has all the amenities required for a comfortable stay. The location is very convenient and with easy access to Downtown Elkins. The Bickle Knob lookout which is just a short drive away, offers breathtaking 360 degree views of the Allegheny mountains and Monongahela forest! The dogs found it extremely comfortable and we loved our stay here! Overall, great vacation. - K & A"
2018-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Cute, rustic cabin with all the essentials. Owners were great and the location is remote and private yet convenient to town. I was a little worried we’d be staying in the back yard of the owner’s when I read the listing but the cabin is separated from their residence a short drive down the mountain. It sits along the river and has a great deck. A warm and functional place to sleep for those who plan to venture out."
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place! Lots to do in the area! I would recommend doing as much this place very much.
2018-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Ann and Paul we're quick to respond to any question. They were lovely hosts and had an easy check in process. We were close to some great hiking locations and loved having access to a river in our backyard. Great stay!
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Had a wonderful stay, felt right at home! The house had all the essentials you would need and was even better than the pictures!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay and very comfortable house. I was very happy to see basic cooking items (oil, salt, pepper) plus a good assortment of utensils and pots and pans so we could cook meals. It was also very nice to have a washer/dryer with supplies. Elizabeth was super easy to communicate with and very friendly in our text exchanges. I hope to stay here again when I’m visiting Elkins again next year!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,the tuck away is sound proof. we heard nothing even though we were right in town. it was neat and clean. the kitchen is well stocked. it was accurately described

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The house was beautiful, clean and gave all the comforts of home. I was very happy to find a place close to our cabin for my in laws to enjoy. Our GPS did take us to another house several times, which is not the owners fault."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Elizabeth was great to work with and very accommodating. Home was very clean and well laid out and beautifully decorated!! It suited our needs perfectly!!

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Elizabeth was an incredible host with communication and flexibility with our short stay. Tuck Away 2 is like a ""warm hug"" while traveling. Adorable and well stocked with all essentials and then some! We will be back and refer others to her as well."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"It was so sad to leave this truly perfect hub for my travels after 4 weeks here! Such a cozy little house. So well decorated, functionally designed and equipped with everything to make it a home rather than a hotel.
The neighborhood is very quiet and very walkable if you’re not venturing off to one of the state parks or forest area. I enjoyed walking into town to the restaurants, to the college campus which has beautiful grounds and to the city park. I even walked to Krogers one day (just under a mile) to pick up a couple of things. Walmart is also convenient - less than 3 miles away to stock your kitchen if you want to cook in.
Area restaurants are pretty good. I especially liked Smoke on the Water. Nice salads and crab cakes!
Elizabeth was super quick to respond if I had questions, but I really didn’t need to once I was settled in. She added so many nice touches - loved the hiking trails guide book! There are games and books, and she left treats which I could have actually done without lol.
I found Elkins to be a lovely little town from which to explore the surrounding area. I made several trips to Blackwater Falls and into Thomas and Davis. Drove to Morgantown one day, and down to Cass another. If you’re into WV glass, Weston is a short trip away. Glass by Scott in Thomas on the Appalachian Hwy is a must see also! All the drives are beautiful! Audra State Park is super close by and a nice hiking spot and place to play in the gurgling water.
Highly recommend Elizabeth as a host and her lovely home!!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place to stay. Very clean and well stocked. Very tastefully decorated. Elizabeth responded in a very timely matter. No issues with our reservation.

2022-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place should be renamed to Tuck-Away Gem instead of Tuck-Away Place, because this place is truly a gem. As soon as we entered the cabin, we were totally blown away by how Elizabeth had turned the whole cabin into a wonderful, cozy and an inviting place. The kitchen was well stocked with all utensils and basic food amenities needed to cook wonderful meals. The living room was very well designed with comfortable sofa, nice little cabinets and cute decorations. The beds were super comfortable and over all, we had a wonderful time. Elizabeth was an amazing host. We wanted to have some wine over the new years and could not find a wine opener. I messaged Elizabeth and she promptly brought one over :) We had a lot of fun exploring all the little stores around Elkins as well as Snowshoe mountain. We definitely recommend this cabin!!!"

,,,"***DO NOT RENT FROM THIS HOST, THEY ARE SCAMMERS***
After testing a smoke detector in the cabin, an angry man called me YELLING AT ME without saying who he was (turns out he is one of the owners/hosts). They then proceeded to *FALSELY* accuse us of damaging their carpet by burning holes up the entire staircase, which we did NOT DO. They are falsely accusing us for causing 'damage' to their old, shag carpet that they want replaced. Initially, I was attracted to this cabin because of affordability and it looked cute. Now, they are trying to get $1,100 extra from me for damages that me or my guests didn't do, which they have NO proof for. These people are frauds and liars and I HIGHLY recommend AVOIDING THEM AT ALL COSTS.
FULL STORY:
Rented this cabin for a weekend away with my mother and brother, because it looked cute and was the most affordable cabin (and one of the only ones that wasn't booked) in literally all of Elkins.
While we stayed there, we suddenly smelt a strange odor, like cat urine or gas. We got worried, so we wanted to make sure that the safety systems existed/worked in the cabin. My brother hit 'test' on the smoke detector, which then started to go off. Less than a minute later, we received a call from Vivint, the built-in home security system. We told them that we didn't need help, we were just testing the alarm and it went off, and that we were sorry. The Vivint security responders were very understanding and just wanted to make sure we were safe. I then received a phone call from the Airbnb host, Ashley, who wanted to make sure everything was okay. Two minutes later, I received a phone call from an angry man, who proceeded to yell at me and belittle me when I said 'hello'. He never introduced himself, and didn't say my name either. He said ""Why the hell would you touch the smoke alarm?? what is wrong with you??!"" etc etc , even though I had already talked to two different people about this and apologized. He continued to speak to me in a patronizing way and kept questioning why we would test the smoke detector. My brother then jumped in and said we have every right to test the safety systems in a home that we are renting to ensure our safety. He hung up on us. After that phone call, I felt very unsafe and contemplated just going home. That man sounded absolutely crazy.
The next day, we were checking out, so we made sure to do everything that was listed in the host's rulebook (strip the beds of linen, wash used dishes, etc).
Then, the morning after we checked out (a full 24 hours later) that same man called me again with the same demeanor. He said "" Y'all the people that stayed in my cabin this weekend?"" And I said yes. He then said what did you do to my carpet? There are burn marks on the stairs. Basically he accused us of burning holes in his carpet? He then sent a picture that did NOT look like a burn hole, almost like a fire poker impression on the carpet. We didn't even notice a mark like that when we were there, and we definitely did NOT make that mark. I then proceeded to call Ashley because I still didn't know who this man was - he's not listed as a host or anything. Yet he kept calling my cell phone, harrassing me. Ashley suddenly refused to speak with me via phone, even though her and her brother had called me three times already. Via Airbnb messages, she wrongfully accused me and my family for burning up holes in their carpet. She included images, all of which looked like different carpets. We think they just found holes and damages in carpets at their other rental locations, then pinned the damages on us because they have on record we tested the smoke alarm. Their story just doesn't add up or even make any sense at all, not to mention they have absolutely no proof we did any of this. We do not appreciate being accused for damages we didn't do, and do not appreciate that these hosts are trying to scam us. Save yourself the headache and do NOT rent from these people."
,,,"Our stay at Hannah's place was fantastic! It was very clean. Had all kitchen
and bathroom items that were clean and accessible. The fenced in back yard
was great for our dogs! We loved it."
