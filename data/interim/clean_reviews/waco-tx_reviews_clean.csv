2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sweet cute cottage. Felt as comfortable as staying at grandma‚Äôs house. Close enough to enjoy Waco attractions and far enough to feel like a getaway. It was a perfect place to prepare for and after our half marathon. The animals were great üôÇ
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Host was very helpful and friendly. Very cozy comfortable home.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Such a wonderful time to spend with my family. Peaceful and just beautiful view
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved being by the animals and in such a quiet quaint place . Absolutely would come here again.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"we stayed here for two nights and absolutely loved it! i am a city slicker - don't know a llama from an alpaca and am really wanting to spend more time around farm animals now. the animals were all so fun to watch and listen to - there was a lot of rain on our second day and we sat for hours on the porch and watched neighboring horses just mill around. lovely. the kitchen and bathrooms were spotless, the beds comfortable and the living room well appointed for curling up and talking or watching TV. would reserve this home again anytime i was in waco."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is quiet and peaceful. The home has everything you need to accommodate your stay. Plenty of towels, and well stocked kitchen. Watching the sunset from the porch was definitely a favorite part of our stay. THE FARM ANIMALS! Lucy the Llama was such a delight, as were all the goats and their babies. The geese randomly waddle through the yard letting you know they are there. The neighboring horses are also very friendly and will allow you to feed them grass, and pet their heads. You can walk the street as there is very little traffic, and it is very safe. If you take an evening stroll you will find views of the lake, miniature donkeys, and a miniature pony down the street from the home. Such a delightful retreat here in Waco. Close enough to town for anything you need, yet in a country quiet setting. It was just what we needed!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was an amazing Airbnb!! Pictures couldn‚Äôt do this place justice! Animals were such sweethearts and it was so peaceful will be coming back and staying here!!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Josh's Rustic Farmhouse was just perfect. The house was very comfortable. The kitchen was awesome...big refrigerator; very nice stove; wonderful pantry with essentials for cooking; very nice dishwasher and lovely back porch for eating and visiting with friends while watching the farm animals.
We loved sitting and having coffee on the front porch rocking on the rocking chairs. Loved walking the lane in front of the house and admiring the beautiful homes and neighboring horses. The farm animals were the highlight of our trip even though our trip was to visit Magnolia. Josh was Johnny-on-the-spot with his responses to any questions we had. My friend who I was concerned about staying in the country said if I ever come back to Waco, I want to stay here. Lucy the Llama, Harry the horse as well as the ""bully"" goat with the beautiful blue eyes highlight our memories. Thank you, Josh, for a wonderful trip."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice. Beautiful views and fun animals. Overall a great place to stay and very convenient to other places in the area.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay! We booked it to watch the solar eclipse and we got to do that and more! My kids loved to interact with the animals, you can tell they are used to visitor, they approached the fence once they saw us and they are very friendly. The place is just like the pictures. The house has everything you need for your stay. Very quiet, tranquil area and beautiful sunsets. Josh is very communicative and friendly. Would definitely go back!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and loved being able to interact with the animals!! peaceful, clean!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We didn‚Äôt wanna stay downtown we wanted somewhere we could relax and vibe at considering we were there for a work trip.
It met all expectations and the animals were so fun to watch and interact with!
Reminded me of home and would recommend anyone stay here if you want a feel of the peaceful country life"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,What a great stay! The host was super responsive. The home made us feel welcome and was super clean. No issues at all! PS. The animals were great! You can tell they like visitors.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rustic Farmhouse was a perfect stay on our way from Dallas to San Antonio. Quiet setting and lovely area. We were fortunate to meet Josh who was great. Wish we had a longer stay.

Loved, loved, loved the farm animals next door. In a perfect world I would want to this ever day. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay far exceeded our expectations. Josh was beyond kind, welcoming and helpful. He let us roam his farm as we pleased and interact with any and all of his friendly farm animals. Even more, Josh joined us on two occasions and helped our young kids learn about and better engage with his animals. It created priceless memories for our family.
The house was super clean, and both the front and back porches were as relaxing as it gets. The location is close enough to Waco to enjoy other attractions, but far enough outside of the city to be in the country. I would highly recommend this stay. Thank you Josh for a wonderful experience!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at Josh's place was wonderful! It was quiet and peaceful and the animals were so friendly! My kids loved getting to pet the goats and the horse. If you visit during the spring, you might get the added bonus of the cutest baby goats! The house was cozy and had everything we needed. It's about 20 minutes into downtown Waco but only 10 minutes to stores if you need to pick anything up. We thoroughly enjoyed our time here and would definitely recommend it if you're looking for something a little off the beaten path."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our time in Waco and loved the quiet, peaceful cottage that Josh provided for us. We will definitely be back next time we need a place in the Waco area!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay in Waco and having a home like Josh‚Äôs to come back to each day, made it even better!
Our event was only 5 minutes away! (The Walton‚Äôs cast reunion at Tucker Hall)That was a big plus! And we were able to bring our dogs.
We look forward to returning and spending more time in the Waco area."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful outdoor space & so peaceful! Loved that we were able to bring our dog with us. Waking up everyday to the animals in the pastures around us was so serene & relaxing.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Pure bliss. I cannot say enough about Josh‚Äôs place. It‚Äôs exactly as described but the tranquility of being in the country while also being so close to Waco made it the perfect destination for us. Highly recommend, and cannot wait to stay here again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It is a great place to stay peaceful.
2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay a bit outside of Waco. Was perfect for us as it offered a nice relaxing and peaceful environment with easy travel to Waco as well.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful time at your beautiful property! The goats, alpaca, and horses were fun to feed and see everyday!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Josh was extremely nice and communicated well. He even offered to let us check in a little early.
The place was ideal for our needs! The pastoral views from the kitchen were especially lovely! There are chickens, geese, goats (some adorable baby goats), one alpaca and a horse behind the back fence. Josh had a container with food to feed the chickens and geese. All come running when you‚Äôre at the back fence.
We were in Waco for the Homestead Heritage Fair so we didn‚Äôt get to sit on the porch in the rocking chairs; maybe next time. And, there‚Äôs a nice back deck with a table and chairs also.
The Mammoth site is just down the road and we were within 20 to 30 minutes of everything we needed to get to.
There were four of us counting my son and daughter in law and we had plenty of room; plus they brought their dog. The beds were very comfortable!
We hope to stay again!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nestled in the peaceful countryside just outside of Waco, this property offers comfortable accommodations and relaxing scenery. We found the cottage well appointed and comfortable. We appreciated the available coffee, games, and quiet surroundings. The host is responsive and ready to accommodate."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Josh was an amazing host who checked in to make sure everything went okay and also let me know of things that were being done at the house while I was there. The home has everything I needed for a weekend away. beautiful property as well.
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This was a simple, clean place to stay. The animals-the goats especially-added a fun farm experience. Comfortable beds helped us get a good rest. The location was also nice: outside the hustle and bustle of the city but an easy 15-20 minute drive to get downtown. Overall, a nice place to stay!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay, hope to come back soon!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect getaway for a family of four from DFW. It's about 10-15 minutes away from the hustle and bustle of downtown Waco which is usually quite a headache to navigate. Though it's a little more remote, there were plenty of gas stations and restaurants nearby. My kids' favorite part was hanging out with the exceptionally friendly goats, chickens, and horse just over the fence line! Will definitely keep visit again!!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time at Josh‚Äôs place. It is nice and quiet and the animals are so sweet. Nice to be out of town a bit and Helbergs BBQ is close by and has really good food.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great house in a great location. Not far off the highway, but far enough away that you heard no traffic. Only a 15-20 minute drive to downtown Waco. Very peaceful and quiet area, unless the goats and goose are yelling at you for more treats (which were provided to us). Josh was very responsive as well. Would highly recommend."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely great place to stay. Clean and private but with so many animals nearby. Had the feeling of ""out in the country"" but still had 5G signal on Tmobile. Bed in the master bedroom was more comfortable than what you'd get in a hotel. Would love to stay here again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place with farm animals! Place is so clean and lovely makes you feel at home! Would definitely stay again!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Josh‚Äôs place was clean, quiet and relaxing. Having treats to feed the goats and horses created a relaxing way to end our long days. The animals were friendly and gentle. Josh‚Äôs house met our needs and I would gladly stay there again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the house, the baby goats, horses and alpaca, house was just adorable. Josh could not have been nicer or easier to work with. If you are heading to Waco, look for his B&B. You will not be disappointed!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This little farmhouse is the best! We loved sitting on the back porch watching the animals while drinking coffee, it was so relaxing and peaceful. My daughter enjoyed feeding and petting all the farm animals, and our dogs felt right at home. This will be our go to place in Waco when we come to visit family and friends."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great getaway to rural life. Enjoyed all the animals., they were friendly! And still close to things to do, made great combination. Josh was also great, was quick and flexible when I needed to adjust times and very very responsive!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Loved our stay at the farmhouse! Super clean home. Josh is an extraordinary host! Comfortable beds. Roomy for

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our family was in the middle of a move across the country, and thus Airbnb was perfect both us and our pets. There was plenty of parking for the moving truck as well as our vehicle. Our daughter enjoyed all of the farm animals behind the building. The host even with thru all of the trouble to set up a kennel for our nervous dog, so that she wouldn‚Äôt run off. Would definitely recommend and stay again!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just what I needed. A peaceful relaxing spot away from the city. I don‚Äôt remember that last time my head really felt empty. No where to be. Nothing that needed to be done. Just to spend time with my mom, drink coffee, read my book, and watch the animals. We did spend some time in Waco doing a few things, but to be honest, I was so happy and at peace to just sit on the front porch or back patio and just, be. The goats are adorable and the chickens are so clever. The speckled hen was my favorite! She‚Äôs very talkative and will eat from your hand. Loved the house! Immaculate and cozy. Would definitely book again the next time I need a break from life!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Cottage was a great location, it was so cozy and charming. We met friends from Hampton, Virginia celebrating their 50th anniversary. We all had a great time enjoying the farm just relaxing and peaceful area. We are planning to meet again next year, same time and place. Josh was excellent on everything.
Thank you so much for the great memories with dear friends.

The animals were a huge plus and it was fun interacting with them all. The goats were a hoot!!
Loved the whole place! From how clean it was, to the beds, to the outside patio lighting, and access to every amenity!
The only thing is maybe put a few more keurig coffee pods next to the keurig for morning coffee‚Ä¶?
But again‚Ä¶! It was overall amazing!
P.S. the ac and heat worked so quickly and water pressure was way better than expected!!
WOULD RECOMMEND AND GO AGAIN!!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We drove all the way from Michigan for a weeding and needed a house that would allow pets (we brought my daughter‚Äôs cat). This place was fantastic. Very cute cottage with lots of space. Loved seeing the animals every morning. Even our cat loved them lol. It was very peaceful and Josh was readily available if we needed anything. We would definitely stay here again should we return to the area.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay at Josh's guest house! It was a relaxing getaway for spring break. My kids loved watching the animals and the setting was beautiful and peaceful. The home is so pretty. I wish there were photos of the bedrooms. I almost didn't book because of the unknown but they were clean and very nice. Waco has so much to do and we'll definitely be back.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful stay. The farm animals were interactive and friendly.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect place for our time in Waco. Came in due to Baseball tournament at the China Spring High School. This house was in the perfect location. Close to the High School and the Silos. The place was clean and comfortable. Josh was a great host and even went and turned the lights on since we were coming in at night! The animals were fun. Very peaceful place! Would definitely go back if in the area again!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Josh's airbnb and farm property were outstanding and idyllic. We were coming from the hustle & bustle of Austin and needed to relax during a long holiday weekend. Josh's Airbnb offered the perfect setting to enjoy the beautiful Texas night sky, sleep in comfy clean beds, visit with their sweet farm animals (we even got to welcome two baby goats born on the night we arrived!), play board games, pick up great tacos at El Norte√±o, go to nearby parks... and all while being just a short drive into downtown Waco. The Big Plus was that Josh and his family welcomed our dog on the property ~ and even offered to provide a doggie crate.
PS: We weren't very familiar with downtown Waco but the town boasts wonderful farm to table restaurants, fun indie bookstores & boutiques and of course, the stunning Magnolia Market."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect. My fianc√© and I came here for an early Valentine‚Äôs Day weekend, and it was so peaceful. It‚Äôs far enough out from the city so you don‚Äôt hear traffic. The farm animals were awesome too :) Lots of games to play inside, and the kitchen was well stocked for making meals. The beds were SO COMFORTABLE. We slept amazing :)"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great spot for a family weekend getaway. Our young children loved feeding the friendly animals next door (with the provided feed).

Location is perfect. Away from all the lights and noise of Waco, but within a 20-30 min drive of the majority of Waco's attractions."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely peaceful! We recently stayed during the New Year's weekend. From the moment we stepped on the property until the moment we left, Josh was the best host. He was kind, responsive, and very helpful. I now understand why so many of the reviews spoke of the animals. As soon as we arrived, we couldn't help but rush over to meet them. Feed was left on the patio table and we couldn't wait to feed them. My husband and I were looking for a place to get away and have some downtime. This place was just perfect for that. We loved the outdoor sounds of animals and New Year's fireworks in the distance. We grilled and enjoyed the fire pit. Josh even provided us with the firewood. The house itself was quaint and simple. There was plenty of room to enjoy the t.v. and the quiet time indoors. Everything we needed from kitchen items to bathroom linens was available. It was just my husband and I, but a family of more than two would be just as comfortable there too. We can't wait to return!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is just what we needed. Far enough from the city to feel like you are in the middle of nothing, no light pollution, highway, or city noise. We loved it! Thank you for letting us spend time in your little slice of paradise farm style."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We this is our 3rd visit to Waco with Josh as our host and as always, this was a wonderful stay. We wake to the most breathtaking sunrise over the farm and it‚Äôs the perfect place to unwind after a busy day. The farm animals are such an added bonus and enjoy little visits from house guests.
Josh‚Äôs home is clean and comfortable, and has all the amenities needed to make this a home away from home. Plus, a very comfortable bed which is a must for us.
We will continue to book this beautiful, quaint home every time we visit our family in Waco.
Thank you Josh for hosting us again. Loved our visit."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Total comfort and peace in this quaint farm house! Our dogs were welcome as well. My adult children loved sitting on the back porch visiting while watching the farm animals.
The beds were super comfortable and the linens were cozy. The whole house was perfect for our weekend in Waco. It was just a short drive into our family gathering in the nearby country club.
Highly recommended for lodging in the outskirts of Waco."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Just the getaway we needed. Our daughter loved seeing the goats, horses, chickens, geese, and alpacas. We grilled, sat by a fire in the fire pit, and sipped our coffee in the rocking chairs on the front porch."

The house has a fully equipped kitchen with newer appliances, an awesome front porch with rocking chairs to sit and just enjoy your surroundings, and just a really cozy interior with really nice touches all over. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed petting the goats and horses that came right up to the fences. This is a relaxing size of heaven that I will most certainly be returning to. The proximity to town (20 minutes to Baylor and the Silos, and 5 minutes to the Lake and many different restaurants), yet being out in farmland is absolutely the best!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay to have peacefulness and see some farm life. Nice and spacious house with a great deck off the front and the back! Very user friendly from check in to check out.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We stayed here for Father‚Äôs Day weekend to get away from the city and enjoy some farm life with our son and dog. We all enjoyed being able to feed the animals and they were all pretty comfortable with people- even the horses! The home has everything you need and is close enough to go to markets and restaurants. We actually brought our own food but did go for a coffee run at one of the local spots. We played monopoly several times during the weekend and it was such a life saver. Anything to get the young one off the phone lol Thank you for a fun and relaxing weekend!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect location. Exactly what was needed.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Would highly recommend staying at the farmhouse if you‚Äôre visiting Waco. It‚Äôs small, well kept, peaceful, and fun with the animals next door. If you like baby goats and board games, then you will enjoy staying here."

2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Rustic Farm home doesn't disappoint!! Our family of 5 stay comfortably in this 2 bedroom home. We enjoyed waking up in the morning to the rooster crowing, but not too early. Our kids loves feeding the chickens, goats and horses. The scenery and quiet was nice. Having a firepit and roasting smores under the stars was amazing. This little Rustic home checks all the boxes. Hope y'all enjoy it as much as our family did. We will definitely be back!! Jones Family"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were looking for a peaceful, rural and comfortable stay, for Mom, Dad, 12-year old daughter and her friend. And it did the job perfectly. Joe was friendly and helpful, without being intrusive at all. The home is very comfortable and in perfect condition, just as in the photos. Our daughter and friend loved the swing, and the big yard, as well as the great sunsets. They tried to make friends with the local (friendly) bull, but it was too shy! Overall, highly recommended."

The guest home is cozy but had plenty of room for our family of 4. Kitchen was fully stocked and had everything we needed to cook a few meals. Loads of clean towels and extra linens. Comfy beds. Yard was SO lovely and had such beautiful space for our boys to run around and play. Quick 20 min drive into Waco to all attractions and restaurants there.

They were friendly, the stay was peaceful, and the place felt like home. The wildflowers in bloom were beautiful. His neighbor was even gracious enough to invite me over and make a wildflower bouquet and teach me the name of each plant. Really wished we had time to stay later. Highly recommend to anyone. This is a gem ü©∑"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"The stay was beautiful, it was quiet and the property well maintained. My kids loved playing outback on the swing and running around. This was our second time to book this AirBNB and it is a great place to return too."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Joe might be one of the sweetest hosts I have ever worked with! He was kind and immediately came to introduce himself and tell us all about his sweet guest home. We felt like we had known him forever. His rental is peaceful and gave these weary girls a perfect retreat to rest and relax and catch up after a year of missing each other!! We‚Äôre so thankful his spot was available!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I got away for a couple of days of rest and relaxation, and Joe's property was the absolute perfect place for it! I cannot say enough good things about the screened porch. The second I stepped out and felt the breeze, I felt an overwhelming sense of peace that remained with me throughout our stay. The entire space was comfortable and well-designed, and privacy was not an issue. We will definitely be back the next time we need a retreat weekend!"

All the amenities were a plus such as the sound machine and fan in the rooms were very much appreciated."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved our stay at Joe‚Äôs! It was just as pictured & so clean! We had anything we could possibly need as well. The beds were comfortable and plenty of room for a family of four. My kids loved the backyard, as did my husband and I. Sitting on the porch drinking my coffee was one of my favorite things about trip! Waco is close enough to get to all you want and need quickly but you are still out a little bit for a quiet peaceful stay for a relaxing vacation. 100 percent recommend and would stay again! :)"
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,We loved our stay here! Highly recommend to anyone looking in this area.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Best Airbnb experience I‚Äôve ever had. Staying at Joe‚Äôs home was a great experience. He was a very friendly and attentive host. The guest house is sectioned off from his so it was nice to get the personal service with the accommodation of privacy. The location was absolutely beautiful, especially at sunset. We turned on the gas fire pit and watched the sun go down each evening. It was pretty close to the Heritage farms, so that was convenient. The home was perfectly clean, and comfortable. We loved our stay, and highly recommend it. Thank you Joe, for a great experience, and for going out of your way to make our vacation very pleasant."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Joe is a great host and made our getaway worth it. Great house with a great backstory! Had a lot of fun!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Joe and his Air BnB are top notch. One of the most relaxing and peaceful views in Waco. The home is modern and ultra clean. Tons of amenities including washer and dryer help to make it feel like home. The host Joe was extremely nice and helpful. Went above and beyond to make us comfortable, even made us some pancakes when we had a rough morning. Joe lives close by but was never an issue. He‚Äôs very respectful of your space and noise. A+++ experience."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Highly recommend! Just like the photos--gorgeous and peaceful, very clean inside, nice decor.

100% highly recommend staying at Joe‚Äôs guest house!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was exactly what I needed, and the location is great. It was only 1.5 hrs away from Austin, Dallas.
I had a beautiful view of the sky from sitting outside. Plus it was so quiet and peaceful"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"An amazing place to stay when visiting Waco! About 15-20 minutes from most things in Waco. Which was just enough out of the way for my husband and I, while still having privacy. Beautiful property and air bnb. The host was amazing and so sweet. He was willing to help with whatever we needed over our stay. Highly recommend!! We will definitely be coming back."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joe‚Äôs place was the cutest place ever! Love the farm scenery, little patio, and beautiful decor!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Joe‚Äôs place is quite literally our home away from home when we come down to see our kids (our third visit in 2023!). Only 15-20 minutes from Baylor‚Äôs campus and downtown Waco with the peacefulness of the country. Perfect balance! Joe is so kind! We recommend his place to our other WI Baylor families for one of the best stays near Waco!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the location- beautiful property & only 20 mins from Waco. We‚Äôve never stayed on property where the host lived next door but we were very comfortable & it still felt private. Joe was very nice and made us feel welcomed. The Airbnb was just like the photos- very unique & aesthetic. Loved our stay!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Java Joe was great. I didn't know the back story until we rented the place. I'm so glad we were able to stay. We only stayed one night. Got there late and left early. It was so peaceful after a long drive. We sat on the porch with our kids and had a fire. Thank you for the great stay. ‚ù§Ô∏è
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host and great guest house set up!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was by far mine and my husband‚Äôs favorite Airbnb stay. The house is connected to Joe‚Äôs actual house but was still extremely private and not a problem. The cleanliness of the home was in perfect condition and had plenty of added items that you sometimes forget when traveling which was nice (shampoo, conditioner, chargers, speakers, games, etc). The place itself was so homey and Joe even made it a point to stop by to say hello which was actually very much appreciated. The backyard and patio fireplace was the perfect touch to the hill country stay. Cannot recommend Joe as a host and his home enough!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Everything was absolutely perfect! Joe has a great place & I would definitely recommend it! We were only in town for a wedding, but will definitely have to plan a trip to come back!"

Vilma"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Joe‚Äôs place was our favorite Airbnb stay we‚Äôve ever experienced. First of all, the area is beautiful. It was so quiet and peaceful. We were not expecting the surrounding area to be so beautiful and were pleasantly surprised. The house was inviting and very comfortable. This guest house is connected to Joe‚Äôs main house but it didn‚Äôt bother us at all. It still felt private and comfortable. We also got to meet Joe, which was so pleasant. He was so kind and accommodating.
While we stayed at the house, we took a horseback ride at Brazos Bluffs Ranch (it was amazing!!). It was only 10-15 mins away. The homestead heritage market nearby is also very nice. We also took a walk in the morning and really enjoyed it.
This is a great place and we hope to come back!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I enjoyed our time at Joe‚Äôs place. It was a well thought out space and perfect for a few day getaway for the two of us. Thank you Joe for sharing your beautiful home!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,We so enjoyed our time at Joe's place. The space is pristine and thoughtfully designed. It was a pleasure to meet Joe and hear the inspiration behind the design. I would 100 percent recommend this rental to anyone looking for a beautiful peaceful place to relax and explore the area.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I enjoyed staying at Joe's place! The beds were super comfy, the shower was divine and all of the details to the home are so sweet. If you're hoping to stay near Waco, this is the perfect home!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Joe was the BEST host! He was kind and very open to conversation. His place was even better than the photos and it was very clean.
We had our two kids(2 and 4) and he made the home very welcoming to kids. We look forward to staying here again in the future."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband, our friends and I had the most delightful stay in Joe‚Äôs Swiss themed guest house. The design is stunning, every detail was considered. The beds extremely comfortable, the patio seating area was delightful even in the summer heat. Every inch of the space was carefully considered and designed, it was truly a joy to spend the weekend in this wonderful little place."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Joes place is very beautiful, and he is very nice."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved Airbnb! It is very peaceful, clean, nice and cozy. We felt comfortable and at home from the beginning.
Joe was a wonderful host. He treated us very accommodating. He wasn't in any case at all, but always on hand if we needed him.
For us, the location was wonderful! Rural, calm yet well developed. We love coffee. From Airbnb, numerous coffee shops can be reached in minutes. But we also liked staying in Airbnb and outside. We were able to relax wonderfully.
Looking for a nice and quiet place to stay, a weekend in Swiss style, or cozy days in a good atmosphere, this Airbnb is wonderfully suited!
We were really happy! üòä"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joe was very helpful, friendly and responsive. It was a very peaceful place with a nice screened porch to enjoy the evenings. Thanks Joe for a great stay."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Joe was a fantastic host! He welcomed us upon arrival, and then left us to have our privacy during our stay. The place was surprisingly very kid friendly and we felt very comfortable letting our baby crawl around and our 3 year old play around the house. Everything was extremely clean and easy to find and the view out back was very peaceful. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The home was crafted to be an exceptional experience. So many details worked together to make the stay here amazing.
Our family of 6 stayed here for three nights. The entire space was clean and beautifully designed, with so much attention to detail about how the design and decor of the space would impact the experience. Some spaces are rented out simply to make money, and some are made to share the passion and talent of someone who greatly cares‚Äîthis is that home."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My Dad and I absolutely enjoyed staying at New Kaltenbrunnen. This was our first time using Airbnb and we were beyond impressed. Beautiful space, immaculate, and very peaceful. Joe was an exceptional host and he exceeded all of our expectations. The story that inspired New Kaltenbrunnen has deep meaning. I would definitely book with Joe again!
5/5 would recommend to anyone I know."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Joe made sure I knew he lived on the premise so it was no surprise when he checked on us to ensure that our needs had been met. His input was very valuable for our visit to Waco. Thanks Joe.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a fabulous stay! Very clean. Lots of towels and linens. Everything we needed. Beds are very comfortable. Such a pretty place. Joe is a very responsive host. He even checked on us when he thought the wi-fi was out. We loved our stay! Very peaceful, beautiful views, and just minutes outside of Waco. We would definitely stay again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Joe‚Äôs place was just as beautiful as the pictures. It is homey and welcoming, and there are so many thoughtful touches - a full spice rack for cooking, plenty of extra towels, laundry detergent if you need to run a load, and even a stepstool for kids to reach the sink!
We had a couple small issues like a wrong door code and some ants in the house, but Joe was responsive and quick to help fix the problem.
The space is lovely and I would absolutely recommend to anyone looking for a peaceful setting that is still convenient to Waco amenities."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Really enjoyed our stay!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an amazing place to stay! Absolutely nothing negative to say about it. It was pristine, and I loved the style of everything. There was even a calming video of flying over Switzerland playing on the TV when we walked in. Joe was super helpful, and communicative and it felt very private even though he was right next door. Would definitely come back here if I was staying in Waco againüëçüèª."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! So many things to say! From communications prior to check in and all throughout the stay, if I had a question he would respond promptly.
The Haus was beautifully decorated and so many details. It was warm and inviting with everything we needed. The closed in porch made for a cozy place to sit with coffee in the morning or a cocktail at night. The beds were quite possibly the most comfortable I‚Äôve ever slept in and the linens so soft and inviting.
The property was gorgeous and well maintained (I almost asked if I could ride the riding lawnmower). We did see Joe during our stay but never felt our encounters to be intrusive-truth be told he seems like a gentleman we‚Äôd love to sit and chat with and boy can we!
The Haus was the perfect getaway for these busy moms to just sit and enjoy one another‚Äôs company uninterrupted. We will definitely be back! We are already looking at our calendars for the fall."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Although we only stayed one night we really enjoyed it. Joe‚Äôs place was cozy and we had a great night of sleep.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Joe‚Äôs place is connected to his own home (but still private!)- so it was really easy to reach him out whenever we need some instructions. He made sure that we can get into the house.
There was crazy thunderstorm and the power was out for 1 hour, but it was okay.
The place is very clean and peaceful. Highly recommend to everyone!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely a beautiful and peaceful stay. Joes place is lovely and extremely clean. This is our second time staying here and we can‚Äôt wait to be back.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a wonderful stay with my husband and daughter. It was the perfect distance from Waco. Joe was a pleasure to meet! Will definitely stay here again if we make another trip to Waco.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was even better than the photos and description made it out to be! It was beautiful, clean, relaxing, and the unhindered views of the Texas countryside were incredible. The location was perfect, not far from I-35 so everything in Waco was easily accessible and quick to get to while also being far enough from town to truly unplug and unwind. Joe was very helpful and pleasant to interact with and even gave excellent recommendations on restaurants and especially coffee shops in the area and throughout Waco. I have stayed in other AIr B&Bs that were decent but this outshone them all for the convenience and peace of the location, as well as the the cleanliness and beauty which made this place and experience an incredible value. I couldn‚Äôt imagine recommending anything else for a visit to the Waco area."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a very beautifully built and decorated home. Very lovely. Beds were awesomely comfortable. Just very cozy all around. Thanks Joe for an amazing little place to get away to. Very much enjoyed it!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was an amazing stay! Such a nice little guest house on a farm. Perfect for a peaceful getaway. Joe was a great host and he was very attentive to us. Didn‚Äôt even know if he was on the property, that‚Äôs how private it was!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It felt very peaceful as soon as we got there. We loved the little swing outside ! The actual suite is beyond beautiful. There are so many small touches that make the place that more cool. More than enough sheets, towels, toiletries as well! There is a lot of thought they went into the place for sure. We ran into some car troubles and Joe really helped us out with a mechanic. Once we finally got that sorted and were leaving , Joe prayed for our safe travels which was so sweet - we are very appreciative of his hospitality during our trip. I will say, PLEASE be smart and stock up on mosquito repellent. You are deep in TX at this location lol. Overall, would recommend."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice place for a weekend getaway to Waco
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"This place was so beautiful! You can tell a lot of thought went into the space. There were a ton of extra towels and linens. The rooms were very cozy and spotless. The beds were SO comfortable. There was a lot of seasonings, which is nice if you want to cook. My favorite part was the chargers in both rooms on both sides of the bed.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at Joe‚Äôs Swiss-style guest house. It feels like home away from home. Joe is such a kind and gracious host. The location works so well for us when visiting our Baylor student since it‚Äôs an easy drive to Baylor (15-20 minutes depending on where you need to be on campus) and downtown Waco, but far enough removed from all the noise and bustle. It‚Äôs our little retreat. And it‚Äôs only minutes away from the Czech Stop for those fresh and delicious kolaches for breakfast! We rebooked already for our next trip to TX! Thank you, again, Joe!"

Beds and pillows were incredibly comfortable. Home is spotless!! Everything about our stay felt like a home away from home. Quiet, serene setting about 20 minutes from Baylor campus but easy to get there. Joe is so friendly. Can‚Äôt wait to return when we come to visit our Baylor Bear! So very highly recommended!!!! Joe, thank you for the wonderful hospitality- we felt very blessed to have stayed at your gorgeous guest house and look forward to our next visit. üêªüíöüíõ"

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,So peaceful and great space for a small family. Stopped here on our way North. Had to clean up a spot in the bathroom but I‚Äôm sure it was a mistake cause the rest of the place was spotless. Would def stay again. What a special place!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This AirBnB was even more beautiful IRL than the pictures. Thank you for a wonderful stay.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was absolutely beautiful! We stayed with our kiddos. They loved playing basketball in the front and running around out of doors. The place felt so homey when we walked inside and was very clean. The amenities did include shampoo and conditioner, which is a big plus to me as I often forget to bring such items. (We may have also forgotten our kids toothbrushes and I was relieved to find some fresh spares in the drawer). It was very relaxing and I would highly recommend staying here as a couple, girls weekend getaway, or a family stay."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Super cute guest house! Has everything you need.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Clean and quiet.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had an amazing time here at the guest house. It was relaxing, homey, and very peaceful. This place was perfectly nestled into the country and only 15 minutes away from the Waco area.
The kitchen is fully stocked and using everything was pain free. The enclosed patio made for a nice seating area as i drank my wine and read.
There are nice touches in the house like the portable speaker, the extra hygiene supplies and hair dryer in the bathroom, as well as the bedrooms are so cozy i didn‚Äôt want to leave. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a blessing to stay at Joe‚Äôs incredible place! Everything about this place felt special, peaceful, and intentional. It had everything our family needed, and we loved the cozy feel and being in the country. Loved reading the story of Joe‚Äôs wife & family‚Ä¶ definitely felt the legacy of hospitality and love in this space. We also enjoyed some of Joe‚Äôs suggestions from his guidebook‚Ä¶ Parker‚Äôs Park was our toddler‚Äôs favorite, and we loved the cinnamon rolls at Gerik‚Äôs! Both were local gems. Would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone considering it."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"My girlfriends and I stayed for 1 night to celebrate my birthday, and we were all so amazed at how soft the sheets were and how comfortable the beds were. (Two of my friends are pregnant, so being comfortable in a bed is no small order!)
I may be a bit biased as I was involved in the design of this airbnb, but I have not been involved on the hosting side of things since it opened up, and I wanted to experience it as a guest firsthand to make sure everything was going well.
I have to say‚Ä¶.I am very proud of how Joe (my father in law) has created wonderful systems to make staying here a breeze!
It smelled AMAZINGGGG when I walked inside. Fresh and clean and crisp. His wonderful housekeeper does an A++ job making sure the beds are fresh, the coffee is stocked, and everything is immaculate upon arrival!
To design a space is one thing. To operate a business is another thing entirely. Joe has done an amazing job! (I‚Äôm a proud daughter-in law)
My one critique: there was no sugar or honey to sweeten the coffee. I‚Äôm a bit of a wimp and take my coffee sweeet! After a quick chat, he brought some sugar over and I was able to have some coffee with my sugar! ;)
10/10 recommend this guest haus for your next stay.
(Ps‚Ä¶. Love you, Dad!)"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,the guest house is absolutely gorgeous. You feel a lot of love and peace in this place. the rules and the place of everything is all very clear. The decoration and design is beautiful. we want to return to this lovely place
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay at this gorgeous B&B. It's comfortable and peaceful and we loved the beautifully coordinated d√©cor. It was a great homebase for our visits to Waco and Ft Worth. We especially appreciated the well-appointed kitchen and how clean everything was. There were a lot of thoughtful touches and plenty of closet and counter space to put our personal things. We'd definitely stay again.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Joe‚Äôs house was truly so well put together with the highest degree of thoughtfulness. Every fixture and addition made the house feel so welcoming. The theme was utilized in every room and the beds were SO comfortable. 10/10 would stay there again!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joe‚Äôs place is beautiful and I highly recommend if you are looking for a peaceful getaway in the country. We enjoyed the fire pit and screened in porch. Views of sunset and surrounding countryside are lovely. What a treat it was to be away from all the loud sounds of the city. The bedrooms are very roomy, comfortable beds and black out curtains allow for sleeping in. There are plenty of large fluffy bath towels and throws for snuggling. Don‚Äôt miss out on this gem of a place. Located close to town of West and quick drive to Waco. Did I mention it is beautifully decorated and extremely clean. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house is beautifully decorated, and in our opinion, a great location. Wide open skies were great to look at. I wish we could have spent more time since this place was just too cute. Extremely clean! Would highly recommend staying here, and we may again if it‚Äôs available the next time we visit our daughter at Baylor."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,This Airbnb is beautifully decorated and in a great location. It‚Äôs the perfect family getaway.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We did a ""staycation"" here with a few friends from Waco one weekend and absolutely loved it! You get the feeling of being out in the country while still just a short drive from town (not to mention Style Station and the West kolaches!).
The place was extremely clean, and we appreciated all the snacks and coffee in the kitchen. The back deck was also beautiful to spend time in both late at night around the fire and early in the morning over coffee. Joe was also a wonderful host, quick to answer any of our questions over text.
A great spot to enjoy a peaceful getaway with 4-6 friends, whether you're in town for a Baylor game, Magnolia, or simply looking for a change of scenery somewhere quiet."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Staying here was truly an amazing experience. Every detail of the house tells a story that draws you in and transports you to somewhere far away. They have thought of everything you might need during your stay and went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable - including some of the softest sheets I‚Äôve ever felt.
Communication prior to our arrival was incredibly helpful. We knew exactly what to expect when we arrived. Joe was available if we needed anything during our stay. I really appreciate they have a later check out (11) so we didn‚Äôt have to rush out the door in the morning.
You HAVE to enjoy the back patio with a fire, sunset, and a glass of wine or a mug of hot chocolate. It‚Äôs dreamy!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"every piece of this Airbnb was so intentional! kitchen supplies, spices, toiletries if needed, baby gear + more! we felt so hosted + taken care of. the property is so beautiful ‚Äî walking around felt like a piece of heaven. if you want a peaceful retreat in waco, stay here!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Extremely relaxing and peaceful atmosphere. Very clean and detailed perfectly. Amenities are well thought out, readily available and professionally labeled for use.
Recommendations would be to place a label on the front door key pad entry device informing occupant to turn the small deadbolt below the keypad after entering the code. Also, place a label on the porch fire pit informing occupant that the lighting instructions are in the closed compartment area below. Joe was an excellent host. On a few occasions we contacted him with questions and he responded immediately with accurate and concise answers. All in all, this is a real winner as a comfortable BnB. Highly recommend this for anyone looking to have a special quiet country time away, while still being easily accessible to the city. The Swiss decor theme for this BnB is spot on. Thank you Joe for a very special and relaxing stay."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved, loved this place!!! Our only regret was not staying an extra night! But we‚Äôll be back!! We got to see a gorgeous Texas sunset and enjoy the beautifully decorated home! 100% recommend!"

They felt high in the trees. The deck was great and offered relaxing views. The location was quiet, even with kids excited to feed the miniature horse. We enjoyed making a fire to make smores. We enjoyed the sound of the running water from the creek. Garry and Tammy were very responsive and friendly. The location was not far from all the fun Waco destinations. Definitely would come back to this treehouse."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay here with our 2 families in 2 treehouses connected by a patio. Was extremely quiet and peaceful, very clean, and hosts were extremely accommodating! We took a tv and antenna so our kids could watch tv in bed since no WiFi or tech, but was a great escape from the city! Horse and dog were super sweet! Loved it and would stay again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our children loved this. The location is great and the hosts were very accommodating.
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"It was a lovely place. The cabin is not as spacious as we thought for four people, and grilling is difficult especially when it rains. Otherwise, a beautiful place that I'd recommend anyone to stay."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was adorable. So peaceful. I really enjoyed it.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I love their hospitality. Everything was very nice and the pony was a bonus.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great Treehouse! Beautiful,peaceful property. All the little touches in this place make it so homey and comfortable.

Host was super communicative and gave some good restaurant and sightseeing recommendations! Would definitely come back and enjoy this amazing hideaway."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the property, the treehouse was a fun and unique experience. Loved the animal presence, mini horse and sweet pup! Only complaint, water pressure in the shower was very low. Otherwise it was amazing, and we would stay again in the future!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The treehouse was a dream come true for our little adventuring family! My kids loved it! The house was clean, cozy, and idyllic.

The tree house was clean and cleaned up very well.
Host responds almost immediately and very friendly.
We had a great stay."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little gem tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the city but so close to everything we needed. The surprisingly expansive hideaway of the 3 treehouses behind Tammy and Coach's home was amazing! I would imagine it would be a bit tricky to find the place if you were showing up after dark though. But Tammy gave great instructions on how to navigate their unique little ""neighborhood.""
Our family had a much needed, quiet and peaceful stay to unwind from work and before the boys went back to school.
Our 3 boys really enjoyed exploring the property! We were greeted by Chocolate Chip, the house horse! That was absolutely thrilling for my boys!
The house was so well set up and cozy with such great attention to the smallest details.
We were originally booked to for the Coach's Quarter house but Tammy suggested since we were a family of 5 we'd be more comfortable in the Clubhouse. It was perfect!
We will definitely be back again....when it's cooler and the river is flowing!
Thanks"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great time! It was a lovely setting in nature. Lots of cicadas and crickets mixed with a miniature horse that was gentle and friendly. It was a great adventure that hopefully we‚Äôll be able to do again!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I loved staying at the treehouse in Waco! The home was clean, nicely decorated and fit our needs perfectly.

It will be a fun memory for my granddaughters as well as Chocolate Chip and Snickers! It was great to get away from the mountains of snow we are returning to in ND!
Our last AirBNB experience was disappointing so I am glad I gave it another chance and am able to write a good review. Thank you both for your hospitality and work you put into our stay!"

If you are looking for a Treehouse,I highly recommend Gary (Coach) & Tammy's place."

That also goes for their friendly dog, Sam, and their two ponies, who greeted us as we arrived. The treehouse is well structured, accommodating, and a delightful place to getaway for the weekend. It is well maintained and very comfortable whether you are inside or outside just hanging out on the balcony. The treehouse is also close to Cameron Park, a refreshing park to get out and enjoy a walk or bike ride. Additionally, you will have Cameron Park Zoo located next to the park, Magnolia Market, and last but not least there is a variety of places to eat within minutes of the treehouse. We definitely enjoyed our stay and HIGHLY recommend it!"

I love how the have a recommendation list of their favorite places to eat. Definitely made it easier on us!! Gary saw that we have 2 little boys so he decided to take them on a tour of the prooerty to meet some horses whice was totally unexpected but a great treat!!! We had a small issue with parking because we have a 40ft trailer with us but they did not hesitate to find us a solution. They have a total of 3 tree houses next to each other so we will definitely be back with family all the way from Florida!! Thanks Gary and Tammy!!!"

We enjoyed the local fare as well as the tourist attractions. Thanks to Gary and Tammy for a great Christmas present for our daughter. We look forward to visiting again soon.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was such a beautiful place, we booked it last minute as a surprise to our daughter for her 11th birthday. She loved it! We live like 30 min away so we‚Äôll definitely be back in the summer bc this stay was too cold 10-20 degrees on 12/22/22-12-24-22. We couldn‚Äôt do much outside. We will be back to let the kids play outside when it‚Äôs not too cold. The view was so beautiful watching the squirrels during the day just jumping on the tree branches. We enjoyed having family time. Thank you Gary and Tammy for everything."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The treehouse was perfect for our family of 4. The location feels like you are out of the city, but you are just a few minutes drive from anything you want to do in Waco. We appreciate Coach and Tammy‚Äôs hospitality, and we would definitely stay here again."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Gary and Tammy were great hosts! Gary took us around on his cart to see the horses. My 3yr old loved the tractor outside and seeing the horses. It was fun to climb the stairs to the loft and sleep upstairs and read books with him. Although the place is in the woods, it was just a 5-10 min drive to most attractions at Waco."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay in the treehouse was awesome! We have two kids that were so excited about ‚Äúsleeping in the trees.‚Äù They loved feeding the miniature horses and the s‚Äômores at the fire pit. We were able to make memories here.
The beds were comfy, the fridge had water (thank you) and coffee pods were a plus for us coffee lovers. It was close to Magnolia, grocery stores and eateries. Easy to access."

We also loved seeing Sam, Chocolate Chip and Snickers! Such a fun time!"
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,A very unique accommodation! Comfortable beds. Nice deck (bring mosquito repellant though). The loft has two of the three beds and is up a narrow stairway with a low ceiling at the top- careful or you might bump your head! The miniature horses that roam the property are adorable!

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My two daughters met me in Waco for a ‚Äúgirl‚Äôs weekend‚Äù. We are so glad we chose to stay in the treehouse.

It was nice to sit outside in the early mornings with a cup of coffee and watch squirrels in the trees above and listen for other wildlife. If we had it to do all over again we would definitely choose this place!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nothing left to be desired in this beautiful, quiet, tranquil, and perfect get away! Wether two people or a family, it‚Äôs the perfect way to unplug from the world! Amazing amenities, fabulous hosts, and just the right distance from the center of Waco!"

Location was quiet and peaceful, but we could get to anywhere in Waco in minutes."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had such a great and relaxing stay at this Treehouse! The Treehouse was an easy drive to so many fun Waco attractions - The Texas Ranger Museum, The Dr Pepper Museum, Baylor, the Silos, and so many more. At night, it felt like we were sleeping under the stars - nice and dark, super relaxing, and the A/C was perfect in this Texas heat! We highly recommend the Treehouse! We hope to book another weekend stay in the future :)"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bucket list check-off!
This treehouse was absolutely perfect! We especially loved having coffee on the porch in the morning while chillin in the rocking chairs! (We saw a fox run across the creek bed!)
There‚Äôs such a great variety of trees to shade the porch!
Even though it‚Äôs close to popular Waco destinations, you truly felt like you were in the middle of nowhere!
Every detail they have put into the treehouse truly makes this a one-of-a-kind place!
Coach & Tammi are very friendly and sweet!
Thank you for everything!
***check out their restaurant recommendations!!! We agree with your assessment!
Blessings!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a great experience for my family! We loved the treehouse and the animals they have came to visit us (2 small horses and a dog). It is a unique and beautiful place to stay. Gary was so friendly and nice and made us feel like part of the family.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at the treehouse! Came with friends from college for our annual reunion and we loved the unique experience and meeting the horses.
The location was close to downtown Waco and everything we wanted to do. Gary and Tammy‚Äôs recommendations were on point, we didn‚Äôt have a single bad meal the whole trip!
Only thing to note is that the bathroom privacy was a slight issue. The doors to the bathroom were more like shutter doors than actual doors. With the mirror placement if anyone was showering/getting ready we could see them! We fixed this by hanging a blanket over the door to cover the mirror‚Äôs reflection.
Thanks again to Gary and Tammy for the awesome stay!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Quiet treehouse sitting next to a peaceful stream. The inside of the treehouse smells like fresh cedar! This was the perfect weekend get-away. Thank you Gary and Tammy!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We took this impromptu trip from the city and it was perfect!! Just to get away with our girls was great, gave us time to connect with them and get away from electronics!! We enjoyed the late nights, board games and even did some painting as a family!

2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a perfect Airbnb experience! The treehouse is delightful and so peaceful! We found ourselves choosing to stay there relaxing on the porch over going to find other things to do. Communication with Coach was effortless and he was so wonderful to visit with when he popped down to say hi. Check in and out instructions we‚Äôre clear and simple. The minis on the property are adorable and friendly and were so sweet and playful with Sam the shepherd ‚Ä¶.also sweet and friendly! We couldn‚Äôt recommend this highly enough and will be back again one day ourselves!

Coach and Tammy were very nice and welcoming too."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful treehouse crafted with love! The pictures do not do it justice. We enjoyed smores at the campfire with the ""mini""taurs, they were curious little horses. Tammy's and Gary's restaurant recommendations were spot on!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The treehouse is so much fun! Excellent communications with the owners. Great location within 15 minutes of downtown shopping. We went for a girls weekend. The treehouse very comfortably accommodated all four of us. It has all the amenities of traditional AirBnBs. You won‚Äôt really be cooking but bring snacks, drinks, and Door Dash delivers there. The outside decks are inviting. The beds are super comfortable. The loft area is really cute. One of the best places we‚Äôve stayed and w3‚Äôll be back!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The treehouse is a very cool place to stay for a few nights. While not very large, it still packs a lot in that space and there is tons of space outside. And who doesn‚Äôt love mini horses coming by to greet you and hangout!"

Also said they will long remember the place. Had fun in Waco too!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I really enjoyed our stay here! The treehouse was so welcoming and comfortable. My 4 yr old loves all the room there was to run and play. He loved tossing rocks into the creek.
The Cameron Park Zoo is close by and we liked it. Very relaxing trip, can‚Äôt wait visit again."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Top notch, cozy, fun, relaxing, and convenient! We stayed at the treehouse and had breakfast at Homestead Heritage before a Baylor basketball game. The treehouse was well situated for all these activities. We also hit up Jon Lillies Steakhouse for a quick dinner just down the road. Oreo and Chocolate chip (miniature horses).along with the stack of wood for the campfire made the stay one to remember for years to come."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Treehouse was such a great experience! Never have we stayed in such unique accommodations, and we had such fun livin‚Äô the life for a couple of days!

Everyone needs to experience the Treehouse!"

2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed from the 23rd-26th of December. It was such a fun way to spend Christmas with my 3 little kids. The place was beautifully decorated with lights and a tree, making it more magical.
The highlight with the ability to run in the openness, play in the creek and care for the sweet little mini ponies.
Hosts are wonderful and stayed in touch with us as needed and responded quickly to any questions or concerns.
Recommend for anyone looking for magical simplicity."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,My kids and I loved staying at the treehouse! It was a unique and wonderful experience. It is out of the way but minutes away from Waco's modern conveniences. What a great way to get back to nature!

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The CUTEST Treehouse AirBNB we‚Äôve ever stayed in! The area it‚Äôs in is absolutely gorgeous! The trees and natural landscape are so beautiful and serene that we never wanted to leave the space. We happened across Gary and Tammy‚Äôs listing and immediately knew we wanted to stay here! The space is super clean and the bed is so comfy! Every detail about the treehouse was thoughtfully implemented to create a very memorable experience. The miniature horses Oreo & Chocolate Chip are the honorary greeters and they reminded us of fairy horses in a secluded woodland ready to make friends who happen on their home.
We got to meet Gary-the owner- and we throughly enjoyed chatting with him the morning of our departure. We told him we would definitely be back when we visit Waco again!!!
Thank you Gary & Tammy for allowing us to stay in your gorgeous & homey Treehouse!!"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't imagine a better place to stay in Waco! First, it was off in the wooded back-yard acreage of a VERY upscale neighborhood, along a beautiful creek. We felt so secluded, yet very safe. The pictures show you how beautiful the place is. They had the fridge stocked with drinks, and the counter stocked with snacks. The 3 beds were comfortable. We met Gary twice as he came to feed horses. He even offered (and we accepted) a tour of the pastures on his Kawasaki Mule. We got to see their 5 day old longhorn and 10 day old mini horse! Their dog, Sam was a ham, stealing the alfalfa cubes from the horses. We felt like we were staying with old friends. It was a fantastic experience!
THANK YOU!
Sic 'em Bears!
Koehler Family"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you so much for providing a unique get away for our 27th wedding anniversary! The treehouse was so clean, cute and cozy, and the recommendations for restaurants and activities were extremely helpful. Our favorite part of Waco was Heritage Homestead."

2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at the Treehouse was fabulous. We were in town visiting our daughters at Baylor and this was the perfect location and lodging for the weekend. Our younger son had a great time running around, petting the miniature ponies, and playing cornhole while we had a relaxing spot to visit with our older daughters. It was only about 15-17 minutes to campus and we loved having a quiet, beautiful spot to come back to. The lodging is fun, our son thought staying in a treehouse was cool, but for the adults it was also very comfortable and Gary and Tammy had thought of lots of little touches to make us even more comfortable (coffee, waters, snacks, soaps). Very clean. Very comfortable beds. Overall a fantastic stay for our family."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is one of a kind. The pictures and descriptions do not do it justice. It‚Äôs beautiful, very clean and was a perfect stay!

2021-09-01,5,Group trip,Great relaxing getaway!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can not say enough good things about our stay at the tree house! It has been near impossible to relax in 2021, and the four days my husband and I spent at the tree house were the most peaceful of our life. The location is great and extremely close to several shops, restaurants, and gas stations. It was extremely clean and more than we expected. The shower is amazing and the hot water is outstanding. My favorite place is outside on the deck, there is barely any street noise and all you can hear is nature noises. We came for a wedding and only had one day to explore Waco and chose to actually spend it at the treehouse. Finally, chocolate chip and Oreo were such an amazing additional perk. They were so sweet and we loved getting to meet them. Thank you Tammy and Gary for the perfect weekend."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful and unique place to stay! Hosts were very helpful in providing directions to their place. We appreciated the personal touches like leaving a list of their favorite restaurants and gifting us a bottle of wine since we were celebrating our anniversary!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"As a family of 6; it was the perfect stay for ALL ages! We had the best time, not only was the stay tranquil and unique but the added touches of Tammy and Coach were absolutely perfect!

We really don‚Äôt have any complaints."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at the treehouse! The location is far enough away to disconnect, but a quick drive to all of what Waco has to offer.
The treehouse itself is spectacular. Coach and Tammy have added so many beautiful touches that just make the place so accommodating."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying in this little treehouse! It was just what our little family needed for a weekend getaway.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cleanliness, accuracy, check-in, communication, location, and value all deserve 5+ stars. The treehouse and surrounding property is simply beautiful, magical, and the space is used brilliantly. The gorgeous ramp (lit up at night time) makes this treehouse so accessible. The wrap-around porches with lovely seating areas are a heavenly place to relax with a cup of coffee while listening to the song birds. The accommodations are magnificent with truly comfortable beds, lovely bedding all around, loft and great room with spectacular windows with zebra blinds, huge rain shower area with sparkling shades of blue tile, fantastic AC, Keurig coffee maker and snacks provided that my grandchildren loved, two fascinating miniature horses, and high-end details all around. As I sit here at my computer at home, I wish I was still there and can't wait to go back for more peace and relaxation in the Fall!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thank you! Gary and Tammy were excellent hosts! Very accommodating and welcoming!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This amazing treehouse is a piece of paradise. If you are in Waco....this is the place to stay. The attention to detail is wonderful. The craftsmanship, care, warmth, and quaintness is five star ‚≠êÔ∏è The location is perfect, and Gary and Tammy are the epitome of graciousness. The miniature ponies...icing on the cake. üê¥"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Treehouse was amazing! It‚Äôs so quiet and peaceful! We loved sitting on the deck over looking the creek and relaxing. The inside of the house was great too. The finishings were beautiful and our little boys loved the loft area. They can‚Äôt stop talking about our fun weekend!! This was definitely an awesome tiny house experience in the trees!! Thank-you again to Coach and Tammy for being such amazing hosts.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our girls‚Äô trip at the treehouse was idyllic. Just the perfect space for relaxing, playing with the miniature horses on the property, and enjoying all that Waco had to offer. It was close enough to everything we wanted to see, but secluded so that we felt like we had plenty of privacy and space! Would definitely stay again!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The tree house is very cozy! Its is furnished perfectly.. just beautiful .. you have everything you need! The beds and pillows are soo comfortable! I am a mom of a 13 yr old boy who is 5 10' n a 10yr old girl who is 5 foot and we fit comfortably in the loft area. My sister and brother in law had plenty of room down stairs bed. The tree house looked rustic from the outside and well kept but the inside you feel you are in a luxurious hotel! But honestly i felt right at home!!! Will come here again!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This treehouse is beautiful and my family of 5 absolutely loved it! There was plenty of room for all of us. It was so nice to get away and not have a TV and for us to just be together. The kids loved the miniature horses and feeding them. Gary and Tammy were great hosts! My husband threw out his back near the end of our trip and they were kind enough to bring us some things to make sure he was comfortable. I HIGHLY recommend this place!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Deserves ten stars. I can't say enough about it. Comfortable, clean, quiet, peaceful are just a few of the words we used to describe this amazing Treehouse. Everything you need is right at your fingertips. We arrived late, and it felt like it was welcoming us home as we drove up to the beautifully lit walkway. It was Fourth of July weekend, and yet there was very little noise. The owners, Coach and Tammy, were the sweetest hosts. They went above and beyond what we expected."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed staying at the treehouse! It is so unique and comfortable! Everything was so clean and cozy!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place. So unique and such attention to detail. We felt very at home and comfortable.
2021-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great visit in the treehouse! It was such a unique experience, which is what we were looking for. We received great instructions on how to find the treehouse and check in was super easy. We stayed during the heat of the summer and the downstairs portion of the treehouse remained very cool and comfortable with the air conditioning unit on. The loft area was more difficult to keep cool. There is one small personal fan the owners have provided for the loft, but it cannot point at both beds at the same time. We were still able to sleep upstairs, but it definitely does not cool off like the main area. The owners did a great job with the craftsmanship of the treehouse. We had a fantastic overall stay, and the lights at night make the treehouse pretty dreamy!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful spot in Waco! Close enough to everything you want to see and do, but away from the hustle and bustle. We came on a mother & two daughters trip and enjoyed our time! The horses were a big hit and our new BFF‚Äôs üòâ and we loved the beautiful area as well. Sitting on the porch was super relaxing. The only thing I missed was maybe an extra mirror for the room for the girls trip üôÉ We were grateful to have a microwave in the room! We would definitely stay here again and would recommend to everyone!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The treehouse was so fun! There are spaces to sit outside and enjoy the view. It has everything you could possibly need - just bring your clothes. Comfortable bedding, clean and beautiful spaces. Coach and Tammy were communicative and friendly. Thanks again, guys for a wonderful trip. üòä"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I will be suggesting this place to everyone!!! It was so fun and peaceful. The view was excellent. Everywhere you look in the treehouse had fun person touches. My husband and I will definitely be back!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This treehouse was everything we hoped for and more! It is in a quiet location but close to everything we wanted to see in Waco. It was also very clean and homey. Gary (Coach) and Tammy were very responsive to our messages. We definitely want to return to the treehouse someday!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is without a doubt the coolest AirBnB we have ever stayed at. The amazing Tammy and Coach have created something truly magical. Coach's Quarters by the Creek is stunning in every way. To quote our 6 year old's vocabulary, this getaway is ""epic, extraordinary, next level, and wonderful."" That last one really resonates because every thoughtful inch has been handmade and designed by a beautiful couple full of love and wonder. From the homeplate at the base of the ramp that makes you feel like a winner every time you step on it, to the gorgeous views of the enchanting neighborhood with a flowing creek clear enough to spot the little fish swimming by, to the relevantly designed gym wood floors, to the artistic mosaics, to the luxurious rain shower, to the whimsical indoor ""outhouse"", to the perfectly Feng shui'd and uber comfortable furniture, to the masterfully placed windows that maximize natural light and achieve serene privacy, to the charming, character filled knickknacks and heartwarming decorations, this family designed and built custom treehouse is truly the epitome of wonderful.
Yet if that wasn't enough, on the property are two of the friendliest miniature pony sisters, Chocolate Chip and Oreo. They followed our daughter and loved on her from the very first minute she stepped out of the car. Then there's the sweet treehouse pup, Sam, who loves the back rubs and makes sure everyone is safe and well. Lastly and most importantly, you have the most gracious, passionate, and deserving hosts you can find. The level of artistry, passion, discipline, precision, elegance, and joy that Tammy is famous for delivering with her choirs is quite tangibly present and alive in her treehouse.
Honestly the only negative thing is that this place is pretty much booked every weekend in the foreseeable future, but if you can snatch up some dates, don't hesitate. It is worth every penny, and it is still incredibly underpriced. Most treehouses in Texas are at least double what this rare gem is being listed as, and that won't last long because AirBnB controls part of the price regulation so book your next getaway here as fast as you can!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The tree house is a wonderful place to stay! It is very clean, peaceful and beautiful."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the treehouse. If you are looking for some downtime, this is the perfect place to chillax. It is amazing to wake up surrounded by lush greeneries along with the sweet chirping of the birds. The house is compact and has everything you will need. And it is not too far from the town. We had a lovely time and would definitely be back!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The best Airbnb place that we ever stayed in. The treehouse is so pretty. It looks exactly like the pictures maybe better. The location is secluded, quiet and very relaxing. The views were amazing. We really had a great time as a family. No Tv, no wifi, just the nature, board games and the tree house experience.

2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at the Barkley house for one night on a work trip. The airbnb is a private questhouse behind a home. This was my first stay in an Airbnb, and I was nervous because I‚Äôm a very private person. I travel for work and my nephew encouraged me to try something new.
I could‚Äôve easily missed the property, but Michele‚Äôs directions made it easy to find. The neighborhood is lovely. It was less than a five minute drive from work, and near the lake, hospitals and shopping centers. To access the airbnb you have to climb stairs. This is clearly depicted in the pictures, but I‚Äôm pointing this out for travelers who may have heavy luggage or mobility issues. Accessing the place was easy; there‚Äôs a coded keypad on the door that was easy to use. The space was beautiful. It‚Äôs one large room which was plenty for my needs. It was clean, uncluttered and smelled nice. The water pressure in the shower was great, linens comfortable. The internet was spotty, but didn‚Äôt bother me much. Overall great stay."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Barkley House was so cozy and perfect for our weekend getaway! There are TONS of things to do all within about a ten minute drive and the house is in a great neighborhood. Super cute studio with the coziest atmosphere and sweet pup neighbor.

Plenty of natural light during the day, and blinds and curtains for the night-time. Excellent location, too! I also appreciated having the iron and ironing board to touch up my clothes.

2022-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I echo the other positive reviews especially for the prompt response, hospitable extra touches, convenient location, and great value. As a new AirBnB user I would just point out that what is described as a ""one bedroom"" in some regions of the country would be considered a ""studio"" in others. Also if you are allergic to perfumes /scents, you might ask the host to remove the plug-in air freshener before your stay."

Needs a couch or comfortable seating.. only the bed or 2 metal chairs. I had to do a lot of study and research and the kitchen table was inadequate especially because no good reading or study lamp.

Thank you for the experience"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Definitely a hidden gem, well worth the price!! Incredibly clean, made for a great getaway spot that won‚Äôt break the bank"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Despite having a hiccup when I arrived, Cameron & Danielle made sure I was taken care of. Their home & neighborhood (just like Waco, in general) is a little old & worn but that's what gives it its character. The neighborhood isn't the nicest but after pulling into the driveway & having my own space to park & walk into, all my worries disappeared. I came on this trip alone & not once did I feel unsafe in their home. I loved that their home was so close to everything & downtown! Bed was super comfy & it was nice to be able to watch tv after a long day. It was super hot in Waco & the AC worked perfectly. Shower pressure wasn't the best but did it's job. The room was nice, clean, quiet & quaint. I also got a lucky chance to meet the dog, didn't catch his name, he was too busy chasing squirrels running up trees but he was super friendly. Thank you for making my visit welcoming. I loved this little space & would absolutely stay here again!"

2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a great stay at Cameron‚Äôs place! We were in Waco for my graduation at Baylor and it was a great spot to stay to be close to downtown and the Baylor campus. Their home has everything that we needed and for the price was a great deal!
One of the things I really appreciated was the fridge had filtered water. I‚Äôve been to many Airbnb‚Äôs that don‚Äôt have that, and it was great to not have to buy water.
Another great amenity was having AC and a fan in the home. We visited when it was 106 degrees!! But the AC held up and worked perfectly! The unit can be a little confusing to navigate so it may be useful to get instructions from the hosts.
The only thing to note is we did have some issues with the shower being inconsistent with the hot and cold temperatures. However, the hosts were informed of this issue and are responsive and seem dedicated to resolve any problems.
Overall our stay was great and I would 100% recommend to anyone looking to visit Waco ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, no issues. Highly recommend."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly like the pictures, very easy to find and check in/out! On our first night however there were limited towels/wash rags but the owners were very fast with getting brand new towels and wash rags delivered! I loved how close everything was just about everywhere we had planned to go and do was within 10-15 minute drive of the actual Air BNB which was nice!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Staying here was great! Cameron was very communicative and everything was very clean. I appreciated the flexible check-in process and the amenities. Would definitely recommend!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a peaceful and enjoyable time while staying at this location in Waco. The suite and en-suite were spotless! We had our own parking spot on the premises. Will definitely stay there again when we go back to Waco.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay. Very peaceful and close to everything we needed in town.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a great place. The bed was so comfortable. The one room Bnb was very roomy and decorated nicely. It was very quite. I loved that I didn‚Äôt hear any road noise. My only complaint is the security light outside of one of the windows shined in the room at night. The window had blinds but it could use a curtain to cut out the light. It was a great stay!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you‚Äôre looking for a good clean spot to spend your weekend in Waco. Look no further. Cost effective, clean, and fairly close to all the Magnolia related adventures."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I only stayed one night here, but I felt comfortable and the king size bed was perfect!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable beds, place looked just as described. My ONLY complaint would be the neighborhood. Surrounded by very rundown houses & we were not sure if it was a safe area. But very close to downtown Waco which is what we came for."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our weekend in Waco and Cameron‚Äôs place was just perfect. Very gracious and attentive host! Comfy bed, clean and newly updated house. It was perfect for what we needed. Will definitely return in the future!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So clean! So cute! Very cozy, will def come back!"
2023-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"Spent one night and space looked like photos posted. Neighborhood was quiet and we felt safe. Neighborhood accurately reflected what was posted. Decorating style was cozy and minimalist. Appreciated the kettle & easy log-ins to streaming devices. Two parking spaces were provided & about a 10 minute drive to downtown. Contacted host since one towel was provided and she responded quickly. Noticed hair on comforter and bed sheets (informed host). When collecting towels from dryer, I saw clean sheets and changed them myself. Unit smelled like bug spray (informed host) & had to spray some perfume to mask the smell. Unfortunately, the bug spray didn‚Äôt seem to work since beetles were coming inside the unit. We killed about 10 beetles that evening, as well as flies/gnats."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great location for my Waco stay! Cameron provided great hospitality and a very cozy atmosphere for a home away from home! Would definitely return for a future trip!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location! Drove passed some run down homes to get there, but it never felt unsafe. The place is beautifully remodeled and the off street parking was a plus. It is so close to everything! I was at Baylor, parks or the Silos in minutes. Room was nice and bed was very comfy. Almost anything you might need was there except there isn't any place to hang up your clothes and no drawers so everything stayed in the suitcase for the week. I don't want to sound picky but future guest should know that detail. Cameron was very accommodating to my schedule and I really appreciated it. All in all I can honestly say that I really enjoyed my stay and would definitely stay there again!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super nice, Jesus loving people! Beautiful apartment!"
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Other than the heater/AC unit not functioning it was a great stay. The AC unit only blew regular air but not cold or hot air.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,This listing was perfect and we enjoyed our stay at Cameron‚Äôs place. The studio was beautiful and matched the pictures. The decor and space made it feel like home. We loved how close everything in proximity to the studio and there are some really neat things to do 8-10 minutes away. Cameron was really helpful and responsive with any questions asked. I recommend this listing to anyone looking for a beautiful place to stay in Waco. 10/10.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Communication with Cameron was stellar! The Airbnb was clean, uncluttered and everything we needed."

2023-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"The place is cute, they did a great job renovating. As they mentioned, the neighborhood is a little rough looking and can be noisy. The only downside to our stay was the fact that we couldn‚Äôt get the AC working properly. We always sleep with it on as we run hot and I can‚Äôt sleep when I‚Äôm too warm. By the time I realized it wasn‚Äôt pushing out cold air it was a bit late and I wasn‚Äôt able to get a response from the hosts. Other than that it was a nice studio Airbnb. The bed and pillows were comfortable!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place to stay in Waco!

2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Really nice place just like the pictures. Only like 5 minutes away from magnolia farms. Just the short drive from Airbnb in the neighborhood to town was very sketchy and felt uncomfortable. Neighborhood is very run down , Really the only bad part about our stay . Everything else was pretty good, you do have to share a laundry room with the longer tenants next to you which was ok."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Stayed here for a week by myself and absolutely loved my stay!! Owners were super responsive and friendly. I also loved all the included amenities, made staying somewhere for a week so much more home like!!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cameron's place was perfect for our little getaway and a short distance to shops and restaurants. I would highly recommend it to anyone!

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cameron‚Äôs place was just as described! As many reviews stated the bed is very comfortable! I have always found that to be hit or miss with airbnbs. The kitchen was beautiful and the filtered water from the fridge was an added bonus! We would definitely book again.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"A great deal and easy spot near the hustle and bustle of Waco! Felt totally safe even though the neighborhood is a hot tub down. The place was spotless and it was perfect for us just passing through and needing a clean, comfy space. The bed was so comfy and we heard zero noise from the main house. Highly recommend!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I‚Äôm 73 years old and this was my first experience with staying at a AirB&B.
it‚Äôs so much better than staying in motels. No echos of slamming doors or people walking down the halls talking. The host, the room and accommodations were excellent. I was five minutes driving time to down town where I needed to be. Next year I may have to return to Waco and I‚Äôm hoping I will be able to stay at Cameron‚Äôs Air B&B. What else can I say. Just Excellent!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super clean and updated. host is very quick to respond. will stay here again if we visit the waco area!

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect little place to stay in Waco! 10 minutes or less from all the touristy spots, very comfortable bed, and cutest place.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,They were incredible host! We loved the experience and they went above and beyond to create an experience for my wife and I. They also went above and beyond with helping us invest in our marriage. Highly recommend!

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cameron is very communicative and proactive to make sure you have a great stay. The bed and linens were very comfortable. The mattress may be a Tempur-pedic, and the comforter was the perfect weight for us. Usually, the mattress quality is a hit or miss at hotels, or other places, and comforters are too light to enjoy a good night's rest. Not here! Thank you for investing in bedding!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved the airbnb! We were in town for the Baylor x TCU game and this was in a great location. Easy to get around and Uber everywhere in Waco. Check-in was seamless and the place was very clean. Will definitely be staying again. Thank you!!

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had to cancel our plans last minute so never stayed here. I have given it five stars because Cameron, the host, was very communicative and helpful to work with. I am sure his place is equally up to these high standards based on my experience!"

Communication was easy with the owner and nothing was a problem.
I can recommend this studio to anyone wishing to visit Waco."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is cute, spacious and clean! I am super particular about cleanliness and a bit of a germophobe but I was completely at ease here knowing the space was clean! The sheets and pillows were spotless, the floors were clean and the bathroom had recently been cleaned. Though this place seemed to be in sort of rough neighborhood, there were absolutely no issues and it's located about 5 minutes away from all the nice restaurants and bars. Cameron and Daniel were super responsive and the lines of communication were always open. They are truly there to help and are awesome hosts. We loved staying here and would stay here if we ever visit Waco again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This little studio is perfect for a cozy weekend! We loved the style and looks and that led us to booking. The studio was stocked with anything we needed and was very clean. Cameron is a great host and was prompt to reply to all my questions! It is located in a slightly older neighborhood but don‚Äôt let looks stray you away. This stay worked out perfect for my husband and I as we were in town to go to the Magnolia area. It was roughly 10 minutes (or less) of a drive.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing! We‚Äôve had the opportunity to stay in 3 of Cameron‚Äôs airBnB‚Äôs and this one was our favorite. Always clean, super accommodating, and I love the decor in each place. Must stay in Waco!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was great for us. Extremely clean and comfortable. You can tell it is recently renovated. We were in Waco to move our daughter into college and it is easy to get to and from Baylor from the house. We did not eat in the house but there is plenty of room for even four people to eat in. Overall a great place to be. We hope to stay here in the future.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really cute studio. Cameron was very easy to work with. All the amenities and personal touches made for a fantastic stay. Clean, comfortable, quiet, and spacious. You won't regret staying here. Close to everything."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed at Cameron's for a weekend. We were up house hunting and needed somewhere close to both downtown, and all of the listings we were going to see. The place is only 10 minutes to everything downtown. We like to walk and even walked to downtown one evening to dinner and then took Uber back. The walk downtown to Austin Avenue was only 20 minutes for us.
The place is beautiful inside and the bed was comfortable. We were out and about for most of our stay so we did not make use of the kitchen. We would definitely stay here again the next time we're in town."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Although my stay was quick, I loved this little studio. Good size, large comfortable bed with good linens, and the kitchen is awesome (great for long stays. Big fridge, full size oven). Lots of care and attention put into this unit."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great communication. Nice little property being updated in an older neighborhood. Had an issue during our stay, but Cameron was quick to respond to work through it. Thanks!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This space is just beautiful and the pictures don‚Äôt give it justice. Cameron is super responsive and you will have everything you need for the most relaxing stay. We enjoyed drinking coffee on the covered patio area at the table and chairs that were set up and relaxed after a fun filled day enjoying the cool breeze and there‚Äôs even games to play if you want. Uno anyone? LoL! We‚Äôre definitely booking here again! We‚Äôd give 10 stars but it only goes up to 5.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great spot! Very clean home, and nice hosts!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The hosts were excellent communicators, made the check in/check out experience easy, and even threw in some fun ‚Äúmust dos‚Äù"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! Very cute place, had everything I needed."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I wanted a romantic getaway with my partner and this studio delivered! Believe it or not, It is way more cozy in person, the pictures do not do it justice! It is perfectly located to near everything. The HEB is only 6 minutes away and Magnolia only 10 minutes away. Cameron was super helpful and communicative that everything went smoothly. I am definitely recommending this place to friends and family!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved being able to support another family in ministry!! Attentive and super quick to respond to any messages sent. Not to mention the place was absolutely adorable! Stay here!! You won't regret it!
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Great location and many things to do in the area. Host was very responsive and the pillows were so comfortable!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were amazed that it looked amazing as the pictures. Loved the style and the amenities were wonderful. Now I want to invest in a water filter like the one we got to use there. Bed was comfy, the dish wear showed the excellence in taste and not cheap. Can‚Äôt say enough on the overall feel and design from every aspect. We would come again. It‚Äôs easy to walk to Magnolia from there."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Hands down the best AirBnB we‚Äôve stayed at! Home is thoughtfully decorated, and sparkling clean. Nice driveway to the back with a nice private entry space. Such close proximity to Magnolia. Looking forward to our next stay!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An absolutely gem of a property! Yes, it‚Äôs as stunning as it looks, and it really is just a few blocks from all things Magnolia. Quiet neighborhood, felt very aafe on our girls‚Äô trip. Thorough instructions for everything, and the place was spotless. Can‚Äôt recommend enough and cannot wait to return. Until then, I‚Äôm quite jealous of the sweet kitties who get to enjoy that beautiful patio. ;)"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay. The home is beautiful, had everything you could even think of you may need, and was a perfect location to walk all around Magnolia!
The host was wonderful and easy to work with!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,The Wishing House was the perfect location for exploring all things Waco and Magnolia. The location is within a few minutes walking distance to the silos. We loved having morning coffee at Magnolia Press before the crowds arrived. The home had every comfort of home and then some! The memory foam mattresses were a nice surprise after being on the road for several days! This is the most well appointed Airbnb we‚Äôve ever stayed in. The snacks and cereal were much appreciated! If we are even in the area again we will not hesitate to stay here!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Wishing House is absolutely perfect!! Adorable, very well appointed, clean, every detail was perfect!!
Highly, HIGHLY recommend!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at the Wishing House was perfect for touring Magnolia Silos and other local antique stores. We felt safe and loved just walking to the Silos Bakery etc. There was a loud party at the Backyard venue nearby but the sound machine, earplugs and blinds provided were very helpful! Thank you for the fun mother daughter getaway! We really loved our stay!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at The Wishing House was everything we hoped it would be. We traveled from TN to experience Magnolia Market and many other things Waco had to offer.
Bethany was extremely pleasant and professional to deal with through the process.
Also, this home was easily the most outfitted Air BnB we have ever stayed in. The house was a huge part in the comfort of our trip. We were really able to relax while being there. The Kitchen was great, bathrooms were huge, space was perfect, outside was amazing, and location was unmatched!
Thank you again for contributing to our overall experience!
-The Bakers"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Wishing House was AMAZING! Walking distance to everything too which i think is a huge plus! We walked everywhere. The house is just so tasteful decorated , amazing outdoor are, perfect space for our family. Had great game, swings, projector for movies outside and we enjoyed a nice fire outside with our family. I would highly recommend staying here and if we ever come back to the area this is where we will stay."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is beautiful with an aesthetic interior. The cleanliness is impeccable! The location is perfect if you are visiting Magnolia. It is under a 5 minute walk to Magnolia from this house. The area itself is a bit underdeveloped, however, most of the houses in close proximity are AirBnBs with tourists visiting Magnolia and the Silos. There is one bedroom downstairs with a full size washroom and one bedroom upstairs with a full size bathroom. I would highly recommend staying at this house!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful time we had at The Wishing House! Very clean, close to everything, beautiful decorated and even had some snacks for us. Communication was on point. We absolutely loved that we could walk to everything we wanted to. We would definitely stay here again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a beautiful, clean place to stay while we visited with family and enjoyed the town of Waco and Baylor‚Äôs campus."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lovely home! Clean, and accommodating to my party of 6. The kiddos enjoyed the backyard along with the outdoor projector. The location is perfect walking distance to the silos and other attractions. Two concerts played at ‚Äúthe backyard‚Äù during our stay and surprisingly it was not loud in the downstairs part of the house, a little loud in the upstairs but nothing the tv couldn‚Äôt drown out. 10/10 would recommend and stay again!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous getaway! We will be back.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely loved staying at The Wishing House! Easy access to Magnolia/The Silos, Milk Bottle Cookies, Union Hall and Spice Village! Lots of food options nearby. The house was spotless and had everything we needed! Such a cozy vibe and fun outdoor space! We loved watching a movie on the projector outside and sitting in the relaxing swings! Will definitely stay here again"
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"Wow!! 5 plus Stars!! This was the most well thought out Airbnb I have ever stayed at! Beautifully designed/decorated, super comfy beds, beautiful bathrooms(those showers!!!), amazing kitchen, outdoor space was awesome, great parking, stocked with everything you might need, great communication and walkable to all the downtown areas of Waco! We enjoyed our stay at The Wishing House so much! Thank you, Bethany for sharing your beautiful place with us!! A must stay!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Just a great home, really lovely! Thoughtful design, spacious, outdoor space is awesome too! Location is perfect if you‚Äôre planning around the Silos, but quick and easy to downtown too. Highly recommend The Wishing House!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Bethany is definitely a ‚ÄúSuperhost‚Äù. A beautiful house and a great outdoor area.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to stay within walking distance to great local hot spots. The house was private, upscale & had everything we needed & then some."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Great location to downtown Waco. It is in the portion of Waco that is slowly being revitalized. We are from Waco so very familiar with area. You can literally sit on the balcony and or downstairs patio and listen to The Backyard‚Äôs entertainment they have for the evening (but if inside it doesn‚Äôt bother you). We rented it for wedding weekend for my daughter and her bridal party. It was perfect! Well stocked, plenty of inside and outside amenities to enjoy. The patio area is amazing. Also, know for sleeping arrangements since there are no single beds you can easily fit as big of an air mattress you need. One king bed is downstairs and one is upstairs. Then you have the pullout sofa. Overall an amazing place and I will recommend to clients and would rent again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow. What a great place to stay. Not only was The Wishing House beautifully decorated but it was so well thought out as a hosting space. The little details stood out like the filtered water, the stocked ice in the freezer, the snacks, and even a kiosk telling the history of the house. My coworker and I are trying to make excuses for another stay. Amazing place!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful and comfortable home close to local attractions. Highly recommended!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,The Wishing House is amazing! It was so well done inside and out. Was such a beautiful and comfortable place for my family to stay while in Waco. Super short walk to Magnolia didn‚Äôt hurt either! The back yard patios and the deck where super cool. There was even snacks available which was awesome! We WILL stay here again for sure when we make our way back to Waco!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family really enjoyed staying at The Wishing House. It was a clean, luxurious accommodation with everything we needed. The short walk to the Silos was a big perk for us. We hope you enjoy your stay there based off our recommendation!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place for two couples. Both bedrooms have king beds plus their own private bathrooms. Each floor also has its own thermostat which was also a plus. The music from a nearby bar is loud which we had been warned about. We took our box fan and that was helpful.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The best Airbnb ever!!! Cannot wait to go back!!! Couldn‚Äôt have been more perfect!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Immaculate home within walking distance to the silos. The house is well stocked, super comfortable, and the perfect accommodations for a small family or girls trip."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Pictures don‚Äôt do this place any justice. Truly outstanding. Everything about this place was beautiful. The owners thought of every detail. So close to everything. Felt very safe with the location. Host were super nice and helpful and responded super quick anytime I needed. Before we left we were already saying how we couldn‚Äôt wait to come back to this beautiful home!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a special home! Extremely clean and had everything we could need. Location was perfect! Host was responsive as well. We had two babies and we were worried about the music from The Backyard Bar - IF you are a light sleeper (like me), you may be bothered by it but luckily my kids slept great. We even set up the projector outside and that was fun too. My daughter said her favorite part of the whole stay was ‚ÄúThe Wishing House!‚Äù."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a wonderful home, conveniently located to the Magnolia Silos and other Waco attractions. The only complaint would be the proximity to a large outdoor bar that had live music that did make it hard to sleep. The owners were gracious in providing additional accommodations to try and assist in this matter. Overall, I enjoyed the home and everything it had to offer to provide a cozy and comfortable stay while visiting Waco."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,The Wishing House was very clean and very well appointed with latest styles trends. Great Experience
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was beautiful and so comfortable! We would definitely recommend staying here. It was close and walkable to most everything and was easy to find! Great location and convenient. Worked perfectly for what we needed.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great Communication!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect place for 2 couples to stay and the kitchen was awesome. We had a little trouble figuring out how to lock the door but that was more user error and they were very responsive and ready to send someone if needed. If you're staying to visit the Silo's you couldn't pick a better place for location and comfort.
Keep in mind WACO is a noisy town with active train tracks right thru the middle of town but you can't go wrong with this vacation home."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Wishing House is a perfect pair if you are visiting Waco for Magnolia Farms. We loved being able to walk every where and the home itself was beautiful. Highly recommend this home if you are looking to explore Waco, enjoy some sun, and want a gorgeous place to rest at night."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful house in Magnolia style. Nice finishes and subtle but helpful perks such as snacks, ear plugs, and extra linens. Perfect location for girls trip to Magnolia Silos!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was very nice and pleasant.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow. What an amazing place to stay. The location, the indoor and outdoor areas, all great.
The only downside is that for such a big place it‚Äôs a two bedroom, and the tvs were smaller than I would like. Neither of these in any way hindered my stay, just the only bummer. I would highly recommend this place to anybody! Great host! Great place!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing stay! House was awesome! Everything we wanted and more.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Wishing House is the perfect place to stay if you‚Äôre in the Waco area! Walkable to most places including Magnolia, less than 5 minutes. The Wishing House is extremely clean and looks exactly like the pictures. Can‚Äôt wait to come back in the future."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a delightful home! It is beautifully decorated, comfortable and within walking distance to so much! Check in/out was a breeze and we enjoyed our stay very much! Would highly recommend and hope to be back again! Thanks!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location for walking to Magnolia complex/district and surrounding businesses. House was even better than photos. Two master suites, one up and one down. Great outdoor space and amenities. Appreciated built-in bottle filler with filtered water right in the kitchen. It's definitely an up and coming area, but you're so close to Magnolia that you can overlook the under-construction and the need to be under construction homes in the neighborhood."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,wonderful place and location.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Adorable house in an amazing location! Not a single complaint.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Love staying here. House is amazing inside and out, and is in a great location. Bethany‚Äôs communication is always top notch. We will be back!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing house and location! We loved that we each had our own bedroom and bathroom space. The house is walkable to everything you want to see. It‚Äôs very clean and beautifully decorated. People drive by and stare at it which can be a little awkward, but I couldn‚Äôt really blame them. Some features we loved‚Ä¶ the water station, the Keurig coffee maker, the snacks and cereal, and all the outdoor seating.
It didn‚Äôt really bother us, but you can hear music and the neighbors if they are loud.
Thanks for letting us stay at The Wishing House! - The Wantlands and The Shivers"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This house is gorgeous!! Everything down to the door knobs. Perfect location if you‚Äôre visiting the Silos you can walk right over in less than 5 minutes. Has everything you need and the outdoor space is a dream. We stayed with some friends and we had the best time sitting outside by the fire. Definitely recommend!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our favorite place to stay in Waco! Thanks for another great experience!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,House exceeded expectations! Perfect location to visit Magnolia Silos. Super clean and had everything we needed.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay. A week before Christmas to slow down and enjoy time as a family in a beautiful space. Our favorite part was the kitchen. We both cook and we enjoyed the space. Planning our next trip here.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful house! I loved how close it was to Magnolia. This house is a perfect location if you are going to visit the Silos.
Very clean!
There is loud music on the weekends which wasn‚Äôt my favorite but it was okay.
Definitely would recommend!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From the moment I booked this place, Bethany was super responsive. The place is so beautiful and just amazing!! Super quiet and clean! It was only a 3 minute walk to the Silos and not far from Union Hall (lots of different food options!). This was such a relaxing and fun girls trip! The communication was great. I would highly recommend staying here and can't wait to come back!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thank you. The house was wonderful. We appreciate this type of host and would work with her again.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our stay was wonderful! The house was extremely clean and very close to all the action!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place and in a perfect spot to enjoy Waco and Baylor. Great hosts and always so friendly. House was immaculate and communications were timely and great. We will be back.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is a gem. The communication was great and it is truly beautiful and pristine. If you‚Äôre coming to Waco, look no further."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the Wishing House was perfect. It all began with excellent communication. They were prompt in responding to all of our questions and were accommodating with our arrival. We especially loved that they presented us with a file of places to eat and visit while we were in Waco.
The house itself was lovely. There wasn‚Äôt anything missed. The decor and attention to detail left us feeling more comfortable then any upscale hotel.
The location was perfectly located in the silo district. Several restaurants and shopping were all within walking distance.
The only recommendation to those staying at the Wishing House would be to consider renting a car if you didn‚Äôt drive. There is still a lot to see in the Waco area, and having a vehicle to get around would be helpful. (We used Uber which was easily available, but not as handy)
We would highly recommend staying at the Wishing House. (We got some great decor ideas even within these four walls!). Enjoy!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our recent stay at The Wishing House far exceeded expectations! We have rented numerous houses and this was by far the nicest, cleanest and most ""thoughtful"" house we have rented. The house has everything one would need, from a white noise machine to creamer for your coffee. The house itself is amazing, better than the pictures show! And the location is perfect. You can truly walk anywhere within minutes. Don't hesitate to book The Wishing House!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful home in the perfect location. Incredibly well appointed. Bethany is a wonderful host. It‚Äôs our home away from home. Can‚Äôt wait to return.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hands down the best stay at an Airbnb I have ever had. Communication was great, house was AMAZING, the family is still raving about it. Such nice little extra touches with snacks available and all the little extras to make coffee. The outdoor spaces are perfect for an evening hanging out outside. A MUST STAY IF COMING TO WACO. Oh did I mention is a 3 minute walk to the silos‚Ä¶gents let the ladies go and enjoy some time at some great bar options just as close!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic location and really cool place that is close to both Baylor and all things trending in Waco. Outdoor living space is awesome with plenty of room to eat and hang out. Bethany was a great host with excellent communication throughout. We will be back.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything about this house was great, it was extremely nice and made for a great place to relax after traveling and busy days in Waco. Sitting outside and listening to the music from the backyard grill was really neat as well. It was the perfect location for visiting the magnolia silos district being just a couple minute walk down the street."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect stay, thank you!"
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"Great house with lots of usable outdoor space. We loved sitting on the upstairs porch listening to the music from the nearby restaurant. Beautifully designed & decorated!
Cleanliness needs improvement. It appeared that one bathroom was not cleaned.
Location is great for walks to restaurants and Baylor."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything was wonderful if your looking for a beautiful home to stay in.. don‚Äôt look any further. This house is super clean, that‚Äôs very important to me. Great communication and super location to the Silos and Magnolia. We‚Äôd rent agin if we‚Äôre ever back in Waco."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful Airbnb! We enjoyed all of the amenities and beautiful decor. The house was pristine and comfortable. Look forward to staying here again!

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfection.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly appreciated the wonderful house and property, especially our host and all her communication, and the extreme cleanliness of everything. I'm an OCD germaphobe, so I am extremely grateful!! The instructions were crystal clear, and host responsiveness exceeded any expectations we could have had. The location was super convenient to activities, so you really don't need a car if you plan to stay in downtown Waco. We felt safe as not much foot traffic. With exception to an occasional train or weekend music on occassion from Backyard Grill, the location is extremely quiet and peaceful. And, they have ear plugs if you're a bit sound sensitive or a light sleeper. They truly thought of everything, so we really felt like it was home away from home. We were able to relax and work without being in each other's way. This was our first Airbnb experience, and we were spoiled. It will be painful to stay in a hotel going forward, and the bar is extremely high for all other Airbnb's and their hosts. Thank you Bethany and Andrea for a phenomenal experience in Waco!!"

Would recommend staying here again! Perfect for a girls weekend trip stay!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved having our Wacky Waco weekend at this Fixer Upper featured property.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Jeff was super helpful with getting me ‚Äúsquared-away‚Äù with the check-in. I had not downloaded the abnb app and he was kind and understanding in getting it resolved. A kind voice when I needed it.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at The German Schmear house very much! It looked just like the pictures, and we loved the blessing from Sara's father Max Lucado still hanging in the house! It was so fun to see the episode on Fixer Upper! We loved the quiet and peacefulness of the neighborhood, although it was a bit older neighborhood. Jeff and Sara were very accommodating and allowed us to extend our stay by one day. We enjoyed cooking in the beautiful kitchen! The house was the perfect place for us to enjoy time with our son who attends Baylor and his girlfriend who had flown in from Auburn. We will certainly want to stay here again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a great spot in Waco, TX if you want the full Fixer Upper experience. We stayed for 1 night but would have enjoyed a second to take in some more of the Waco restaurants. While in Waco, we ate at the 1928 Hotel and were very impressed with the hotel and food quality."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,I found Jeff and Sara to be extremely friendly and responsive host. If there's a way to possibly feel warmth over text message I felt it. the neighborhood really charming. My mom and I went for a walk in the morning before the kids were up. I rented the property to take my mom to magnolias which she had asked me to go. It's very close without being in the downtown. The house is in a beautiful residential neighborhood eight minutes away. Drive from anything.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Squeaky clean and comfortable stay! Safe and secure. Loved that we had room to spread out and the crib and baby gate were a nice touch. Sara was super friendly and communicative. Would absolutely stay again.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"2 families, 5 kids, had a great time! Loved the open kitchen! We had a wonderful time cooking and dining. The mattresses were very firm and we slept so well.
The kids loved the foyer. They thought it was a dance floor so we let them have a dance party there. Such a memorable stay. Thank you so much!"

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Was the perfect/memorable place to stay for our Waco trip!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was so nice being able to stay at the German Schmear house from Fixer Upper season three. My husband and I rented both the house and the cottage for ensured privacy. It was nice to see both parts of the house. It felt so peaceful and was a wonderful place to relax. I really enjoyed being able to read in the upstairs rooms in the house when my husband and I wanted a little separate time to do whatever we wanted. We stayed in the main bedroom downstairs in the house. It‚Äôs a great split floor plan. I was excited about the piano from pictures, but it‚Äôs only for decoration, so you can‚Äôt play it. My favorite place aesthetically is the kitchen. My favorite place to relax in the house is the upstairs room with the white board flooring."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Jeff and Sara‚Äôs house was fantastic. Very clean and stylish place with everything you need. In a great location, convenient location Jeff and Sara were very accommodating and helpful and made sure we had everything we needed. Would definitely stay here again!"

2023-07-01,5,Group trip,We enjoyed the space!! Had a business meeting comparing Mary Kay Cosmetics business to the building of Magnolia. Wish we could have met the owners. Great property for our retreat!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying at the German Schmear house! It fit our needs perfectly. Having 2 1/2 baths was great! I loved the picture frame windows. Another family member stayed in the cottage which added to the fun.
We were tickled by the tour vans that would drive by. The neighborhood is beautiful, peaceful and easy to get to.
We enjoyed being in the city where we could use Instacart and DoorDash as needed. The grandchildren (age 18 mo & two 3 1/2 yr olds) really enjoyed the Mayborn Museum. My kids said it was the best children‚Äôs museum they have ever been to. Another fun outing was to a nearby splash pad and playground.
We would love to stay here again in the future! Thank you Sara & Jeff!!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Really enjoyed staying at a house remodeled by Chip & Joanna! And especially this particular house with its interesting and fun facts about the homeowners.

We surprised hubby with a stay there for Father‚Äôs Day and he was blown away! And of course, we just had to watch the actual episode on Fixer Upper while sitting in the kitchen ü§£
You‚Äôll have a grand old time, the home makes you feel you‚Äôre at home, the house it stunning and the hosts are extremely pleasant to work with.
We will return soon as we think we‚Äôve found a little piece of Heaven with this house. We wish we would have booked for a longer stay.‚ô•Ô∏è
Thanks to Jeff and Sara for being amazing m, and sharing your incredible lodging with the community."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"This Airbnb is absolutely wonderful. Nice open space with a clean and modern look. When you get inside you just immediately feel at home. Everything is just so clean! The beds were wonderful to sleep on, and the AC kept the space all nice and cool as Texas was experiencing extreme heat advisory notices. The back garden has tables and is a great space to have friends and family around for an evening outdoor meal.
Thank you for such a memorable weekend in Waco!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As fans of 'Fixer Upper', we were so excited to have the opportunity to stay at the German Schmear House. It did not disappoint! The house was beautiful, and clean as could be. We would highly recommend it to other fans."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is exactly as described, super clean, comfortable and packed with all you need. It was fun and eye-opening to stay in a house featured on a TV show. The hosts are great and very communicative. Would definitely consider staying there again."

The house is in a great location; no more than 10 - 15 minutes from anywhere you want to go.
The hosts were very helpful and accommodating.
We enjoyed our stay at the Schmear Fixer Upper."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful all around. Beautiful house and great experience staying in a ‚Äúfixer upper.‚ÄùExtremely clean and easy communication with the hosts. Even a nice sized backyard that we could throw a ball around for a few. Highly recommended.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Schmear House is gorgeous and lovingly restored. It looked just like the pics and the written description. Very clean and peaceful and had an amazing backyard.
Minutes from all that Waco had to offer.
I would definitely stay here again."
2023-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"Very nice house, very clean and was just as presented in ad. Backyard could be much nicer, very old furniture."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed one night and I wish we could have stayed more. The neighborhood was quiet and peaceful, and also close to the grocery store. Jeff and Sara left a list of their favorite things to do in Waco and also a very easy to read and understand check out. The home was beautiful and very relaxing! Would definitely recommend."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great time!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jeff & Sara‚Äôs place was perfect for our girls trip! It was sparkling clean, easy to get to, and very relaxing. They even had little notecards throughout the house that gave tips and directions. The neighborhood is charming, and we felt safe the whole time. Jeff & Sara were easy to communicate with and made check in a snap.
We had fun watching their episode of Fixer Upper and seeing the things that were the same versus the things that have changed in the house.
We would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed staying here. It was close to all the things we wanted to see and do. The house was very clean and had everything we needed.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house was beautiful, close to everything, but still didn't feel too crowded by the city. We will absolutely stay here again!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jeff and Sara were super hosts. The house was super comfortable and we felt right at home. Clear instructions and labels everywhere, making it easy to figure out things around the house. Kitchen had everything available to make meals. Excellent stay. üëç"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great house and decor
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful as fans of the show fixer upper it definitely lived up to our expectations. Very happy and would recommend to everyone.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,One huge thank you from Alyssa and I for everything! Your home was even more lovely in person! We look forward to bringing our family down sometime next year.
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"The German Schmear house was beautifully decorated, clean and cozy! We have zero complaints! We also want to say thank you for all the linens, coffee, wifi, and high quality toiletries. We really enjoyed our stay!"
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful home with long drive way for parking. The neighborhood is beautiful and in a great safe area. The drive isn‚Äôt far to Magnolia which is what brought us to Waco in the first place. I would stay here again if Something brought me to the area. The hosts were friendly and informative. The home itself was clean and just beautiful inside. The yard is very big!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a fun experience to stay in The German Schmear House. We were in town visiting Magnolia and we even took time to watch the episode for this house while we were staying in it (it was mind blowing trying to picture the original walls).
We had two different families staying together and the four bedrooms offered us plenty of individual space. This house would be great for a group. Thanks Jeff and Sara!"
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,Great home. Great stay. Hope to do it again.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great house to stay at to experience the Fixer Upper life for awhile!
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful home conveniently located to everything Waco has to offer.
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,The beds are the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on away from home! We enjoyed our stay so much!
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,We absolutely loved our stay and hope to be back!!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was really cool to stay in an actual Fixer Upper house that Chip and Joanna had worked on! The main area they remodeled was absolutely beautiful! And what they couldn‚Äôt remodel was painted and refreshed and looked very nice! It‚Äôs an older house obviously, but it was the experience we were there for.
It was very clean and well appointed! Very roomy and lots of rooms for sleeping! The beds were comfy and we enjoyed our stay!
Something to know that surprised us a little was that they also rent out a cottage that is right behind the house. It was not a problem at all and we didn‚Äôt see anyone. But just know that the cottage is right outside the back door, almost like a detached garage. It never posed an issue of any kind and we didn‚Äôt see the people that were staying there at all. But they would be walking up the driveway past the kitchen window if they were there. Not a deal breaker at all, just a heads up so you aren‚Äôt surprised!!
I wish we had time to watch the episode of Fixer Upper but we were only there one night and were exhausted from our early morning flight and the day spent at Magnolia.
Make reservations at Magnolia Table way ahead of time! It is amazing!! Absolutely delicious!! Highly recommend!!
All around great stay! Would stay again!!"
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Jeff & Sara‚Äôs house is a great place to stay in Waco, especially for larger groups! The location is quiet and relatively close to many amenities. The kitchen and living are the nicest and best parts of the home, and it was enjoyable to spend time there. The one main criticism I have after staying there is that I feel like the bathrooms could use some updating to bring them up to the same level as the rest of the home. The bathrooms are clean and there‚Äôs absolutely nothing wrong with them, but they just fall flat compared to the rest of the house (they feel more like you‚Äôre in a clean, but slightly outdated home, rather than any sort of vacation retreat). Overall, I would recommend this property if you‚Äôre a fan of Fixer Upper or want to stay in a larger home in Waco!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely adorable! We enjoyed watching the Fixer Up episode while we were there. So fun to feel like you were apart of the Magnolia life. Jeff and Sara were fantastic hosts. We would love to stay next time we are in town. Fun experience for a Magnolia weekend.
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,Picture perfect and a special experience for Magnolia fans. Definitely some of the best hosts we‚Äôve booked with. Hope to be back soon!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"For the fixer upper fan! Super cute, lots of room! Great neighborhood!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home! Definitely met our standards and needs!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really loved our stay! It is a great house to stay with family, and visit all the great places in Waco!"
2022-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"It was a beautiful house, but we would not stay here again. We did wobble between giving it 3 or 4 stars for reasons that I privately messaged the owner about, one that is a deal breaker for our family. If Jeff and Sara fix these issues, this would be a great place to stay, and they seem like excellent hosts. As is, we feel we definitely overpaid for the issues we had to deal with. Hopefully they will be addressed in the future.
Pros: Fixer Upper fame and great location to Waco activities and shops
Con: uneven temperature distribution in the house and a lack of privacy, as well as privately discussed problems"
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"Very cozy house for a small gathering. We had a combined bachelorette/bachelor party and fit us nicely, 5 cars could fit in the drive way with a squeeze."
2022-07-01,3,Stayed with kids,Furnishings exactly as listed. A beautiful home.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved this home. Friendly and inviting. Our kids loved the backyard and the wonderful yard to run and play.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the German Schmear house was the highlight of our trip to Waco! The house was clean, well-appointed, and everything in the house was well labeled. Watching the Fixer Upper episode where the house was remodeled while actually in the house was an experience we will not soon forget! Highly recommend staying here!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lovely home. Great accommodations. Had so much fun staying in a fixer upper!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The home was absolutely lovely and very relaxing. Our family truly enjoyed the visit and we plan to come back soon.
Blessings to you and yours and‚Ä¶
Thanks again Jeff & Sara!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the German Schmear house was everything we hoped it would be for our girls trip! We enjoyed watching the Fixer Upper episode in which the home was remodeled during our stay & trying to figure out the specific changes they made. It‚Äôs beautiful, clean & centrally located. Thanks for the wonderful memories & hospitality!"
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,Great house. Loved the open floor plan! Perfect place to hang out with family.
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"Stay here!! It‚Äôs amazing, the neighborhood is nice, the house is gorgeous, everything is great. I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better place to get ready for the wedding in. They let my maid of honor get in early to decorate some and were very accommodating. It was such an amazing stay!!"
2022-06-01,3,Group trip,"The house was good location, if nice weather would be good to have more patio furniture outside only has room for 4 people to sit. It was really hot this weekend in Waco and the AC definitely was having a very hard time keeping up. Could use some portable fans."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great experience to stay in the house. It was very comfortable, location was central to all we wanted to do and is in a nice neighborhood. We appreciate the opportunity , will recommend to others and hopefully stay there again"
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,We definitely enjoyed our stay with my friends and their sons. It was great for us to come in a night before our Baylor tour and explore the city. Us 3 moms had our own rooms while our four boys shared a bedroom and used the air mattress provided by Jeff and Sara. It‚Äôs in a nice neighborhood and close to campus. We definitely wish we could have stayed one more night. The beds were comfy too! That‚Äôs a plus.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great visit at the German Schmear House!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful hoe in a nice area in Waco, perfect amount of modern and country. Was about 12 minutes from magnolia market.
Shopping and restaurants nearby
Hosts were very friendly and fast responding to my messages"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful!!
2022-03-01,4,Group trip,Was so great! We enjoyed and would be be back!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a wonderful house and it was so exciting to stay in a ""fixer upper"" :) The house is very clean with ample linens and supplies. The check in was so convenient. I would highly recommend staying at Jeff and Sara's ""fixer upper!"""
2022-03-01,4,Group trip,Beautiful house- fantastic location. Hosts were quick to respond about any questions or issues- highly recommend!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Aesthetically beautiful and wonderful accommodations
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,"Such a cute home in a really accessible neighborhood! It was nicely decorated and fun to relive the episode of Fixer Upper while in the house. Make sure you realize that the bedrooms each have only a full or queen bed. We were hoping for 2 twins in one of the rooms. Our hosts were very helpful and overall, it was a wonderful stay!!!"
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,"Staying at the German Schmear house MADE our whole trip! It was perfect for our girls week/40th birthday celebration! We loved being within driving distance to Magnolia and the Silos. We enjoyed everything about our visit to Waco and all agreed that getting to come back to such a special home, during our down times, was one of the highlights. Throwing on sweats and curling up on the couch to watch episode 9 of season 3...you have to watch the episode of Fixer Upper while you are there! We kept pausing it to stop and look around at the real thing. The home is so welcoming and set up so comfortably. We made sure to cook some dinners at the house and enjoyed eating together around the dining room table. We did the Waco Tour towards the end of our stay, but highly recommend it for doing at the beginning of your stay, if possible. The beds were comfortable, the kitchen was well stocked, check-in was a breeze and our hosts were super nice. You won't regret making this part of your stay in Waco. We definitely didn't!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The German Schmear house is so cozy and comfy! We plan on going back there for our next trip to Waco!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful and clean home. Perfect for a girlfriends weekend or for family gathering. We loved the location and easy access to the Extract Events Center. The neighborhood was nice and clean too. We were in town for business so this was great for us.
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,"We have stayed here twice; once last year and once this year. It‚Äôs a pretty penny but worth the great stay! You can split the price with a big group/family. Magnolia Silos and Magnolia Table aren‚Äôt too far away, which is where we visited on our trip. It‚Äôs always fun to watch the Fixer-Upper episode in the house! The house is styled very nicely, is clean, has a valuable kitchen space, many rooms, bathrooms, big backyard and amenities. The only downsides were that the back door is difficult to shut/lock, driveway is a little tight, upstairs old wooden floors tend to be noisy and the downstairs master‚Äôs bathroom‚Äôs main lights don‚Äôt turn on. For us, not huge deal breakers. Other than that, worth the stay and hope to come again on our next trip to Waco!"
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,Great neighborhood and house was great for the one night we were in town.
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,A perfect stay!! Thank you Jeff & Sara!

2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you are a fan of Chip and Joanna, this is the house for you. All the ladies in the party loved walking around and looking at the same house from the show. It was really a special experience."
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"This home was so nice and fun to be in. It met all our needs perfectly. It‚Äôs such a darling home! Soooo cute, homey, clean, and comfortable. We‚Äôd love to come back again. It was easy to communicate with Jeff and Sarah. We easily slipped in and out. Thank you!"
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home, great proximity to the points of interest and to stores to pick up some groceries or other staples for your stay. Easy check-in, super responsive hosts in Jeff and Sara, and good value for the cost. Highly recommend!!"
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"Jeff and Sara,
Thank you for a wonderful place to stay during our visit to Waco. The ""Fixer Upper"" German Schmear house is just adorable and what fun it was to watch the HGTV episode while sitting in the actual living room! The location is perfect, so close to everything we wanted to do, and we felt very safe in the lovely neighborhood. Comfortable beds, stocked kitchen, private back patio and huge yard. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the German Schmear house... thank you!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,I am an absolute fan of Fixer Upper and this was a treat to be able to stay in one of the homes Chip and Joanna did! By far the prettiest house on the block and very close to stores. I would definitely recommend staying here! It really made for an awesome stay in Waco!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were traveling to Waco to of course visit The Silos! We really enjoyed the cleanliness, beauty & location of Jeff & Sara‚Äôs home. The home was clean and checking in was super easy. We didn‚Äôt encounter any problems while staying here but didn‚Äôt end up using the kitchen either as between Magnolia Table and amazing Taco Trucks, the city of Waco fed us well! There are two thermostats for upstairs & downstairs that we missed the first night. Kiddos upstairs got pretty warm, after we figured it out the temperature was much more manageable! Thank you for the beautiful accommodations in Waco!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for hosting us Jeff & Sara! We had a great time staying here! We loved the place and appreciated seeing some of the original decor from the fixer upper episode. We also liked how close we were to almost everything to do with Magnolia as well as the convenience of stores around us. Would definitely stay here again!

2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"A very long awaited trip for my family, postponed twice due to COVID. Pulling up to this home gives you all the feels of living the Fixer Upper dream! Beautiful neighborhood. The home is immaculate, although there is some normal wear and tear. The kitchen was well stocked to make meals with ease. We thoroughly enjoyed using the kitchen to cook! Jeff was super responsive to minor issues encountered and even stopped by to help out. The beds are very comfortable! (Master bed higher than upstairs beds). My family and I enjoyed a week long stay and we were very happy with the space the house offered and the proximity to all Magnolia related things. Tour busses/tourists passed daily, multiple times. Can‚Äôt blame them. All in all, a wonderful experience and family memories made that will be cherished forever. Jeff is truly a pleasure to deal with and great to talk to! So glad we had the chance to meet!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a well stocked and clean home, and Jeff and Sara were so great to work with! We had the best time, with all the comforts of home- oh and the beds were all super comfortable too!"

2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We stayed at this home for a few days. The home was beautiful! My daughter is a huge Joanna Gaines fan. She loved staying at a home Joanna and Chip had fixed up. Location is close to everything and in such a beautiful neighborhood.

2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"This house was so cute and awesome to stay in for the entire Magnolia experience. We watched the episode while we were in the living room so it was neat to see! Safe location, quiet neighborhood and great accommodations. The upstairs is older but they did a nice job renovating it to match the rest of the house. Would recommend staying here if you‚Äôre a big Chip and Joanna fan to complete the entire Waco experience!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an outstanding stay at the German Schmear House. Jeff and Sarah were awesome hosts and it was a great trip!
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,7 girls stayed here to visit magnolia for a bachelorette weekend getaway. The house is stylish and pretty. Beds were comfy. Close to stores and the silos. Wish we had more time to spend outside in the backyard but due to weather we couldn‚Äôt. Definitely made amazing memories and laughs in this house!
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,Amazing spot and host
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Large spacious house that looks and feels just like the episode you‚Äôve watched at least 10x.
2021-03-01,5,Group trip,"There are not enough words to describe how amazing Jeff & Sarah were and how perfect this property was. Aside from the fantastic location, the attention to detail and all the little added extras made it that much better. They included things that we hadn‚Äôt even thought of. It made everything feel so homey. From the layout of the property to the amenities that were included. We were able to spend quality family time together under one roof. We had perfect weather to be able to utilize the patio to hang out and play games. We were amazed at the size of the yard and the kids had a blast running and playing in the yard with their cousins. The process for check in and check out was so simple and we had no trouble whatsoever! We would absolutely recommend this property to anyone and everyone we know."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful space, warm and inviting. Jeff + Sara were amazing!"

2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a lovely comfortable stay here.
2021-01-01,3,Stayed with kids,Thank you for the stay! The house is very quaint. It has had some wear and tear but you can tell how lovely it was. It is well stocked with kitchen appliances and everything needed. It is important to know that the back house is not available because it rented separately.
2020-12-01,5,Group trip,"Charming, quaint home. A relaxing & enjoyable time."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,This house was exactly what we needed for our week long stay for Christmas! Jeff and Sara even had a beautifully decorated Christmas tree.

Thank you for opening up your special space!"

2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great house
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great Place to stay! Close to the Silos at Magnolia Market.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"I‚Äôve stayed in Waco a few times, but nothing quite holds a candle to getting to stay in one of the actual fixer uppers- especially this one!! The space was incredible and we loved our stay. Thank you so much, Jeff and Sara!"
2020-11-01,5,Group trip,"This home is everything and more! We watched the Fixer Upper episode while staying there... it really is such a beautiful house! Great outdoor space, cute neighborhood... and close enough to the Silos that you could go as much as you want! Highly recommend!"

2020-10-01,5,Group trip,"It was so lovely to have ample space in a beautiful home with thoughtful accommodation for everyone in our party.

2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had such a great time, and enough space for a quick fun family getaway! Everything was a clean and exactly like the pictures showed. Thank you for everything! Will definitely stay here again. We also tried Pinewood Coffee shop per their recommendation, and we all agreed it was super delicious!"
2020-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed our stay!! The German Schmear exterior is magical and the interior touches are a blend between Joanna Gaines and the owners. Really neat to see the house as the first stop on the Waco Tours show of Waco. The house is warm, spacious and wonderfully outfitted to cook at home and save a few bucks. It is proximate to downtown Waco (but not too close) and Lake Waco. We loved our stay!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful stay in a beautiful house!! And Jeff was very quick to answer when we had a question!
2020-09-01,5,Group trip,The home is beautiful and in a great place to explore all that Waco has to offer.

2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is a wonderful house! We stayed here with family to escape Hurricane Laura and it was a nice place to call home for a few days. Open kitchen and den area that is spacious and clean. The backyard is great - large for playing in the day and has pretty lights at nighttime! It‚Äôs well located in a safe neighborhood. Bonus: the beds are super comfortable!
2020-08-01,2,Group trip,"Beware the Shmear. We saw no less than 4 Cockroaches, so bring your bug catching net! Also you can‚Äôt go outside at night and use the backyard space because the neighbor‚Äôs dogs will bark incessantly. Only the downstairs was remodeled. The upstairs area of the house is old and there are pieces of the wood floor that aren‚Äôt flush or have holes, so watch out if you have kids and they are running around. Air conditioning isn‚Äôt accurate and we were freezing while the house was set to 73, but 74 produced a sauna. Overall not a pleasant experience, and when the cockroach issue was pointed out to the hosts, they interrogated me even after I provided VIDEO EVIDENCE. Needless to say, we won‚Äôt be back and you probably shouldn‚Äôt risk the stay."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place! Will be back!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time! Great hospitality!

2020-07-01,4,Group trip,Great stay!
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,"Our family enjoyed our stay in this home. The kitchen is absolutely gorgeous and had everything we needed to cook a meal. The owners had provided all of the little extras you need during a trip down to the shampoo, body wash, dish detergent, clothes detergent, extra trash bags, bug spray, hair dryer, iron etc. We always pack these items because you normally have a limited supply but that was not the case in this home, everything was available to us. It is a quiet neighborhood and we enjoyed the lights on the back patio. All of the beds slept comfortably as well. You will not regret this rental."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great short stay at the German Schmear house! Of course, the house is beautifully styled, it‚Äôs comfortable and very clean.

We didn‚Äôt want to change the date so we used the house and backyard as our new venue and downsized to immediate family only. Huge backyard that we barely utilized, but it is beautiful. We used the patio and gravel area for the wedding. Turned out amazing. Thanks so much!!!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at this stay, even with a baby and a toddler! Lots of sleeping room and plenty of space for the family. They even had games we were able to use! The host cookies were delicious!!!"

2020-05-01,5,Group trip,"My girlfriends and I had a perfect weekend getaway in the beautiful German Schmear House! Jeff & Sarah left the place sparkling clean for us and we loved feeling right at home in their big yet cozy house. There was plenty of room for everyone to be together and enjoy quality time but to also have their privacy. They left us plenty of towels for bathing, as well as thoughtful touches such as toiletries and coffee. Not to mention the beds were SO comfortable! Jeff was great about communicating with us and answering all of our questions. We had such a great time here and will definitely be back to enjoy this lovely home again!"

HIGHLY recommend this home if you are staying in the Waco area!"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jeff & Sara's home is really exceptional. We booked an extended stay in Waco to be closer with family during the pandemic and provide our 1yr old daughter with a backyard to play. This beautiful home was a perfect choice for many reasons. It is stylish without being stuffy. The space functioned well as we cooked every meal, held work calls, entertained our daughter, and relaxed in the evenings. The full-size crib ensured that our daughter slept well and we enjoyed the thoughtful touches of luxury around the house. Having grown up in Waco, I knew exactly what neighborhoods would work for our needs but this particular street really impressed. There are large trees throughout the neighborhood ensuring shady walks and lots of beautiful homes. The neighbors are super sweet and we received lots of waves and ""howdy's"" on our evening strolls. Jeff & Sara were quick to respond when an overnight thunderstorm knocked out the wifi for a couple hours and we had no problems finding everything we needed during our stay. I can't say enough great things about this home and hosts. Highly recommended."
2020-04-01,5,Group trip,Amazing place to book!
2020-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, quaint little spot with a lovely home and a wonderful backyard in a niece, quiet neighborhood. Jeff and Sara were wonderful hosts!"

2020-02-01,5,Group trip,"Such a lovely home! Perfect for family vacations. The kitchen and family room layout are PERFECT! The beds are so comfortable! I meant to see the brand of sheets because they were sooo soft, lol. Easy check in. This home will exceed your expectations."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"My wife and I had a wonderful time during our stay. The location was beautiful, quiet, and peaceful, just as described in the listing. Everything met our expectations perfectly. We highly recommend this place for a relaxing getaway."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My mom and I loved our visit on their beautiful ranch! We loved all the animals! We did not love all the bugs! haha We did have an encounter with a HUGE scorpion in the bathroom sink when we arrived and a big spider. That is the real Texas experience! The only other problem we had was not being able to get the DVD player to work. It wasn't a deal breaker and was able to get on Netflix to watch something. Overall, the Airbnb was so cute and we truly enjoyed staying there. I would definitely go back!"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I missed the fact in the description that there would be no Wifi or TV. But it was clearly stated and I just missed it. The setting was very nice and quiet. Was a little surprised at the instructions to wash and put away dishes (no dish washer) and strip the beds due to the fact that we paid a cleaning fee. The host was very communicative, which is appreciated."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It‚Äôs definitely a secluded place on a working ranch. Tried my luck at fishing hoping I would get the chance of releasing it back, got a couple of nibbles, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called fishing! I was in Waco for work, so staying here checked all the boxes, and this biggest for me was the peacefulness. In some ways regretted not having wifii, but for work reasons only. It was too easy to just sit back and drink a glass of wine, and enjoy the evening. Thank you for letting me stay there."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,If you are looking for a PEACEFUL property to relax and rejuvenate then look no further. The weekend was just what the doctor ordered for this busy mom who needed her cup refilled so to speak. Looking forward to spending many more weekends at this beautiful home away from home.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This was honestly a little slice of heaven if you want to slow down and enjoy a beautiful evening surrounded by lots of land and sweet little cows. My mom and I enjoyed this little place so much. It was more than I anticipated. I wish we stayed there longer! The fresh eggs were icing on the cake!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was very pleasant, we enjoyed the peace and quiet. Everything was wonderful. We enjoyed watching the cows and horses right outside our door.Heather was so helpful and sweet!"

Loved the secluded location and peaceful property with the chickens and the beautiful horses came over and greeted us through the fence !

We definitely hope to come back again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,I felt some peace and motivation for how I would love to live in Texas with my family. ALL THE GLORY TO GOD CHRIST JESUS
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If I could leave 10 stars, I would leave 11. Heather was super friendly, helpful and professional. I was greeted with a warm welcome from Heather, her husband, the dog and every last one of the chickens the moment I arrived. Putting face to name was a caring thing to do and I knew then this stay would feel like home.
Speaking of home, the Airbnb was CLEAN, and COZY, which lets me know that it‚Äôs not just about money with this host. She definitely LOVES what she does. That alone should be the reason this Airbnb is your #1 pick.
I would‚Äôve never thought for the price I paid, I would be staying in a peace of heaven.
Thank you, for letting me enjoy that beautiful place Heather. I will definitely stay again."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I found exactly what I was looking for- a quiet place to be alone.

Heather is welcoming and friendly. I look forward to future visits."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We are ‚Äúcountry‚Äù folks, and we usually try to stay in a quiet place to relax after a day of exploring. Heather and Craig‚Äôs place was perfect!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We are returning guests and have enjoyed all of our stays. In full disclosure, the only complaints we have had were that the bed was pretty squeaky and swayed a bit (bolts just needed to be tightened up) and the shower temperature fluctuated tremendously due to water pressure. Both of those things were taken care of and we had a perfect stay! This was the first time I took advantage of the farm fresh eggs as well and yum! Once again, we will be back!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We are here on April 21-23, 2023. We thought we were late for wild flowers season, but there are wildflowers right on the property and short driving distance. The flock of hens came to welcome us when we arrived. Check-in was at ease. plenty of space as shown in the pictures. This place fits best for 2 persons. The owner provides extra linen for my son to sleep on the comfy couch. Bed is super comfortable. There are kitchen, sink, coffee machine, refrigerator, microwave. So you could do some cooking here. Restroom is big and clean with cowboy decor. There are washer / dryer if you need to use it as well.
During our stay, we saw 2 cows, 2 horses, lots of hens, and a night clear sky. We enjoy stargazing at night.
There is a nice camper right on the property that belongs to the same owner if your family and friends need extra space. You could do the campfire too, but check with the owner first.
We got some fresh eggs and cook for breakfast along with some oatmeal too."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely getaway! While this time, I stayed for a work training in the nearby area, I certainly plan to come back for a personal trip. Perfect for unplugging and unwinding."

When we had a question about the heating, Heather responded immediately and gave us the information we needed to get it going. Even though there is no WiFi available, Heather provides Roku and a good selection of DVDs. There is a pond where guests can fish (fishing poles provided) and chickens who provide eggs."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Peaceful stay in the country. We loved Heather's place. The bed was so comfortable, there was a fan (which we appreciated cause we love the noise at night), and we were able to get a couple fresh eggs from the chickens the next morning. We spent a good amount of time on the porch watching the horses and enjoying the Texas sunset. The only thing I would mention is that there is a camper to the left side of the rental that is often rented out as well. We did not use the firepit but it is shared between the two rentals."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"So peaceful, we had an evening snack and our coffee and breakfast out on the front porch watching the horses, cows, and chickens. Just what we needed after a long day of driving. Comfortable bed too!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great experience!! Will definitely rebook
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Heather's place is cozy quiet and relaxing. It's just as described. Has all the amenities you could need. The location is great. Not too far to get where you want to be or to the attractions. But far enough to be away from the crowds when you're ready to relax. We will definitely book again in the future.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Overall nice place to do a small getaway if you don't want to be near anyone. the animals were nice to see and there are a plethora of movies to select from
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Overall the location is great, and place was beautiful. Had a slight issue with bugs and little worms on the floor. But nothing that would stop me from staying here again, seems like something to do with the season we were here more than the cleanliness of the stay :) I‚Äôd recommend!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"we enjoyed our stay, it seemed to be out aways but once we got there it was peaceful and comfortable. We enjoyed sitting outside and having coffee in the morning with the chickens."

She‚Äôs fast to respond if you need anything and her and her husband are extremely friendly. The view is indescribable. This is the perfect getaway from your busy everyday life to sit back and enjoy all of the views and sounds of nature. The weather was on our side and we got to sit out and enjoy sunsets, sunrises, all of the stars and great wind. I will definitely be back again for another get away. Also love that it‚Äôs far enough but not too far from the city to do stuff during the day. Dr. Pepper museum was my favorite.
Thank you for the wonderful stay Heather!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Heather‚Äôs barndominium was a last minute decision and we couldn‚Äôt be happier with what we experienced. Heather was very quick to respond. Upon our arrival, she was so gracious to send her husband over and allow us to feed the cows since I‚Äôm an avid cow lover. We took advantage of having a fire our first evening in their fire pit and were able to star gaze some. The atmosphere was so serene and exactly what we needed amidst our busy lives. While the chickens didn‚Äôt produce any eggs on our short 2-night stay, we still enjoyed seeing and interacting with them. It‚Äôs not a far drive at all from Waco so it was nice spending our days in Waco and then being able to come back to a peaceful scene. We definitely recommend if you‚Äôre looking for a quiet and secluded get-away! You won‚Äôt be disappointed."

Finding the location was a bit confusing but once I found it the rest of the stay went smoothly. The host requires guests to clean up after themselves including taking off bedding and taking out the trash. I think this is in lieu of charging a cleaning fee. If I'm on vacation I'd rather leave my chores at home, but that's just me."

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect place to stay for my son and me to visit Baylor. The ranch is very quiet and in a rural area but it‚Äôs only 15-20 minutes to Waco. The barndo was very clean and comfortable. It was very much our home away from home, and to be honest, we miss it. I hope to be back someday."

And there were tons of towels, with a family of 5 and everyone showering I‚Äôve found we run out of towels at a lot of places! The kitchen was also nicely stocked, we randomly needed a ziplock and found some in a drawer. I liked that the parking was behind the house and not visible from the road."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"My family and I use Airbnb a lot. So, we've stay at many different places globally.

Luckily found this gem after a handful of other post-booking host cancellations. Cory was communicative about the instructions for the house and we found the entire space to be super clean and spacious for four adults.
We also very much appreciated the fully stocked cooking and coffee supplies in the kitchen. Cupboards full of great dish ware, utensils, and cooking/baking tools.
Waco‚Äôs a pretty quiet town but this spot is just a short drive away from restaurants, quick food, and the Magnolia branded area. We loved it and would certainly stay again if we found ourselves in Waco!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came to Waco to visit Baylor on a college tour. This space was perfect for two mother/teen pairs. The house is only 10 minutes from the visitor center, also very close to the silos.
What I liked about the space, it was very light, airy and open. There was a super fun triple bunk room with lights and outlets for each bunk. We had everything we needed in the kitchen to cook breakfast daily. Loved the air fryer, there was also a nice coffee bar with coffee creamers and sweeteners, by the dining table. Otherwise it was exactly as described.
It was a lovely place and we will stay here again the next time we‚Äôre in town."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time and Cory and Callie's place! It provided everything we needed for us and our adult children.

We highly recommend this house and if we visit Waco again, we would definitely stay here again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super cute home close to the Magnolia complex. Cory was super responsive and clearly communicative. As two women traveling together, we felt safe and right at home. I would highly recommend and gladly return if I visited Waco in the future."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Uptown Cottage was an absolute gem! It was spotless. We booked it for a girl's trip to Waco. There were 4 of us so the two bathrooms and three bedrooms gave us plenty of space.The beds were comfortable, including the built in bunk beds. The linens and towels were well appointed. The cottage had a modern farm house vibe, with thoughtful touches such as Keurig pods and creamers provided in the cute coffee bar. We stayed in December and the tree and holiday lights were such a nice touch.
Cory sent very clear instructions a few days prior to arrival. Entry was very simple with the keypad entry and also felt very safe and secure. The rental is a short 5-10 minutes drive to the Silos and several restaurants and boutiques in the area. We did extensive research and this rental was a great value.

Loved the decor, super clean, extremely functional, great air conditioning (105 degree heat!), and wonderfully close to all activities and amenities. Beds were extremely comfortable, Keurig coffee machine very nice touch on a beautiful coffee bar. Wish we could take the washer and dryer home with us because they are large and worked great! Thank you Cory for making our visit to family in Waco extra special!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Our stay at Uptown Cottage met and exceeded expectations.

Reservations and communications prior to the visit went smoothly and Cory answered questions promptly.

The cottage was sparkling clean and welcoming, tastefully decorated, and there are special touches for comfort throughout.
Beds and bedding were very comfortable. Our stay was fifteen days, so the fully equipped kitchen was a delight to work in.
Outdoor temperatures were extremely high during our entire visit, so the HVAC system worked overtime and performed perfectly.
We were fairly unfamiliar with Waco when we arrived and found the cottage to be well located and private. Parking is off road and convenient.
Cory and Callie have created a little bit of heaven for travelers. Thank you both for your attention to details."

The neighborhood was quiet and right around the corner from Harvest on 25th and one of our favorite bars, Sloanes. It's also walkable to Pinewood coffee, which is also a favorite of ours. The kitchen had everything you could think of including a blender and toaster oven! We hosted a lunch for the grandparents we had in town for the graduation and had everything we needed to prepare it. Cory is a very responsive host. I usually waited no more than a couple of minutes for a response. The beds were very comfortable...even the bunks. We've already booked two more stays at Uptown cottage for when we come to a few Baylor games next season."

The home was so nice that two 14 year-old boys were impressed. That‚Äôs hard to do! None of us wanted to leave. The hosts did a wonderful job with the place; there are too many details to list. I loved that there was a first aid kit. We felt right at home. The icing on the cake was the bird‚Äôs nest above the front door camera which housed newborn baby birds. I love that the owner left the nest there for mama bird and her babies.
I will stay again when I return to Waco."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cory‚Äôs place is exactly as described. Accurate against photos and description. It was very clean and comfortable. Nice touches were added including some complementary popcorn, snacks and water, which made you feel welcome. He also has a bjnder with recommendations on local restaurants and attractions. We ate at the recommended Mexican restaurant and it was fantastic. The location is convenient to all Waco attractions including Magnolia silos, market, home store, bakery and restaurant. Also close is the Dr Pepper museum. Definitely recommend this place to anyone."

Walking distance to silos and all magnolia shops. Cute house with comfy beds, all the extra you would hope for. We had coffee each morning before starting our day, provided. There was a complimentary bottle of wine, mini scones, and a chocolate for us at bedside. Phone chargers by beds were nice!

We walked into a wonderfully cool (it‚Äôs Texas, we need cool!), serene home with soft music playing, the electric fireplace on (no heat, just pretty) and everything neat as a pin. It smelled lovely as well. It was even better than the pictures. Rye and Dana had a wonderful photo book that told us about their history and explaining some of the unique and special pieces in the house along with suggestions for food, entertainment and shopping. Our main interest was the Magnolia Shops and Silos and they are all within walking distance of the house. The beds were comfy, we had everything we needed.

Perfect home for our Easter stay with our Baylor student!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,There are so many positives to coincide with progressive change in this town. Our visit was sans college term and likely a benefit for low key fun. This host effective use of space and thoughtfulness to hosting was a bell ringer.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"You will certainly not regret staying at the Poppy and Rye cottage. It has all the charm you could possibly imagine. Dana has thought of everything. They go above and beyond anything you‚Äôd expect of an Airbnb. We kept being delightfully surprised at all the thoughtful details. Apple chargers at every bedside, snacks and wine upon arrival, and cozy ambiance with the fire going and candles lit. If you think you forgot something, think again. Dana probably has it available for you. The beds were extremely comfortable. The outdoor space is very cute. We walked everywhere! Dr. Pepper museum and the silos are both within 10 minutes. But honestly, we had such a lovely time just hanging out at the cottage! Dana‚Äôs also made some wonderful suggestions for restaurants and shopping. We took her up on a lot of her suggestions and were not disappointed. The 1905 latte from Magnolia Press was fantastic. 10/10 recommend staying here!!!"

I arrived to find the cottage warm on a cool night, fire on, and candles burning in every room. It smelled delicious and made me feel at home immediately!
As I explored my home for the weekend, I was impressed by the incredible eye for detail; nothing was left wanting.
While it was just me for this stay and it makes for the perfect retreat, I would most certainly want to share this experience with someone when visiting again. A romantic weekend, sisters getaway, mom and son trip, this cottage is the perfect landing spot.
A few of my favorite details:
- the design OMG! Beautiful!
- white linens
- cloud of a bed
- Itty bitty extra bathroom
- photo wall
- wine, Dr. Pepper & peanuts
- drawer of things you forgot to pack
- backyard fire
- fireworks from hammock
- easy parking
- everything is walkable
- Poppy's poetry
- the creativity here
- the amazing hosts ‚ù§Ô∏è
THANK U!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great time at the cottage. We had a minute issue and Riley responded same-day. I was a little disappointed that the wooden adirondacks shown in the photos were replaced with plastic chairs, but I know that renters aren‚Äôt always as respectful to the property as they should be. It‚Äôs within walking distance to Magnolia and other businesses (1-3 blocks)."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Charming home and with walking distance of excellent restaurants (like Pivovar and Milo's All Day) and shopping.
Great hosts who went above and beyond with just about everything.
You will love this adorably cute house!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"They have thought of everything. You can literally just bring your auutcase and the reat ia there. Little surprises eveywhere, all intemtionally thought out to make your stay special. It is clear how much they care about you loving the house, Waco and your experience. The outside items are the icing on the cake. My kids played ping pong, roasted smores, played cornhole, and walked to Magnolia for cupcakes. Perfect."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The BEST place to stay! The location is fabulous and walking distance to magnolia and shopping. We sat out back by the fire pit and relaxed while listening to live music. Dana & Rye literally have thought of everything. They are so intentional with the decoration and accommodations, the sentimental qualities in their cottage, and the ease of having chargers, items you might have forgotten, utilizing every inch of space so well, etc‚Ä¶ was all so impressive. Everywhere we looked there was another fabulous item or decor that was just stunning. You can tell they love life and have created a space for others to truly enjoy and create beautiful memories. They prepared us so well for our trip and we did many things on their list of recommendations! The best girls weekend ever! Thank you for your incredible hospitality. We‚Äôve already told others about your place and can‚Äôt wait to come back!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was one of the cutest airbnbs I've stayed at. So much detail and personality in the home, it was truly unique. I came to Waco to explore the Silos and Magnolia Market, but once I checked in I didn't want to leave the airbnb! But I did love that it was in walking distance to those places, it's the perfect location."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Poppy and Rye was the perfect spot for Baylor move in. We loved the location and the cottage was great!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place! Perfect for our stay!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice and clean. Beautiful decor. Love that it is family owned. Air conditioner worked excellent during hot Texas summer.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Poppy and Rye property was more than than expected. Clean and ready, felt right at home right when we walked in. It‚Äôs a smaller house but very roomy, very good use of a smaller space. We hope to stay again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rye and Dana were fantastic hosts! We had one small hiccup with the alarm system but Dana was there within 10 minutes of me reaching out. Any time I messaged them the response was immediate! The story of Poppy is just so lovely that it made me fall in love with the place that much more ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Very thankful for how well the cooling system worked in the house as it was insanely hot while we were there.
Such nice little touches throughout the house that it made our stay so enjoyable. Thank you Rye and Dana!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Poppy & Rye Cottage is the cutest place we have ever rented. Riley and Dana have thought of everything! From the moment you walk in you feel welcomed and at home. The home is decorated adorably and they have so many special touches. Every single room is perfect! The outdoor space is amazing as well. The backyard is the perfect hangout spot and feels very private. It appeared that the building across the road is under construction. Once that is finished the surroundings will look much nicer! You do not even notice it once you are inside though. We would definitely recommend this home, and the hosts, if you are looking to visit Magnolia!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was absolutely perfect! The home tells a story that you can‚Äôt help but appreciate!! We felt encouraged and impacted by ‚ÄúPoppie‚Äù all throughout our stay. What a great way to honor someone!
Everything was super clean and every detail was thought of! Loved finding little notes every where. Made us feel special and thought of. The art and custom pieces are amazing!!
Backyard was a GREAT hang! Firepit while laying in the hammock, listening to music on a provided Bluetooth speaker. üíØ
Could not have been more pleased with the host and home!
BOOK IT NOW!! You will be better for it!
Long live the rainbow makers!! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I can't say enough about this pace and these hosts!!! Absolutely perfect in every way...location, house layout, decor, amenities! It was so comfortable and felt personal and intimate. Communication with hosts was so easy, fun, timely and helpful. I can't wait to come back and bring my daughter and/or other friends to experience this place!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The attention to detail here was incredible, and there were instructions for everything. Each light switch was labeled, which I thought was a nice touch. The tp was rough, but I loved the nice linens and non-toxic handsoap. Everything we could have possibly needed was there, including some fabulous wines. I really appreciated the tastefully scented candles that were going upon our arrival and let out a literal breath of relief to discover there weren't any gross chemical smells like glade plug ins or harsh cleaners in the house.
The space was beautiful, clean, cozy, and inviting both inside and out. My only possible critique is that the lack of curtains in the secondary bedroom makes it impossible to sleep late because the room gets flooded with early morning sunlight.
check in and check out was so easy, and it's always nice when hosts don't ask you to do 20 things before check out. If I'm ever back in waco, I'll definitely book with these fantastic hosts again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Poppy & Rye‚Äôs cottage was perfect. There is no other word. The attention to detail and the small touches to make it feel like Holm were over the top. Amazing! I do not know how to explain the space other than to say that it was absolutely perfect and absolutely comfortable and so adorable and exactly what we needed. On top of the wonderful space itself, our hosts were the best. They were totally responsive and even dropped off extra goodies and supplies mid-week because we stayed there for a full seven days. I do not think anyone would be disappointed in staying at one of Dana and Riley‚Äòs spaces. Super!!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was perfect. Wish we could‚Äôve stayed longer! If we ever come back to Waco, we will be staying here. 100/10"

Beautifully decorated cottage with very thoughtful amenities. Host went above and beyond! They left us a nice bottle of wine, snacks and many odds and ends that made our stay memorable. There is a nice little book that talks about the renovation of the cottage with a brief history of the place. Also many recommendations of local restaurants and things to do! Such a great touch and wonderful information for people from out of town. We felt right at home at the cottage and I believe anyone who stays here would! We will definitely be back!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You won‚Äôt regret staying at a Poppy and Rye place. It was exceptional! All the details and lil extras made it special and memorable. As soon as you walk in you will have a WOW feeling and definitely feel the care of all the intentionality and hospitality. When you walk in there is a desk with all the info you need for your stay, and all the recommendations for every question you could think of as well as the questions you didn‚Äôt think of. This really impacted our trip. Lots of comfy throws, great beds, excellent kitchen, great showers, and comfy living room. ( suggestion) If you are into watching movies at night sign up with prime before you go and bring your log in info. Over all- 5 stars! We left fans of the place! :) As Mary Poppins says, It was ‚Äúpractically perfect in every way.‚Äù"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was by far my favorite Airbnb I‚Äôve stayed in! All of the extra touches, the clean space, the cozy vibe, the comfy bed‚Ä¶ everything was immaculate. I hope to stay here again when I visit Waco again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a beautiful, special home with so many personal and whimsical touches! The Texas heat was in full force so very short walking distance to the Silos was nice. Our son appreciated the free snacks and we appreciated the wine and scones. Comfy beds and lovely lighting inside and outside the home made us feel cozy as well as safe. Thank you for the southern hospitality!"

This was one of my favorite Airbnbs to date!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay! Everything in the house was well thought out and we appreciated all of the little extras throughout the house that made it feel like home.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"There is not one detail missed in the Poppy & Rye cottage! My mom and I walked everywhere from the cottage‚Äôs location and looked forward to coming home from a day of shopping to sit by the fire, on the porch, or in the beautiful living room. This home truly made our trip to Waco !"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always enjoy staying at Riley and Dana‚Äôs properties. The houses are welcoming and friendly with personal touches.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An amazing, well designed place with very responsive and helpful hosts. The Poppy and Rye Cottage was more than we could have hoped for. Each room felt very well thought out and the decor was impeccable. Rye and Dana went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable and entertained (based on their list of recommended activities/stores in the area) for our entire stay. We highly recommend booking a stay at the Poppy and Rye Cortage and hope to come back someday soon ourselves!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Location location location!!! This house was outstanding from the time we walked in until we left. Rye‚Äôs place goes above and beyond to make your stay comfortable and enjoyable. Easy walk to Silos and all surrounding areas. Great backyard and so many thoughtful touches inside the house! I highly recommend this house for your Waco trip.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This charming little bungalow offered so many treats and perks. Dana & Rye were the perfect hosts! Walkable to Magnolia so was perfect for us. Glad to recommend Poppy & Rye. Loved all the quotes.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cute, friendly feeling house made our girls trip even more fun! The house was immaculate, the personal touches and stories shared about Poppy made it feel like we were staying with friends. The complimentary bottle of wine made it feel like we were staying with friends who knew us very well! =D The neighborhood has a lot of development happening, but we felt completely comfortable on the short walk to Magnolia, and the home alarm system was an added comfort at night. All the extra amenities - bathroom supplies, snacks, umbrellas, coffee - were an unexpected bonus! The guest map, guest book, and selfie wall were a fun touch also. We were the only pins from Nebraska on the map! Will definitely want to stay again and have recommended the house to several friends."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Very close to our event. Very cozy.

Hoping we can return to Waco one day soon!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little cottage was just perfect for a quick visit to Waco. We rent vacation homes quite often, and truly have never experienced such hospitality from owners before! Dana and Riley go all out to ensure their guests feel welcome. Highlights of this property for us were the attention to detail, (so many personal, charming touches!) and the location, as we opened up the windows to enjoy live music from the Backyard while hanging out cooking in the evenings. Epic battles of ping pong and a short walk to Magnolia were icing on the cake. Thanks so much for sharing this little gem with us!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a wonderful Airbnb. It was extremely comfortable with many welcoming touches. It was fun learning about the remodel and the sweet tributes to beloved Poppy.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at the Poppy & Rye house! We could feel the love from the history and all of the personal quotes from Poppy.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,The Place was So nice and had so many little cute touches. I loved the bathroom essentials drawer. Also thank goodness for the little fan in the bedroom. The scone was so good and we had so much fun in the hammock. the walk to magnolia was fun. It was nice to be able to walk after All these years of driving as a Baylor student. My mom and I had a great trip!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location especially if you‚Äôre in town to check out Magnolia Market. The place is beautifully decorated and has all the necessary amenities to make you feel at home. We used the outdoor hammock and enjoyed the private little backyard space. The beds were extremely comfortable. Plenty of pillow and blanket options. I was glad I remembered to bring my ear plugs as the house is on a moderately busy road and also has a train track 2-3 blocks away. We loved the personal touch that‚Äôs been added and Rye and Dana have seriously thought of everything. We enjoyed reading the family story and shared poems on the walls. We definitely would stay here again and will be recommending it to family and friends.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I planned a short weekend trip to Waco to visit all things Magnolia and absolutely loved Riley and Dana‚Äôs home!
First off, the design and look of the place was SO cute. For a ‚Äútiny home‚Äù it felt so spacious - literally there was not a single inch in that place that didn‚Äôt serve a very functional purpose that made it feel like a large two-bedroom home! They also made sure that we had plenty (and I mean PLENTY) of amenities! There was a complimentary bottle of wine, snacks, plenty of toiletries, even a cute little dish of scones for us! They really went all out to make sure their guests felt comfortable and truly at home. Finally, the location of the place is perfect if you are planning a weekend to visit the Magnolia Silos - just a few minutes walking distance down the street. There is also parking on-site which was a big plus as Magnolia parking is a total zoo.
Overall, we absolutely loved our stay in Riley an Dana‚Äôs perfectly appointed home. We can‚Äôt wait to return!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,This is definitely one of a kind and will for sure make plans to come to Waco and stay at this beautiful house. Felt like walking into a true home after a long drive.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rye and Dana are the BEST! This was my second time renting the cottage and I just can‚Äôt wait to come back! What they‚Äôve created there is magic! Book it!!! You won‚Äôt regret it! ‚ù§Ô∏è

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Poppy & Rye Cottage is the best Airbnb we have ever stayed in hands down! The hosts are amazing. So hospitable. Every detail of the stay was done with excellence. Location is perfect for a visit to Magnolia Silos - just a block walk. Can‚Äôt wait to come back to visit again. I would give this host and location 10 stars if it was possible!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow. We literally were blown away with the personalization and care Dana and Rye put into this home. Over the years we have stayed in over 50 airbnb's and this is probably in the top 1 or 2. We cannot describe how comfortable we felt in this home. It's a small cottage, but you don't feel that when you are inside or on the property. When we arrived there was music playing, the TV was on with peaceful images, a couple of candles were safely lit in containers. There were personalized, informative instructions. There was a sign welcoming us with my wife's name on it. The beds were terrific, bathrooms pristine. They have done an amazing job converting the property into modern-traveler standards. We enjoyed ping-pong on a custom table, the firepit, and a bottle of wine called ""Poppy"". Very close to silos - 5 min walk. We both felt that a piece of Dana and Rye are truly in this home and their message and story they shared made us feel welcomed! I'm running out of room - but could go on!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was so darling and close to everything ‚ÄºÔ∏èIt was clean and the bed was so comfortable ‚ù§Ô∏èWe hopefully will get to stay there again Thank you Mike and Michaelyn Atkinson ü•∞

It was such a pleasure to stay in this home! It's such an adorable, quaint home with all the fixings. Space was used efficiently, everything looked high end and we really couldn't ask for more! So many personal, welcoming touches. Home was one short block away from the Silos with lots of other shopping areas within the same block. Host (Dana) very responsive and available. We highly recommend Poppy & Rye cottage and should we return to Waco, this is exactly where we would stay."

We commented on how we didn‚Äôt feel like we had to adapt; it was so easy to step in, put our things down, and relax. We loved the space, the place, and the conveniences to Magnolia.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Poppy and Rye was enchanting! The cottage was beautifully renovated; Riley and Dana put their hearts into the project to create a relaxing and happy environment. It's one of those places you can truly feel home away from home, and leave rejuvenated and inspired. Each room was well appointed, functional, extremely comfortable and it's own sensory experience, not to mention the ping pong, propane fireplace, and dreamy hammock space in the backyard. We were so pleased with the walkability of the neighborhood and ended up having quite a foodie experience just at the nearby restaurants. Waco is a fun place to explore and Poppy and Rye cottage was the ideal homebase, providing many suggestions for our 5-day vacation. We couldn't have asked for more kind and responsive hosts.

The house was spotless, and was even better than the pictures(which were beautiful)! The beds were super comfortable, the bathrooms were perfect, and the backyard was just as wonderful as the house. We had a fantastic time playing ping pong and sitting in the hammock. The location was ideal because we could walk to almost everything.

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Poppy & Rye has all the charm and personality of the perfect AirBNB. From the moment we walked in it felt like coming home, only better. It was so warm, inviting and had a ton of personal touches, and the the book of the history of the house, Poppy & Rye and Dana."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Well worth the price. 10000000 stars! I traveled to Waco with my warehouse team to take part in Spring At The Silos and being able to walk from our booth back to this wonderful AirBnB was such a treat. Every single night we discussed how much we enjoyed staying in the house. The attention to detail was incredible and inviting. We will be back next time we are in Waco!!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed this little gem. The owners nailed the style and comfort. The location is great one block from Silos. We would recommend this for a girls outing or a couple.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are headed to Waco, you need to stay in one of their 2 places. You will not be disappointed! The house is located within walking distance to most things ‚Äúmagnolia‚Äù. If you plan on going anytime in the near future, there is so much construction, you will be thankful for a parking space you can call your own."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved every detail of this Airbnb. Dana and Rye are the absolute best hosts. The Airbnb was clean and inviting. Can‚Äôt say enough good things!
