2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This setting is truly stunning ‚Äî you‚Äôre tucked in a private but easy to find/centrally located area, and everywhere you turn are massive saguaros, views of the mountain, and wildlife (a particular highlight was a herd of javelinas, including some tiny piglets meandering past the cabin. Joe was incredibly responsive even while hiking in a remote area himself, as well as the local property manager who were both gracious and prompt. Our last night we discovered the sweet little seating area behind the cabin ‚Äî a perfect place for a stunning sunset!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,it was perfect for our quick weekend get away!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Words cannot adequately describe the peaceful surroundings that await you at this cabin. It's set in the Tucson Mountains with serene desert in all directions. Listening to birds and other wildlife provided natures music. You'll come to anticipate the woodpecker who visits each morning!
The cabin was cozy, clean, and peaceful. There is a main house up the driveway but you will not likely see or hear anyone. There is a lovely pool just steps away from the cabin with comfortable seating and an umbrella to shield the sun. We sat outside and listened to birds, saw a javelina, a fox, bunnies, and thoroughly enjoyed the picturesque sunrises and sunsets. Every view is a postcard at Joe's place. Tons of trails to hike and mountain bike nearby. Joe very responsive-a wonderful host.
Only bad part was leaving."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed at alot of places but this cabin was absolutely amazing. It felt like you were out in the middle of nowhere but close enough to hit the town for restaurants, grocery shopping and other entertainment. I wish I could have stayed longer but this will be my go to place from no on when in the Tucson area. Also my wife was a little leary about staying outside of town but she feel in love with this cabin. She wants to go back and can't wait for the next time.
Definitely recommend!!!!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"a really special place that clearly has the heart and soul of new and old artists. so peaceful, so unique. you can't go wrong and the value is incredible."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a very quiet place and the host was so helpful üôè
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joe‚Äôs place was probably the best airbnb I‚Äôve ever stayed in. I am a teacher who wanted nothing more than a quiet spring break where I could enjoy nature and not talk to anyone :) This spot could not have been more perfect for my needs. I trekked all over Tucson for various hikes and every time I came back to the neighborhood I felt like I picked the perfect place. The location was gorgeous and so, so quiet. I felt perfectly safe as a solo female traveler and even though I never saw anyone who lived in the larger house (which was honestly great considering I was seeking solitude) it was nice knowing that there were friendly people so close. The interior looks as exactly as pictured, and the exterior, primarily the private viewing patio and the pool, greatly exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend following the walking directions in the binder to the sweet water preserve and watching the sunset at Gaye‚Äôs pass. I can‚Äôt wait to recommend this place to friends and hopefully return."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the cabin and the area is beautiful with lots to do! Unfortunately, we got bad weather and weren‚Äôt able to take advantage of the hiking & biking trails. We did, however enjoy downtown for dining & drinks.
We definitely want to visit again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Could not have picked a better Cozy Cabin to Stay at for my 1st visit to Tucson. Joe‚Äôs Cabin is close/borders Tucson Mountain & Saguaro National Parks and is in a park like setting. Joe is a great host and plan to stay here again.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, you are in the middle of the beautiful desert in a quaint cabin with quail and rabbits frequenting the property. Joe is great at responding to any questions you have."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joe's cabin was a wonderful stay, with lots of comfy accommodations and plenty of room for two people! If we wanted to, we could be entirely self sufficient with a lovely little kitchen and washer and dryer set. There are lots of critters all around the property , but they were lovely to enjoy. There's plenty of space for relaxing outdoors on the property, and the lack of traffic noise made every night almost silent. The stars were beautiful to view."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My roommate and I stayed here for a week for spring break and had the most amazing time. Pictures are identical to what you get but nothing could prepare us for the views around the property- actual magic as two people who had never been to AZ before. With this, Joe gave us great trail recommendations for our hike and was consistently responsive for all our inquiries or needs. Super easy to get into town with ubers but we stayed on/around the property mostly as it was so beautiful. We didn‚Äôt wanna leave it was everything we could‚Äôve asked for and more for our first desert vacation!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little cabin
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed the historic yet updated cabin with it's simple and pleasant decor. The location and grounds are beautiful and quiet, close enough to go to restaurants and hiking within 15-30 minutes. Very helpful to be able to do laundry in the cabin. Comfy bed and plenty of hot water.
We would love to stay here again!
Thanks for a lovely stay!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay in Joe‚Äôs cabin! If you want a quiet getaway near nature, this place is great. We stayed for five nights and explored Saguaro NP and took a day trip to Chiricahua National Monument and Bisbee. The cabin is great but a few things would make it better: a larger coffee pot, a toaster that works, a bigger table, and a bigger hot water heater that provides enough hot water for at least a 7-minute shower. None of these are deal breakers though as the cabin on the whole is great!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Joe and Lenka were wonderful hosts, immediately available if we had questions. The cabin was warm, cozy and had everything we needed.
Sitting around the pool basking in the sun or sitting among the cacti on the backyard chairs looking at the view was a quiet treat. The cabin is on a very walkable road that leads to washes and a hill with a 360 degree view. We were there for a month with no complaints and probably was the nicest air bnb we have been to."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The perfect place for a getaway with my husband. We loved the cabin and the surrounding landscape was absolutely beautiful. It was very quiet and peaceful.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really beautiful place, serene location. Joe was very accommodating and even offered to bring me an extra blanket on the record cold night. Great stay."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An incredible experience! Perfect for a getaway for two! the cabin was beautiful and cozy. The kitchen and bathroom had everything we needed. we walked in the neighborhood in the evening and it was peaceful and beautiful! Amazing views! We used the chairs Joe has set up to watch the sunset and it was wonderful! After a hike up Wasson Peak we put our legs in the pool even though it was cold for Tucson. It is a great location to explore Saguaro National Park and the Desert Museum, but very close to all of the restaurants we visited. The kitchen was incredibly well supplied and we had a ton of linens and towels. Definitely recommended and we would visit again. Thank you Joe!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The little cabin was perfect. It was close enough to the city but far enough away to make you feel like you were in the desert and mountains. Joe was very friendly and a great host. Enjoyed hiking in the surrounding mountains.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a really nice place to stay to check out saguaros. A very cozy cabin, great communication from host, would recommend and would stay again! ü§†üåµ"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"100% as described. Very detailed instructions. Quaint, peaceful, tranquil accommodations filled with the character and charisma that only a log-cabin can provide. Far enough away to feel the serenity of the area; close enough (a short drive) to access many activities or anything that might be needed. Host seemed responsive; but our stay was uneventful."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was cozy and had all the modern amenities. It was very peaceful and private!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Unique cabin in the saguaro forest. Hundred years old, but has all modern adjustments you might need.
Clean, comfortable, convenient.
Private patio is amazing, swimming pool is very nice.
We hope to return one day and stay at least for a week."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying in the cozy cabin amongst the Saguaros. I don't know about you, but I hardly sleep well when I'm on a trip, but this bed was amazing! The kitchen was just right and well stocked. I highly this place for your next trip to Tucson."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Joe's place is amazing! The views are breathing and the cabin is a one of a kind gem in the desert. I loved it!! It was so quiet and peaceful. The patio was a great added touch to sit and watch the sunrise and sunset everyday. I would love to come back and stay longer.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved this little cabin. It gives you the feel of living out in the desert and the area gives you some of the best views tucson has to offer. It was awesome waking up and being surrounded by saguaros. We will surely love to stay again whenever we are back in town.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay in this cute cabin surrounded by cacti and wildlife.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing rustic spot in the middle of the desert. Beautiful scenic surroundings with lots of wildlife. Will definitely return
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"This cabin was a beautiful getaway in the Desert. The location is stunning and very private. The reason that this is 4 stars instead of 5 is that as others have mentioned the Air Conditioning just isn't powerful enough and doesn't cool down the cabin enough to make it comfortable this time of year. The pillows could also use replacing and we did consistently find a lot of bugs in the cabin. These minor things aside, the value is superb and Joe is an impeccable host!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Could not have been happier. Joe is an amazing and thoughtful host and the cabin is everything he said it would be. Thank you Joe!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It is. One of the most beautiful and romantic moments with my husband perfect weekend at the beautiful and quiet sunsets that we have spent perfect for romantic anniversaries üíï
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super beautiful location, felt so nice and full of nature. The pool was great, and it‚Äôs a perfect little desert oasis to escape to for a little getaway."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic experience. The cabin is just as beautiful as the pictures show and is thoughfully stocked with everything you need, including coffee and spices for cooking. Our stay was in August and the temps were very high but the cabin temp remained reasonably comfortable even in the extreme (for me) temps. The surrounding scenery was spectacular! I loved utilizing the sitting area that looked out over the desert landscape each morning for coffee and again at sunset and well into the evening for star gazing. The host is super responsive - beyond expectations. I woke up around 3 a.m. to go to the restroom only to find that there was no water. I sent a message to the host and went back to bed. We woke up around 5:30 am and I found a message from the host informing me that the whole neighborhood had lost water service and that there were 4 buckets of water waiting for me on the porch. The water was back on by then - but wow! That's service!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to escape from the heat. The cabin itself is well equipped with everything you'll need and the pool on the property is the perfect to enjoy a hot summer day
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter and I had a wonderful stay. The pool is a true oasis in the desert. The cabin and pool are and beautiful, simple and luxuriously comfortable. We had everything we needed and had a relaxing vacation."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a special and unique experience! The cabin was very comfortable and cool, even during the heat of the summer. Great to have the pool to relax and cool down in, too."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If you want to escape the city life for a few days and just be one with nature this is the place to go!! The cabin is so cozy and welcoming! The pool was definitely needed after the hot days! Definitely enjoyed my stay!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is incredible! Beautiful little oasis surrounded by saguaros and mountains and all with an amazing pool next to the cabin. Joe was so friendly and invited me onto the deck to get a better angle for some sunset photos because the sunset was one of the best ever!! 10/10 location, host and stay!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Absolutely Perfect! It was exactly as expected and great for nature lovers. We highly recommend this gorgeous cabin!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This Airbnb is absolutely beautiful! Joe was a wonderful host and was very proactive. The cabin itself is rustic and full of charm. I highly recommend staying here.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful location!
Such a gorgeous home, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here. Really cool, historic home, stunning surroundings and about 15 mins away from shops and downtown.
It was far enough out of town to feel private and secluded but close enough for food and shopping.
Swimming in the pool was lovely and I enjoyed all of the string lights at night.
Also super close to the Desert Museum, cool hiking and attractions.
Both hosts were responsive, helpful and easy to communicate with.
Would definitely visit again.
Thanks Joe and Arielle!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful saguaro desert location. The log cabin was tastefully decorated in a desert-western motif as you can see in the photos. It was clean and well stocked. Very private and safe for a single woman. Hosts communicated well and were very responsive. The bed was comfortable.
The only downside was that it was a little warm (in the middle of the summer). Other than that it was a great find."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved my stay at this historic little cottage!
I was solo and felt safe, nice area loved all the cactus ‚ù§Ô∏è my favorite place was the little sitting area among the cactus ! The pool was a plus( clean and quiet) since I was there in June and was very hot. The cottage was so cute and very clean I would definitely recommend this adorable place!
There ‚Äúthings to do book‚Äù was very handy üëç
Must do is the drive up Mount Lemmon ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful little cabin tucked away in the desert! Had a wonderful stay, was a quiet and peaceful getaway. Still pretty close to downtown and things to do."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a hidden GEM...a lovely place to get away, relax, and reset. This is everything we were looking for and more! The natural surroundings are picturesque. We found the cabin to be cozy, quaint, and quite charming supplied with everything you may need, including games. The pool is gorgeous, private, and inviting. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay and plan to return soon!!! Joe and Arielle were lovely hosts."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,very happy with the place. Felt very warm everything was super clean!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joe's cabin is one of a kind. The space is beautiful, clean and practical. The kitchen has everything you may need to prepare a meal. The washer and dryer work great and the bathroom is clean, spacious and well-lit.
The main room of the cabin is exactly as it looks in the pictures. Quite comfortable even in the heat of the afternoon thanks to the efficient AC unit and fan.
The surroundings are quiet and unique, with many saguaro cacti in the property, where you can see native birds and other animals such as jackrabbits and javelina. We couldn't have asked for a more apt place for our stay in Tucson."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great home and the host had provided a binder full of activity/food recommendations, that was a really nice touch."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Terrific hideaway, in an extraordinary setting. Excellent, generous, hosts. For a guesthouse rental with owners on the premises, it doesn't get much more private and special than this."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I've been working a lot lately. I finally had some time off. I really wanted a change in scenery. Well, I didn't have to go far. Joe's place was definitely a home away from home. Pure rest and relaxation and away from the city. Had a good stay perfect for a couples retreat."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joe‚Äôs cabin was awesome! We really enjoyed ourselves. We were able to see a lot of wildlife, which was really cool. The cabin is the perfect space for two with nice amenities. Great cabin to have a getaway! Would definitely stay again!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful cabin and property! The pool was amazing and a nice place to relax after hiking. Lots of amazing hikes nearby.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are lucky enough to book this place, you‚Äôll be grateful. It‚Äôs a gorgeous desert setting. Photos don‚Äôt do it justice. It feels very secluded in the desert landscape. There‚Äôs a little private patio for watching spectacular sunsets on the saguaros. Pool is perfect after long day of hiking in the National Park. (Also recommend e-biking the east side of the park.) We were there for a few days, and will not soon forget that view. The historic cabin is so cool. This is the place you want if you are looking for a little Arizona adventure."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at this unique mountain cabin in the desert! If you are wanting to get out of the city limits and immerse yourself in the landscape, this is the place to do it! This cabin was such a unique place surrounded by the Saguaros. Highly recommend!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our 2nd stay in the Cozy Cabin and it will not be our last. The location is convenient for our day trips enjoying Arizona's wonders. The Cabin is a treasure surrounded by cactus and amazing desert creatures. The sunsets are National Geographic worthy. Joe is friendly , helpful and very interesting to converse with."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic cabin right next to the National Park! It‚Äôs the perfect get away cabin in the perfect location for nature lovers. I stayed there for three nights to explore the National Park and Tucson Mountain area and it was the perfect location. This cozy cabin is a must. Highly recommend!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,very nice cozy cabin!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joes cabin is truly a hidden gem! Up in the hills away from everything but a short trip into Tucson for restaurants/entertainment if you so desire. The surrounding area was beautiful- peaceful and walkable.
Joe is an excellent host - checking on needs but not overbearing.
We will certainly put this on our list to come back!!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sweet oasis in the desert-after all who has a log cabin among saguaro cactus. Very quiet and peaceful. And convenient 15 minutes away from almost everything.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing location and beautiful cabin. Would highly recommend to anyone wishing to explore the area.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My third stay here‚Äîthat says it all! Looking forward to #4.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cottage was as cozy as we had hoped for and it was so lovely to sit out in the shade and enjoy it. Some evenings we could hear coyotes! Joe came quickly when we needed help with the stove! We recommend this place!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay at this lovely setting. Well equipped rental with privacy and lots of nice extras.
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,This was such a cool place to stay. The location was awesome for everything we wanted to see. Joe was so nice and friendly. The nights were so still and calming. The best was when the coyotes howled at dusk. Would definitely come again!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Joe has a unique place in a beautiful great location. There are chairs set up to enjoy the view. The beautiful and peaceful desert surrounds the rustic guest cottage. There is a pool but it was too cool for swimming. It is possible to take good walks and enjoy the surroundings. Joe is friendly and works as an artist. We really enjoyed staying in the historic home. Great biking and food spots are also relatively close by. Would love to return.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"beautiful outdoor area. The cabin was clean, good location, and bed was comfortable. exactly what I was looking for.
heard coyotes at dusk, saw a few rabbits and a couple mule deer in the evening. good location for driving to many trails in the surrounding area."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We spent a wonderful, peaceful week at this rustic getaway. It really does look like the pictures! You're in the desert outside of Tucson with saguaros, javelinas and a billion stars. All that and only a 19 minute drive to the heart of city and the best of Sonoran cuisine. Highly recommended!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joe‚Äôs place is so great this is our second visit! The well appointed cozy historic cabin with fireplace is very special and unique. The outdoor area and location are just as special. Joe and Arielle were helpful and accommodating. This place is why AIRbnb is still relevant.
Unforgettable!!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was a cool rustic place to stay. The place has character. The bed was super comfortable and the working fireplace was nice to have on chilly winder evenings. Joe was very responsive and helpful for any questions I had. The location is conveniently close to Tucson Mountain Park and Saguaro National Park which have some great hikes. I would stay again.
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"We really enjoyed our stay at Joe‚Äôs cabin. There is a cozy sense of place to be had, especially in the evenings when it‚Äôs cold and dark outside. Being nestled into this cute cabin was great after days of hiking and exploring the natural beauty of Tucson. We loved the attention to detail- the objects on the mantle, the sitting areas around the property and the area around the pool were all clearly created by someone with an artistic eye. As you may have read, the shower is finicky- sometime it‚Äôs just fine, others the hot water did last as long as one would expect. I‚Äôm sure they are on it though! We love the neighborhood- huge lots with lots of desert wildlife and quiet- except for the coyote serenades. We appreciated the well appointed kitchen as we ate in many nights. We valued the great communication and Joe‚Äôs desire to have us feel at home."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful setting, cute and cozy cabin with unique character. We loved our stay! Would stay again and recommend it to others. Thank you so much!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Location was lovely and cabin was nice. Had difficulties with the tv but it is good to take a break from technology
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our first stay so much that when we had to change our plans due to weather, we were excited to be able to stay for two additional nights."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was mostly great. It was cozy and comfortable. And Joe was very responsive. The only issue we had was that the fire place did not have great ventilation and would tend to smoke out the room.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at this cozy cabin. Our only complaint would be the hot water situation in the shower. Although we saw the note and understood that the cold and hot dials were switched, the hot water still seemed to run out very quickly. It wasn‚Äôt an issue of running out of hot water though as the kitchen sink always had steaming hot water so maybe it was user error? We would have liked the hot tub to have been working. Perhaps our favorite feature of this cabin was the wood burning fireplace. We had little contact with the host but his communication was clear and frequent. We would definitely recommend this cabin and would stay again if ever back in the area."
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very unique place to stay!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had an amazing stay at this beautiful desert cabin-like home. Incredible views of the desert and surrounding mountains, beautiful sunsets every night. A short drive to many great local shops, restaurants and museums."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This adorable place is perfect for exploring Tucson and environs! Clean, private, quiet, and so adorable!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Joe's cabin was beautiful and extremely unique! the location was excellent, tucked away right next to the mountains. we saw a pack of deer come right up the driveway, it was pretty cool! it made for a great base camp to see all areas of Tucson. Joe was a great host, he even provided us with some firewood!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joe‚Äôs place is a true gem. The location and setting is perfect - I felt like I was on vacation somewhere very remote. The cabin is the cutest - clean and functional, gorgeous views! Hoping to come back soon."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really great place to get away, convenient to Tucson and all the sights. We stayed two nights, it was cold outside in the evening and we had to run the heat, which worked great. We also brought a Duraflame log and had a fire in the fireplace one night, which was quite cozy. The cabin has everything you need for your stay away from home. Very clean, well supplied with dishes, pots, pans, coffee pot, etc. It's a very comfortable place to be.
It is a really unique antique building that was obviously restored with a lot of love and devotion. It's a very special place, nestled among the giant Saguaros of the Sonoran desert. If you are looking for peace and quite, calm and serene near the city, this is it.
We spent two days seeing sights from the Sonoran Desert Museum, the Pima Air Museum, Reid Park Zoo, Saguaro National Park, Tombstone, Bisbee, and Kartchner Caverns, and this was a good location for all that sight seeing. Unfortunately, due to the cold, we didn't use the pool, maybe next time.
Joe was super quick at responding to my questions, and is obviously a very attentive host. I would absolutely stay here again if I head back down to Tucson area in the future."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A really lovely place to stay as close as you can get to the Saguaro National Park! The cabin was beautifully decorated, clean, with a full kitchen and nice hot shower. Would definitely stay here again."
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Historical cabin with the best little private patio steps away for taking in the sky. We didn't use the pool. It was super handy to have a washer/dryer during our lengthy trip away from home. Also, when we needed to extend the stay due to the airline changing our flight, boom, easy. Very kind host. Very cool space."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a really good d time at Joe's place. The cabin is cosy and nicely secluded, would definitely recommend if you are in the area visiting."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Joe was a great host‚Äîwe had a clogged shower drain and issue with stove that were immediately fixed. Thank you so much!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay. The neighborhood is very quiet and peaceful. We could hear coyotes at night! Joe was an excellent host and was very responsive to any questions we had during our stay. The cabin is very nicely decorated, clean, and the bed was incredibly comfortable. The kitchen is well-equipped and the washer/dryer were so nice to have after a week of traveling. We will be back!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good evening Joe! Maddie and I are jist settling in for the night and we realized we forgot to grab our food out of the fridge. It was one of those ""i thought you grabbed it"" kinda things.
So sorry about that - we arent the type to leave a mess!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This cabin is a find. Rustic with modern amenities. Serene and a nature lover's dream. We hope to go back again!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great find and experience! Close to the national park, downtown, and museums, but located in a quiet, beautiful neighborhood, Joe‚Äôs cabin is a must stay! Not only we‚Äôre the hosts accommodating with our travel schedules, but their restaurant and excursion recommendations were perfect. Would definitely come back!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a special place. We weer very intrigued by the local critters. We spent a lot of time wandering around looking for local AZ creatures that are so different than what we have in the pacific northwest.
The location was so perfect. Far enough away from Tucson but close enough to be convenient. The drive to and from was also very nice."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The highlight of our trip and maybe the best AirBNB spot we've stayed at! The place was perfect, very comfortable and had everything we needed and more. Communication was great, and hanging out in a nice swimming pool in the middle of the desert in the morning before a short drive to Saguaro NP had quite an amazing feeling!"
2022-09-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cabin was charming but things do need attention. There was no hot water for the shower,
the Frig.. did not cool. The towels were stored above the shower and necessitated standing on a chair to retrieve.
The TV was hard to tune in."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was perfect for a weekend getaway from the city life. It was very clean, the pool was amazing, and the hosts were very accommodating and easy to communicate with. I definitely would recommend this for anyone seeking a true western experience!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The log cabin is magical and a walk through time into a space of simplicity. The rustic ambience was so peaceful and the attention to detail was remarkable. Arielle our host was a pure pleasure and instantly available. Have to admit as incredible as the cabin was, the highlight for us was the pool. It was a step into Shangri-La surrounded by a village of saguaro cactus. Floating in the pool watching the beauty of the desert sunset - can't get much better than that! Even as you feel totally remote and private it is really only a few minutes from town. Was a perfect location for our 40th wedding anniversary. Will definitely be back and hopefully for a much longer stay!!!!
Tom and Christine Oyas"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed every second in the historic cabin. I was a amazing, relaxing weekend getaway. From the private drive way, pool and beautiful sunsets it is definitely a place we will visit again."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying out amongst the cacti, so beautiful! Quanit cabin, pool, beautiful grounds. Thank you!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is a dream. I enjoyed three days here relaxing and working. It was quiet, safe, and comfortable.  
The pool was a perfect way to cool off in the heat or after a walk down the road. There are lights where you can swim at night.
The front half of the cabin is cooler where the ac is and the back half is a little warmer but it's not a big deal. Has a kitchen with everything you need. 
Wifi and tv. Open space in the cabin to move around. Beautiful sunset and sunrise views. The entire property and neighborhood is surrounded  by saguaro cactus. The national forest is about 15 min drive to see. 
Thank you for sharing your space! I enjoyed every part of it. "
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"10/10 recommend staying here.
The space felt much larger than the photos could show but was still super cozy. The pool was amazing, the views were stunning and seeing the wildlife around was pretty cool. It was an overall great experience and would stay again."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joe‚Äôs cabin is probably the best experience we‚Äôve had on Airbnb yet. The place has a ton of charm and the details are amazing, but at the same time it‚Äôs also totally modern and squeaky clean. Location is top notch. If I could give 6 stars, I would!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My second stay there. That says it all! Looking forward to my third.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect retreat right on the edge of the Saguaro National Park. The pool was amazing, perfect temperature in these hot Tucson summers. 10/10 would recommend."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very beautiful and private.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place. Our favorite parts were the pool, washer/dryer, and the quiet surroundings. Recommended!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and very clean space. The host was very responsive and accommodating. Definitely recommend staying here.
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice desert dwelling place cozy enough for the two of us. Beware that you might come across some desert creatures that might make your stay a bit interesting. A tarantula greeted us upon arrival, along with a few toads, lots of lizards...outside. Enjoyed cooling off in the pool, and watching the sunset from a special ""patio"", a small walk from the house.
Love living the desert life"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great 4 night stay at the cabin, which was very clean & comfortable. It's a charming, authentic homesteading cabin transported here from Montana, with an added bathroom and kitchen. It was so quiet - we could only hear the desert birds! We loved the beauty of the surrounding landscape, and being able to walk on quiet roads right out the back door, or driving a short distance away to reach hiking trails. Food shopping was only a 10 minute drive away, and most Tucson must-see sites were within a half hour drive. As we were visiting at the height of the summer heat in July, the added fan our host brought us helped cool the cabin off better than the AC alone. If we were staying for more than a week, we would choose something with a larger kitchen but this is perfect for a shorter stay. The swimming pool was delightful and totally private. Our host responded to our questions within minutes. Great value for money - highly recommend this place!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The attention to detail was amazing. Great communication and an amazing experience. Thank you!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Nice cottage on the west side of town.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Joe & Arielle have a very nice cabin situated in the perfect location. It is easy to find and near the National Park. It is also isn‚Äôt far from everything else in Tucson. The area is quiet and the cabin in clean and comfortable. This was the perfect spot for my wife and I; we had everything we would need and had no issues. This cabin is everything Joe says it is and more. Would definitely use it again. Perfect.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a great stay - the cabin was charming and cozy, and the pool was exactly what we needed during the hot Tucson afternoons! The sunset views from the private patio (next to the giant saguaros) were breathtaking. Hosts were responsive with clear instructions. We would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is so special. Clean, comfortable, has really cool history, and the views are just magical. We wish we could‚Äôve stayed longer - will never forget the beautiful sunrise/sunset. Would stay here again in a heartbeat."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had such an amazing stay! The cabin is so unique and cozy. The AC is great and we had all the amenities we needed. The location is amazing, go to the Arizona Sonora Desert Museum if you get a chance! Very cool!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,A cute little cabin in a great location. The hosts couldn‚Äôt have been more responsive. Had a nice stay and enjoyed the pool too.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful location, and an excellent cottage to stay in."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great spot! pool was a little bit unclean but overall this was a fantastic spot in a beautiful area !
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely property in a beautiful location. Thoughtful hosts. Easy drive to several birding hotspots. I‚Äôd love to stay there again.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Staying here feels like staying in Saguaro National Park. Our first morning we had a javelina on the front porch and our last night we saw a small herd of deer in the neighborhood. So many birds and gorgeous views. The hosts were very communicative and their instructions were clear and made everything easy. Absolutely recommend staying here!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,really neat place and awesome location. great hiking in the area. nice cabin for 2 people
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little place! The porch off the front of cabin was a great place to relax and enjoy our morning coffee with the birds, javalinas, and deer."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I reserved Joe's place as a birthday gift for my son in graduate school. He loved the place and felt refreshed and energized after a couple days there.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was beautiful, as we're the surroundings. Perfect for a relaxing little get-away anniversary for my husband and I!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Charming, peaceful, and a perfect getaway. The attention to detail is so remarkable that you feel incredibly special just being there. It‚Äôs like walking into a movie set, or being transported to a different time. It‚Äôs so very relaxing, you‚Äôll absolutely love it!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Joe‚Äôs place was great! It‚Äôs located in a beautiful neighborhood abutting the Saguaro National Park. The area is quiet and the cabin is unique with all the modern amenities you could ask for. We saw mule deer and javelinas. There is a beautiful spot with chairs to just enjoy the outdoors and sunsets. 10/10 would recommend.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Joe‚Äôs place was clean, comfortable unique, & special. Everything you need is there. And what you don‚Äôt know you need, But actually do is the quiet‚Ä¶. Just sit and look up at the dark desert night sky. I would come back here on my next trip to Tucson first choice. I can‚Äôt really imagine any better place to stay in the area. The only thing that could‚Äôve made the experience any better would‚Äôve been a working hot tub. And by time you go it may be working so enjoy that too."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the rustic cabin. It had everything we needed and was neat, tidy, and comfortable. It was exactly as advertised. We loved the view from the little sitting area off the driveway - great for an evening glass of wine. Additionally, it is a very serene and relaxing location. The neighborhood is beautiful, and everyone seemed friendly. We are runners and were able to run to the Sweetwater Preserve and along neighborhood roads. We saw local wildlife when relaxing on the porch with our morning coffee - deer, javelinas, and all manner off birds. It is a perfect getaway for those wanted a break from busy life. However, it is also close enough to access restaurants and sightseeing. Joe is a wonderful host and was quick to respond to all messages. We would definitely stay here again!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,An authentic cabin in the middle of the desert! Great sunset views out back and (if you are lucky like us to see a full moon) even better moonrises from the other side of the cabin. Cabin was comfortable with a full kitchen for all your cooking needs. Close to many great hiking trails as well as the city in case you want explore both things. Highly recommend this place!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cozy cabin was the perfect launching point for exploring Tucson and Saguaro National Park. We loved the historic cabin - it was a great spot for viewing wildlife in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at Joe‚Äôs cabin! It‚Äôs clean, adorable, and was perfect for our long weekend getaway! It‚Äôs a great spot for beautiful sunrises/sunsets too! On our last morning we even saw some Javelinas in the nearby brush right outside the cabin!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Imagine waking up in a log bed with sun streaming through the windows highlighting the artist decorated room of a cabin originally built over a hundred years ago. We even heard a lone coyote early one morning. It‚Äôs all about the peaceful location and experience!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This lovely cabin is peaceful, clean, quiet, and it has such history in its walls (literally!) The space is perfect for relaxing, the kitchen is fully functioning, there is a washer and dryer, the shower water has great pressure, the outside landscaping is lovely, and it all makes us want to come back again! Oh yes, and check outside for the native fauna out foraging in the morning!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This stay was excellent. Picture perfect location!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a really unique place, with extraordinarily enjoyable outdoor spaces, from a shady porch to a little private patio among saguaros, to a pool. It‚Äôs out west among scattered houses and desert. The 100 year old rebuilt cabin is comfortable and quiet, except for the sounds of coyotes and owls. Comfy and cool looking bed, and cool area to explore on foot. Just what we were looking for!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Altogether delightful and so comfortable and authentic! Wonderful private sun deck adjacent to cabin was a lovely meditation spot, with the peaceful, quiet desert hovering nearby! Do it!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a quiet little cabin with a rich history. You are out of the way from the city life, but yet close enough for exploring, restaurants and shopping."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Stayed here for 2 and half weeks and Loved everything about this place! Close to Tucson but also far enough away to feel very quiet and private.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Such a lovely cabin! Nestled in the Saguaros- away from the city noise and lights, yet close enough to easily get back into town. Feels like being wrapped in a warm blanket‚Ä¶ fireplace completes the cabin feel. Can‚Äôt wait to stay again and hosts were just as lovely as the cabin."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome cabin for a few solo nights in the Sonoran desert. Would recommend!! Great for a Tucson native or a newbie. I saw jackrabbits everyday from the kitchen window, saw and heard tons of birds, and heard lots of coyotes every night. Picturesque desert living in a historic cabin. I loved it!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend staying at the cabin. A charming place with huge log walls and saguaro ceiling, which evokes bygone times and surrounded by picturesque desert. It's wonderful just to relax outside and look at the cactus, mountains, hummingbirds, quails and rabbits. Well located for hiking, visiting the Sonora Desert Museum, etc."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin out amongst the saguaros is as good as it gets. The location is almost unbelievable - close to town but out in the middle of huge cacti, with stars and coyotes and a squadron of 10 visiting javelina (yes, a pack is called a squadron) right outside the window one morning. The cabin is beautiful, a perfect combo of rustic and charming and completely functional. Arielle and Joe were easy to communicate with, provided clear and user-friendly directions and check-in was a breeze with the lock box. Melissa and I have stayed at many places and this cabin is absolutely one of the top few. I could struggle to say something negative (let's see, the sound of the knife on the glass cutting board is kind of loud? The holiday lights outside were too colorful and fun? That's all I got). I honestly think this is THE best stay in the Tucson area! Thank you Joe and Arielle!!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent place to stay. Clean, cozy, and functional. Great communication with host. Excellent suggestions for food and things to do. Highly recommend."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Plenty of hiking and wildlife in the area. Cozy cabin and perfect for a couple looking to get away.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a happy time in their wood house. The instructions from them are easy to understand and clear. Looking forward to visiting here again.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This cabin is a hidden treasure!! Everything was just as the photos and descriptions stated; so cozy and comfortable!! We felt like we were in our own private piece of the Saguaro National Park! Communication with the hosts was great from booking to checkout. Would definitely stay here again if traveling in the Tucson area in the future.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely charming cabin. A gem in the desert! Very prompt communication as well.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my second time visiting this gorgeous cabin. The only thing I would change would be to stay for longer. I can‚Äôt wait to come back! Such sweet holiday touches like Christmas lights and a little tree added to all the thoughtful details. This is the best Airbnb I‚Äôve ever stayed in. Thank you!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is the closest you will get to actually living amongst the Saguaros! This cabin is simply amazing and perfect for either a short term or long term stay. My wife and I stayed 7 nights and didn't want to leave! Very quiet and full of local wildlife. There is even a patio with 2 chairs and footstools out back that is PERFECT for watching the sunset-which we made sure we did every night! The host has thought of everything. You really do get a true desert experience here. Remote but close enough to everything you could want. Some people go to the beach to relax and do nothin, I go to the desert. This place allows you to just sit outside amongst the cacti and do nothing if you want. I highly recommend!!!!! The desert is calling you!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wow!!!! Such a beautiful place ‚Ä¶ everything was wonderful.. love the location and the beautiful views‚Ä¶
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is an absolute gem. Beautiful surroundings, wonderful cabin with all the amenities you could need, close to the city, close to the parks, and the hosts couldn‚Äôt be nicer. We would stay here again in a heart beat."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a place to learn what Tucson has to offer! Close to everything.
And amazing to wake up inside of a 100 year-old cabin. One lives history here!
Saguaros, stars, coyotes, and hiking with rewarding views.
The hosts were outstanding. I will return."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My best Airbnb experience in a decade. Joe‚Äôs cabin has the small touches that show a host who truly cares. The property itself surely doesn‚Äôt hurt - it‚Äôs a gorgeous backdrop.
It‚Äôs close to the owner‚Äôs home, but the bramble and Saguaro provide a genuine privacy and feeling of comfy isolation. I‚Äôd love to go back for a while and spend some real time in this part of the country; it‚Äôs incredible.
WiFi is good enough to do the job for most remote work purposes (10mbps synchronous), so this would be a fine spot for a few video calls if you are having to work remotely"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"'Comfy and Cozy' does not begin to describe this wonderfully unique 100 year old cabin. When you walk inside it feels like a giant hug. The views are spectacular. It's incredibly quiet and peaceful for being so close to the city. The cabin is beautifully furnished and the kitchen, although compact, is perfectly adequate to cook a huge Thanksgiving meal! We felt privileged to stay in this beautiful historic cabin and would not change a thing!"
2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Peaceful and perfect.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful place to experience the Sonoran desert. Quiet, secluded and comfortable. It was a great hideout in a perfect location to explore the Tucson area."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic spot and host.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my second time at Joe and Arielle‚Äôs cool cabin among the saguaros. What an idyllic location. Hopefully you‚Äôll have time to do some hiking in the nearby Sweetwater Preserve. We did 2 seven mile hikes and were so glad we did. Equally spectacular is just sitting among the saguaros and watching the sunset from their special sunset patio‚Äîlistening to the quail and coyotes; watching the stars in Tucson‚Äôs well deserved ‚Äúdark sky‚Äù; and just relaxing. The cabin has everything you‚Äôd expect and need. Even though it‚Äôs a bit remote we ordered delivery pizza (Door Dash) with no problem. I was also a bit concerned since we didn‚Äôt have our vehicle this time but we didn‚Äôt have any problem with Uber and Lyft finding us and arriving relatively promptly. (Uber was more available but Lyft was cheaper.). All in all this is one of my favorite AirBnBs. We‚Äôll stay here again!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My son and I flew out to Tucson to spend the week hiking and stayed 3 nights at Joe and Arielle‚Äôs beautifully decorated cabin. It was extremely cozy and extremely clean. The washer and dryer was an added bonus. It was in very close proximity to Saguaro National Monument. I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to stay here again and would highly recommend it to anyone.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful rustic charm in the desert. Feels completely private and like you are in the middle of the desert even though you are right off the road.

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved the cabin and the quiet solitude of the desert! We were visiting relatives in Maran so the location was perfect for us. The well equipped kitchen makes meals a snap. There is even a blender for those who want to make margaritas! Great place to relax and party!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful cabin in a great location. Very comfortable and cozy. Amazing scenery in every direction. Incredible sunsets , wildlife and cacti. Can't wait to go back."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Norma and Luis were great hosts that made you feel at home! The studio is close to their home so I was kindly greeted when I arrived and they made sure that I has all the information I needed.

My experience and expectations were met exactly with what was described in the posting. The bathroom was extremely clean with modern fixtures. Bonus! Mattresses are a personal preference, but I really like the balance of this medium firmness memory foam. I slept great. This place is not super fancy, but it is cute and it absolutely suited my needs for one night and was perfect for me. So much cheaper than a hotel.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I had a lovely stay at the studio on a working vacation, so spent more time at the house then I would on a tourist vacation. It was roomy and comfortable. Very pet friendly with lots of space for the kennel and fenced yard. The neighborhood seems quiet, though note that it generally lacks sidewalks and shaded streets making walking a dog in the summer challenging. There was a bit of noise from the immediate neighbors, including evening loud music, children screaming, and occasionally drums, but the noise did not go late into the evening and was not constant, mostly during the weekend. But something to note for very noise sensitive guests or pets. I loved that the kitchen had lots of appliances, but it had only basic dishes and stovetop pots and pans; guests wanting to do more extensive cooking should bring their own cutting board, knives, cooking utensils and oven bake ware. Parking instructions turned out to have changed, but I didn't have parking issues once that was cleared up."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"the place was clean and well-maintained. I enjoyed the yard with shade trees. It was quiet. The surrounding neighborhood is high-density housing, but I never had any problems. The kitchen had everything I needed and more."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place to stay for a couple nights. The bed is a full, so if there are two people staying together, you'll be cozy. It's nice to have a whole casita to yourself and having parking is nice too. We would stay here again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, cute space!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is off the road and very quiet. It is the best designed small space we have seen and actually did not seem small from the inside. We highly recommend this place.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was met by Beatriz‚Äôs husband & he was SUPER hospitable. He saw I had a few bags & carried them to the door & made sure that I got in safely. I felt like an extended family member more than a guest. The area is near plenty of restaurants, the UofA , Downtown & is super safe."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as described in the listing, the hosts were great to communicate with and there weren‚Äôt any surprises. It is conveniently located near restaurants, breweries, grocery shopping, etc. We had a lovely time while visiting Tucson for a friend‚Äôs wedding."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Single, stayed for a week, would go back again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The studio worked perfectly for my needs, a good space for one person, and the kitchen was very convenient. Norma was very helpful, letting my sister put some groceries in the apartment since I was arriving so late in the evening. Only comment would be as the last reviewer commented, there was food in the refrigerator left from a prior guest. My sister gave me a detailed list of what she left so that I knew what was meant for me.
With family on the far east side and northwest, the central location was a good middle ground. I would recommend, though would be most comfortable for one versus two, as the bed is a full."
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"What the place lacks in exterior conditions, it makes up for in interior. Very nice modern bathroom with bidet. The kitchen is convenient and the bed was comfortable. Huge TV with all the streaming services. The only negatives are it is small. Best for one person but my friend and i found it fine for one night and it wasn't that bad but there was food in the refrigerator. Lots. Like full condiments and meats and cheeses. Looked like someone lived there. And there was some miscommunication about the parking. But it was addressed. All in all, i would stay there again if it were just me."
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean studio sized apartment in a central location. We spent one weekday night and it was quiet. Neighborhood safe, but run down. Good value for the price."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I only slept there for one night, but it was great!"
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Norma was responsive to most of my messages. The room was nice, but a little smaller than we thought, we were hoping for a queen size bed, but ended up with a full.
The neighborhood
was quiet and the neighbors were friendly.
overall, we enjoyed our stay and would consider renting again."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was just as described and i had no issues with my stay. Would do it again

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super clean, smelled great,quiet and peaceful. Hosts were so kind, considerate, and respectful. I‚Äôll be back"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute little cottage that's part of a duplex behind the main residence. There's what appears to be a duplex next door that shares the same entry way. Also the property is at the back of the lot, fairly close to the rear neighbor's home. So, there is some people density.
That said, other than some neighbors who stay up late Saturday night talking, it was peaceful and quiet the remainder of the time. The neighbor in the adjoining duplex unit was quiet as well.
Inside the unit is very charming. There's not a lot of prep space if you're staying for a while and like to cook, but it is doable. I enjoyed my stay and consider this a good value for the price."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great deal for a nice place. Looks exactly as it does in photos. Would come back again.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Norma's place was just what we needed while our travel trailer was getting repaired. She and her husband were very friendly and accommodating. I would recommend their place and there is a little yard for your pet!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was great for me. Plenty spacious for myself, pretty close to the interstate and the rest of town, and very affordable."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed the night on our way home to Texas. Checked in late with no issues, clear instructions on how to get inside. Nice efficiency with a huge smart tv. Next time we‚Äôre in Tucson, will be staying at Beatriz‚Äôs again."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,wonderful place
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely perfect for my quick trip to Tucson. Highly recommend.
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The interior of this property is nicely updated, clean, and well-kept. The location and surroundings, however, are a huge deterrent. Off a busy street in Tucson, located behind a car dealership. It is a small house within a group of similar small houses, which are all located on what looks like a shared property with chain-link fences in between. The walkway and yards are all overgrown with weeds, no distinguishable landscaping attempts. It is dark, and the parking area is essentially located on the street. I did not like leaving my car there. I also did not feel safe walking to and from the property in the dark - and feeling safe in the dark is essential, as I am a travel nurse who takes overnight call for the hospital. The owner was super responsive and kind, asking for feedback on how to make it better. However, I'm unsure if it's a fixable issue - location is location."
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Convenient, easy stay in Tucson! Norma is a gracious host and was very responsive for us."
2022-11-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"I couldn't sleep because I was so cold. The blanket was a thin summer thing and there was no extra one, I searched the whole place. There is no heat here, and it got down to 40 that night. I also had to search for a (clean?) towel, and eventually found (only) one tossed on a shelf in the closet. This should not have been listed as available for Instant book if it wasn't ready. This was a terrible way to spend the night after a long day of driving. The place is cute, but my stay sucked."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was a nice clean. Good location to lots of restaurants and not a far drive from many attractions. It was not an issue for us as both myself and my fianc√© are on the smaller side but the bed may not work for couples that need a lot of room. Other than that no major issues!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location close to UA. Perfect for what we needed!

We stayed with another family; so four adults, four kiddos age 3-6, as well as a 4 month old. Our kids were constantly entertained with all of the indoor and outdoor toys and activities. Would highly recommend and would stay again in a heartbeat should we be in the Tucson area!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is by far one of the best airbnbs we have ever stayed at! The house is extremely accommodating to children which was perfect for our season of life. There were activities all throughout the inside and outside of the house to keep the kids entertained! Unfortunately the weather was too cold for us to swim, but that just had us wanting to return even more! The kitchen was fully stocked with cooking ware, plenty of towels, shower supplies, extra blankets, a pop up crib and also subtle labeling around the house to let you know where everything was. Absolutely Perfect. Perfect. Perfect!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great for a family. They were extremely responsive, accommodating, and perfect for our needs."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was our first time in Tucson and we had a wonderful time. I was blown away how beautiful the landscape is. The location of Nikki's place is perfect- private, near the base of Mt. Lemmon (stunning views of mountains!), but also a very easy drive from downtown Tucson and plenty of day trips. There is really so much to do in Tucson for a family- drove up to a Spring Training game, Desert museum, hikes, biking Mt Lemmon, tacos, etc. The place is also very family friendly- plenty of little kid toys, great outdoor space (swing set, pool- although a bit too cold for us to go in in March, area for lawn games, grill, etc). Perfect place for a family spring break!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Amazing spot! We really enjoyed the accommodations and our stay.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house was perfect for a family- we played lots of ping-pong and poker. This was well appointed, with tons of kitchen equipment and herbs and spices. The mattresses and pillows were fantastic. We loved the Sonoran desert landscape all around. Was a great place and will definitely rent this place again when we go back to Tucson."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Incredibly clean and welcoming. One of the best airbnbs we‚Äôve stayed at. We greatly appreciated all the kids toys, coffee bar, shampoo and conditioner in the bathrooms, and extra blankets. The backyard was beautiful and peaceful and the kids loved the sandbox and playset. Everything was exactly as pictured. Quiet safe neighborhood. Mattresses and pillows were super clean but FIRM so keep that in mind if you prefer a soft mattress. Also, there was a strange lack of pots and pans. The kitchen had lots of spices and oils and utensils, but hardly any pots or pans or cookware. There was nothing I could use to bake chicken or roast veggies or stir fry for a large family. We ended up just ordering take out and eating out but if you like to cook more you might want to ask the hosts for more pans. There is a grill tho with provided propane which is very nice. Overall it was a super clean and well appointed home and we enjoyed our time there!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful desert home. We used to live in Tucson and it made us want to move back!!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house was exactly as expected! Loved all the things they had for kids to do. They definitely thought of everything!
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,This was a perfect place for us to stay as a family. It was neat and clean and just as seen in the photos. The area was peaceful and nice for a walk. The kids loved the ping pong table and card table. Wish it was warm enough to enjoy the pool and the awesome backyard. It was spacious and everyone had their own place to rest comfortably. We all loved it and would have liked to enjoy it for another day if our time allowed.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Everything went beautiful staying time viewing the beautiful white snows on the top of Mt Lemmon and I have my service dogs enjoying staying with me. Many Ton of Thanks üëç Robert

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The family getaway is just that. It was thoughtfully put together to give families a chance to be together but not be cramped for space. The walking area around the house is beautiful. It was so peaceful too. A nice quiet setting.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was great
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The stay was good. The host communicated almost daily during our stay.
The location was great with the mountains in the background. In addition the place had activites for the kids. My granddaughter enjoyed the games and activities provided.
Be aware that the pool is out side and may have critters in the water. We had a desert rodent during our stay at the bottom. The host was very responsive and willing to come out to remove it when notifled. The host left a binder about the place. It gave good instructions about the place.
Always check the pool first and beware of ants by the pool.
No negative comments."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home. Lots of space. Game room was excellent addition. Big backyard but unfortunately did not use the pool because it was too cold to swim. Great location. Not far from Mt Lemmon or Saguaro Natl Park. Highly recommend.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Exactly what we were hoping for and more. An unexpected warm welcome with a gift basket waiting for us when we checked in. First Class!
Whether a family gathering including toddlers or group of adult friends, this home is very accommodating in a great location. Can enjoy ‚Äúall things Tucson‚Äù from here and be able to relax in comfort when hanging out indoors or in the back by the pool. Excellent restaurants nearby as well as hiking opportunities in beautiful Sabino Canyon. Would definitely stay here again. Nikki and C√©lida are awesome hosts."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a lovely family and dog friendly home. They thought of everything to make you feel comfortable and make it feel like home away from home. Especially loved the dog toys and wall of pictures. I wish I had brought my dog on the trip with me! Thank you!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Gorgeous home that‚Äôs great for families. The kids loved the backyard and all of the games ! Pool was a little too cold for a fall dip, but it probably really refreshing in the summer. Host was very proactive about making sure we had everything we needed. Might be our new Tucson go-to!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home and located in a great spot. Was very close to the Catalina highway to go to Mt Lemmon, many nearby restaurant options. Kids loved the ping pong table and the outdoor playground on the sand. The pool was very cold so we didn't use it much but loved that it was locked and separate from the rest of the playground. Beds were very comfortable and rooms were spacious. Lots of toys and activities for kids to stay busy the whole trip."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful house that was absolutely perfect for our family vacation. Everyone we needed for a baby and 2 kids was there and the kids had the best time in the pool and on the playground. Great restaurant recommendations too! We hope to be back again one day!

Nikki was super responsive and readily available if we needed anything.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The home was absolutely pristine and hosts were very responsive and professional
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Charming house with lots to do in a secluded neighborhood that made the house feel very private. The home was very clean and offered spacious kitchen and living areas and the pool was a nice plus after a hot day. However, the Master bath felt a bit cramped (every house has its quirks). While not a big deal, the neighborhood was a short drive from dining options and supermarkets.
The host paid a lot of attention to detail and even personally reached out to us to make sure that our stay was going well.
Although we did not bring our fur baby on this trip, I thought that the house was super pet friendly."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Such a beautiful place and great location! It was clean with clear instructions and it was the perfect get away.

The home had everything we needed for our stay and was very clean when we arrived. Would definitely recommend to family and friends."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place was extremely cozy and made us and our young daughter feel right at home. So many toys and things for her to play with and a very comfy pack n play. The ac works amazingly and the beds were very comfortable. The pool was absolutely amazing and well maintained, spent a lot of time enjoying the gorgeous pool, back patio and fun cornhole games. I‚Äôm from Tucson and this is a very ‚ÄúTucson‚Äù home, made me feel back"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This house was beautiful! It was bigger than I anticipated. The house was full of everything you needed and more . Lots of stuff for everyone to enjoy. Great for families. Not too mention the best part the pool and the great hosts. I‚Äôd definitely stay again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay. The house is very clean, beds were firm and comfy, there were lots of extras touches like nightlights, pool toys, a few board games and lots of towels that we really appreciated.
The location is a bit rural, which gave us quiet and privacy. The grocery store was just 10-15 mins away."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a great Airbnb, especially for families! Everything was as pictured and as described, in fact even better than anticipated. My grandkids loved everything about it‚Ä¶.the pool, the playground, and plenty of space and things to do inside when the afternoons were hot. Also plenty of space for quiet time/naps etc. I‚Äôve stayed at many Airbnbs over the last few years, and without a doubt this one had the very best set up for spending time with my family!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a wonderful time in the blazing heat! The pool was very refreshing and the wildlife there was a thrill to watch. The house itself kept us nice and cool in the 100 degree weather! Great for families.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Gorgeous house, roomy, great pool. Thoughtful consideration of kids and dogs who all had a wonderful time, playing with toys provided and kids playing darts and ping pong. Everyone enjoyed the pool. I wanted to give my family an oasis on a long road trip and it really helped them relax. They loved it. I was able to give them a perfect break. Thanks a million."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in this home previously and love the private feel, the pool, and the beautiful space."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Wondeful space and great scenery! Happy we made the trip and loved the nice desert environment!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"There was a mix up between the cleaners and the host so when we arrived, it was obvious it hadn‚Äôt been cleaned. To be honest, I thought this was going to taint our whole stay, but you can tell that the hosts really care about their guests. From the labels scattered throughout the house, to all the toys and games for kids, we all loved staying here. Once the house had been cleaned, it was definitely clean. They even had kid‚Äôs plates, utensils and cups, pool safe cups and towels, and sand toys for the playground. We don‚Äôt get down to Tucson too often, but when we do, we hope we can stay here again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We were in town visiting our kids and grand kids. The house was like home away from home. Everyone enjoyed the beautiful pool and play ground. We all played games and bbq‚Äôd. We will definitely book here again!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed at this beautiful home while visiting family in the area.

We loved how clean and easy navigating everything was. The house was in beautiful condition and the yard was great for our pups! We look forward to being able to stay sometime again soon.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We really this part of Tucson and this home and neighborhood are great. It was a great pit stop during our multi-month road-trip across the country. Highly recommended.
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a wonderful time at Nikki's place. Felt really comfortable and peaceful. The kids enjoyed the pool. Nikki was very accommodating. Loved the place was sad to leave. Will be back during the summer. Thank you

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Enjoyed our family vacation in Tucson, and this house has everything a family could ask for!! Our daughters, ages 7 and 9, loved the play set outside, and our older daughters, ages 13 and 16, loved the pool and playroom. Very clean, and the host is very proactive and made sure we had everything we needed. After a busy day in Tucson enjoying the sites, it was blessing to come back to a house in a private and quiet community and sit outside on the patio. Highly recommend, we will be back!!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nikki's home was so comfortable. The Easter decorations were a fun touch!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place-highly recommended. Loved the location and neighborhood, on the way to Mount Lemmon. House was as pictured, clean and roomy, enough space to spread out with our family and the kids could have their own area. Loved the backyard, beautiful sunsets on the surrounding mountains. Hosts were responsive. Overall wonderful experience at this rental."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place is amazing with so many great amenities and such a comfortable set up. We felt right at home and the ambience was so inviting. We will definitely be staying here again!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We love the house and enjoyed our stay. Our little ones didn‚Äôt want to leave the house. There was plenty of thing to keep them occupied. They can‚Äôt wait to be back. Host were super helpful and easy to communicate with. Definitely 10/10
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nikki and Celida responded to all my many messages within minutes. Their house was super clean. Very comfortable. Dog and kid friendly. We lived the location. We actually stayed in to different house for the month of March. We preferred this house. I kept wishing we just rented it the whole month. Neighborhood people were very friendly. We did see 9 coyotes into bobcats on the road. They just looked at me and my dog and kept on walking. But it was very cool. There is a great park to take your kids and dog near by. Also a great hiking trail called south hills trail you can easily bike or drive to. The pool was too cold in march to use. But we did enjoy the back porch area. I would stay here again. Most hiking parks are easy to drive to. A lot are dog friendly. We did put our dog in doggie daycare at dogatopia when we hiked a park that didn‚Äôt allow dogs. Seriously, my only complaint was the lack of spoons. There were three."
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house was as described but here are my thoughts.
1. Don't send me a message and ask me not to give less than a 5 star review. I'm going to give an honest review and would appreciate it if others did the same.
2. The house is as described and has great amenities in a great location. Kids love this place, there's lots to keep them occupied. The beds were quite comfortable.
3. The house smells like cigarette smoke. (in the walls) Those with allergies beware.
4. The shower in the master is awful. The water drips out of the shower head with very little pressure.
5. Overall it was a good experience, but I do think it's overpriced."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very nice stay and Nicky was great. Very open floor plan and comfortable with everything u need.
We plan on staying here again when we come back to Tucson. A++"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved the location of this home. Tanque Verde was the perfect launching pad for hiking and visiting Saguaro National Park. The neighborhood was quiet and chill and spread out-we even had a bobcat run by yesterday. It felt very private. The backyard with the pool and outdoor dining was very relaxing. Our kids loved the inside space as there was plenty of room to do gymnastics. We really loved our time in this Tucson home.

The kitchen is well stocked, the living room is spacious, great bedrooms with plenty of space for our entire family of 7 plus the dogs!
They decorated with a cute Christmas cactus tree which was such a pleasant surprise!
The neighborhood had a power outage for a few hours one night and the hosts were super responsive giving us updates and providing options if it didn‚Äôt come back on - but it did and everything was fine - we just had Christmas dinner by flashlight üòÇ
I can‚Äôt say enough about this home - it was perfect and we had such a wonderful time!"

This wonderful house has everything! The pool is divine and the home cozy and spectacular. The view is classic Tucson, Thimble Peak in the Catalina mountains. Nikki is an absolutely fantastic host! As someone who was raised in Tucson and who hasn‚Äôt been ‚Äúhome‚Äù in ages, this special home surrounded me in beautiful Sonoran desert comfort. Do not look any further. If you need a good sized place, you found it, with everything you could want, for adults, kids, and even pets. When we come back to Tucson, we know just where to stay. Thank you sooooo much Nikki!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful home with everything you need to keep the kids and dogs entertained. Hosts are top notch and communicate regularly. They‚Äôve thought of everything!

The kitchen was perfect for homemade meals and the adults enjoyed the covered patio. We will definitely reserve this home next time we are in Tucson!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Fantastic, friendly communication from the hosts. We enjoyed the kid friendly options and the variety of games and things to do while staying.

And our host was very nice and so sweet/kind. We would call every now and then and she would be very helpful. My kids loved the pool I loved the pool. But more so it was very private and comfortable. Hope I can come back one day. The price and value is better than any 5 star hotel."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a fantastic place to stay. The attention to detail was second to none. Everything was well thought out to make the visit comfortable and enjoyable. The kitchen was well supplied with consumables as well as a great assortment of dishes, cutlery, cookware, cooking and serving utensils, spices and more. Bathrooms were well supplied with the basics like shampoo, conditioner and body wash but also had some razors, hairspray, nail polish and more. The bedrooms were as described and beautiful also having additional floor fans, hangars, robes and though we didn‚Äôt need it I even saw a pack n play for little kids. We didn‚Äôt bring a dog but this place is ready for a dog as there were food and water dishes prepared, a nice dog bed and dog treats at the ready. The pool was fantastic, the playground was in great shape as well. The communication with the owners was amazing as they responded right away to any questions we had. I would definitely go there again."

2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful interior design, fashionable and trendy gold fixtures, most comfy bed and large fridge. Everything we could want except one thing.
I wish the listing reflected the strict dog rules regarding the pool area. We were looking forward to enjoying a romantic time in the pool and spa together but Molly wasn‚Äôt allowed to be with us, even in her carrier. She‚Äôs anxious when left alone and barks. We chose the place for the pool/hot tub, so it was very disappointing not to be able to use them.
Otherwise our stay was lovely"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,As advertised and good for quick stay over
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice place for a hotel stay. The front desk had a lot on his plate but still was able to take care of me and the other people in the lobby. I would stay again if I‚Äôm in the area!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"check in was super easy, place was super clean, location was perfect!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,At first I was not sure about booking a hotel through the AirBnB app but it worked out fine. The room was really nice and clean and well appointed although the bed was definitely on the firm side. It was a bit frustrating trying to get into the parking lot as it was on a very busy street that we could only access via U-turn from the direction we were going and neither of the neighboring parking lots connect. Just make sure you enter one of the two entrances directly connected to the 3 Palms and you are good to go.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I really enjoyed my stay at this beautiful space. It had everything needed and was very modern/comfortable. Would recommend people stay here anytime.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Roger's place was beyond any shadow of doubt one of the most wonderful places we've stayed in our entire traveling experience. The room, the access, the welcome, the service was all exemplary. In fact, the next time we drive from Canada to Mexico we will customize the trip to pass through Tucson and stay at your Three Palms. Next time though, we'll stay more than one night to more fully enjoy the spectacular, resort-like amenities: the landscaping, the pool, the putting green and the outdoor BBQ patio. During our visit, Roger wasn't available but we were more than cordially taken care of by Irene when we got to the venue and the next morning by Keely when we departed. We simply cannot say enough good things about the Three Palms."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Was a great little motel. Room was nicely decorated, bed was comfy and the room was clean.
On the small side- but great value for the price."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay at this beautiful Airbnb in Tucson was absolutely fantastic! From the moment we arrived, we were blown away by the stunning view. The scenery is breathtaking, especially during sunset ‚Äì a perfect backdrop for relaxation.
The house itself is well-appointed, with every amenity you could possibly need. The highlight, of course, is the amazing pool. It provided a refreshing escape from the desert heat. Our group spent countless hours lounging by the pool, taking in the gorgeous surroundings.
Magic was incredibly welcoming and responsive, making sure every detail was taken care of. The check-in process was smooth and hassle-free.
I can‚Äôt recommend it highly enough and will definitely be returning for another stay!"

Top of the line craftsmanship from the wooden ceiling beams to the beautiful floors and everything in between. Great views from inside and outside from the deck overlooking the spectacular pool and yard. Outdoor dining area in the front yard with grill, or eat in the back yard on the deck or in the pool area (with professionally implemented shade structures everywhere). Double sized fridge and freezer and lots of counter space. Great appliances. Well stocked kitchen with good knives. All four bedrooms have nice desks. Beds are extremely comfortable with high quality linens and comforters. Bathrooms are outstanding. Host is very responsive. Just cannot say enough."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great hosts and a beautiful place!
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place is an absolute gem! From the exquisite decor to the sleek modernity, every detail exudes sophistication and elegance. Impeccably clean and flawlessly maintained, it's evident that a great deal of care and attention has been poured into ensuring a perfect stay. The seamless blend of style and functionality creates an atmosphere of pure delight. Without a doubt, this is a haven for those with discerning tastes. A truly remarkable experience that sets a new standard for excellence."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Our family enjoyed the location, cleanliness and space of the gorgeous home! Magic was very responsive when we had questions and proactive to give us information. We booked this location for a week and it felt just like home. The kitchen had everything you could want as I enjoy cooking for the family. My daughter even made cookies and brownies to bring over to the Grandparents‚Äô house.
We asked for the pool to be heated for our stay since it‚Äôs early March. It was an excellent choice! We enjoyed its tranquility (I napped poolside) and we had so many laughs!
The beds/linens and towels are plentiful and clean. The furniture was comfortable and the views are amazing.
I will definitely rent this property again when visiting Tucson!!!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a beautiful home, we enjoyed our stay and would come back if we are ever in the area. We loved the view and the heated pool was perfect for our family. So many different spaces to enjoy in the home and outdoors. It is one of the best equipped Airbnb I have ever stayed in. They have thought of everything you might need. You won‚Äôt be disappointed!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Bellini house was great for our trip with our friends. The house was clean and well stocked with everything we needed. The pool and outdoor areas were great.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I can't say enough great things about my stay, both the quality of the home and the customer service of the owners. I'd argue the rental is almost more beautiful in person, with every small detail well thought out and so many spaces to enjoy. I had messaged the owners beforehand asking if they wouldn't mind unplugging any scented air fresheners if they had some in the home because I have allergic asthma, and they went above-and-beyond purchasing (completely unprompted) all unscented cleaning products to be used before my stay, which was so considerate!!! They were communicative and helpful the whole time, the area was quiet and great for walking with lovely scenery, and I honestly didn't want to leave! Can't wait to visit Tucson and this home, again!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was one of the best air bnbs we have stayed at yet. The view was absolutely breath taking, and the pool was warm and so enjoyable.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We spent 6 nights here and found the house very relaxing and comfortable. The bedrooms allowed for space and privacy from others and the kitchen is well equipped. We opted to heat the pool in late-October and it was well worth it. Highly recommend!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Just know my family and I are already planning our next visit to come back!

The description and pictures do not do it justice... everything about it far exceeded our expectations! From the moment we walked in, we felt the warmth and care the host takes in ensuring guests feel welcome and have what they need to feel comfortable. The host was extremely responsive and followed-through with addressing any requests made during our stay. She even arranged to deliver more coffee pods without being asked to do so. We will definitely book this home again for a future visit to Tucson."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Beautiful house with everything you could need! We were in Tucson caring for a family member with severe dementia/cancer. It was a rough 12 days. It was so wonderful to come back to this beautiful house at the end of the day and relax by the beautiful pool, or just sit on the top deck and look out at the surrounding beauty! Magic was super responsive!!! We will definitely book this place again!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was very comfortable for three couples. The kitchen was well stocked and spacious, easy for several cooks working together. The covered deck was relaxing and comfortable and the view was fantastic. Kit and his staff were responsive with our questions. The dryer broke while we we there and it was replaced in one day. We have been renting houses for 25 years and Kit and his staff were the most responsive team we have worked with.
The location was perfect for access to town and several hiking areas."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Kit‚Äôs home is just as stunning as the photos suggest.
We loved all the decadent details, but, especially the spacious master bedroom and bathroom, and relaxing every night in the hot tub while gazing at the stars. Most impressive though, were the stunning views of the mountains and valley/city below no matter the time of day. The twinkling lights at night were absolutely spectacular!
We were a bit disappointed that there were things not working or available when we arrived: no working TV‚Äôs, no propane for the grill, several light bulbs out, a screen door laying on the floor with the door wide open. But, after contacting Kit, he was very responsive and had most of the issues taken care of the next day.
Minor issues aside, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would absolutely recommend Kit‚Äôs lovely home to anyone looking for a luxurious stay while visiting Tucson."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Host was very communicative and clear. Space is bigger than the photos appear! Hot tub and fireplace in good working order and made a pleasant experience. Great view and very quiet area.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"WOW! This was our first visit to Tucson and staying in this house made it amazing! The location of this house was so great and it is better than the pictures! The views are spectacular! Mountain views and city views combined made this a unique experience that we highly recommend. The house is huge and we stayed with some of our grown children and their family. We joked that we could easily live in the house with them and we would not get in each other's way. The main bedroom is huge and like an apartment in itself, it even has its own office and two outside doors. The closet is a dream! We were on a business trip mixed with a little vacation and had plenty of room to get our business supplies organized.
The outdoor spaces are breathtaking! We enjoyed the hot tub and the views. We filmed sunsets and gazed at the city, especially at night! We are already talking about coming back to Tucson and we want to stay here again.
If you stay here, you will love it! Thank You!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Would absolutely stay here again! House was 10 times better than the pictures show! It is such a big comfortable home! So much larger than it looks in the pictures!

2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"We enjoyed our stay at this beautiful home. The views are stunning! Only a short 10 minute drive from downtown Tucson. The master bedroom is stunning.

We also made dinner one night and the kitchen had absolutely everything we needed and more. Would definitely stay here again in the future!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"This property was beautiful and pictures don‚Äôt do it justice. We only stayed one night but all of use want to go back and stay for a week. The views were beautiful.

The house itself is tastefully decorated and the lighting is dimmable. Great house for entertaining. Great for 3 couples.
The master bedroom is Awesome and the jacuzzi hotub a true highlight. Incredible views!
Hosts very responsive and easy to deal with. Would definitely stay here again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I will come back to this house ‚ù§Ô∏è
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Excellent house and our 2nd time staying here. It is by far our favorite place to rent in Tucson and we rent a LOT of houses everywhere we travel!! Very clean, has everything we need, spacious, beautifully decorated, gorgeous view, a relaxing jacuzzi, love how we can park our vehicle in the garage, a nice trail to walk right by the house, peaceful and quiet area which is very safe....I could go on and on! LOVE this place and will definitely rent again as our son plays baseball nearby all year round. I wish we could put more than 5 stars because it is that good! THANK YOU!"
2023-10-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"The Hot Tub did NOT work.
The main reason we booked this property was to enjoy a Hot Tub soak.
I even confirmed 2 days prior to our arrival that the Hot Tub was functioning. The host indicated the Hot Tub was good to go. But no, no it was not good to go.
The other cool amenity we were looking forward to using was the pool table. But most of the pool sticks need new tips and one is warped.
In the Primary bathroom, the rain fall shower trickles. It never obtained full water pressure. Water was coming out of only about 1/3 of the shower head.
Also in the Primary bathroom, the tub shower wand doesn‚Äôt work.
In the Bedroom that shares a wall with the kitchen, the TV was not working. It powers on, but has to be set up.
In the Bedroom with another rain fall shower head, also trickles. It never had full water pressure.
Check in was not smooth.
Host text message indicated access via keypad at Front door.
It is not."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful view
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"We spent a family weekend at this place. It is a very nice, spacious home with high-end finishes. The neighborhood is peaceful and the views of Tucson and the mountains are superb. You have the feeling of being out of the fray of everything, but are just 10 minutes from the middle of downtown Tucson. We spent most of our time enjoying the deck and outdoor spaces. There were minor issues with the workings of a couple of items, but they were addressed quickly and it didn't impact our enjoyment. We would definitely stay again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is a beautiful property! I would recommend this property to anyone looking to book it. Host is very friendly, is quick to respond and is very proactive when an issue arises. You will not be disappointed"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were there for 2 nights but we could have spent the week there, amazing, balcony with quality spa, large living room where you feel good, all the rooms are beautiful, you will lack nothing."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location with a beautiful view!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We absolutely LOVED the house and location! Beautiful view, house was beautifully decorated and super clean! It had everything we needed. Only complaint was that the hot tub wasn't working the whole trip and we reached out to host. We never got to use it because it wasn't fixed during our 4 night stay. We loved this place so much that we reached out to the host to ask about future dates because we will be coming a lot for my sons baseball games. We got a response that it was available. Then when we went to book it a few hours later the stipulations changed on the website to having to book a minimum of 5 nights instead of just being able to do a long weekend (3 nights). We would definitely rent it again many times and would recommend it to others but wishing it could be rented for 3-4 nights not 5 or more as we can't always stay an extended amount of time due to other kids and their schedules. Thank you!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place Kit was a fantastic host.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Amazing location, and stunning interior. Bathrooms and closets were so spacious and very clean. Beds were huge and also very comfortable. We didn‚Äôt spend a ton of time lounging while we were there, but that‚Äôs one thing that you might consider before booking. If you want a cozy place to cuddle up and watch a movie, the seating in the main living room wasn‚Äôt ideal for that. The hot tub unfortunately was not very clean nor was it on either, but maybe that‚Äôs normal for summer? We booked this for end of June so we got a good deal and overall it was absolutely worth it."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I loved the amazing views of the place! I loved the spaciousness. Was a great getaway!

2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place was amazing!! It was hard to leave!
The set up was great with everything on the same level. The bedroom set up was perfect for us with 4 separate sleeping quarters.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at La Paloma House is probably our favorite house rental so far! The house and property are exactly as shown and represented, and we had a gorgeous view of the Catalina Mountains. The house is comfortable, beautifully designed, and the owners have taken into consideration many conveniences, making it feel like a home away from home. We had excellent communication and response from the manager/owner. In addition, the neighborhood was in a good location for us and the neighbors were friendly as we passed them on our walks. Staying here made our first visit to Tucson a memorable one and we hope to be back."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We booked this Airbnb for Christmas, and it exceeded all our expectations!
The spacious living area provided ample room for our family to gather, play games, and exchange gifts.
The well-equipped kitchen made preparing our Christmas feast a breeze, and the dining area was large enough for our entire family to enjoy a meal together.
The bedrooms were equally impressive, with comfortable beds and spacious closets that made it easy for us all to keep our belongings organized during our stay.
Communication with the host was seamless, and they were quick to respond to any inquiries or requests.
Highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone seeking a delightful and cozy accommodation experience."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I‚Äôve stayed in a number of ABNB‚Äôs and this is my favorite. The pics don‚Äôt do it justice and all of my OCD needs were more than satisfied. It‚Äôs my new Tucson spot. Also, Magic went above and beyond to be an awesome host."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My family and I stayed at La Paloma while visiting family in Tucson and it was the best AirBnB property we‚Äôve visited! The house was exceptionally clean, very well-stocked, comfortable, and very stylish! The pool and the view of the Catalinas were amazing. Just a few minutes drive to La Encantada, Trader Joe‚Äôs, and other restaurants and shopping. Pet-friendly and easy to keep clean while we stayed there.
The house is VERY spacious and the five of us were able to spread out! The beds and linens are great, and there is a great desk in the primary bedroom for those of us who need to do a little work while on vacation.
Magic and team were great communicators. Every note was well-timed, friendly, and professional, from a the time I made the reservation through after check-out.
We love this house and hope to stay again in the future! Five stars for this Super Host team & property."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I enjoyed the place very much. I've stayed in a number of Magic's properties and they are always fantastic places to enjoy. In this case, he was able to get us in early, and then extended our stay for a day on short notice.
The pool was great, the yard very private and secure and the house is well appointed with everything you need to have a great stay.
Its what I've come to expect when I stay in one of his properties and I'm never disappointed.
Thanks, Magic!
Greg"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful and fun space. We enjoyed the beautiful pool with a view! We‚Äôd most definitely look here first the next time we visit Tucson.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,The house was beautiful and clean. The pool and backyard fit all of our needs. Magic was very responsive and checked on us periodically. We had a family of five and the house was very accommodating. We spent a few nights either playing pool or playing board games outside while we were swimming. It was truly a great experience. I would definitely go back.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We walked into this home and was beyond pleased with everything. So comfortable, had what we needed to stay here for a month. Played pool, got in the pool üòäOur critters were comfortable here as well-they settled in right in as we did.
Whenever we reached out to Magic , there was a super quick response and questions were addressed promptly.
On top of that , is was so pretty to see that incredible mountain ‚Ä¶ loved it . Would do this again.
Thank you so much for making our stay here like Home away from Home. üòÅ"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Magic is one of the best AirBnB hosts I‚Äôve had the pleasure of booking with. I will be checking availability of BookTucson properties first for any future Tucson trips. The house was immaculately clean, and thoughtfully well appointed. We were visiting family in Tucson and it was the perfect central gathering place. The open concept kitchen/living room and the beautiful outdoor space provided ample room for everybody to enjoy each others company. And, the mountain views and sunsets cannot be beat!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"House was wonderful, exactly as described. Magic went above and beyond, he‚Äôs a terrific host. Would recommend his property without hesitation to anyone. If I came back to Tucson would use again for sure if available."

Lots of restaurants, but we mainly cooked at home. Kitchen has everything. Pool was great. Beds were comfy. Tankless hot water system, so never ending hot water. Couldn‚Äôt have been better!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place and very well equipped.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! What a great little stay!
We did not rent a car for this trip and used Uber. We walked to AJs and the fancy mall and Starbucks almost every morning.
It was so private and peaceful. And even though it was late may, almost June, the place was not hot at all. Lovely art, decorations, and plants. We saw tons of desert wildlife on our walks. We‚Äôd easily stay here again.
Even though I am a Tucson native (living in Washington state now) we felt as if this was a true vacation. Highly recommend.
Thanks!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spot for a weekend getaway

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful and unique place! Anne's husband greeted us, let us in, and was very gracious. The bed was comfortable, the shower was really nice, all the comforts of home. We went to Saguaro National Park and Mt Lemmon and both was very close. Can't think of enough good things to say other than the rate was very reasonable. Anne also allowed me to cancel and reschedule once with no penalty. What an awesome host!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice furniture and the place felt very clean.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A spacious, comfortable, and beautifully decorated guest suite. The patio had beautiful views of the mountains and a peaceful fountain.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful stay. Very peaceful and beautiful.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Anne‚Äôs place was beautiful! Absolutely stunning location and landscaping. The neighborhood is beautiful and overall the stay was amazing. I do think you pay for the beauty of the space, as there aren‚Äôt as many amenities as some other places in Tucson for a similar price, but the beauty really can‚Äôt be beat for the price. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is such a lovely place. We saw some beautiful birds in the morning , so much of the cactus were blooming. We ate at a delicious vegetarian Mexican called Tumerico. Yum! Will come back for sure"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at Anne's place. Very comfortable and clean with amazing views of the mountains. Perfect location to explore the Catalina mountains and not far from downtown.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful Hacienda with beautiful desert plants. The suite is very spacious. Great location. Very comfortable and relaxing.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have had a very relaxing and enjoyable stay and Anne and Eddie were most responsive and clear in all their communications.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a short stay in Tucson. This was a good fit for what we needed. We would stay here again for a similar trip.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We have stayed at Anne‚Äôs place a few times over the past few years. The room is gorgeous and always spotless. Very close to great shopping and restaurants yet extremely peaceful.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Peaceful spot in close range to shopping and hiking, just what we wanted."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Anne‚Äôs place was absolutely beautiful. The guest house is nestled away in a private cul-de-sac and absolutely gorgeous surroundings. The place was super clean and had everything as described. The photos don‚Äôt do it justice. Looks way more amazing in person and much bigger as well. It‚Äôs close to everything you need but still private enough that you feel like you‚Äôre away from the city. Anne was very communicative about everything I needed to know and would definitely recommend staying here if you‚Äôre in Tucson.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Anne‚Äôs Azul suite. Everything was efficient and easy, exactly what you‚Äôd hope for on vacation. We had a couple questions come up, and Anne responded almost immediately.
The location was great for all things in the north part of the city, including hiking and scenic drives.
It‚Äôs important to know that the suite is the single door on the right in the pictures, not the double doors that are centered in the exterior photo. Not a big deal, and certainly didn‚Äôt affect our enjoyment of the place.
Highly recommended."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location with a nice area to sit outside and enjoy the mountain view.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Walking into the courtyard at the front entrance reveals a peaceful setting with table, chairs, and warm string lighting. Bedding and furniture were very comfortable. Provided a wonderful setting for our Tuscon experience!"

Even though it rained when we were there, is was so beautiful and didn‚Äôt affect our stay at all. Anne was very responsive and recommended some restaurants nearby. We ate steak and lobster at Flemings which was amazing. The stay was very private and had a lovely courtyard. Would definitely stay again and recommend to friends. 10/10 and I need to know where the bedding is from as it was soooo comfyy!!"
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The courtyard was a huge plus
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The courtyard was lovely! It was so nice to sip coffee at dawn, watching the hummingbirds in the fountain."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I loved my stay and would love to stay here every time I'm in Tucson. Quiet, foothills, wonderful views, wonderful place."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very nice place with a cool Hacienda vibe. We would definitely stay again.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super cute little place, off the beaten path, yet close to amenities. Connected to main house, yet felt private. Only thing I would forewarn is climate control options. None of the unit windows open (not broken, just not meant to open) and there is no separate thermostat for the unit, so if you want it up/down, you would have to coordinate with host (who I'm sure would be very helpful, just prefer to manage directly). There is a ceiling fan in the center of the unit (though it did make a fair amount of motion noises; probably just a simple rebalance needed). We happened to be there at a time that it was not particularly hot, so none of this was a huge deal, but we would have liked to have slept with windows open or had it slightly cooler without having to intrude on host. Otherwise, great place, great location, everything was easy/smooth; would stay again and recommend."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Simply one of the best Airbnb experiences we‚Äôve had!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay at Anne‚Äôs place. The location was absolutely beautiful as well as prime for our stay in Tucson to access the city and surrounding areas. The space was exactly as described and very comfortable!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at Anne‚Äôs place for 5 nights while I was at a conference down the street. It was clean, the aesthetic was cool, the bed was comfortable, and it had everything I needed. I liked being able to open the main door and still have the screen door in place to be able to hear the fountain in the courtyard.
The suite is connected to both another guest suite and the owner‚Äôs home, so it is not silent. There are also dogs on site that bark sometimes. That is not something that bothers me, but may be something to keep in mind.
Overall, I would (and might!) stay here again!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow! What a lovely place to spend the night! The courtyard with fountain and view of the Catalinas make it super special as do the furnishings inside the spacious one-room suite (if one room can be a suite) with attached very large bathroom. It‚Äôs a welcoming, interesting, and comfortable space. Anne was always prompt with communication and offered helpful suggestions for things to do in Tucson and clear directions where needed. I would love to stay there again!"

It met our needs and we had a pleasant time there."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Anne was an amazing host and we appreciated the local recommendations that were left for us to check out as this was our first time visiting Arizona.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at Anne‚Äôs airbnb. We really liked how comfortable the bed was and that the airbnb was quiet. The place has a lovely feel. We would stay there again!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was a really beautiful house with scenic surroundings. We could see the mountains from the courtyard. We highly recommend it to sit outside before the sunset when the weather is still nice. Very peaceful and beautiful. The guest suite is pretty spacious with all the necessities. Overall, it‚Äôs nine of ten. The only thing could even make the stay exceptionally great was that we wish there were a king size bed, so my husband and I could sleep more comfortably.
Thank you for your hosting, Anne!!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Anne is a fantastic host. We were in town for a wedding and check in to her home was a breeze! Cozy room with lots of space. Very quiet and cool property. If were ever in the area again, we would love to stay with Anne in the future!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I stayed at Anne‚Äôs Azul Guest Suite between Christmas and New Years and we were very satisfied with our stay.
Anne was proactive with communication and responded quickly when I reached out. We had all the info needed well before we arrived in aTucson.
The Azul Guest Suite is exactly as depicted, if not better! The courtyard out front is amazing with incredible views of the mountains. Inside was just as great, tastefully decorated and very clean. We felt right at home immediately. The location is also superb. Located in the Catalina foothills, everything one might need is close by, a very quick drive to go hiking, see the sunset at Gates Pass, or heading out for a bite to eat!
Lastly, Anne provided great information on local restaurants and places to visit. Check-out was also super easy and quick. I would highly recommend the Azul Guest Suite for any couple looking for a romantic, peaceful, and adventurous getaway. 10 out of 10."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location close to shopping and restaurant
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and easy walk to shopping and restaurants. Anne is very responsive and accommodating. Beautiful home and patio.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great stay here! We were only in town for one night but wish we could have stayed longer. The place is beautiful and spacious. Highly recommend! Anne was helpful and provided us with everything we needed.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"What a stunning location! We loved staying in this quiet neighborhood, surrounded by beautiful desert and mountain views. The courtyard was a lovely addition to our room, which made the visit feel really special. It was very relaxing to listen to the birds and the fountain and feel like we were taking full advantage of the beautiful setting. This location is perfect, since you can enjoy the peaceful desert while also being very close to many delicious restaurants. Anne gave us lots of suggestions for places to visit, both near the house and around the city, and it was super easy to pick up groceries from AJs, right down the street. We needed extra TP and towels during our stay and Anne was able to provide those quickly. It's worth noting that the room is connected to the main house and we were able to hear the dogs barking quite frequently. They always quieted down before 9pm though. Overall, a wonderful place to stay and we will definitely consider returning when we next visit Tuscon!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely, well-appointed home base for exploring Tucson‚Äôs parks. Bed was a bit on the soft side so might not be the best for sensitive sleepers traveling with someone else. We ate once on the patio/yard under an almost full moon and that was a standout memory as it was so private and quiet."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is probably one of the best spaces/homes I've stayed in so far. Anne's home is absolutely gorgeous, both inside and out. The space was super clean, the bed was cozy and comfortable and Anne was very responsive. I'm sad my stay was so short, but I'm definitely marking this spot as a place to re-book whenever I am in the area!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We made a mistake of coming one night earlier than our reservation.. Anne was amazing! Not only did she prepare a new place for us to stay right away but she also made us feel very welcome! She even prepared a fire so that we could make s‚Äômores watching the stars! She was very nice and welcoming! The place is so beautiful! It is also very clean, and has a lot of amenities!
Highly recommend it!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Anne‚Äôs suite is a beautiful space in a beautiful setting. We would definitely stay there again when passing through.

2023-11-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Anne was responsive as a host. Location is absolutely breathtaking. Check in and the room was as pictured. We were overall disappointed with this property. As Anne lives on site, we were disrupted by her dogs barking late into the night and again early the next morning. The private courtyard is immediately outside windows of another guest suite.
We decided to checkout early."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing place!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I felt as though I was in a Tuscan fairy desert oasis...I am a chef and I was hospitalized for my feet being twice the size I had one nite at Anne heartfelt castle and felt so much better when I drove away thanks so much!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is the place to stay! My husband and I had never been to Tucson. We were running late cause we live 3 hours away and that was no problem. She left us the key and we were good to go! The property is beautiful and as soon as you step out the front door it‚Äôs a gorgeous view. The place was clean and it was quiet. Easy access with parking and I‚Äôll tell you this was by far the smoothest part of the trip which is so helpful when you are traveling. Thanks Anne!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really beautifully appointed, gorgeous surroundings, extremely comfortable (high end bedding and pillows‚ù§Ô∏è) and perfect for 2 of us visiting family in the area."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a great spot! Quiet. Secluded. Great mountain views. Close to the foothills for everything you need!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice place to stay! Beautiful surroundings. Clean. Easy to find and check in. Host was clear with instructions. We would stay again!
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Anne provided informative instructions so we found and accessed the place easily.
Really cute place, hidden away, with a wonderful courtyard patio, right outside the door. We loved sitting on the chairs, listening to the water feature and watching the birds under the beautiful Arizona sky.
I reached out to Anne and she responded (and sorted) super quick."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful place! This a lovely studio that is in a neighborhood but feels like a private villa, enclosed by stands of beautiful desert flora. The star is the patio area which is gorgeous, all stone and brick with a babbling fountain in the middle. While we drank our coffee we were visited by hummingbirds (bathing in the fountain!), quail, cactus wrens, and desert cardinals (pyrrhuloxia). I had never seen desert cardinals before so that was special. The view from the patio is mountains and cacti, truly beautiful. The location is very quiet and you‚Äôd never know that a main road is nearby with quick driving access to restaurants. Inside is pretty and the bed was super comfortable. We had a third adult who used the blow up mattress and it is a super thick Sealy, very comfortable. The indoor temp was comfortable even though it was 100F outside. Five stars and we'll definitely look Anne up next time we're in Tucson."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful stay at Anne's home. Anne is a wonderful host. She responded quickly to my requests and she kindly accommodated me with a change to my check-in time. The room and courtyard are beautiful! I felt transported to an elegant hacienda. The room is large and spacious with plenty of light. It was clean and comfortable. The internet is fast. I used it for teleconferencing and I had no issues. The tv has plenty of options from live tv to your favorite streaming platform. One of my favorite parts of my trip was enjoying the sunrises and sunsets from the courtyard. The view of the mountain is breathtaking and the fountain in the courtyard attracts hummingbirds and a variety of other types of birds. The home is close to shopping areas, restaurants, and hiking. I will definitely try to stay here again when I am in the Tucson area in the future."
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Azul was a 6 night landing spot for us while visiting family. The unit was very clean and had a pretty Mountain View and a lovely courtyard. The bed was comfortable, internet fast, tv options good. The house is set back off the road, so it‚Äôs quiet and we enjoyed walking in the nearby neighborhoods. There are many good restaurants nearby. Parking is convenient, right outside the entrance.
It was an inconvenience to have only one set of towels each for a six night stay. I kept checking all of the cabinets to make sure I wasn‚Äôt missing something. When I asked for an extra set along with some additional coffee pods, the host was there within an hour of seeing the message. I just would have preferred that they would have been supplied without having to ask. So, perhaps stock more items for a longer stay.
Thanks for sharing your place, it worked well for us."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay at Anne‚Äôs place. Photos were as described. Anne was very responsive. We were just sorry we weren‚Äôt able to spend some time in the private outdoor area.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful hacienda with stunning mountain and desert views! Pictures don‚Äôt do it justice! The adjacent courtyard with fountain brought an immediate feeling of rest and relaxation! The bathroom was so spacious and the living/sleeping area was stunning with the wood beams and Spanish style furniture and decor. The most incredibly comfortable mattress and pillows! Fridge, microwave and Keurig maker were convenient. Owner was responsive and helpful with a few questions upon check in. A very short drive to U of A. Will absolutely be booking a return visit as soon as possible!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Anne‚Äôs place is truly amazing! My mother stayed here, and her only complaint was that she couldn‚Äôt live here. She spent literal hours in the courtyard watching birds, it was exactly the relaxing place she needed."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Anne‚Äôs place was great! Nice location very close to good restaurants and shopping. As described, comfortable and clean. Responsive host that answered all questions. Would recommend!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I needed a place to stay in Tucson very last minute and I was fortunate to get to spend a night at Anne's place! Tranquil and well-appointed with a great view of the Catalinas and a lovely courtyard. A total gem and would happily stay again.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great stay at the Azul room! It was spacious and the views of the mountains were spectacular! Thanks for a great stay!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful location, great host, 10/10"
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The hosts were gracious & kind enough to allow us to have our small, intimate wedding in the courtyard. They said we'd have to rent the Rojo Suite also, which is understandable considering how close the two suites are to each other. They're separated by a single non-sound proofed door between them . The room & courtyard itself are beautiful & in a great location close to amenities. The downside was that the courtyard was not as private as advertised or that we had hoped. The 3 large arched windows & door belong to the main house where the host lives. The description was unclear that that was part of the main house, which hosts also frequented for travel. Overall the place was clean and tidy, only qualms; the excessive layer of dust on ceiling fan and leftover hair in shower."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great host
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The breathtaking view right from the door was worth it alone! The entire place was homey and warm. I would 10000% book this again!

2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,i enjoyed my stay
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Definitely worth it! the catalina Foothills are truly spectacular
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"I was thrilled when I got to Anne's place. It was lovely. Beautiful grounds, view and room. I absolutely loved being able to sit in the courtyard in the evening - I was lucky enough to get there after a storm enabling me to do that. It was a treat! So was a bath in the big tub. My only issue was lack of climate control, I was hot overnight (I sleep best cool). There's a fan, but I did need an AC or swamp cooler. I would come back, but maybe in a cooler season due to the AC thing. I recommend for all the other reasons though!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,beautiful space!!!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Traveling in our 20‚Äôs is sometimes nerve racking because it‚Äôs a new thing to us. Coming to this home made traveling here so memorable. Because of this lovely home and these lovely hosts we will be revisiting. Anne and her husband helped us with everything we needed with no complaints and were so generous in helping us find good restaurants and getting us the best experience possible. Because of them we will always remember this great experience and look forward to traveling other places. We ate at RA Sushi and Blanco, we also visited 4th Avenue to shop some vintage items. Starbucks and a beautiful mall is in walking distance and the scenery is amazing. Anne also helped us find a nice short hiking spot. Can‚Äôt say anything bad about this great host!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at this Airbnb was nothing short of amazing! From the moment we stepped in, we were welcomed by a warm and cozy atmosphere that made us feel right at home. The hosts were incredibly friendly and accommodating, ensuring that we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay.
The location was also a major highlight. Nestled in a peaceful neighborhood, it provided the perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of the city."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Casita Tolsa is a true gem! The studio guest suite offers a private entrance, parking, and a delightful patio. The traditional territorial style, wood beam ceilings, and comfy foam mattress create a cozy ambiance. The location is perfect, close to La Encantada Mall and scenic hiking spots with breathtaking mountain views. The 55"" HDTV with HBO, Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon provides entertainment options galore. Plus, the access to a private patio and the surrounding area is a treat for nature lovers. The host's commitment to enhanced cleaning protocols ensures a safe and enjoyable stay.

Overall our experience was amazing and we would stay again!

We enjoyed coffee in the mornings and wine in the evenings in the courtyard. The bubbling fountain attracted birds for bathing and drinking, including hummingbirds, and a variety of finches. The hosts were friendly and available. I would recommend this for all who love nature, birds, and desert beauty. A peaceful sanctuary.

While the casita was not available for an extension, she provided me with a very good alternative establishment. It was a good price and very comfortable and quiet. Great host and property. Conveniently located to a large number and variety of restaurants. Within 5 miles of the Lowes resort which is where my conference was located.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Quiet neighborhood and Casita. Hosts very considerate and nice. Casita stocked with all you need; not fancy, but very nice. Didn't avail ourselves of the pool, but it would be very tempting on a warm day.
Close to Catalina State Park hiking. Very nice County parks within a half dozen miles. Great biking and walking path along dry riverside - access also a little drive away. Bit far from Tucson city center, but that was to our liking. Lots of eateries along the main road into Tucson to choose from if cooking meals at the Casita isn't what is wanted. Dog park fairly close and doggie day care about 12 miles away so can plan excursions for the day without worry."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Really enjoyed my week at John's place, I was in town for work and the location was a perfect match.

The yard had beautiful mountain views and saguaros with lots of bird activity. The neighborhood was beautiful and peaceful for walking in the early morning. The only thing unexpected was that the yard was listed as ‚Äúprivate‚Äù, which to me means you won‚Äôt see anyone else during your stay. This wasn‚Äôt the case, and is not really a big deal, except for the ‚Äúprivate‚Äù description."

Complete privacy and we never did see, or hear, their dogs although I was looking forward to meeting them. Very pleasant people to have as hosts, we couldn‚Äôt have been happier. We didn‚Äôt want for anything during our visit. Very well stocked bathroom and a clean, nice kitchen with the basics for cooking if you wanted to. Great restaurants and shopping nearby too.

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,What a great stay! Such great amenities and very clean. Hosts were awesome and I could tell they thought of their guest‚Äôs comfort at every step.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just like the first time I stayed, at Erin's home, this time was also quiet, private, and beautiful! The various cacti were in-bloom, which was a nice surprise. Sunrises were especially nice."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely & ‚Äúchill‚Äù home in the Catalina Foothills. Great southwestern vibe and decor. Really nice bathrooms too. The star of the show is the backyard pool area with the gorgeous desert and mountain view‚Äî !
You‚Äôll love relaxing here for sure. Can‚Äôt wait to return next time we are in the Tucson area. üëçüëçüëç"
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Let me be clear. For the price this is not a good deal. I urge you to consider staying somewhere else. Full disclosure: booked this air bnb for 3 days for a Mother‚Äôs Day get away Sun-Wed. The pool and views of the desert were my must haves, I paid extra for a heated pool & ensured to tell them what the trip was for and why I was excited. Upon arriving the pool was disgusting. Untouched, no vacuum running, not skimmed. Like I said- disgusting. Naturally I let Erin know & this when it became apparent Erin isn‚Äôt involved at all. My entire stay a Co Host replied the whole time and Erin merely had automated messages come to me at certain hours, at one point I was discussing my concerns around the pool and how the pump was broken & releasing the vacuum and I get a message from Erin to take out the trash for her as a favor‚Ä¶
I was irate. The property had a broken back gate so I felt unsafe as well (I have a new born) I could say more but out of characters so Dm me at 2BEE.RICKY for everything"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I sought a peaceful retreat in a beautiful setting near Tucson, one where I could easily toggle between working remotely and outdoor activity, and also one where, while I was engaged in said work, I could gaze at a lustrous view. Check, check, check. Plusses: the views out the sunroom and bathroom windows, the proximity to numerous day hike spots, proximity to the amenities of north Tucson, the MCM-desert blend of decor, the garage! The major hiccup: the pool. I chose this spot so I could swim every day, but while I was there, the pool was packed with hundreds of dead bugs that accrued faster than I could scoop them out--even hours after it was professionally cleaned. It was peak bloom season and the garden was indeed a'bloom, an explanation, and the responsive hosts were sympathetic. Had I known, though, I might not have chosen this spot for this time (or requested a rate reduction for not being able to use the pool without cringing)."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Pool was wonderful, loved the privacy of the house itself"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The backyard provides you the natural desert flora with its birds singing‚Ä¶with the sight of the mountains in the background.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is very close to the Catalina Mountains which are gorgeous. We didn‚Äôt try the hot tub as we elected to spend time in the pool. It is very private and serene yet close to anything you might want to visit. Erin and Frederico are responsive within minutes. The beds are super comfortable. I highly recommend this spot for comfort, convenience and relaxation."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay! The place was clean, comfortable, and spacious, and the backyard was absolutely stunning. Note: the pool maintenance system is quite loud, and it can't be turned off, even if you aren't using the pool during your stay. If you're there for the pool, it may not bother you, but it definitely has a presence if you're just sitting outside and chatting."

The kitchen was fully stocked with plenty of cookware, utensils, mugs, etc and there were coffee beans waiting for us, which was a nice touch.

The house is not super luxurious and we weren't expecting it to be. Quiet neighborhood, comfy beds and cool backyard.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is absolutely the best place for a private desert escape. We even went during a colder time of the year but the pool and hot tub were still very warm and cozy and useable! The house looked even more beautiful than the photos and the view out of the front porch is almost as gorgeous as the serene mountain scape in the back. I could go on and on about how much this place made our honeymoon dreams come true for my wife & I. It was clean, peaceful, and full of amazing vibes. We tried several of the dining & hiking recommendations as well and they made the trip even more amazing. Extra love and thanks to a friendly, responsive, and knowledgeable host. Thanks again y‚Äôall!"

It was delicious. We hiked Finger Rock trail which was a stones throw away from the house. We played records that were provided and even brought some from home and had a impromptu dance party. The house was nice and cozy and tastefully decorated. The back yard was the place to be for morning sunrises with coffee in hand and evening sunsets. We used the fire pit that was provided and enjoyed the pool and jacuzzi. The neighborhood was nice and quiet! We took a few walks around and saw rabbits and cardinals. This home made some great memories for myself, husband and 2 daughters. Communicating with Erin was super easy and she was so responsive to all our needs. I would definitely book and stay at this home again."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place. Great Host. The heated pool is noisy.
This is a wonderful place just as described. Erin is easy to communicate with and I felt well taken care of. The backyard and the location was the main reason I chose this place and it lived up to my expectations except for one thing: the motor of the pool heating system is loud and it is on 24/7. This will not bother everyone but I am used to silence and I was expecting a silent desert experience (which it would have been if I had asked to have it turned off....but the friend I was sharing the house with loves to swim)."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Desert vibrations was the perfect oasis for a small family holiday. Perfect for adults and kids. Well-stocked kitchen for all your needs.

It feels like your own private retreat in the heart of the Catalina Foothills. It feels isolated, but it‚Äôs still close to restaurants, hiking trails, and the broader Tucson area. We stayed here for a wedding and it was wonderful to come back at the end of a great party to relax at the pool and enjoy the natural beauty. The house was clean, well-stocked, and cozy. Erin was a great host, very communicative, and kind. We would love to stay here again!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Group trip,What a wonderful house for women‚Äôs getaway! There were seven of us and we fit perfectly in the house! Stunning backyard! A great hiking trail very close to the house! Thanks for a great stay!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at the Desert Vibrations home! It‚Äôs in a cute, quiet neighborhood close to town, and it has the best views from the backyard. Erin was super communicative before and during our stay, she really went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. Would love to stay again!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a lovely, relaxing stay here in January for a couple days! Could spend hours in front of the large stunning window that overlooks the Catalina foothills. The hot tub was clean, beds comfortable, and neighborhood quiet + beautiful to walk in. Would recommend to friends and definitely come back!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location! Very private and peaceful. Nice stay. We didn‚Äôt do any cooking other than simple breakfast, but we found everything we needed for that purpose. The beds were comfortable. This is not a luxurious house, but very adequate for a comfortable stay especially with kids. Would not hesitate to stay in the future. Thank you, Erin!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Erin is a prompt communicator. The location has a beautiful view of the mountains. We enjoyed hanging out back in the pool, hot tub, and by the fire."

It had all the amenities we needed and the backyard is incredible. The location was perfect. Very close to trails, restaurants, coffee etc. We had an amazing weekend and would definitely stay here again."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is exactly as advertised. It is in a neighborhood but the yard is very private and secluded. The pool, hot tub, and whole backyard were like a private desert oasis with old saguaro cacti and some other great landscaping around the yard, and we even saw a family of javelinas trotting along the back fence.
Location is a little ways out of town, but near a ton of great shops and restaurants, plus the secluded location was a big plus, it was very quiet! We were here for some warm weather and relaxation during the winter, and this was a great home base for that!
The provided recommendations for restaurants and coffee places were also appreciated!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Truly a gem and a great place to stay! Erin was incredibly accommodating to us and I would highly recommend this stay to other guests!

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Erin‚Äôs place was great for a relaxing vacation in Tucson. Hard to beat reading by the pool drinking a margarita (kitchen has a blender) under a Saguaro cactus in the warm Arizona sun. The house is located in a quiet neighborhood in the foothills and is a ~15min drive to most restaurants. Finger rock trail head is walkable from the house. Heads up, the backyard grill is charcoal, not gas."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful place! Very reasonable and the Host is very responsive and excellent. Love the honorary bar and the pool and hot tub were awesome! A must stay!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were looking for a couple days of sunshine and rest on our way from Texas to Washington State. We found it at Desert Vibrations. The quiet and very private property was wonderful - the pool, hot tub and seating areas in the back yard made for very private lounging and swimming. The home was simply and delightfully decorated and felt cozy and homey the minute we walked in. Communication before, during and after was thorough and accurate. Questions we had were answered very quickly. While Erin left great suggestions for nearby short and long hikes, we elected to stay put in this great escape!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a magical place!!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a much need get away for my husband and I. We have a very busy life at home with multiple business and we just wanted some R&R!
From the moment we pulled up to the Desert Oasis we new we were at the perfect spot. The entry way is tucked in a circle drive with beautiful desert trees and cactus. The house itself is very friendly and comfortable. The back yard is fantastic and the views and sun rises are spectacular. We enjoyed the hot tub in the chilly morning air and the pool in the afternoon heat.
Erin and her crew are very responsive to any questions you may have or things you might need and have created the perfect desert get away.
We are so thankful we found the Desert Oasis!! We will be back for sure!!! üåµü•Çüòé"

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This house is amazingly clean with 2 bed and 2 bath! The backyard is something amazing and so quiet even with neighbors nearby. Behind the backyard fence we saw road runners, javelina (which were so cute!!), lizards and a giant snake skin! The drive to downtown Tucsan is so easy and so close. If you don't feel like driving there they have many places nearby to visit and eat at! Our stay was wonderful and we will definitely be staying there again in the future!"

2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a wonderful time! We had a group of 7 and we all slept comfortably. The pool and back yard area were a DREAM- nothing beats the views of the cacti and mountains, especially under the night sky. Good location too- not too far from downtown/airport/national park. You feel secluded even though you‚Äôre in a neighborhood. The hosts were also great at communicating and making sure we had everything we needed. I can‚Äôt wait to come back. Highly highly recommend!!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Such a fun and relaxing stay!
2021-06-01,4.0,Group trip,"Erin's home is perfectly located in the mountains where you are getting the desert experience but are 5 min away from convenient stores, gas station etc. Her & her team have great communication!
I spent my 30th here and feel really grateful to have found such a gem to spend such an important day.
I'd recommend this place to someone thats looking for that vintage, art deco feel with lovely views!
Thank you."
2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Gorgeous, clean, comfortable home with stunning views. Perfect set up for a girls weekend. Erin and her team were very quick to communicate.

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was absolutely incredible, especially if you want to spend time out on the pool deck or in one of the many lounging spots outside. When you're not lounging or playing outside, you'll love the comfy indoors and spacious area. It really is close to so much stuff as well! Overall, an incredible Airbnb find."
2021-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and scenic views
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was a wonderful experience. We really enjoyed our stay at Erin s place. They were great host and had everything they promised. We definitely want to stay again this summer.
2021-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"What a Tucson gem! Erin's home combine equal parts chill with all the desert vibes. There was plenty of room to relax inside and outdoors. We loved having dinner on the patio under the lights and relaxing by the beautiful pool during the day. The mountain views are amazing. The location is just right- tucked in beneath the mountains, but within minutes of several food venues. Our group all had comfortable beds to sleep in & the house was very clean. Highly recommend this unique stay!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Erin's place is simply one of the most beautiful, comfortable, and peaceful Airbnb's we've ever stayed in. The views and landscape are beyond gorgeous, the home is comfortable, clean, and well-appointed, and communication was kind and timely. We very highly recommend Erin's place to anyone looking for a peaceful retreat on the edge of Tucson but with access to both the city and to all of the incredible hiking and nature that Tucson offers. Thank you so much, Erin!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Loved this home!!! We had a family of javelina that came by the back fence a few times to visit with their babies.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent location. Well decorated comfortable home. A must stay to see the Tucson Catalina mountains.
2021-04-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were very excited to stay at Erin's place. When we arrived all of the dishes were dirty inside of the dishwasher, the hall bathroom window was open to try and air it out, and there were bugs in the light fixtures. The hall bathroom had a smell most of our trip. I also opted to pay the $90 for the heated pool, which did not end up being heated. Whenever we brought these issues to Erin, she never responded herself. It was always someone else. The pillows in the master bedroom are awful and I barely slept most of our trip. The garden and the view were the only redeeming qualities of this space."
2021-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Desert Vibrations was one of the best Airbnb‚Äôs I have ever stayed at hands down. The whole property felt like a resort and it was the perfect spot for a weekend getaway with friends!
2021-04-01,5.0,Group trip,This home was amazing! Very cute with sweet touches! They provide everything you could need. Our favorite part was the outdoor area with the pool and the most amazing views. Pictures do not do it justice!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a blast swimming and relaxing. Loved the motif and was stocked with everything we needed. Saw a cute squadron of javelinas too!
2021-04-01,5.0,Group trip,The experience of this house was magnificent. The backyard it‚Äôs worth 1 million bucks! It‚Äôs Arizona and it‚Äôs prettiest.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Fantastic private backyard space for relaxing and swimming. The house was a great starting point for outdoor adventures throughout the Tucson area. Excellent communication with the owners before and during the stay.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We very much enjoyed our stay, we never left the entire weekend! The house had everything we needed, the pool, mountain view and hot tub made for a very relaxing time. Thank you for sharing your home."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Probably the cleanest Airbnb our family has ever stayed in! The house‚Äôs location is ideal for hiking, shopping, and eating while being situated quietly away from downtown Tucson. We had plenty of space between all of the beds, make sure to read host‚Äôs instructions carefully as we didn‚Äôt even realize the trundle beds were there until later in our stay (our fault). The backyard was amazing between the pool, definitely reccommend heating (was 70-85 outside during our stay), hottub, and views. The coolest part of our stay was probably being able to safely observe wildlife right from the backyard (javelinas, coyotes, quail, rabbits). Would 100% stay again."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful backyard and attentive hosts.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house has tremendous views and in a great area for nice restaurants, hiking/golf and grocery stores. Anything you need is 5-10 min away. The house itself was a perfect size for our month long stay (2 adults and a baby). The kitchen has just about everything you need to make full meals and plenty of dining space. We used their outside backyard space many evenings and relaxing by the pool on the weekends."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We had a great time and would definitely visit again. My favorite part of the house was the garden: beautiful mountain views and giant saguaros! Definitely recommend.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location, close to beautiful hiking and felt very private."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place in a quiet neighborhood. Close to the mountains on the north side of town. Erin has made so many personal touches to the home that you can tell she truly cares about her guests being comfortable. The layout of the home is open and spacious. We love how the outdoor space is private and inviting. We really enjoyed eating outside with a view of the mountains and how the back yard pool deck and hot tub are set up. A really wonderful place to hang out with family and friends. Couldn't be better!
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Erin‚Äôs place is lovely and very cozy. The hot tub and the view were great! We would definitely stay here again.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Desert Vibrations. It was clean and in a great location - we did some hiking, enjoyed great Mexican food, and visited downtown Tucson - all were easy to access from the house.
I enjoyed having my morning coffee in the sunroom and the view of the mountains was inspiring. Our girls enjoyed the hot tub, and we also used the fire pit- all good family experiences.
Erin was very responsive, and we appreciated the ‚Äúguidebook‚Äù - we made it to several recommended restaurants with El Nene and Blanco being favorites, and did the nearby hike that was only minutes from the house.
We would definitely stay at Desert Vibrations again the next time we‚Äôre in Tucson!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Erin's place gave us the perfect space to spread out, enjoy the amenities, and the great location in the foothills. The view to the mountains from the Arizona room and the outdoor patio are fantastic, it is so private and has several different settings to enjoy for outdoor eating, hot-tubing, relaxing by the pool, star gazing, and the sunsets! We also appreciated all of the great suggestions for dining out and hiking. Thanks again for the great place to enjoy Christmas and relax."

2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little stylish place! Lovely back yard with a beautiful view and everything felt so private. We would definitely stay againüëç
2020-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Erin‚Äôs place is lovely, in a magical location with a stellar view! We appreciated being nestled in the Catalina Foothills for a few days near some beautiful hikes and views. We saw lizards, bunnies, boar and more all in the surrounding hikes which made it an even more magical experience. The house itself is older circa 1970s, and there are a lot of cool design and decor touches to compliment and play up that retro vibe nicely which is fun. Erin is super communicative and clear with info and instructions which always makes everything easier. Totally recommend for a relaxing few days in the desert."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,very chic place in the foothills. 20min from downtown. backs into the desert. calm and quiet
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was wonderful staying at this easy-to-access and private home with such authentic desert vibrations - literally the name rings true. After an arduous year with this pandemic, staying here was hands down the highlight of our year. We've stayed at a lot of Airbnbs, but this one was special.
Even tho I feel like I'm going into the desert's pasta bit, everything is up to date and clean. Cool record player and overall theme. Nice to walk around neighborhood with mountains in the backgrounds.
Pool was cold, but a nice dip and then jacuzzi! Comfy and neat lounge chair options along with firepit area.
Lastly, great TV - easy to navigate and take advantage of options - Amazon Prime, Disney Plus all under an Airbnb icon."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay at this property. It felt like home with all the amenities we needed for our stay. Amazing views and the pool/hot tub were great. The property is close to neighbors but you never heard or saw anyone so it was super private! Hosts were super quick to answer any questions we had. Would stay here again!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great home for a large group or family. Great private location overlooking the foothills. Host(s) communicate well. Overall great home! Would stay again!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved the neighborhood for sunset walks followed by a soak in the hot tub. Would definitely stay again.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"From the beginning the communication was great!
We found the home to be as described & just perfect for our visit.
The home is perfectly situated to enjoy the natural beauty of the Sonoran desert, beautiful cactus outline the property & the sunsets are spectacular.
The home is well decorated & everything was in working order. We found the home well stocked & enjoyed cooking for ourselves & our guests.
Directions for check-in and communication with our host made visit seamless.
We look forward to our next visit."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent highly recommend!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely, comfortable property. The backyard has a really cute decor which provided great Zoom backgrounds! It was too chilly to get in the pool, but we enjoyed using the hot tub. Definitely some great Instagram moments in the backyard, don't forget to take some pictures! There was plenty of room to work. We made use of the couch, the main dining table, and the bed in the lounge area. There was ample space to spread out. The property is also around 35 minutes from the different ends of Saguaro National Park, which isn't too bad. It is a bit closer to the top corner of the west park.
Note that the master shower has an incredible view, but the water does not get as hot as the other bathroom's shower. The view, however, was a really cool and unexpected addition! It makes for a fun experience."
2020-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Just as the pictures looküòÉüòÉ
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Desert Vibrations is the spot for your next private vacation or family getaway. This property is so beautiful & charming with all the amenities you could need to spoil yourself. We enjoyed the thoughtful touches in each room including the record player.. The wildlife around the property was beautiful in addition to the many beautiful plants & cacti. Loved stargazing on the patio!
I would love to stay again or recommend to a friend in Arizona.. Thanks so much Desert Vibrations!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Erin's place was incredibly clean and stylish. The house is in a great neighborhood and feels very private. Lots of thoughtful touches in the decor and amenities. Things like the stroller, highchair and pack and play were all incredibly helpful to my family. The pool and all the pool toys were a big hit with the whole family, comfortable beds, you name it. Erin also had a lot of great suggestions as to what we should do while in Tucson. We'll definitely be returning!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful space, indoors and out. The house has everything you need inside and an incredible backyard with multiple spaces to relax. Swimming and lounging amongst the giant Saguaro cacti was incredible. The pool was clean and perfect for relaxing after hiking in the trails near the rental as well as the trails in Saguaro National Park. The hosts knew this was our rescheduled honeymoon and surprised us with a bottle of champagne! 10/10 would recommend."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend this Airbnb! We were looking for a safe and more private spot to roadtrip to during covid, and Erin's spot was perfect! We spent almost all day lounging in the pool and watched every sunset in the hotub. While there are neighbors near by, there is a ton of privacy in the backyard so you forget that they are even there. Erin recommended a bunch of great nearby hikes, and Saguaro National Park is a quick 30 minute drive away. We also checked out a bunch of restaurants Erin recommended and they were all great! If we are ever in the Tucson area again we will forsure be back."
2020-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place! They were very kind and helpful.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place! Even better than the photos; it was decorated so cute and was very peaceful. Would definitely stay there again!
2020-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Staying at Desert Vibrations is like the Palm springs of Arizona. Truly a beautiful home surrounded by nature.

2020-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Convenient location in foothills.
Bed was comfortable !
House and pool dirty and host did not resolve except to say sorry."

The house is very cozy and inviting. The beds were very comfortable. The kitchen was fully stocked with the basic necessities. They have a small BBQ grill outside in the backyard perfect for grilling. The pool and outside yard were amazing. The property is close to the mountains and it‚Äôs very private. The communication between the host and myself were great. Erin and Jen responded within minutes. By the way I forgot my phone charger and Erin and Jen offered to mail it back to me. Isn‚Äôt that great!!
Thanks Jen and Erin."

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was a real joy. Our family loved the pool/ hot tub and all the outdoor space. The indoor space was quiet and cozy with many ways to entertain as well (e.g. board games, radio player, streaming movies). A real gem by the mountains!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Erin‚Äôs Desert Vibrations was all we could have asked for and more! This place was very clean and extremely stylish. My friends and I enjoyed ourselves in this space. Only recommendation we would make is for more outdoor lighting near pool/ hot tub area.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Erin‚Äôs place is amazing! We didn‚Äôt do much but got to experience a lot of the desert vibes. Erin‚Äôs place had all the amenities I was looking for to keep my kiddos happy. I would definitely recommend and stay here again!
2020-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Really nice place
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house was a great little getaway. The backyard and pool area were amazing. Would definitely recommend this location!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at Desert Vibrations! Where to begin? Our family enjoyed every minute. The house was very clean. The pool was nice and refreshing, and the pool floats made the day for our kids! The views were spectacular. Everything was just as we had hoped! Erin was very responsive with any questions we had. Would definitely return!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We were expecting a wonderful place based on the listing, but when we arrived it was even better than expected. We stayed for a week to visit our son who is living in Tucson now. Because of COVID, we spent most of our time at the house (particularly the pool) and loved every minute. The views from the pool area are incredible."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Can't say enough nice things about this place. It's like a barbie dream home if barbie were a funky stylish Tucson gal who loved cacti more than life itself. It has a well appointed kitchen, a comfortable bed, and a clean/spacious shower. Enjoyed the private patio as well as the shared one. Would stay again / recommend in a heartbeat"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The house was amazing. It really captured the Tucson and Southwestern vibe and spirit. Everything about the stay was perfect.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"It can be rare these days to find a place that feels like home, complete to cook, play games, relax and enjoy. The grounds are a stunning oasis of the Sonoran desert and truly magical making every minute at the place a treat. And Angie is a wonderful host, kind and full of of knowledge of local places but also a good read of her guests to know good fits. When I‚Äôm back in Arizona I‚Äôll be back at this place"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I were so delighted to stay in Angie‚Äôs guesthouse. Upon arrival, it became very apparent to us why this place has received so many five-star reviews: the grounds are immaculate and it is a peaceful retreat immersed in nature. We have stayed in many AirBnB‚Äôs recently where nothing is stocked (towels, toilet paper, kitchen items) but everything was well stocked, which was so refreshing. The accommodations themselves are beautiful and Angie‚Äôs talent for interior/exterior decor really shines through. Angie was very communicative and helpful as well as a gracious and kind host. We would love to return because this is a very special spot."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful & relaxing stay. The casita is very clean & has all kinds of thoughtful touches that made staying here even better. The kitchen is well-equipped for those who want to do some cooking. We had planned on going out to dinner but the place was so relaxing & the garden so beautiful, we got takeout & ate there. The grounds are like staying in a botanical garden & private. The neighborhood is very quiet - we slept really well on the very comfortable bed.
The photos are accurate - it's actually better than the photos can show. We did not want to leave."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Top among Airbnb‚Äôs we have stayed at, and a place to which we will certainly return! Kitchen is well stocked, the bed/pillows very comfortable, and the decor is really lovely with lots of artistic touches. The property hosts other guests, and yet we always felt a sense of privacy."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Magical, beautiful, thoughtful, peaceful are a handful of words that come to mind. I've stayed in two of Angies places now and she creates wonderful spaces with so many amenities you might need. We loved being there."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wow! Words just don‚Äôt express how magical this place is. I could just sit outside the entire time and watch and listen to the birds! The Cactus garden is outstanding and lots of places to lounge and take naps! Then there is the inside. Absolutley gorgeous. The colours and textures are eye candy and everything is clean and comfortable. Surrounded by beauty in many ways. Kitchen is really nicely stocked and ready for meals to be made. The walk in the neighbourhood during the Pink Full Moon was really quite special. It‚Äôs one of my favourite places and I‚Äôve traveled far and wide!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed the beautiful little casita so much!! Absolute gorgeous styling in the place and watching the birds out back was the most surprising fun we had!! Would definitely go back anytime we‚Äôre in Tucson.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We feel totally enriched by the beautiful and peaceful environment we experienced. We could hardly stand to go! We‚Äôve stayed at lots of Airbnbs and this one stands out as one of the very best. Everything was just as we‚Äôd hoped, and then a few notches above that."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beauty abounds here! This is the best airbnb we've ever been to. There is so much effort put into the grounds and house, everywhere you look is a feast for the eyes. If you have allergies, this is the rare unicorn of completely clean and scent-free that's just so hard to find. This goes to the top of our list of places we need to come back to for the peace and serenity it provides. It was a pleasure to get off the many hiking trails in the area and come ""home"" and just sit on the patio for the rest of the day. Wonderful kitchen with everything you need, bath with all the extras. Felt very Lux! Perfect stay!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Angie's place is magical. We delighted in the surroundings, thoughtful and artistic touches everywhere. The space was very clean and beautiful. It was such a special stay!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wow! Superior Airbnb. Beautiful desert oasis. Like a botanical garden. Great location. Perfect little casa - just like the pictures. Would love to stay here again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Angie's place is absolutely beautiful. The cactus garden on her property is amazing. The kitchen is very well equipped. The bed is super comfortable. The bathroom and shower are wonderful. The entire house is beautifully decorated and very well stocked. It is a short Ride to Saguaro National Park which is an absolute must see! Tuscon is only 20 minutes to downtown. We have stayed at Airbnb's all over the world. Angie's place is very special.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is our absolutely favorite airbnb and we have stayed at many. We could only stay one night bc it was only available for one! Angie has thought of every detail of how to make the stay at her place amazing... Indoors and outdoors!! She has everything you need to enjoy the desert in a luxurious way. We always want to stay there and not leave to tour anything else bc it is like you are immersed in the natural environment, even while inside the casita!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful, cozy, beautiful casita with amazing views of wildlife, the Tucson Mountains, and natural landscaping. The casita is well-furnished for sleeping, cooking and hanging out. Couldn‚Äôt recommend more highly!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great place to stay. Super clean, super comfortable beds. Great shower. Kitchen modern and well stocked. So many extras. The outside is like a botanical garden with so many cactus. Nice sitting areas outside, including a fire pit. Pictures accurately represent this excellent property. Angie has thought of everything to make the stay a memorable experience. HIGHLY recommend."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"There are times when I don't want to rave about a 5* accommodation because I want to keep it a secret...all for myself! But here goes...Angie's casita was 6*! The interior was delightful. Beautiful tile work, a gorgeous well-stocked kitchen, comfy bed and artistic touches throughout. As gardeners we were thrilled with the cacti and the landscaping. The private patio was our favorite spot for coffee and wine! The outdoor common was space equally inviting! We appreciated the lovely neighborhood for walking and the location so accessible to hiking and to Tucson!
Many thanks, Angie!
Todd and Ellen, Appleton, WI"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Amazing stay in a beautiful casita on the west side. Quiet, peaceful, dark at night oasis. Loads of wildlife around casita and easy access to incredible hiking and downtown activities. Angie is a fabulous host and very responsive, personable, knowledgeable and fun. Bed was excellent and kitchen has everything you need to make great meals. Used the fireplace when nights were cool. Thank you Angie for an incredible stay."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second time staying at this property and it‚Äôs hard to decide what we like best: the host, the property itself or the location. All three are unbeatable and we just love our time at this special little retreat. 12/10 recommend!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just like the reviews it‚Äôs a cute little sanctuary and we saw rabbits and birds and one coyote and one deer‚Ä¶Ôøº coolest place. The tree is lit up throughout the night with classy white lights. The place is exceptionally comfortable with Netflix, and the bed was tiptop!!! Looking forward to coming back!!!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very beautiful place and location, we felt like we were in a botanical garden!!! Definitely would stay here again in a heartbeat and was one of the highlights of my trip."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! Completely exceeded expectations! The casita was clean, comfortable, fully stocked with beautiful appointments. And the garden‚Ä¶. As cactus and bird lovers‚Ä¶. Mind blown!!! Stellar views wherever you looked!!!
Already planning our next trip. Thank you Angie!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The desert garden setting is beautiful. The casita is very clean, well appointed, cozy and comfortable. Easy access to Saguaro National Park. Angie is very responsive and welcoming. Would definitely stay there again."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place, convenient to town. The yard is better than the pictures show. Great place to stay"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Hands down the nicest and most well equipped stay on our road trip through Arizona. The photos don't do it justice as it is even better in person. It is beautifully decorated and the tile work is stunning! The front and back garden areas are beautifully landscaped and are tranquil places to relax and unwind. I have highly recommended this listing to family who are planning to visit the Tucson area.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"There is only one word to describe Angie‚Äôs place: magical. Simply magical.
We had high hopes from the listing pics but they don‚Äôt even do it justice. It‚Äôs so serene and well decorated (very high end items).
We will be back!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The casita was spacious, with a separate bedroom, so when one of us stayed up later than the other, the person sleeping wasn't disturbed. The kitchen was well-stocked with various pots, pans, and appliances, except for a dishwasher, which we wouldn't have used anyway. The grounds outside the casita were beautifully landscaped and maintained, with several birdfeeders located around the property. My husband, who is an avid birder, certainly enjoyed that aspect of our stay. Our host was friendly and helpful."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a lovely place to stay in Tucson. The house itself and the outdoor areas are beautiful. Highly recommended!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Angie and Sue do an amazing job of making this darling casita your home away from home. I can‚Äôt get enough of the setting. Unique landscaping. Serene, secluded front and back patios."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I don‚Äôt think I can say anything different than what has been said by all the other guests that have stayed in this amazing sanctuary nestled in the foothills of Saguaro National Park. Angie has thought of everything to make your stay perfect. The surrounding garden was such a sanctuary for our week. We would finish our activities for the day and couldn‚Äôt wait to come back to the casita and watch the birds at the bird feeder - especially the Anna‚Äôs hummingbirds that came every afternoon and relax. Just perfect
Thank you"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This was the second visit to this property and it was just as magical as the first. Angie's property is immersed in the Sonoran desert and is a truly wonderful respite from ordinary hometown experience. I hope to get to go back again!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is probably the best Airbnb I've ever stayed in. I didn't want to leave! The place is much larger than I imagined, the kitchen is fully stocked with everything, a blender, coffee maker, coffee grinder, spices, good pots and pans, Angie thought of every detail. The tile work in the casita is gorgeous. The property was like staying on a nature preserve, it was so amazing, the garden, the birds, the patio furniture, everything was brilliant. I can keep going on and on but read the other fabulous reviews. Hope to stay again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Delightful stay! Will be back.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wow. We knew it would be pretty from the pics but really swept away when we pulled up. The desert garden surrounding the casita showed a lot of love and attention to detail that clearly embody the home as well. We loved everything about this place and will definitely be back the next time we‚Äôre in Tucson!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Angie's place. All of the glowing reviews are spot-on! The guest house was *beautifully* decorated. We were in awe of all the small artistic touches everywhere. And the patio areas-- Wow! Any nature-lover will fall in love with this place. It really does look like a botanical garden. There's even a bird feeder on the private patio and a big window for observation. We saw tons of Gambel's quail, morning doves, cactus wrens, cardinals, and even a hawk drinking out of the fountain in the courtyard. Our first morning drinking coffee on the private patio, we came face to face with a beautiful coyote following a rabbit. Angie has created a wonderful environment for relaxation and rejuvenation. And just a 15 minute drive from out favorite thing to do in Tucson-- a scenic drive through Gate's Pass. Highly recommend."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,So beautiful & peaceful! Just what I needed to refill my creative cup. Angie was wonderful to work with! The home and outside area is more lovely than the pictures. Very thankful for my stay & I hope to make it back again.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you, Angie -- this casita is amazing! We will hopefully get back to it one day. Best Airbnb experience we have ever had! After hiking in Saguaro all day, it was wonderful to make dinner in the great kitchen and turn in early and then get up and do it again the next day. Clean, peaceful, and beautifully decorated. Loved having breakfast in the courtyard and a sunset drink on the back patio!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed here twice now. The Casita is immaculate with comfortable furnishings and a kitchen fully stocked with high-end appliances. I especially love the bird feeder and the bird seed supply to refill it daily. This is such a peaceful place.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of most beautiful homes we have ever stayed in. The landscaping is picturesque to say the least, and the variety of wildlife coming through the property is amazing. We saw mule deer, quail, Costa‚Äôs hummingbirds, coyotes, rabbits, Cooper‚Äôs hawks and lizards right outside the back patio. Although there are neighbors, the area feels very secluded and quiet. It was nice to be able to walk the area in the evening and see all the wildlife including javelina, Harris‚Äôs hawks, and great horned owls. We will not hesitate to stay here again on future trips to Tucson."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is an exquisite Airbnb location. The garden is breathtaking and the interior has many artistic touches. The hosts were responsive and we felt very comfortable during our stay. A+++!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had an absolutely incredible time at Angie and Sue‚Äôs casasita in Tucson! This was one of the absolute best Airbnb experiences I‚Äôve stayed in! Beautiful architecture and design, incredibly clean and well-taken care of, and local art touches brought character to the house that I loved finding new things sprinkled about as each day that passed! One of best parts was hanging outside in the beautiful landscape with the local wildlife and flora! Also nice to know that bugs weren‚Äôt an issue at all! Thank you for opening up your beautiful home to us and for the great recommendations exploring Tucson! Really impressed with the local hiking options and foodie scene based on their recommendations! Thanks again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice stay thank you
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Angie‚Äôs place is a true ‚ÄúOasis‚Äù. Best airbnb to date! Just beautiful and sparkling clean. The garden/grounds are gorgeous. We could‚Äôve stayed here for a week and not leave the premises, very peaceful and relaxing. Every detail was top notch! We loved seeing the quail!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had to look up the meaning of ‚Äòshangri-la‚Äô and it describes Angie‚Äôs place perfectly: a remote and idyllic hideaway. The grounds and outdoor living areas are lush and inviting (I filled my camera roll with pics) and the interior, cheerful, bright and charming. The bed, pillows and linens are wonderful, the kitchen and bathroom well-stocked (and then some!) and the proximity to parks and downtown, convenient. We have stayed at a lot of Airbnb‚Äôs and Saguaro Oasis Retreat is at the top of the list. If it‚Äôs available for your dates, book it!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Kaseeta is absolutely lovely. There are thoughtful details inside the Airbnb, pretty much anything you need is there. And the grounds are absolutely stunning. I would recommend coming here at any time of the year, even in the sweltering heat like when I was there. it was an absolutely delightful place to stay. Angie was really responsive, especially when I had to have something specific shipped there, and overall was very helpful."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I think I might have teared up as soon as I stepped foot inside of Angie‚Äôs casita haha no lie üòÇ. After a pretty hectic morning, Sue messaged me that I could check in a bit earlier & it was just the message I needed to see! I almost forgot I was in Arizona sitting outside sometimes (I know how can I forget with all the cacti outside) but with all the beautiful decor outside I almost felt like I was in a small town in Europe lol. The front patio is drop dead gorgeous. The water fountain, all the plants, crystals, & the hammock?! Heavenly. Inside the Airbnb, even better. Beautifully designed and really calm energy in the home. Couch was really comfy, spent some hours watching Kdramas on it. I didn‚Äôt cook at all but the kitchen was stocked with essentials. The bed was also very comfy. Bathroom also beautiful & had the essentials there for you. Only animal sightings I had was a Fox in the backyard & that‚Äôs when I was like ok I‚Äôm going to just stay inside at night üòÇ."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was by far a GEM in my Tucson experience. I came to Tucson for a bit of a spiritual journey and this location felt like a key magical component of it all. The photos don't even do the space justice... and Angie and Sue were so HELPFUL and RESPONSIVE and ACCOMMODATING, you can tell that they enjoy what they do with hosting, they went above and beyond with recommendations and accommodating me when I was in a bind and needed the space longer last minute. So much love to these owners . All I can say is THANK YOU."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was the most beautiful air bnb I have ever stayed in. A true vacation spot in the desert with responsive hosts though it was compels easy to stay there. I highly recommend!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We can‚Äôt say enough good things about our hosts and the property! The casita is well apportioned and generously stocked - down to the fresh flowers! The outdoor spaces are peaceful and inviting - even in the heat! My only concern is that when word gets out about this place of tranquility and retreat, availability will be at a premium and we won‚Äôt be able to stay here when we return."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous location and gorgeous home!! We loved staying here and definitely would do it again!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Angie‚Äôs place was even better than the photos! We loved our stay and definitely recommend this air bnb to others. Lots of wildlife, even saw a couple tarantulas!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"By far one of the best airbnb‚Äôs I have stayed in, Angie did a great job with the Casita inside and out, my wife and I had a perfect week in the desert, will defiantly be back in the future."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Every single detail was perfect. This home was equipped with high end everything. Beautifully crafted home inside and out. The bed was so comfortable and the kitchen had great equipment. We felt like it was a second home.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place. Very nice and peaceful.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed the stay, nice desert scenery. Not too far from downtown."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Best place ever! Gorgeous garden and interiors. Great location too. The host was accommodating and rhe AC was great. Highly recommend!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Angie's property was beautifully decorated, very clean, & had gorgeous landscaping. Anything you could need was included in the rental. This Airbnb exceeded our expectations. An absolute gem!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Angie‚Äôs place was hands down our favorite airbnb. The space is gorgeous and you don‚Äôt want to leave. Angie is super helpful and welcoming. We felt safe and extremely comfortable. We already made plans to return next year! Don‚Äôt hesitate to rent‚Ä¶ snatch this place up before someone else does!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I don't usually leave reviews for our Airbnb stays - most of them have been excellent but leaving reviews has never been a priority of mine.
I'm making an exception for Angie's because we are in such agreement that her place was superlative. The neighborhood, the property, the outdoor amenities of the property that made it a delight, the indoor amenities, overall condition, aesthetics, comforts - it was a delight just to hang out in the Casita, which was an whole intention by itself of our visit. We're grateful to Angie most of all for all the attention paid to detail that made it such an enjoyable visit."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at this Airbnb was simply amazing! The attention to detail throughout the property was impeccable. The stunning decor added a touch of elegance and charm to our entire stay.
The garden area was a delightful sanctuary that we instantly fell in love with. It provided a serene setting where we could relax and unwind. We spent many peaceful moments there, enjoying the beautiful surroundings.
The kitchen amenities were top-notch and exceeded our expectations. We found everything we needed, making meal preparations a breeze. It was a pleasure to cook in such a well-equipped space.
A unique aspect of our stay was the presence of adorable lizards. We had a great time watching them and it added an extra touch of enjoyment to our experience.
We would gladly stay at this Airbnb again and highly recommend it to others. The attention to detail, stunning decor, lovely garden area, and fantastic kitchen amenities make it an outstanding choice for a memorable getaway."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the most beautiful AirBnbs I‚Äôve stayed in. Check in was easy, the place itself was immaculate (and beautifully decorated), and the surrounding gardens were gorgeous. The biggest plus was being able to watch all the birds and other wildlife outside!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful home and a great experience! The house was beautiful and clean and the hosts were responsive and friendly. The kitchen was stocked with all of the basic amenities for cooking and the bathroom had plenty of toiletries if you forgot shampoo, toothbrush, cotton swabs, etc. Spend some quiet evenings eating on the private back porch and watching quail chicks forage in the cactus understory. You will love it!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic stay again! Thanks again for a great stay! Will definitely be back again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Angie's place is even more beautiful--indoors and out--than how it was presented in the listing. Living and dining room furniture is very comfortable, bed is cozy with good support, kitchen is well-stocked, great appliances, and such a gorgeous and peaceful property. And all sparkling clean. Angie and Sue were very responsive. When we discovered the gas tank for the grill was near-empty, Sue promptly came over with a new one since Angie was out of town. We couldn't have asked for anything to be improved, everything was wonderful. Thank you so much Angie and Sue!!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic. A perfect size for a single or couple. with comfy furniture, southwestern and bold. Fully stocked kitchen, big Mexican tiles for floor and decorative bathroom tiles as colorful as a circus; skylights in the kitchen, big windows, desert moon flooding in. Easy entry with keypad. Good parking down pathway to front door. I value the privacy here, walking in through a shared patio, with a private patio in back full of southwestern plants‚Äîmesquite, palo verde, saguaro, and great gobs of beautiful (and don‚Äôt touch) jumping cholla (that‚Äôs what they seem to do if you get too close and you better have tweezers and pliers to get the barbs out). Doves galore, rabbits, Red-tailed and Harris hawks overhead, great horned owl hoots nearby, sweet herd of slightly preposterous javelina crossing the street on a walk a few hundred feet from the driv"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay in this little desert haven! The casita is tastefully decorated, with attention to every detail. The casita is fully-equipped, extremely comfy and cosy. We loved the feeling of being surrounded by desert plants and animals (we only saw birds and rabbits), being in a decor that felt different but relaxing and homey. We checked out several of Angie's recommendation for sunset gazing, grabbing delicious breakfast and tasty dinner as well as close-by hikes and loved all of them! Too bad we ran out of time to go to the Happy Saguaro as we would have loved to bring home a souvenir similar to the many beautiful ceramics that adorn the garden! Highly recommend this place if you want to be in close driving distance to downtown and on your way to wonderful hikes to Saguaro Natl Park or Mount Lemmon, but in the middle of desert vegetation at a lovely place that feels at home right away!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous house. Fantastic garden. Sleep well. Everything was great.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is one of the most beautiful Airbnbs I‚Äôve ever stayed in! The decor and attention to detail is amazing, and the garden is unbelievable. I stayed for a week to work virtually and to explore the city. I do video calls for work and had flawless internet. If I‚Äôm ever back in Tucson, I‚Äôd definitely stay here again. My only complaint is that there were a lot of bugs inside the house - I‚Äôm sure due in part to the proximity of the gorgeous desert garden as well as the unseasonable rain. Just wanted to mention in case other bug phobics would want to know! Still a wonderful visit."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,awsome place. super clean and wonderful surroundings. one of the best places we have stayed. Will have no worries staying at this hidden gem. worth it for sure. I'm so happy we found it. Sara & Rusty
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An absolute gem. I used to love AirBnb in its early days, when the idea was to stay in an extension of someone‚Äôs home (or what home is to someone). This is one of those places, from the thoughtful furniture and decor, master craftsmanship of the home, impeccable yard and landscape, clean, quality sheets, towels and kitchenware, real floral arrangements to welcome you. I could go on and on - we can‚Äôt wait to come back and it‚Äôs the best AirBnb both myself and my spouse have ever stayed in.
I will also mention, for those of you who are environmentally sensitive/conscious for your health or the health of others you‚Äôre traveling with, the place has filtered reverse osmosis drinking water, cotton l towels, low tox toiletries, pots/pans and mattress."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can't rave enough about this jewel of a getaway. Just 5 min. from a Safeway, Starbucks and more, yet it is super quiet and surrounded by the most amazing natural Sonoran landscape. I sat out on the patio under a full moon and just listened to the sounds of the desert and the faint trickle of water from the courtyard fountain.
The architecture and detailed tile work throughout were clearly installed by a master craftsman. EVERYTHING is so thoughtfully appointed. None of the tiny annoyances from other rentals exist here. And Angie communicated just the right amount. Her guidebook of local hikes and venues sealed the deal. Now I'm eager to stay at her other properties, too."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent, hassle-free, and lovely!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The casita was a perfect getaway for my husband and I! It was quiet, and so peaceful. I enjoyed watching the birds feed from the bird feeder and just hearing and seeing the animals that surrounded the area. I will definitely be returning in the future! Thank you Angie for the amazing stay and experience!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb was exactly what I needed! I was on a business trip and rather than conventional lodging - hotels/motels, I chose this home. It was absolutely perfect. Quiet, peaceful, well furnished. An oasis in itself. Thank you Angie! I will be back!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enchanting cactus garden!!! Casita was perfect in everyway! Spacious and beautiful! By far, one of the BEST I‚Äôve stayed at."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, this place is truly a treasure! Angie really has a gift for creating an amazing space. Waking up to sunshine and birdsong, coffee on the back porch, evening walks in the neighborhood. Not to mention all the things Tucson has to offer. Perfect getaway! Highly recommend."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We could not have more pleased with Angie‚Äôs place. Her casita was fantastic‚Äî better than described. It was exceptionally clean and well appointed. We didn‚Äôt lack for anything while there.
The gardens make the casita feel like an oasis ‚Äî so beautiful and peaceful. We would definitely stay there again, no question."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"if you‚Äôre considering staying here please book it. this place is something else, the detail is incredible and we literally couldnt decide where we wanted to sit for dinner because every spot was so pretty. the shower is also amazing. the nicest place ive ever been to. 10/10"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at this beautiful casita. Everything about it was delightful, inside and out. The decor was absolutely wonderful and the yard was truly like a botanical garden. Relaxing on the patio was so peaceful, with just the sound of the breeze and the cooing of doves. Despite being surrounded by nature, the location is convenient to restaurants and grocery stores, and it's perfectly situated for visits to Saguaro and the Arizona Sonoran Desert Museum. Our stay was everything we hoped for and more, and we would highly recommend Angie's place, especially to nature-lovers. We definitely hope to come back!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Angie was great! She responded right away. And the place was fantastic. It catered to guests with all the attention to details. Super cute, very clean, and the garden/grounds were so special. Loved all the cactuses, garden, hammock and seating outside. I would absolutely stay here again!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Wonderful casita in a beautifully landscaped yard. The place was beautifully-tiled and in the adobe style. Angie was super helpful and friendly. The place is only 20 mins from the Saguaro National Park West with lots of great hikes, and 20 mins from the restaurants and clubs downtown."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Wildlife was abundant including javelinas. The desert garden was a zen experience.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just outstanding!! The guest house is better then the photos. So relaxing, lots of wildlife from Doves,Pheasant, Coyotes, wild pig. Our 6 day stay was so relaxing and the best Airbnb !!!! Angie & Sue were great to chat with and so friendly. Angie even left us a vase with flowers at our door . If you have a chance try this amazing place out!!!!!!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The setting is like a botanical garden, the house is tastefully decorated, it is very clean, and the host is responsive. It is an outstanding casita and a wonderful place to stay in Tucson. We highly recommend it."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful nearly-new Casita surrounded by a manicured desert garden. Peaceful. Restful. Beautiful. Private back porch to bask in the sun and watch the doves, quail, hummingbirds and maybe a coyote or two. Tasteful southwestern decor. The kitchen is better equipped than ours at home! Modern appliances. Dish soap, hand soap, body wash, shampoo, conditioner, soothing lotion (in case you over-sun), birdseed for the feeders ‚Äî All supplied! 20 minutes from the nearest national park (there are three) with great desert hiking. Everything was awesome and just what we needed. Batteries went dead in the TV remote. One text to Angie and we had new ones within the hour. Our best AirBnB find ever!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The casita was a lot bigger than what I first imagined from the pictures. The space inside and outside was beautiful. So peaceful to start the morning in the back patio with coffee and your own private cacti garden. Got lucky seeing rabbits and quail! Will book again if I'm ever back in Tuscon.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was exactly what we were hoping for! A beautiful quiet spot to enjoy the evenings. The landscaping is pristine and plenty of wildlife around (birds, rabbits). We will be back and so will our friends and family now that they've seen our photos."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Angie‚Äôs place was everything I hoped it would be and more. Perfect little slice of nature with all the comforts we needed. The place was very well stocked with extra towels and soaps/shampoo and everything we would need. Close to the parks and downtown without having to be downtown. Tons of birds in the yard all the time. I would absolutely stay here again or at one of her other places. Angie is a great host and even left us some fruits from her garden which I enjoyed.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place and wonderful host. Beautiful home, beautiful setting, and Angie went above and beyond to leave everything we needed for a comfortable stay. Highly recommended."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Angie was a wonderful host. She always responded immediately and also provided a link with wonderful suggestions for restaurants, hikes and things to do.
Communicating with Angie was like reaching out to a friend.
The Airbnb is probably the nicest one we have ever stayed in. Beautifully designed and furnished.
The gardens and home have a serene and peaceful feel to them
We highly recommend Angie‚Äôs place if you have the opportunity."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This has been the best Airbnb experience we have ever had. It is a beautiful place and everything was of high quality - from the towels and bedding to the soaps . The place also has a lovely scent. Enjoyed seeing the different kinds of wildlife too! Every window had a great view. Got lots of ideas for landscaping with cacti just from spending time at Angie‚Äôs place. Top notch experience!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just like other reviewers, I concur that this one of the best Airbnb experiences we‚Äôve ever had. Beautiful place, great attention to detail, well stocked kitchen. Extra towels, fresh flowers, helpful guide to local restaurants. The garden is amazing, the bed is super comfortable, I can‚Äôt recommend it highly enough. We stayed for 4 nights and loved every minute of it!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Our experience with Angie and her beautiful property was not only efficient but touched by her talent in design and kindness throughout our stay. The morning doves, the open interior space and privacy on the side patio made the desert and living area feel seamless. We also appreciate use of the front patio and hammock area to view the natural yet landscaped desert. We shall return for sure."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"So glad we chose to stay at Angie‚Äôs place. It definitely ranks as the very best Airbnb we have stayed at and we have stayed at many. The house was beautifully decorated and thoughtfully stocked. The landscaping and outdoor areas were absolutely stunning. For our tastes it is located in the very best area. Close enough to the city while still feeling spread out and in tune with the natural surroundings.
I would hands down stay here again."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Angie‚Äôs casita was a peaceful oasis. Private and beautifully decorated with all the amenities you could want. Great way to experience the desert yet be ten minutes from the city.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"In need of a recharge in the Sonoran desert of Tucson, this is the perfect place to unplug. The grounds and neighborhood are absolutely amazing to stroll through. We saw more wildlife here than on our trip to Yellowstone; coyotes, rabbits, and a variety of birds, including the adorable quail that roost nearby, hummers, and javelina!
It's a beautiful property fully equipped for a relaxing stay."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Angie‚Äôs place couldn‚Äôt be more perfect! The decor and grounds were gorgeous! The place was absolutely spotless. Loved the layout and the bathroom was amazing. Exactly how I imagined staying in Arizona would look like. She thought of everything we could possibly need while there. We especially had a good time with the board games! Can‚Äôt wait to go to back to Tucson just so I can stay here again!!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing location. Perfectly designed interior, and the landscaping around this lovely casita is unlike anything we've ever seen. Entirely desert plans, but with a diversity that is unique, and as much like a botanical garden as a home. We will definitely come again. Everything about this home was amazing, and perfect."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A gorgeous place to stay! Stunning views, clean, easy access, we were so close to everything Tuscon had to offer while being tucked away surrounded by nature and out of the city. I can't say enough nice things about the attention to details ans ease we had here! Will definitely be returning!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was truly one of the most , beautiful, updated and comfortable airbnb we have stayes in. The space is new and all the amenities are provided in the kitchen and bathroom. The bed is comfortable and the peacefulness in the night is wonderful. The birds in the morning just outside the bedroom were fun to watch from the comfortable outside chairs. The landscape is mature and no other neighbors can be seen - this is truly a gem and we strongly recommend spending some time in Angie's wonderful home during your time in Tucson."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We had a great time. the house is a super beautiful relaxing place. It was really hard to leave
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is nothing short of spectacular and feels more like you‚Äôre staying at your friends house and not an Airbnb. The grounds are stunning and so welcoming upon arrival. The care and attention put into the inside and outside isn‚Äôt something you get at all rentals. Thank you for sharing this magical space!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Angie's AirBnB was amazing. The property is stunning, impeccably decorated and landscaped, and the neighborhood is serene and quiet. It was a beautiful retreat weekend and we will definitely be staying again. The location is also perfect. It's near grocery stores and just a 15 minute drive to downtown restaurants. I would stay a month or longer if I could."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,An amazing Air BnB its gorgeous inside and the garden is beautiful. The inside is exquisite with really lovely and comfortable furniture and the bathroom has the absolute wow factor. Its also in a great location for access to the Desert Museum and the National Park. Angie is a fabulous host and responds very quickly. We loved it!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved our stay! It lived up to all of our expectations. It was extremely comfortable and clean. Check-in and out was super easy. Our favorite part was the overall decor and active wildlife right outside the windows! Would stay again.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of the most incredible places I have stayed at through air b n b. The house is very clean and well kept, and has everything you could need. The property and area felt safe and was absolutely beautiful. If you are ever in Tucson this air b n b is the best place to stay 10/10 recommend."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is an amazing stay. The garden ambience at night is sensational.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place captures the serenity and beauty of the southwest. It is a place that provides peace and inspiration. Loved watching and listening to the array of birds. Even watched a hummingbird drink from the fountain in the courtyard. A great deal of privacy. A number of patios that are very relaxing. The inside of the house should be featured in a magazine. It's absolutely stunning! Great communication with the hosts. We will definitely try to get back here. Words aren't adequate to describe this place. Feel very lucky to have found it!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Angie's place was the most amazing airbnb I have ever stayed in. From the gorgeous outdoor cactus gardens with precious rocks, to the interior southwestern style casita, everything was perfect!!!! The bed was very comfortable. Every time I took a shower I did not want to get back out! The decor and every touch, including the laundry soap and coffee mugs, was planned out for this place. You do NOT want to miss a stay at this one! It is a magical place to escape to."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely perfect in every way - we were sorry to leaveüëç
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Angie's place is perfect for a visit to Tucson. The house is very clean and has everything you need for a long or short term stay. The garden and neighbourhood is beautiful. Angie is very responsive. I would definitely stay here again!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place!!! Perfectly decorated and very clean! The landscape is stunning. Thanks for having us!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a magical desert oasis. The garden is just spectacular with so many varieties of cacti, succulents & trees. It was so relaxing to chill in the hammock and even better sitting out back watching birds, bunnies and even coyotes. Easy in and out, beautiful kitchen to work in and lovely tile throughout. Highly recommend, especially if you are hoping for a desert experience! Angie was attentive and easy to communicate with!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A complete gem i Tucson! Angie certainly has great taste. The kitchen is well stocked aswell, basically a dream home!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Angie's beautiful Tucson home was an amazing stay! The beautiful furnishings, colorful interior, and gorgeous front yard and backyard made this an absolute gem of a place. This was one of the best places I've ever stayed at, and I will be visiting again!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First off, this is the best Airbnb stay I‚Äôve ever experienced. The casita and surrounding yard are works of art. Angie put so much thought, creativity, and love into her property that my boyfriend and I felt like children while we explored and just found ourselves in awe of the beauty she created. The casita was beautifully curated with so many special handmade pieces (including the cups/dinnerware by local artists) and I‚Äôm not kidding, the COMFIEST bed I‚Äôve ever slept in. The tile work was incredible and there is a stunning standup shower. Also, as two animal lovers visiting AZ in part to see wildlife, while staying at her place, we saw a bobcat, several species of lizards, got to save a baby dove, and even saw a tarantula (which only happened at night and was very brief because it dashed back to its underground home). Overall, this was an experience I‚Äôll never forget and truly am in awe of Angie and am so thankful people like her exist and bring these kinds of experiences into existence. -Ashley and Nate"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the best place I have ever stayed. Beautiful inside and out. Lovely scenery, clean, quiet. I will come back definitely."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Slice of heaven! Beautiful picturesque property. Comfortable, welcoming, immaculate & peaceful . We absolutely loved our stay here. Location is great for exploring & set just away from the city. Can't wait to return!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,this was the most amazing place! i would love to visit again!!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Angie's place is gorgeous!!! The space felt luxurious with all of the modern decor and southwest tile work. I loved having cactus and garden views out every window, and the porch seating area was lovely. The location of the Casita is perfect- short drive to outdoor activities as well as downtown. I was truly sad when my stay came to an end, and I would absolutely book again!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It felt like a dream staying at Angie‚Äôs house for four days. The house is so pretty with gorgeous tiles and the kitchen is really nicely equipped. The shower had amazing water pressure, unlike many hotels we stayed.
The cacti garden was also beautiful, relaxing and creative! The location was also perfect for us and we were able to go for some trail walks while being close to downtown. I highly recommend this place for anyone who wants an authentic Tuscon experience!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Angie and Sue‚Äôs casita is absolutely the best stay experience! The place is extremely clean and not to mention the beautiful style with the tiles and traditional flooring. We felt right at home and the desert landscape was a great hangout. Would stay here again, no question about it. You will not regret booking with them!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The best Airbnb I've ever stayed at! The house is beautiful, comfortable, and spotless, surrounded by gorgeous desert and an amazing garden. I spent several hours sitting on the patio and watching the birds and rabbits. (Wildlife updates from Angie about notable animal activity were a huge plus!) The kitchen is fully stocked and all other amenities are great. Honestly, the worst part of my stay was that I had to leave. I recommend 1000%! This is a very special place."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my husband and my first experience using Airb&b. We could not have picked a better place. Angie had great communication. Check in was very easy and efficient. Super clean and beautifully decorated. RO water system for drinking water was an extra bonus we appreciated. Outside the plants growing were just beautfiul we enjoyed walking around and looking at them. Lots of fun wildlife around to observe. Very quiet and peaceful. Everything is just top notch. Great place for any nature lover.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very beautiful property
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for the perfect desert getaway, Angie‚Äôs place is the best you‚Äôll find. It‚Äôs quiet, inviting and beautiful. There‚Äôs fantastic bird watching right from the porch, and a cosy outdoor space that makes for a perfect spot for dinner or morning coffee. I cannot recommend highly enough!!!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Medical, diverse, well laid out Saguaro gardens, multitude of cacti, agaves with crystals and a bubbling fountain. It works be worth coming here just for the fabulous outdoors‚Äîbut wait, there‚Äôs more! And obviously recently remodeled casita, spacious open kitchen, dining and living, with a separate bedroom. The pictures do not do injustice. I‚Äôm picky, and there‚Äôs nothing negative I could say about this stay! Don‚Äôt hesitate: if this is available when you want to get away, book it. Angie and Sue are perfect hostesses, promptly respond to messages. They made everything clear and smooth. I will be back!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"10 Stars ‚≠êÔ∏è - The best Airbnb experience I‚Äôve ever had!! Angie‚Äôs place is so clean and she didn‚Äôt miss any details!! Her property is magical - with so many amazing wildlife sightings, gorgeous gem stones, and several places to sit outside and enjoy it all! Solid WiFi, super comfy bed and pillows, washer/dryer, and the water pressure in the shower is awesome!!
Book your trip NOW- you won‚Äôt regret it!! ‚ô•Ô∏è"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home was immaculate and beautifully decorated. It‚Äôs always a good sign when you‚Äôre on vacation in a new place that you‚Äôre excited to explore‚Ä¶but you don‚Äôt want to leave where you‚Äôre staying because it‚Äôs just that amazing. We relaxed in the yard for quite a bit of our time there, enjoyed seeing all of the desert animals, and various plants, gorgeous rocks, succulents and eclectic decor outside.
We were fortunate enough to get to say hello to our host Angie, (who is super awesome by the way!) and she went above and beyond to make sure our stay was memorable!
Great location, safe/quiet neighborhood, beautiful yard. The bed and pillows were so comfy, and the little touches (thanks for the chocolates!) in Angie‚Äôs home were so thoughtful. We will absolutely be back as this was our favorite Air Bnb experience, ever.
Thanks Angie!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Once again, Angie‚Äôs place did not disappoint. What a delightful, charming retreat! Cannot recommend enough. 5 stars all the way."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful casita! Every little detail was perfect. The garden was pretty and well kept. The area felt very private and secluded which was nice. I was sad to leave and hope to return again soon!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Casita is beautiful, and the owners are very kind. The place is very clean, and the yards outside are beautifully decorated and well kept. Would absolutely recommend staying here."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this casita. It‚Äôs immaculate and beautifully decorated. Everything is top quality: sheets, pillows, blankets. AC works beautifully. The garden is gorgeous. This morning we saw a coyote walk through it. Probably the best AirBnB we‚Äôve ever been to."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"STUNNING. Angie's place truly is a hidden oasis in the beautiful Tucson desert. We were blown away by how beautiful the garden and guest house are. The babbling fountain brings close a huge variety of desert animals such as bunnies, lizards, hummingbirds, and quail families. You don't need a tv if you stay here and enjoy nature! (but there is a smart tv anyway :) The queen bed is very comfortable, the place is immaculately clean, and the kitchen has every new appliance someone could want or need if they plan on cooking here. Angie has been gracious enough to provide an abundance of linens, towels, and supplies you may require for your stay. She even provides bird seed for the feeders! You'll need a car to travel to Tucson but it's a very short trip into town. You'll find the Saguaro National Park and the Sonoran desert museum are a short and lovely drive from the place. The museum is a must see as there are fabulous caves and exhibits to explore. We can't wait to visit Tucson again and we will definitely stay at Angie's place. She's an amazing host!!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I would say this is THE BEST AIR BNB we stayed during our vacation. Everything is absolutely beautiful and perfect.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful space, inside and out! Angie was a fantastic host, answered all of my questions and provided great recommendations. Very pleasant stay, thank you ~"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an absolutely fantastic place to stay! Beautiful, relaxing, clean and so well prepared. Stunning outdoor area, delightful interior, just as described. Cannot say enough good things about this stay. 10/10 recommend. Will definitely be back"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Angie‚Äôs casita is hands-down the best AirBnB we‚Äôve stayed at (and we‚Äôve stayed at a *lot* of AirBnBs)! It‚Äôs even more spectacular than the pictures.
The design, the attention to detail, the colors, the tile, the window seats, the decorations, the comfortable king bed, the high sloping ceilings with exposed beams, the large windows, the skylights, and the views to the amazing desert landscaping all come together perfectly in this delightful space. The craftsmanship is superior. The casita feels spacious and open and cozy and secluded all at the same time.
And the landscaping! It‚Äôs like staying in your own private Southwest botanical garden, full of gorgeous mature desert plants and decor. The cholla forest beyond the landscaped area is also impressive.
If you‚Äôre a fan of wildlife, you will not be disappointed! We saw a mourning dove chick snuggled under its mom in a nest under the patio roof and were treated to a delightful family of quail with newly hatched chicks poking around under the bushes in the morning.
But the highlight of our stay was the bobcat who casually strolled in to get a drink at the water feature while we were enjoying the evening sipping our own drinks not 20 feet away!
We are so happy to have been able to experience Angie‚Äôs spectacular setup, and can‚Äôt recommend it highly enough!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is gorgeous! It is beautiful, comfortable, and so stylish inside and out! It is also surrounded by an amazing desert garden with lots of neat bird activity that made the place feel private and peaceful. The location is very convenient to many great trails and in a lovely, quiet neighborhood. Angie was great - kind and always prompt with communication. (We also looked at her guidebook for visiting Tucson and tried many of her suggestions and they did not disappoint!!) Overall, this was a terrific place to stay and made our vacation in Tucson truly wonderful. If we are ever back in town we will stay here again!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful property, the photos don‚Äôt do it justice! We appreciated all the thoughtful touches, decor, and design. Bed was super comfy and Angie is a great host. We can‚Äôt wait to come back!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This place is simply wonderful. First of all, the fabulous garden conquered us by its magic touch.
Angie, the hostess and owner of the place is a person of very fine taste. She has a real eye for detail in everything and we really appreciated the care she takes in creating and maintaining her peaceful haven. We were sad to leave!
We would have loved to have talked beyond our brief meeting, but her schedule was too busy.
On a practical level, the house is superbly equipped with quality appliances, cookware and everything you need. The bedroom is great with a huge comfortable bed. What can I say about the bathroom with its large walk-in shower. The whole layout and decorating is done with a sense of refinement down to the smallest detail. Each window is a remarkable picture frame of nature. The outside spaces where we could have breakfast or dinner are very pleasant.
Although located in a more natural area, the location is really convenient - we are only 10 minutes away from the services and close to the center.
In conclusion, it is easy to understand that we warmly recommend Angie's house. A pure enchantment!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I just want to say for anyone who is looking to book, book now! You will NOT regret it. This place was so magical and beautiful. Such friendly messages from Angie, and I would never stay in a hotel when I come back again! This place is so open, light, and comfy. It felt right at home, I could definitely see myself living in a place like this and I‚Äôm from Ohio. Can‚Äôt wait to come back!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This truly was a desert oasis! Angie‚Äôs place was the perfect balance of ‚Äúsecluded‚Äù and ‚Äúconvenient.‚Äù In between touristy things, we enjoyed eating meals outside and relaxing in the hammock. The desert garden (and fountain!) really elevated our experience. The inside of the casita has so much charm. We found the perfect place to stay in Tucson!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Angies Airbnb is just as described. Great location, clean with all the amenities you would need, very responsive when asked a question. Will definitely stay here again."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This casita is heaven! The cactus garden is incredible, and filled with little rabbits and birds. We worked from Angie‚Äôs Casita for a couple of days and it was the perfect place for us to cook, hang out and work. Very clean, lovely decor, and great wifi. Highly recommend!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Casita was better than we could have imagined from the website- beautifully built with tilework, giant windows, and ample patio space with desert nature at your doorstep. We loved waking up to quail and wrens and, once it warmed up, hummingbirds! The kitchen was fully equipped with everything you'd need to cook for a group. Angie was incredibly welcoming and communicative. We just left and can't wait to return!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome! Basically like staying in a beautiful botanical cactus garden. Coffee out front was magic- Constant wildlife activity at the bird feeders!
Super Clean, tasteful decor and comfy bed! We did a few hikes nearby, can‚Äôt wait to return for more. Will definitely stay here again!"
,,,"Easy check in, beautiful location and home/area, lovely decor and the fountain was very nice. The room did have a foul odor, which triggered my allergies. I decided to leave and stay elsewhere and communicated this after. I‚Äôm hoping for a partial refund based on this but if not it‚Äôs okay. All the best, if I had to assume, I‚Äôd assume this is not typical or a reoccurring situation. My apologies for not communicating my grievance previous to leaving, as I‚Äôm sure you would have attempted to address it. Thank you for your time and your hospitality."
