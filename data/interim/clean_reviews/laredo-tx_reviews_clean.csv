2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Michelle was very responsive and helpful. Booking her house made more sense than booking 2 hotel rooms for our stay and the photos were exactly what we found when we opened the front door. Check in and out was very easy and the house was an easy distance to everywhere we needed to go (which was all around Laredo for a baseball tournament). I would definately book again if we ever came back to Laredo.

2024-01-01,5,Group trip,We love the place and the host was amazing
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The house is very clean and nicely decorated. The house has many wallflower plug-ins. So, while the smell is nice, it is also overwhelming. The neighborhood is quiet during the day. but quite noisy at night and in the early morning. A lot of neighbors, who seem to have lost their mufflers, enjoyed revving their engines during these hours. There is also a nearby train, but we only heard it few times. Not a complaint, but just informational, all bedrooms are upstairs. Overall, the place is really good and the host was great - I would stay again, but will bring earplugs."
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful place and location and location too!
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,A beautiful house! Surprised by how delicious the beds were! Clean house with all that I could occupy! The only thing is that I was happy to join a king size bed still rested very well!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It is a very cozy little house, very well decorated, and clean, just like what it says in the description, the price was made good for us to stay 5 people, in the showers at times cold water came out, but everything else was impeccable, comfortable spaces above all the back terrace, until it has a barbecue, the kitchen has everything you need to cook, the place is in a central area, one block from the main avenue, where there are many shops and restaurants, thank you very much to the host for always being on the lookout 🤗💜"

I loved the color and style of the place and the outdoor space in the back is absolutely lovely and so comfortable, I wish you'd post pictures of the back! there are TV's in every room and with them all being smart TV's there is plenty to watch. the kitchen is awesome and I loved the couch. the lighting is warm and inviting with plenty of options. thank you so much for letting us stay!

A true townhouse that creates a private world in the middle of town. Big city tastes throughout. Thank you for using your talents to create this beautiful space and making it available to all of us. I thought the bed was so comfy I gleefully overslept. We opted to bring back takeout meals just to be able to spend more time in this home. About 15 mins away from Quinto Sol, an excellent vegan/vegetarian restaurant."

Instructions to get inside were clear. The home is extremely well decorated with contemporary designs. The A/C worked like a charm. The water temperature and pressure were perfect. I loved the outdoor space with twinkle lights. I work remotely so I took advantage of a desk that was set up in one of the bedrooms. The wifi was excellent. We hope to be back."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place is amazing. It has everything you need to feel at home. Very clean and the area is calm and we were able to walk and attend the park which was about 2 blocks away without a problem. Everything was very close to us. Maria's service was impeccable. We appreciate the details and amenities that it left us inside the house inside the house. I definitely recommend to stay in Laredo and of course we would return. She's 100% a superhost.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,I came with my family and we really felt right at home. The place is cozy and has everything you need. had details like toys for my son or the coffee that was great! I would definitely come back.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Maria was an excellent host. She left us details to make the stay more enjoyable for my child and us , the place with plenty of privacy, the space with enough to be very comfortable.
Nearby was a park a few meters away on foot, it had games and space to walk very quiet and pleasant walking in the neighborhood. Very central to what we needed as well as the shops.
The private entrance is a lot of privacy, all clean and tidy. Maria was always on top of our needs and supporting us with recommendations of places to go, she was very flexible with schedules and accommodation.
Definitely a wonderful place to spend a quiet and comfortable stay feeling at home.!!! :) totally recommended this place. Thank you for everything Maria!!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a one night stay for a baby shower in town & although it was quick, it was very nice and homey to enjoy. Maria was very responsive & the place was just as described. Super comfortable bed & the AC cools you so fast from this Texas heat. We will definitely book again whenever we come back to visit."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My wife and I were visiting family for a few days with our cat, Passacaglia, in tow. Maria was very accommodating of all three of us, including having cat treats on the counter when we arrived. We loved that! The neighborhood felt safe, and the area was easy to navigate. The three of us enjoyed our stay, and we will definitely be back! 🐈‍⬛"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great experience in a great location. It was an absolute pleasure to stay in and would definitely come back! Check-in and check-out was very simple and parking was kindly provided in her own driveway. The host is incredibly responsive, polite, and proactive. 10/10 would recommend!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host and place was great
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We visited Laredo for Mother’s Day and we truly enjoyed our stay. The place was clean and peaceful and Maria even provided some snacks for us. I have rented other Airbnb’s in the past and I can say this is the cleanest of all. We will definitely be back when we visit Laredo again.

Quiet
Very comfortable"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Maria’s place is always spotless. I’ve stayed there twice and it is perfect for me and my two pups with enough privacy and an enclosed patio.
The little dog park a couple of blocks away is a big plus!
I love that Maria allows for parking in her driveway."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Don't hesitate. Go ahead and reserve Maria's place. Her place offers a lot of privacy and was exactly what we anticipated. Maria was kind, flexable and responsive. We didn't have to log into all of our streaming apps which I really appreciate. The guest house was cozy yet spacious. The entry way was a bit narrow so if you have a wide frame or bags that could pose a challenge but honestly there is nothing she can really do to adress that. 10/10 would recommend and come back."
2023-01-01,4,Stayed one night,Nice place
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Maria’s guesthouse was absolutely great!
I truly enjoyed my stay. It is completely equipped with all the essentials and so comfortable.
I am especially grateful to her for allowing my two pups. They are well behaved but one is a puppy and he tore one of the window blinds.
I, of course, paid for it but I cannot thank Maria enough for being so sweet and understanding.
I will definitely check the dates for my upcoming trips to Laredo to book again!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We appreciated our home base in Laredo as we were meeting friends for a short visit and then driving north to watch the eclipse. Our host was very responsive and we were grateful that she accommodated our request to drop several suitcases off and use the restroom early. We were notified that the cleaner found the dishwasher wouldn't drain, but we didn't use the kitchen much anyway and appreciated the proactive communication.
The home was comfortable and as advertised, though not our favorite area to stay in. It worked fine for what we needed and we were happy. Thanks!"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Everything very good, what we did not like were the beds, the mattresses too soft, we could not sleep well for this reason, if you like firm beds it is not an option, otherwise excellent."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We can HIGHLY recommend this property- It was exactly what we needed for our very hectic business/pleasure trip. We were able to determine this through the listing itself, as well as through contacting the host prior to making the reservation. Upon arrival, the property was exactly as described in the photos and by the hosts. The AC worked perfectly well, the restrooms were clean and functional. The internet/wifi was excellent. The TVs in the living room and Master bedroom are large (65""). The kitchen was stocked with the basic necessities to prepare a simple meal. HEB is just across the street. Several restaurants are very close. The accents and furniture are tasteful. Very cozy by our standards.
We were able to rest and relax. It was literally a PERFECT stay. Thank you Amalia and Jorge for being perfect hosts."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Easy check in. Tons of towels to use throughout the stay. Nice bedrooms and nice linens. Close to tons of restaurants and shopping centers. Friendly host and gave clear instructions for the property.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very convenient to the mall and restaurants. Also helpful that an HEB is one block away. There was plenty of room for my family of 5 and 2.5 bathrooms made it more comfortable for everyone. My only suggestion would be to maybe add TV's to the guest rooms but otherwise it was a very pleasant stay and I will definitely book again when going back to Laredo.
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"The place was lovely, comfortable and clean, we really enjoyed our stay and definitely go back!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Newly remodeled house , pretty good space and nicely decorated"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amalia’s place is absolutely amazing! We drove in tired and late not expecting much but once inside, we found the place clean and beautifully decorated with everything we needed to feel right at home. The owner didn’t skimp on providing good organic keurig coffee, bottled water, and high quality soaps and toiletries. The place has huge tv’s, super comfortable beds, extra blankets and plenty of fluffy cotton towels. She also provided soaps for the laundry and dishwasher but we didn’t use those appliances as it was a short stay. The location is in front of a highly trafficked street so some noice will be heard but nothing intolerable. The bathrooms have good water pressure and plenty of natural light throughout. One thing worth mentioning is that it’s on the second floor and the condo is two stories so there’s plenty of stairs to climb. Overall, we were very impressed and delighted with our stay and highly recommend Amalias place. Special thanks to Jorge for all his help and attention."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was new and beautiful. Everything was super comfortable. Amalia is a nice host. Parking was not respected by other apartment guests but that is not her fault. Would have liked if it had tv in every room. Beds were comfortable. And the place was super clean.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved my stay. Amalia and Jorge were amazing hosts and made sure my every need was taken care of! The place was immaculately clean and smelled wonderful. This was one of my most comfortable stays at an Air BnB

2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Second time we stay here! Always clean and good communication.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,0-10. 9
2022-01-01,3,Stayed one night,"So, to be fair the place itself was very neat. The beds were comfy, and the host was very helpful and communicative. I wrestled between giving this place 4 stars but ultimately settled on 3 for the following reasons:
1) I reserved what was marketed on the app as an “entire place”. Now, I’m sure technically it might count but in truth, it was a garage that had been remodeled into an apartment space. While it did have a little kitchenette, and a restroom of its own (aka I didn’t share a space with the family of the attached house) it did have a wall that connected with the home. So it felt more like a private room than an entire place to myself. It was a bit odd to pull up to a home with cars in the driveway and realize that this was basically a detached area semi connected to the house. So I’m not sure if that’s something I missed on my end or not, but definitely wouldn’t recommend if you’re looking for an entire place to yourself.
2) The heater didn’t work and it dipped into the 40s at night.
3) There are a lot of dogs in the neighborhood and anytime someone was outside they would go crazy barking. Woke me up a few times throughout the night.
Again, to be fair the host was awesome and the space was nice. Just not what I thought it was."

And, if arriving at night, the street is very dark, don’t pull directly into the complex, the unit is the very first one on the street. We drove around for a bit in the complex. Maybe that was our own oversight and being tired, but there’s the note if it helps anyone unsure of where the unit is located.

2023-02-01,5,Group trip,Great place! The 4 of us had ample room. We were in town for a baseball tournament. The house was centrally located. Nice place!
2023-02-01,4,Group trip,"The stay worked out well for a family of 7. Host was always available when needed. Home was very spacious & beds were comfortable. A few things that could be improved to receive a 5 star review would be the following: more linens & blankets. Stain-free comforters & furniture. En suite bathroom needs a mirror that’s mounted to be able to see your head for makeup/hair. It was not usable. Some lamps didn’t work. Also tv’s in the bedrooms would’ve been a nice touch. Other than that, our stay was great. It served our needs."

2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"We came to Laredo to visit family. Annibal’s house was exactly what we were looking for. Everyone had their own bedroom and bathroom, and the kitchen/dinning area was large enough to accommodate all of us. We spent the majority of our time around the pool and hanging out in the gazebo. Restaurants and shopping are very close by. A very large storm came through the night before we got there, and did some major damage in the neighborhood. Annibal got in contact with us right away and went above and beyond to get the storm debris cleaned up and the pool ready for us. He was very quick to respond to any questions we had. We would definitely stay with him again!!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I would recommend this place to anyone traveling to Laredo, with the heat the pool was excellent for the kids, and the outdoor areas were perfect for entertaining the family that came by. It was the ideal spot for all the local families to drop by and for us to visit from. Over All Very Outstanding!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Thanks to Annibal’s home, me and my family where able to create a beautiful memory for my fathers 63rd birthday. Annibal was an excellent host and addressed any concerns I might have had. The check in process was super easy and he allowed for us to have a late check out. The home is big and spacious and is able to accommodate any big family. Whenever me and my family are back in town we will be reaching out to enjoy the home again."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Annibal was amazing ! I was in for my daughter’s wedding with several people in our party! He was able to accommodate everything we asked and checked in multiple times to see if there was anything we needed! Very impressive! Thanks for everything!!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay was comfortable.
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Overall we had a good stay, plenty of room for our large family. The house had quite a few amenities and the location was surrounded by lots of food places. It was quiet. I wish the pool would have been cleaned. Although we were told it was cleaned that morning and it was due to the rain making it cloudy. The kids still got in but it was a little too murky for me I like to see the bottom and to be able to tell what's in a pool. The furniture was outdated and felt completely uncomfortable to sit on and we had a few issues with the log in for a couple of the bedrooms were we had to use our own Netflix log in because we kept getting an error message stating the account was not authorized on that particular tv even though it was on the same wifi in the house. The bathrooms and floor could have been cleaned a little better. We had to keep shoes on the children and throw away nasty socks. However, we did have plenty of linens so that helped."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Spacious house, good for a group. Needs some maintenance and TLC, including fixing a broken window in the kitchen/living area.
Otherwise, the space matched the listing description and slept a large group easily. Annibal was a responsive host."

It was the perfect home for a family of our size. I am most definitely coming back ."

Loved the fact he set up a Christmas tree and lights to make us feel at home away from home😊❤️"
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"My team and I traveled for a work project the week of November 7th. We had previously rented some smaller home as I had sent a three or four member team. I had thought we were going to have to rent two homes, but found this place with just enough space so team members could enjoy their own room. According to the team members that had traveled previously, this was the most comfortable. We enjoyed the spacious home with enough bedrooms and restrooms for my team. We booked it for the week of the 14th as well. Although we did not get to enjoy the backyard as much as what we would have liked, I noticed there where both gas, charcoal and wood burning grills available. Annibal communicated well prior to the stays and during the stays to make sure everything was ok. He even offered a late check out if needed which for the first week was well welcomed since we had to work half a day. This gave us time to come back to shower and pack before our 6.5 hour drive back to Dallas/Fort Worth."

2020-06-01,5,Group trip,Annibal is an amazing host with the best communication. The house is very spacious and easily accommodated my family group of 8.

The kitchen is stocked with all the essentials and made for a good location for cooking, the bed was very comfortable, and the tv is equipped with Roku. We couldn’t have asked for a better place! Thanks, Annibal!!"

2019-12-01,5,Group trip,Great host. Annibal was on the lookout the whole time we were at the house. The property is very large and spacious literal 5 minutes from the mall. I highly recommend it.
2019-11-01,5,Group trip,"My family and I stayed here and celebrated early Thanksgiving with my father. Very spacious, cozy, great location and great price, able to accommodate a large family. Host was very welcoming and helpful. Will definitely stay here again."

2019-10-01,5,Group trip,This house is amazing. Every room has its own restroom which made every one of our family feel comfortable. The hospitality we received was great. Definitely one of the best place we have ever stayed at. Rooms are a decent size with great closet space. Definitely recommend this house for family bonding vacation.
2019-10-01,5,Group trip,We had a wonderful visit. My family was in town for a funeral and having this home to gather at was such a blessing. The hosts we're so patient with our difficult schedule and so very kind.
2019-09-01,5,Group trip,Great location and plenty of room.
2019-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is the second time my family and I have been to Annibal’s house. Every time that we have been there everything is extremely clean and he is quick to respond to our messages. Pool is clean and the backyard is perfect for grilling. The amount of room and beds + the crib and bassinet made it easy for my large family to stay there, and with 2 small infants! We will definitely be back when we make our way to Laredo."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,House and accommodations were incredible and I would highly recommend staying here. I will be visiting again soon..
2019-08-01,5,Group trip,Great place! Just as nice as it looks in the photos.
2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"You can expect to find this home as described in the listing. The home is clean, large, and and all guests will enjoy their own private bathrooms. I have a large family and the adults were comfortably seated indoors while the children had fun in the pool under the safe watch through the glass doors and windows. The beds are extremely comfortable. I learned Annibal replaced the mattresses with Purple mattresses which I've heard of before but never actually laid on one. Well, I am a convert and plan to replace mine at home with Purple. My mother-in-law, brother, and sister-in-law (and their children) who shared the home also felt the same. The home is easily accessible from I-35 and about a 10-15 minute drive from the airport. The neighborhood is quiet. I recommend this listing for large families and would definitely consider booking this one again in future visits to Laredo."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,If you want a big house close to the mall and shopping and close to restaurants and has a pool this is it every bedroom has its own restroom/shower this is it look no further and host goes above and beyond your expectations definitely will stay here again.
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent house, excellent host"
2019-07-01,5,Group trip,"Thanks Annibal. The inside space was huge and very comfortable, everyone had plenty of room. Bathrooms are very nice. TV room is huge. Living areas large. Host was very accessible."

2019-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved our stay! You definitely feel at home! The house was absolutely clean. The beds were so comfortable. I definitely recommend this house to anyone with a large family or small group.
2019-06-01,5,Group trip,"Spacious, looks small from the outside but big in the inside."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It's a beautiful house with all the amenities you need and more. I definitely recommend staying there. We came in town for a funeral and were able to accommodate a lot of our family. I hope to stay there again in the near future. The host was Awesome!
2019-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is great. I did not have to worry about anything since their host details and amenities are more than I expected. It is more comfortable than having to rent several rooms in a hotel and much nicer. Will stay there again with my family when visiting.
2019-05-01,5,Group trip,"Great place, clean and spacious
Great location
Excellent back yard pool and patio
Annibal was a Fantastic host."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our first Airbnb experience and it was beyond our expectations I want to express my gratitude to Annibal because he is an excellent host. He made sure in all ways that we had everything we needed to make the best of our stay.
The house is in excellent condition and is very specious, we had a family reunion and we all had different spaces to talk and to enjoy ourselves, the bedrooms are very big, including a bathroom for each one of the bedrooms and I wanted to point out how confortable the beds are.
The kitchen is very well equipped I can’t think of anything that we needed because we had it all. We didn’t had to much time to watch tv but the kids enjoyed Netflix, also the kids swam al little bit but the weather wasn’t ideal for the water to be warm enough to be there for long but I will say it’s a very nice pool and the barbecue area is very specious as well.
Overall our experience was amazing and if we go again to Laredo we would love to stay again in this house.
Thank you so much Annibal for everything we had a great time at your place.
If you are considering staying at this house don’t hesitate because overall it was an amazing stay. Hope you have the same experience as we did."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If anyone is looking for a big place, look no further. Annibal is an excellent host. My entire family felt they were at home. A place will stay at again."
2019-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Annibal was very nice and informative about his house. The house was extremely clean, beautiful and truly made us feel at home!

2019-03-01,5,Group trip,"We travel as a 6 man team and this was probably the best house we have ever used. It was clean and cool, the communication was impeccable and there was a bathroom for every person!

Very clean and would absolutely come back!"

2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house is great for big families. The bedrooms each have their own restroom which really makes it so accommodating. There is no restroom outside of the bedrooms for additional guests. There is one that could be used for guests that is connected to one of the children’s bedrooms. It’s like a jack & Jill sort of setup.
The neighborhood is quiet & friendly."
2018-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place with tons of space. Perfect for family gatherings.
2018-06-01,5,Group trip,This host is amazing. Truly a wonderful stay. He even included complimentary beer and soda!
2018-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was awesome. The pool was so much fun and was so nice to have with the Laredo heat. Everything was clean and working. We had tons of space to move around with the kids. Each room was like its own little suite. We would definitely book this place again!!
2018-05-01,5,Group trip,Just a great house in a good location within Laredo. The owner is very nice and was great to interact with. Each room having its own bathroom was a huge plus along with the open kitchen. The outside pool was nice to sit around at night. The house was very clean and comfortable.
2018-04-01,5,Group trip,"This is a great place for a large group- there were 11 of us and we were all accommodated very well. Everything is in the house for a comfortable stay and it is very well appointed. The pool is fantastic along with the covered area where the Barbecue is located. The house location is very central in Laredo- only a few minutes to shopping, eating places, the Old Town etc. Also the price is very reasonable for a group. The owner responded quickly to a small problem and fixed it immediately- very important in these type of rentals. We will return to Laredo and stay here again if it is available."
2018-04-01,5,Group trip,Loved it
2018-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at Annibal's house for 4 nights with my family including a 5 years old baby. The house is very comfortable and perfect of a big group. Each room has its privacy and en suite bathroom. The back yard is very nice for entertainment.
The house is very close to the mall that is very convenient for last minute grocery shopping even at the middle of the night since Walmart is 24 hours open! This huge house is very clean with all what you will need in the kitchen.
I highly recommended this place for a very enjoyable stay in Laredo! In addition, Annibal was very responsive 24 hours a day before our trip and during our trip!!! Our stay at Annibal's house could not be better."
2018-03-01,5,Group trip,"Annibal was an excellent host and communicated frequently in a friendly and completely approachable manner. My family’s vacation to Laredo was made extra special because he allowed us to stay in his beautiful, spacious home! We cannot wait to come back and stay with him again!"
2018-03-01,5,Group trip,Fantastic memories! My family had their first reunion here and loved it! My dad uses a walker and this house was perfect for him. Do not hesitate to stay here!
2018-02-01,5,Group trip,"This house was immaculate and the host was excellent at communicating in a timely manner. Really appreciated how attentive he was and went above and beyond to accommodate us.
We were very comfortable and felt right at home."
2018-02-01,5,Group trip,"IF YOU’RE READING THIS, DON’T HESITATE! This is the best air bnb I’ve ever stayed at and it has everything you could possibly need. The price per person, per night breaks down to way cheaper than a cheap motel, and you get to live like a king.
The property is in a super quiet neighborhood, the house itself is beautiful and well taken care of. There are plenty of places to sit and be social, eat, watch television (he had many streaming choices available as well as good and fast WiFi!). All the rooms were spacious and had their own bathrooms, the towels were SUPER SOFT, and everything was super clean and there was no auxiliary clutter in the home. The decor is tasteful and not overbearing. the Pool is beautiful and there’s a few chairs back there so you can lay out. Also a gazebo with patio furniture and I think there was a grill too, but we didn’t use it.
The house even has 2 thermostats, a room that works for kids and babies, and the front living room has a door that closes and a pullout couch making it another sleepable room. I took this room and was more than comfortable.
I’m already looking into the dates we’ll be in laredo next year so we can book this place again.
10/10, A+++, perfectamundo!"
2018-01-01,5,Group trip,The house is huge and convenient for large parties. Very spacious and clean. My family and I had an amazing time and experience at Annibal's house.

2017-11-01,5,Group trip,Very nice home and hospitality by Annibal. A great place for families.
2017-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Host was great, had a relaxing stay. There was so much space , enough rooms and bathrooms . In a good quiet neighborhood . Right around the Corner from the mall . When we re visit Laredo we will definitely re book here."
2017-10-01,5,Group trip,"Host was extremely easy to work with, facility was great, space is huge, and proximity was perfect. It truly was a ""home away from home""."
2017-10-01,5,Group trip,"Great home away from hone, proximity is perfect. Access to everything, just minutes away! Recently upgraded and very spacious!"
2017-10-01,5,Group trip,Great accommodation and location. Home has been recently upgraded and has that home away from home atmosphere and feeling. Spacious bedrooms and huge TV in den. Recommend highly for a family or group booking.
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was the perfect place for our team to set up shop for the week. The pool was great and such a treat that everyone had their own private bathroom (5 people).
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Annibal's home for five nights and absolutely loved it. Small issues with the AC and pool, but nothing he didn't rush over to fix (probably due to us being his first visitors, I think). He was attentive and friendly and allowed us to check in and check out at the times that were most convenient for us. Our party was rather large - 5 adults, 3 teenagers, and 4 kids and we all fit very comfortably! This home made our softball tournament trip much more comfortable! Highly recommended - Thanks, Annibal!"
