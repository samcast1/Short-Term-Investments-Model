2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is fantastic, and Larry is a wonderful host - friendly, helpful, and responsive. The place was perfect for my two-day stay, but I could have stayed much longer if needed. It has everything you need and it was spotless when I arrived. I debated between this place and another location, and after seeing both in person, I'm really happy that I chose this place. I'll book this stay again anytime I return to Enterprise. Thank you, Larry, for a great stay!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"‘The Sanctuary’ – Another One of Larry’s Must See / Stay at properties!
I thoroughly enjoyed staying at this lovely, comfortable, secluded, peaceful and fully-equipped rental. Not only does this rental include all the large/small appliances (i.e. washer/dryer, microwave, etc.), the Host has also anticipated the needs of his Guests, exquisitely I might add, by paying close attention to the small details: i.e. – designated/free parking, bottled water, make-up remover wipes, a Guidebook, written details regarding heating/cooling, Wi-Fi access, card games and even old-school board games (i.e. Trouble, Chutes & Ladders).
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND staying at The Sanctuary, and/or one of Larry’s other properties, as well. You’ll be glad you did!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Larry’s place was just what I needed for some peace and quiet.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We arrived in the dark, and Larry met us to give us some instructions. He then escorted us to the apartment and explained the lock system, the heating system and the cargo lift. This was valuable information to us.
I was able to use the apartment kitchen to make my Thanksgiving sides for the dinner at my daughter’s a short drive away. Everything worked so well in the kitchen for me.
The apartment is decorated with a couch in my favorite color, red. That was a plus! The bed was comfy and the shower water pressure was amazing. This is a place we want to return to for another visit.
We recommend the restaurant, The Barrel Room, if you visit Enterprise."

We were visiting to verify we want to come back and we will definitely be moving back ASAP. Thank you Larry!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location, very peaceful. Keep in mind, you do share a porch with the other guests right next to you so may not be as private as you think.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I cannot speak highly enough about my stay at the Sanctuary, and about the host, Larry. Our stay has been longer than expected and Larry has been extremely accommodating and responsive as host. The Sanctuary is well-appointed and extremely clean and the area itself is worth the drive.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was impeccably clean and Larry included so many little things that made the stay extra smooth like makeup remover wipes in the bathroom, extra towels and bedding, dishwasher and dishwashing detergent, coffee and a personalized keypad check-in - just to name a few things. The covered carport and motion sensor lights made getting in and out super convenient and instructions were clear. I also appreciated the binder inside the place with recommendations around town. I'd 100% come again and stay here!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The sanctuary was awesome. it's perfect if by yourself or even a couple.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I've been blessed I suppose to have had many great experiences with Airbnbs all over the country, and Larry's place was no exception. Of all the places I have had the pleasure to stay, Larry may be the best communicator of all the hosts I've had, his stay may easily be the best value, and his process and facility ranks among the most professional I have experienced. the location is just a little outside of town, quiet, but not too distant. The apartment was modern, well appointed, and spotless. I will look to stay again if ever in the area."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We will definitely stay again. The absolute best we have stayed in so far. I LOVED the kitchen and the kitties.

We will definitely be using his place again in the future."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Larry was a great host. The Sanctuary was great. although we didn't cook, the kitchen was well furnished with great appliances.

Eagle stadium is 25 min away and Donaldson Park is 5 minutes away. There were several restaurants to choose from. Larry provides pots, pans, utensils to cook if you prefer. I highly recommend a stay in this cute country setting!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is Immaculate the host has thought of everything look forward to lodging here again … your gps will have stop about 1/3 of a mile before the Airbnb just look for the gray barn down the road

He was always super fast to respond, very approachable for anything, and even went above and beyond to offer us assistance. The apartment was clean and well located. It was very comfortable and the cargo lift was super convenient considering we had a ton of luggage! We loved the automatic lock on the door and the key code system so that we did not have to worry about losing a physical key. Parking was really good, we managed to fit two cars in to the lot. All in all, we would recommend this place to anyone in a heartbeat! Thank you very much Larry!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place! Super clean, well kept, and cozy. Quiet location made it easy to relax There was a minor hiccup with parking the first night we were there.

It was an amazing place. We would absolutely stay here again"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my third time staying in one of Larry's spaces. You can tell he's thought of everything - cleanliness, appliances, cooling, channel choices, hybrid charging, etc. It's quiet, pretty, and relaxing."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Larry's place is very well organized, very high quality, designed very nicely, own separated space away from the main house, he puts a lot of effort to makes you feel very comfortble. No doubt we woukd stay again at Larry's place."

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This Airbnb was a little secluded off the main part of the city but close enough to not have to drive a distance. The home was perfect— clean floors, a cozy bathroom and bedroom, perfectly placed couch and tv distance with a cute kitchen table just perfect for my girlfriend and I. The tub was amazing and the bathroom was perfectly spaced and everything felt so spacious. The addition of a washer and dryer made the entire stay feel even more like home. Larry has a cat that foals around outside and waking up to go to work to see a little cat rub up against your leg made it feel so much more blissful. The parking was spacious and perfectly placed under shelter. It rained so hard and nothing was wet: the car, the porch, the door or stairs— everything has been built to a good standard and the entire trip made me feel like a was home away from home and it was only 95 miles away from the beach! You HAVE to stay here, you will NOT regret it, I promise you!"

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I'm hard pressed to find any real negative things about this spot that aren't just personal preferences. The rental was exactly as advertised and the host very easy to work with.

I will be visiting this area again in the future and I'll be checking Larry's rentals before I look anywhere else.

I really appreciated the extra towels, blankets, and linens that were available to us because that's not the case for every AirBnB. I also loved all the custom signs inside & out of the place. It was super comfy and cozy for us. We'll definitely look to stay at one of his properties anytime we come to Enterprise to visit my hubby's family. Thanks again for having us, Larry!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Larry's airbnb was one of the best lodging experiences I ever had! As a frequent traveler, I have seen the gamut of good and bad hotels and similar temporary lodgings. Larry's airbnb experience easily stood head and shoulders above almost all of those experiences! Larry and his family were helpful, attentive, and supportive during the stay. The rooms themselves were superbly maintained, clean, and easy to live in. The price per night was reasonable; in fact, given the quality of the lodgings, it was outstanding. I cannot emphasize enough how good of an experience this was. 5/5 stars- I would definitely recommend Larry's airbnb to anyone interested in a high quality lodging experience!"

The kitchen has all you need--(besides the dishes, pans and flatware,) a stove, microwave, toaster oven, k-cup coffeemaker and a full size fridge with an icemaker. The queen bed is in great shape. We didn't need to use the washer or dryer, but they are full size too!
The apartment is on the second floor, and the owner has installed a cargo (cargo, not people) lift, so you don't have to carry your stuff up the stairs. It's a quiet neighborhood and the owner is very attentive; he communicated a lot and checked in to see if we needed anything.
If we ever get back to Enterprise, we will definitely want to stay here!"

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This location was both beautiful and quiet. The bed slept great and there was WiFi! Everything you could possibly need was provided and thought of.

2021-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Great place
2021-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Larry’s place was exceptionally clean the location and the amenities were great.
The Host greeted me as I drove up and parked, which was extremely thoughtful...
The only two negative things I have to say about this listing, was when you get in and out of the bed in the bedroom it made a lot of noise, and on the second day we were there the dish detergent in the Dispenser ran out, so Unfortunately I had to use the soft soap that was located in the bathroom. But, Otherwise than that I would stay here again."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Larry's apartment was perfect for my wife and I while we were taking care of business in the Enterprise area. Had everything we needed and was only a few minutes away from all the places we had to go. The apartment was super clean, spacious, comfortable, and had many thoughtful and convenient amenities.

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet, clean, comfortable - if you want a relaxing stay this is a great pick! It isn't right in town but it is close to most anything you would need. You will not be cramped in this apartment, it's very roomy. His place is in a quiet residential neighborhood that will make you want to sit on the porch and get lost in thought while enjoying the breeze. There's a country feel but you aren't in the boonies. The apartment is clean, the tub is deep and there's a full-sized stove, refrigerator, washer and dryer. I cannot think of one thing to complain about. Really enjoyed my stay!"

2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Larry's place ranks as one of the top Air B&B's we have ever stayed at. It is super clean and spacious. There are two TV's so you can watch in either living room or bedroom. The apartment has a dual zone heating and air conditioning system with remotes so you can change the temperature from the bed and in the living room/kitchen. The washer and dryer are located in the bedroom closet which was super nice. The bbq grill was nice and we cooked out twice during our week stay. We really enjoyed the freight lift and used it bringing our luggage and other stuff for the week up to the apartment. The apartment is nice and quiet and Larry's place is located on a street that dead ends so there isn't much traffic or noise. You have pretty much anything you could possibly need here with a fully furnished kitchen, regular coffee pot, Keurig style coffee pot, fridge with icemaker, electric range and even a dishwasher. We had a very comfortable and pleasant stay and would highly recommend it!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Appreciate the attention to cleanliness and comfort. Excellent communication, too."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We travel a lot, and I've entered many Airbnb. I long to be able to enter then relax. Unfortunately, because of my work in the construction industry, my eye for detail and workmanship keeps me from just being. I tend to see everything(bad). I'm sure its mental. Entering this home gave me a unique opportunity to both relax and respect great workmanship. Everything from the rustic log cabin interior to the floor elevation change in the kitchen just so a set of stairs wouldn't look out of place reaching the second-floor kid's loft. Trimming every nook and softening every angle. Knock down ceilings with a flawless 45-degree corner bead. Little lanterns hardwired for accent lighting. Ductless splits installed level and tight to the wall. As one old timer told me years ago. ""If you have no pride in what you're doing, you'll have no shame in doing it poorly."". This home is unique in that way, (forgiving the tile, lol) and it was a pleasure to stay in. Quiet, cozy and relaxing. Thanks again!."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Larry was amazing. He met us when we arrived. Very helpful. We will be coming back.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"10/10 would rent here again! The place wasn’t hard to find. Larry provided great instructions on how to get there and how to get inside the apartment. And provided us with a pack n play for the baby! When we walked in we were all pleasantly surprised to see how nice the apartment was! My kids absolutely loved the bedroom space and were so excited about the way it was set up. The pictures don’t do it justice, it looks so much nicer than what you see in the photos. Larry is also a very courteous host and made sure that we were okay with activities he would be doing before doing them. I definitely recommend choosing him for your stay and we absolutely loved the clubhouse!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is our 4th stay (at least) in Larry’s Clubhouse. It’s perfect for me, my husband, and 10 year old to stay. The pictures do not do it justice at all. Well kept, clean, and my daughter LOVES the games and the upstairs loft and secret hideaway. We stay here twice a year or more and it remains just as clean as when it was a new listing! Highly recommend."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was very clean and beautiful. It was a pleasure staying here, definitely will be back again. We saw Larry a few times and he was very nice and spoke everytime. A extra plus for the elevator, saved me from bringing the groceries and luggage up and down."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"‘The Clubhouse’ – An Absolute Must See!
I have had the good fortune of staying at all 3 of Larry’s properties, which are uniquely beautiful in their own way. BUT, I must say that this is, by far, the most well-thought-out and creatively designed rental property that I have ever stayed at. Not only is it aesthetically pleasing with its woodworking style, creativity, design and layout, it is also fully functional / equipped, modern, elegant, comfortable and clearly focuses on the needs of the Guests, by providing a much appreciated attention to detail, in order to ensure all the comforts of home, and then some.
The carpentry, rustic, yet comfortable, furniture and décor, coupled with the modern and elegantly styled kitchen, with all the amenities and appliances (small and large), make it an ideal accommodation, which can be appreciated by both men, women and children alike.
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND staying at The Clubhouse, for both short and long-term stays. You’ll be glad you did."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A nice, clean, and comfortable place for my wife and I to stay while visiting family. Everything was as expected and true to listing."

The attention to detail in the layout, the decor, and amenities really stood out. The owner takes great care to provide all the things one would like away from home. It was only a few minutes from town which we didn’t mind at all! It was much better than a hotel room. Enjoyed visiting the sweet cat and hummingbirds in the morning while having coffee to! Larry thought of everything, we will be visiting a few times in the next year and look forward to being repeat customers!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second trip to The Clubhouse, as our last stay instantly made it one of our favorite rentals. I was in town to visit family with my daughter, and it was just as we remembered it-clean, well-appointed, nicely decorated, and extremely peaceful. The rental provided everything we needed for our stay and was super-convenient for everything we did in our time in the area. Also, as before, Larry communicated with us the check-in and check-out details and any other pertinent messages in a timely manner. We will be back again on our next visit to the area."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Clubhouse is one of the cleanest air bnb’s I’ve ever stayed in. You can definitely tell Larry is invested into every last detail in the Clubhouse. Larry was super nice and his response time to messages was almost instant. His instructions were very clear. He even had a binder with local places to eat (with the best comments listed underneath). He also has a cat named Lucy that loves to come around and say hi, especially in the morning. If I ever go back to Enterprise Alabama I will definitely be looking to stay in the Clubhouse."

The woodworking, lighting, and decorations were amazing, and all weekend long, we were finding new ""little surprises"" to marvel at. The place was extremely well-appointed, and it was super convenient for everything that we did. The setting that it is in is wonderful as well. A quiet and beautiful country surrounding as viewed from the porch, was the perfect setting to start my day with a cup of coffee, and the tv with surround sound in the living area was the perfect place to finish it. We came away highly impressed and happy with our time spent here"

All the comforts of home were thought of and appliances and electronics were top notch. There was every kind of pot or pan you could want, all kinds of utensils and even a blender! No need was overlooked. It was by far the cleanest Air B&B we have ever stayed at. Even the trash can was spotless! There are a couple steps up to the kitchen/bathroom area and then a couple down to the master bedroom. Not a problem but just wanted to let folks know as I didn’t see them in the picture. Would definitely stay in any of Larry’s properties again. It was excellent!"

Both properties have been exactly as described, with all listed amenities. We felt immediately at home at both properties, and it truly a great value for all the space and privacy you get.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We weren't really there much to explore all the amenities but if we wanted to use the kitchen it had what you needed to stay in and cook. The kids liked it and it was comfortable. We were there for a pageant that kept us from sun up to sun down, we opted for the air bnb because it gave our daughter a break from the pageant she wouldn't of had If we'd of stayed at the host hotel. So it was perfect for our needs and is about 15 minutes from the Enterprise Civic Center."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just a tad bit congested in this area with people parking on the narrow streets, however the area is extremely quiet. I suspect that there are a lot of military due to the close proximity to base, which is most likely the reason for the congestion. I really enjoyed the stay. Loved having access to the garage remote! My last place didn't have one and I had to keep getting in and out of the car in the cold. The place was extremely clean, plenty of space. Sylvia is very responsive, and does so in a timely manner. I definitely recommend and look forward to booking again."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an outstanding townhouse and location. Several things all played into the 5 star rating. First the townhouse: it was clean, tidy, well appointed and everything was as promised. Two very large bedrooms and large actually doesn’t describe their size well enough. A small but well stocked kitchen and dining table was perfect for breakfasts at the house. We were fortunate to have access to the garage and that was such a plus. Second the communication: absolutely outstanding. Not just timely communications but everything was followed up with another note. A question we had was replied to within 30 minutes. We really felt that anything we needed would be accommodated if possible. Third is location: if you are there to access Fort Rucker you are less than 5 minutes to one of the gates. We were there for our son’s graduation from flight school and this was PERFECT. Plus we were closer to downtown Enterprise which was nice since it’s such a quaint town. We HIGHLY recommend Sylvia’s AirBNB!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We booked Christy's place and it turned out to be a fantastic stay. We were visiting family in the area and looked for a place that was close to Fort Novosel. Christy's place was a perfect place as a daily launching place for our visit. The suite was only minutes from the base, was very clean and the bed was comfortable. The kitchenette worked well for us as we only had a quick breakfast in the morning and didn't return to the suite until much later in the evening. The suite is spacious and my wife and the bedroom privacy is ensured with a door separating the bedroom from the rest of the suite. Plenty of room for two, we really enjoyed the stay and look forward to booking again for our next visit to the area.
Christy is truly a Superhost! It is obvious that she takes pride in her suite and cares for those who choose to stay here. Great communications, easy check-in and check-out and very respectful of privacy, I wish that I could give more than 5 stars for Christy. Thanks!"

2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"It was very nice, however, no utensils except forks to eat with. There was a hot plate but nothing to cook with. Other than that a very nice and quiet place at the end of a cul-de-sac."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Christy was an amazing host. There was a fan (white noise machine) and an AC unit in case it got warm. Which I always sleep with a fan so it was nice to have the noise. I had an overnight flight and they were generous enough to let me check in earlier. I slept great free of distractions. I loved the extra light at the mirror in the bathroom to help get ready. It was only 5 minutes from Ft Rucker. They had a bookshelf with some books, that if I had time, I would have enjoyed to read. I also love how the couch/loveseat rocked. If I ever go back to Dothan I will definitely request to stay here. Oh and another bonus is they let you park under the carport right next to the door. They even had a diffuser which I use essential oils daily so having that option was amazing to be able to make it feel more like home."

We arrived after dark but the entryway and front door was very well lit which made our entrance to the house very easy and safe. The whole property had only small steps at the thresholds which was great for my octogenarian parents with limited mobility. We had access to the double door garage which was very nice and rare. We were happy to be able to park in the garage for added security. Also, the hosts have a treadmill and weight bench in the garage which was nice as an option for those dedicated to working out or walking/running even on rainy days. The house and furnishings were immaculate and tasteful. The home has a supply of games and activities for kids and families. The neighborhood was very walkable and clean.

We enjoyed the private checkin into our cozy, cute private Airbnb & the covered parking was a plus. The fridge was stocked with cold water, sodas and snacks were welcoming as we had been driving for hours. We eventually had a glass of wine while sitting on the porch and the birds were singing and the view was very nice. We both slept well and then enjoyed a cup of coffee before checking out.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Nice place
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Reserved this location at a discounted rate of $79 a night. The location is quiet and peaceful. The new appliances in the kitchen are nice but unfortunately overloaded the houses electrical system and popped the circuit breaker when using the stovetop and microwave at the same time. The rooms are well furnished but had some dirty surfaces. The only issue with sleeping is the occasional squirrel in the wall. The owner tried to keep them out with a deterring spray but it only kept them out for one night. Overall a good experience considering the price and amenities available.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family & I stayed at this location for three nights - four days over this past weekend. Eric & his wife were very helpful for all of our needs during this stay. The home was fully stocked upon arrival with everything you or your family would need for an over night stay/weekend! From kitchen appliances, laundry supplies, toiletries…everything was fully stocked!! I especially loved the goodie basket placed on the kitchen counter upon arrival! I didn’t take any pictures of the home during our stay, but the pictures posted on this website are accurate! The beds were very comfortable & the home was very clean/warm! My family & I will definitely stay here again while visiting the area. 10 out of 10 & was a win ❤️"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Sylvia was the best host I’ve had on Airbnb and the listing was absolutely A-mazing- we even stayed an extra day. There were commodities available from hygiene to cooking to cleaning. She made sure check in went smoothly and that there were no issues during our stay. If I ever am back in the area- Sylvia will be my choice- not to mention she has more than one listing available so that makes it’s even better. If you’re looking for a great experience- she is the one.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was very pleased at how my son and I felt at home in this townhouse. The location was close to Ft Novosel which was convenient.
When I look at a place, one of the first things I take notice of is if the bathrooms are clean….never once did I have to clean the bathrooms or anything else prior to using.
I ask a question or two through the Airbnb app and received a response almost instantly.

Well done, Sylvia! I would stay again!
5 Stars!"

Everything you needed was already in the airbnb to accommodate you with your stay.. It’s very quiet you could literally walk out and hear a pen drop. Whenever, I visit again I will most definitely be booking with her again. We have no regrets an we were very pleased with our stay. We drove 6hrs from Memphis ,Tn for my sister’s baby shower.

The place was in great conditon, and perfect for our visit to our kids, who are stationed at Ft. Novosel, AL. The 2 BR, 2.5 BA was big enough, and private enough for a quiet peaceful stay. The unit was freshly updated had everything we needed to make it a comfortable stay. We appreciated the map of where people had come from to stay here, as well as the guest register for a special touch.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Of course! Here's a kind review you can use for Airbnb and owner Sylvia:
---
I had the most wonderful stay at Sylvia's Airbnb! From the moment I arrived, I felt welcomed and at home. Sylvia is not just a host; she's a true gem who goes above and beyond to ensure her guests have a fantastic experience.
The accommodations were immaculate, and the attention to detail was remarkable. The cozy bedroom, well-equipped kitchen, and charming living space made my stay incredibly comfortable. Sylvia's home is a true oasis of comfort and relaxation.
What truly sets this Airbnb apart is Sylvia herself. She's not just a host; she's a warm and caring person who genuinely cares about her guests.
I can't thank Sylvia enough for her hospitality and kindness. This Airbnb experience exceeded all my expectations, and I can't wait to return!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay and close to the Base Gate, the purpose of the stay. House was easy to find and easy to access and was nice not to have to carry keys around with us during our stay. Kitchen had everything we needed, as well as the bathrooms. Bath towels were plenty and clean! Beds were comfortable and a TV in every room was really nice! We even enjoyed the pool one day. Morning walks through he neighborhood were glorious and relaxing with the beautiful vegetation and foliage as well as the wildlife. Would highly recommend a stay at this property! We loved it!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Sylvia was delightful and very helpfull. She let us check in much earlier than the shown time and remotely let me in after I made a mistake with the entry code. The place itself is exactly as described and very well kept with lots of supplies for guests like condiments, board games, coffee and toiletries. It really felt like a second home rather than a rental. Loved the ""cinema"" themed living room. Much obliged!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sylvia was a great host. Accommodations were very clean and comfortable.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I love staying at Sylvia’s place. It’s also super clean and has everything you need. I might have left some unopened chocolate milk in the fridge just in case you haven’t found it yet! Sorry! I got in a lot later than I thought and was totally fog brained but this host is very responsive and friendly and I enjoy staying here.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect!

She even had out a high chair and pack n play for our youngest to use. Will definitely use Sylvia's again on future trips. Thank you so much!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have become a regular at Sylvia's listings. She's always very polite and quick to respond. I wanted until the last minute to book for the 4th and had to book 2 of her properties. They ended up being next door to each other. Instead of me having to leave and come back, she accommodated me by cleaning the second property first and allowed me to stay at the first property until cleaning was complete. The second night's stay at this property did come with a small problem with ants in the bedroom, which made me have to sleep in the other bedroom with smaller beds. It's the south and we've had a LOT of rain. Even if you think your house is air tight, they somehow still sometimes find a way in. Sylvia was quick to respond and even refunded me for the incident. I will continue to be a regular."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The location was clean and comfy. We wanted a quiet get away and this place did what we needed. You are close to everything and the neighborhood is quiet.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay here. The beds were very comfortable. I have an over sensitive sense of smell so very often the most objectionable thing about a place will be its smell. There were some air fresheners, but they were mild so I didn't mind too much. The next door neighbor was burning trash when we first showed up. The smell hadn't gotten into the house by that time and we kept the doors shut as much as we could to keep it out, but by the middle of the night it had made its way into the house somewhat. It was still smoldering the next morning so I contacted the host about it and she responded quickly and said that the authorities were on their way. I guess whatever she did worked because the fires were out when we came back that night and we didn't have any more issue with that. It was really more space than we needed, so if we come back to the area I might choose a smaller cheaper place if one is available, but if not I'd be more than happy to stay here again. Thanks for having us."

We vacation and travel often, so we've been to quite a few Airbnb's. Nevertheless, I have to say, Pearl's Cove is one of our favorites this far. It's very spacious and CLEAN with lots of spaces for entertainment or to allow privacy, which was a bonus. I always travel with liquid hand soap for the bathrooms, paper towels Tide pods, and trash bags when renting someone else's home.

Organized! Over the top organized! Everything is labeled so you know what is available to you and what any rules about it are. Very reassuring! I never had to ask about anything!
The inside environment was very quiet. The neighborhood is excellent and in the country. There was ample onsite parking.
The bed had a perfect, high quality, medium-soft mattress. I slept very well. Had control of a ceiling fan. The bedroom has a pin-pad lock.
I shared a bathroom with another room but almost didn't see another soul. Bathroom was sparkling clean and stocked with shampoos and soaps. A fluffy towel, hand towel, and washcloth were provided in my bedroom.
I didn't use the common kitchen except for a cup of complimentary Keurig coffee. However, every single cabinet was labeled with its contents for our use. Also, there was designated cabinet storage space in the kitchen labeled for each. The very reasonable usage rules were posted clearly too.
Love this host and home."

,,,"The facility was nice and the stay was overall good. Although, for future residents, do NOT come with more than just yourself. It is stated on the page that it is a single person housing, meaning only one person per room. Unfortunately I did not read that part and my fiancé and I were kicked out the next morning at 6:30 AM. I apologized and offered to pay a fee if necessary because we just got done from a 10 hour drive because I am on pre-deployment leave and we were exhausted from traveling but the owner was not flexible and had us leave immediately."
