We were here over the 4th and actually got to see fireworks from the neighbors on the back patio. Obviously there was some late night noise from that but that is always to be expected in any neighborhood. We were maybe a 10-15 min walk to the downtown area, sidewalks the whole way. The Walmart in downtown is maybe a 3 min drive, but also included in that 10-15 min walk if you aren‚Äôt grabbing much."

2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Bree is very responsive and helpful. the house is old, but clean and warm with no problems. However, a few things to note when booking here: the house is listed as four bedrooms, but you have to go through one of the bedrooms to access the attic space. that means that if someone sleeps up there and needs to use the bathroom in the middle of the night, they have to go through someone else's room to get to it. that should probably be noted in the listing, since you pay for four bedrooms, but you may only really be able to use three. Also, Bree's house is just across the street from a gas station which is open late, so there can be traffic on the street late at night."
2023-02-01,4.0,Group trip,We were there for skiing. The house accommodated our family of five. We were satisfied with our stay except for the street noise.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bree‚Äôs place was the perfect location for a winter vacation in Vermont. While my husband and son skied at nearby Killington and Pico Peak I toured the shops in historic downtown Rutland, a ten minute walk out the front door. We all made the journey through the beautiful Vermont countryside to Woodstock where I visited the many shops and they skied at Saskadena Six (formerly Suicide Six). Each day we returned to Bree‚Äôs home which was clean and comfortable and had everything we needed. Bree provided lots of information about local dining options and attractions and was accommodating about changing our day of arrival. I would recommend a stay here."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great spot for a large group. So close to everything you need and a quick trip to Killington. The home felt spacious and comfortable, we felt right at home. It is stocked with some essentials in the kitchen as well as plenty of towels, blankets and pillows. We would absolutely stay again."
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"- Great place to stay if you're going to Killington for a short stay, especially for the value
- The beds are not the most comfortable
- The bedrooms also face an active road so passing cars may be an issue for noise
- There is only one shower so please consider that if you're booking with a larger group"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Like others have reviewed before me, place is way better than pictures can show, huge house with tons of character, would like to have stayed longer & most certainly hope to soon return. Highly recommend."
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Everything about this house was great. Bree was extremely responsive. We had a minor issue getting into the house one morning but reached (in the meantime I re read her instructions and found she left alternative instructions). The house was 20 min from killington and got out needs perfectly for what we needed.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great Host
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was better than expected.
Sparkling clean , lots to do around .
Comfy beds , and very easy check in .

2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,House was comfortable. Living room had great big couches for lounging. Kids had fun with the games and hanging out in the living room. Close to downtown. Host was very responsive. Ample parking. House was well appointed - plenty of amenities. Some vehicle noise at night either due to nearby gas station or proximity to town. Fourth bedroom is in an attic type space that can only be accessed through another of the bedrooms which was kind of an issue for us and could be for others as well. Bathroom on the first floor doesn't lock so just have to be good about knocking. 2 bathrooms but one shower - just something to be aware of. Overall felt clean and safe and we enjoyed our stay.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a great place, very close to ski resorts and had lots of options for dinning. We will definitely come back!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lovely home in a well-situated section of Rutland. Quiet, tastefully furnished, beautiful woodwork throughout, and all the amenities that make a home truly cozy: abundant towels, pillows, blankets, fully-stocked kitchen wares. We cooked most of our meals and it was a pleasure to eat in the dining room amid all the natural light. All we had to do was show up and we felt right at home."

House is set-up nicely, its clean, has a lot of home implements that makes your stay easier and lots of rooms to spread out. Its an older home with some quirky power arrangements but overall very nice and will have most everything you will need. Would happily return to Bree's place on any trip to Rutland, Vt."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was great. Coffee on the porch every morning was nice. Very clean house and well stocked. Bree was amazing allowing us to amend the reservation from 4 to 3 people at the last minute due to a family emergency.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Plenty of beds and space for the 4 of us. Just a short drive to downtown Rutland (also walkable). We enjoyed the farmer‚Äôs market on Saturday and found a fun coffee place (Speakeasy). Great hiking nearby and plenty of space for our son to explore.
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Bree's house is excellent for many reasons. It is spacious and accommodating of larger groups, but it stays calm, homey and clean. The house is centrally-located in Rutland, an eccentric 'proper-city' city with an unexpected, almost recusant, cool factor -- all only twenty minutes to the major slopes. The house itself is an easy ten-minute walk to Rutland's downtown, a stretch of streets teeming with life and compelling architecture. Bree is very quick and considerate with her responses. ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Bree was a wonderful host and the home was incredibly roomy and well kept. Everything was as advertised‚Ä¶ would stay here again.

2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"A clean home located near restaurants and stores. No handicap accessories but is well supplied with cooking utensils, coffee maker, toaster and a wonderful little crock pot. Was able to make a splendid little batch of chowder. Two of the beds were firm, the others were too soft for me. Plenty of clean linen and towels. Toilets flushed well, water pressure okay and adequate hot water for showers."
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Nice central location for the mountain biking in this corner of Vermont. The place was well-kept and as-advertised. Sitting on the back deck catching up with old friends was a treat. Already thinking of staying at this spot again for next year‚Äôs trip.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice older house in quiet area. Myself and my family enjoyed the home. Would definitely return
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was very clean and comfortable. Didn't have time to enjoy it but the screen porch is a plus. Bree was excellent to communicate with.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bree‚Äôs house provided everything that we needed for a quiet, cozy, relaxing, and pleasant stay in downtown Rutland. The beds and couches were comfortable, the screened in porch was great for the rainy weather, the kitchen was nicely equipped, the TV and WiFi worked great, and it‚Äôs very close to many nice restaurants and retail. We would definitely stay here again!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"What a lovely house! It was perfect for our family gathering of 5 adults- spacious, well equipped and so conveniently located. It reminded us all so much of the old New England houses we had grown up in- in the most charming way! Check in with the lockbox was super easy and Bree was quick to respond to questions. We‚Äôre sad we only got to spend one night here!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Big old house with many beds and gathering areas. Had everything we needed for an enjoyable weekend. Short distance from downtown Rutland. Would definitely stay again.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a fantastic time. Her home was wonderful. Every thoughtful convenience was there for us. The house is clean and comfortable. My family is still raving about it and was sad to leave.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was exactly as advertised and had everything we needed. The location was perfect for us and the cost was very reasonable. Although we had no need for cooking, we appreciated that the kitchen had spices and would have been easy to use. The screened-in porch and back porch were perfect for enjoying our morning coffee. Check-in was easy!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,This large house with its 4 bedrooms was terrific for our family congregating for family wedding events at the Killington Ski Resort an easy 20 minute drive away. Bree is a great host - responsive and friendly.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I was in town for a quick visit and had a great stay. It was a hot week and was worried about the AC keeping up, but the AC kept the place nice and cool my entire stay."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent host! Always responded quickly with any questions! It definitely is a home away from home!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very grateful that we were able to rent this house for the week. As others have commented, it was very clean and the beds were comfy. Nice towels. We slept well and were not bothered by street noise. Wifi was good. It is a normal city neighborhood and we never felt unsafe. It‚Äôs a good 1/2 mile to downtown; I walked twice downtown but not everyone would want to do a hike to dinner. We recommend Roots, the HopnMoose and Tokyo House. And Jones Donuts. Not to be missed.
Walkable to Pine Hill Park which has great hike and bike paths.
We cooked a number of meals during our stay and although the cookware was rather random, we always had a pan or pot or implement as needed.
Only negatives are that the shared driveway needs some attention (go over the sidewalk carefully), and that there is only one bath on second floor with the bedrooms (the half bath is off the kitchen). This was not a problem for us, but could be if all four bedrooms are being used.
Bree is very responsive and a good host. I will definitely stay here next time I am in Rutland."
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Bree has a very sweet place. The two porches where great to just sit out and relax on in the evenings and the mornings with a cup of coffee or tea. Although we just stayed two nights She has everything that you might need for a longer stay. It did however have an odor to the place that was a bit unpleasant until we got the AC's going and then it was not so noticeable. I would stay again if I got the chance.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great and comfortable house. It lived up to every expectation and we hope to stay there again.
All the basics, and more, are provided and there wasn‚Äôt a single ‚ÄúI wish it had...‚Äù on the entire stay.
The owner was communicative and answered any questions that arose very quickly.
We hope to return and stay there again in the future."
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,House is great. Neighborhood is interesting.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Fascinating home with lots of room. Lovely town with all you need very close by. The entire process was simple from start to finish. A great value in a beautiful mountain setting.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice stay in this classic New England home with a 10 minute walk to old town Rutland. Everything you need is blocks or minutes away. Killington is 20 minutes away. Home was very clean, plenty of room to spread out over multiple floors. Washer / Dryer was super appreciated after some wet, muddy hikes. Communication was excellent and fast. Totally would recommend fora homey base for exploring the Green Mountains and central Vermont."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Perfect house for a vacation. The house felt so homely. The place was clean and accessible to most tourist areas.
2021-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"This house is in the perfect location for a visit to Rutland VT! Within walking distance from a lot of downtown, and is very spacious. Everything was great! The house was decently clean but not as clean as I‚Äôve experienced with Airbnb‚Äôs in the past. Bree was very helpful and accommodating. Would recommend to anyone looking to get away to Rutland!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When people ask me about staying at an ABnB, my standard answer is: ""at the end of the day, you feel like you're coming home."" So true about this place. On the first day we stayed there, it was a bit damp and dreary out..........the heat was on !!!! that was a welcoming feeling.
Loved your place..........."

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is amazing and so is the Host. Bree is easy to communicate with, organized, and very quick to respond to emails."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"It's a great space and location! I stayed solo for a week in early April and had the best possible weather. I'm not sure I'd recommend it for large groups, but two couples or a family would work just fine.
As has been noted, very comfy beds and pillows. The 2 decks (one screened-in, one open) are awesome. TV and wifi were great. Cleanliness was great and I appreciated the day between guest stays. No dishwasher but did appreciate the washing machine and dryer.
Only real comment is the driveway leading to behind the house - where one parks one's car - needs fixing and is a bit bumpy. Otherwise, all good!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cozy atmosphere and a great location. It has everything you need.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place. I loved staying here and was very easy to get to the ski mountains. Beds were comfortable and a very good setup!

2021-02-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,This is an place was a great place for us to stay. We used it for our ski trip to Killington and Okemo. The kitchen has all the amenities you will need to be able to cook most meals. The beds were comfortable. The only thing that I think could be improved was the sitting in the living room. The couches were not the best and it felt a little crowed when we were all in there. If you not planning on stay here all day you will be fine with it.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay close to ski resorts with everything we needed for our stay. Bree got back to us immediately with all of our concerns and took care of every issue promptly. Highly recommend and we will return.

The house was within walking of downtown & Rutland is an easy start for anywhere in VT. Big tv & comfy couches for lazy eves and strong wifi for the day i had to work. Quiet, safe neighborhood. Comfy beds, thick towels & warm older home. 'worst' parts were the creaky stairs and feathers on my clothes from couch pillows üòä"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,We were in the area for work. Bree's house was a perfect fit for us. It is in a great location.

She is very responsive and checked in with us mid stay to make sure we were all set.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We definitely enjoyed our stay at Bernie's place. We were there for a ski vacation to Killington, which is a straight shot about 15-20 min down the road. The house certainly has old bones but it felt very cozy and comfortable nonetheless. We were able to make meals in the kitchen using the provided cookware and also made use of the beautiful claw-foot tub (the place has an excellent amount of very hot water). Overall our stay here was very good, and I would definitely consider staying there again for another Killington trip."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Weekdays at Bernie‚Äôs! We had a terrific few days. Ideal for our family to chill out and relax after spending the days at Killington. I was glad we booked this over something closer to the mountain as it offered so many walkable features that we would‚Äôve missed out on if we did stay at the base. The clawfoot tub was a welcomed feature after a day at the hills!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place to stay for skiing at Pico. Killington is pretty close too! Great accommodation!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Bernie‚Äôs home was a 10 out of 10! And way larger than i expected. Very comfortable we absolutely plan to stay here again.
2024-02-01,4.0,Group trip,"Had a great time at the place! 20mins drive to Killington, which was most important to our group of 5. Everything was basically as we expected. Local grocery store a few steps away! Description says 9 people but max would really be 7 people (last person on the couch). Unfortunately the windows are covered by paper thin blinds and let the sun in the bedrooms so sleeping in is tough. There is another unit attached in the back which we weren‚Äôt aware of so we had to be mindful of our noise level. Overall good option for the area!"

Tastefully decorated, cozy and clean, a beautiful home away from home. Bernie was extremely responsive to any questions I had. One of the best surprises for me was discovering Dell Veneri Bakery just around the corner.

Not a lot of clutter: just nice decorations, comfortable beds, and nice linens and towels. The home is well-appointed and had everything we needed. It is on a quiet street next to a bus stop, and the downtown and grocery store are all within walking distance. We loved Bernie's place, and he made us feel right at home. Highly recommend!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Needed a place for a few of us to sleep while attending my father's funeral services & came across this listing. This being a stressful time along with being my first time using Airbnb I wasn't sure what to expect. Bernie was very communicative & the check in process was so easy. The house was exactly as described. It was spacious & clean & the beds were very comfortable. It was a perfect fit for our needs. I now feel comfortable where I will use Airbnb in the future. And if I ever need to book in Rutland again I would come back to this house.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the best B&B experience we have ever had. Bernie extended himself to us before our arrival and was very accessible throughout our stay.
The home is full of character and charm. Bernie has managed to retain the character of the old home while updating with modern, tasteful and comfortable furnishings.
The home is sunny and bright. Extremely quiet. The well appointed kitchen has everything you need for a short or longer stay.
For TV watchers, there is a TV in each bedroom, as well as a massive screen in the living room. The walls are so thick that I was able to go to sleep without hearing noise as my family was downstairs watching a movie.
The thought given to this B&B has clearly been a labor of love by its owner. I can‚Äôt wait to return."

2023-03-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Needs updating worth the price
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"During our three -day, two-night stay we went alpine skiing at Pico and backcountry skiing on the Catamount Trail; both are just 15 minutes up Route 4. At night we walked downtown for dinner and a show at the Paramount (great venue). The house was very clean and comfortable. It's an older Vermont home but is holding up well. Great location."
2023-03-01,4.0,Group trip,"The house was cozy and comfortable for three people. It could have fit 2-3 more with the bedrooms but may have felt tight in the living room space at that capacity. We easily fit two cars in the driveway, and a third may have also been possible. The house is located near plenty of stores and food places. It was about a 30 min drive to Killington and Pico, about 45 min to Okemo - easy access!
Parts of the house are clearly updated, while others are showing their age. The house could use some fresh paint and a bathroom upgrade, but otherwise very functional.
Overall, we enjoyed our stay. It was a comfortable place to sleep between skiing. We are also very grateful to whomever shoveled the driveway after the snow storm!"

The stairs up to the bedrooms are on the steep side after skiing all day so be ready. The listing is in a quiet neighborhood with lots of restaurants and stores close by. The kitchen has everything you could need, including yummy coffee to wake up to. We really enjoyed Bernie‚Äôs home as he was super communicative about expectations and directions once arriving. Can‚Äôt wait to stay again!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great 3 bed apartment for family ski vacation at Killington (just under 20 minutes away). Very responsive host.

VERY comfortable sleeping arrangements! Very easy check-in and check-out. Though it was not an issue for us, the staircase is quite narrow and steep (it is an older home). Bernie was very communicative and even reached out to check on us midway through our stay. We had no concerns and would not hesitate to stay again!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very nice new unit. We spent only one night there but we had a really good time. The beds are really comfy and the ambience is really nice.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My colleague and I had a very nice 3-night stay. The house has some good updates and is well appointed upstairs and down.
There is a dining room off the kitchen with a large table that is nice for working or dining. The comfortable living room has a large sectional that is great for lounging or watching TV. The 3 bedrooms upstairs all have really comfortable beds, smart TVs, and are spacious with lots of light but only one had AC and we were there during a hot spell. The bathroom is functional and a good size with a claw foot tub and a small shower.
The stairs are super steep and a bit precarious but we just took them slow.
Would definitely stay again!"

Bernie was great at communicating and responding to our questions and making sure we had everything we needed for our stay. This was a work trip and the house had great high speed internet for that. We had several video calls and there was no freezing or glitches! As others have said the stairs are no joke though, we just made sure to use the handrail and we were fine. Looking forward to staying here again the next time we are in Rutland."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a convenient location in the heart of downtown Rutland. I was attending a wedding in o Rutland so this was the perfect accommodation.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to stay for a ski trip or if you‚Äôre looking to experience the heart of Vermont! We had 4 of us staying in the house and there was more than enough space. Bernie is very responsive and friendly, couldn‚Äôt have asked for more. Only thing I will say is that there is only one bathroom so depending on how many people are staying with you, you may end up forming a line, it was fine for us because there were only 4 of us. There‚Äôs 3 beds that are all very large and comfortable. The bedrooms were all quiet sizeable too. The spot is directly in Rutland so you have quick access to plenty of restaurants and stores."
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is nice but is not suitable for children under 6 beds are really high and the stairs are very steep
Bernie is an amazing host and responds right away with a solution to any of the problems you may have..
Will be Renting again in the summer"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Bernie was very responsive. The house was clean and perfect for our one night stay. The kitchen is stocked with most kitchen wares. The coffee machine is a keurig and there were k cups available. The only main issue we had was that none of the upstairs windows had blinds. Hopefully this gets taken care of moving forward as Bernie seemed opened to suggestions and improvements. The house is also a 10min walk to historic downtown so perfect location. We would stay here again.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful place, we had a wonderful night and had wonderful fresh snow at Killington on Sunday. We are Bernie's first tenant in this unit and he was still working hard to sorting out all the finishing touches. At first we found no cooking pans in the Kitchen and contacted him. He replied in 30 minutes and brought us a new set of pans in an hour. The unit has a big good size living room, kitchen and dining room on the first floor and 3 bedrooms on the second floor. Spacious enough even for two small families.
The place is at the heart of Rutland, 2 minutes walking to a Walgreen and Rt. 7. But located in a quite back street.
Highly recommend if you take a ski trip to Killington."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An immaculate, newly renovated apartment with beautiful finishing touches. Really one of the nicest Airbnb‚Äôs I‚Äôve stayed at. Be warned, the exterior is a little rough and the building sits in an industrial/warehouse sort of setting ‚Äî and there‚Äôs some traffic noise ‚Äî but if you‚Äôre prepared for that, the apartment is really spectacular, and sits only a block from the Main Street in Rutland‚Äôs downtown."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My friends and I had a great stay here! Jamie is a wonderful host and was very communicative from the time of booking through check-out. The apartment is adorable, clean, and cozy. Had everything we needed to cook and have coffee in the morning which was very much appreciated. Used this as our home base for a girls skiing weekend at Killington and the location was perfect. The apartment is a short walk to the bus stop for Killington, which was an added bonus so we didn‚Äôt have to drive through the blizzard to the mountain! Would absolutely return!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The inside was beautiful! Two king beds for a dad and three teenage boys worked perfectly.

One little hiccup with the lock when we arrived and Jamie responded immediately to provide assistance. Would rent again if we return! Thank you!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb was the perfect place for our short getaway. Everything looks as good as it was in the pictures.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Jamie is a fabulous host that truly cares about her guests. She has thought of your every need and convenience and created a stylish and elegant space that you will be comfortable in.
The apartment lies in the business district, making everything within walking distance - coffee shops, retail and restaurants and more are mere steps away - not to mention the Farmer‚Äôs Market during the season.
We spent a week in Rutland and invited friends and family over on several nights; all were universally impressed with the space and will definitely be suggesting it to their out-of-town friends."

Easily one of the best AirBnb's we have ever stayed in!"

Darcie provides spare bath essentials in case you forget something. The place is very spacious and beautifully decorated. The bedroom closets are very large and lighted, so they make great changing rooms. We stayed in Rutland to ski at Killington and Okemo. There are so many electrical outlets in all the rooms, which was convenient to charge all our devices and plug in ski boot/glove dryers. Loved the front door/mud room, which was a great place for wet winter boots and ski storage. Darcie is very responsive.

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"The house is very comfortable, pleasant and well equipped. The host(s) are most helpful and responsive. Walkers/hikers should be aware, though, that there are no footpaths around the immediate neighborhood for after-dinner strolls. It takes a bit of driving to get to places where one can walk without the presence of cars.
We arrived the day before the destructive deluge of July 2023 hit Vermont and had to endure plenty of rainy days, but were impressed by the massive public effort to return matters to pre-storm ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. Hiking was not really in the cards under the prevailing conditions, but we managed to enjoy ourselves by visiting a number of the pretty small towns and villages and lakeshores."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Jeff‚Äôs instructions, preparation, quick responses, well equipped stocked kitchen and extremely comfortable home exceeded our expectations.

At night the fireflies and stars twinkle creating a magical experience. We highly recommend Jeff as a super host.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place to stay in Vermont! The location could not be better -- it's close to more hiking trails than we could visit in a week's time, and is also private and has a great view, all within a few miles of grocery stores. Jeff's place is extremely well-stocked, with a full kitchen and supplies, and he is a communicative and helpful host. The main living space is just beautiful, with a full wall of windows looking out on the beautiful view.

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jeff‚Äôs place is awesome! It‚Äôs clean, conveniently located and cozy! I stayed here for a ski trip to killington but would recommend this place for any season. Rutland is so close by and has everything you need. Jeff‚Äôs kitchen is also one of the best stocked I‚Äôve seen in an Airbnb. I look forward to staying again at this beautiful property."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I had a really great time at Jeff's home - it's very clean and a great place to get away. We cooked many meals in the kitchen and enjoyed the views out the deck and across to the horses. The main room is open and inviting and made for a good base. We skied at Okemo, about a half hour drive away, and supermarkets/Rutland is less than 10 min away. Jeff was great at communicating and a wonderful host!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The stay at Jeff's Chalet was the second time for my family at Christmas time--though with a year off in the middle. It is clean and comfortable and quiet! The view to the west is memorable especially at sunset.
There was plenty of room for my 7 year old grandson to have space to play while the grownups could sit and chat. They had a lovely Christmas tree and presents--just like home but with snow and mountains.
The house is about 10 minutes away from an excellent supermarket where all supplies are available to create fine meals in the well stocked kitchen.
Sledding at Mountain Top and the country club in Rutland was the major outdoor event every day!
A perfect get away in all respects..."

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jeff‚Äôs place was excellent! Exactly as described with a wonderful view of the hills. It is close enough to downtown Rutland to easily get to the stores, but feels as though you‚Äôre away from the bustle and in your own farmland. Would definitely stay again."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jeff's home was lovely! The perfect place to enjoy the beginning of fall with friends, given the sprawling mountain view from the large deck. The interior was cozy and spacious. A friendly barn cat wandered over a few times, which was a treat! Check-in was smooth, and Jeff was pleasant in all our correspondence with him.
Jeff also left us a bottle of red and some chocolate, which was a sweet surprise!
(One note, when outside it's quite horsey, so not good for people with horse allergies such as myself.)"

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location. Scenic, quiet, and close to great hikes and stores if you forgot to bring anything on your trip. Jeff's house has very spacious and open common areas which are filled with sunlight during the daytime and nice soft lighting at night. Tastefully decorated space makes you feel right at home as soon as you walk in. I recommend sitting on the deck for both gazing at the mountain in the distance or stargazing at night when the skies are clear. We had a very restful weekend here and would recommend Jeff's place to anyone visiting the area!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jeff‚Äôs cabin is amazing, a totally hidden gem .
We got the opportunity to watch the sunrise and sunset from the deck which has breathtaking views .
The cabin it‚Äôs extremely clean and we truly felt like we were home .
It‚Äôs very secluded and the sky at night was just so beautiful.
The kitchen is great and we were able to also grill outside.
The whole house is perfect and spacious not mention so close to everything.
The wine and chocolate were a such a nice surprise and the clean robes were a really nice bonus .
Jeff was a great host and quick to respond to any questions .
We will definitely come back and can‚Äôt wait to make more memories ."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a lovely house with beautiful views especially from the back deck. The gas grill was especially nice on the deck and we enjoyed watching the horses who lived on the farm next door. There was plenty of comfortable furniture and the kitchen was well appointed. A very nice grocery store was close by and great hiking was within a few miles. A covered bridge is about 2 miles away and worth a visit.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing place! Clean, well equipped, cozy. We are definitely coming back there."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was wonderful & relaxing. The house is well stocked and we didn‚Äôt want for anything. The location is central too so it‚Äôs easy access to all the area attractions.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just spent a fantastic five days in Jeff‚Äôs beautiful home. The location and scenery was even more beautiful than we imagined, with the backdrop of mountains and a horse farm nearby. The house itself was exceptionally clean and very warm and inviting. The light-filled family room had a big comfy settee and recliners. The beds were comfortable, the kitchen well stocked and the bathroom was spacious with lovely thick towels.
Jeff, was an exceptional host, he communicated well with quick responses. He is also very thoughtful. He welcomed us with a nice bottle of wine and chocolates. He also provides nice robes in the bedroom, and the family room has lots of books, games and puzzles, plus a big basket of information about the area.
This home was the perfect base to enjoy this beautiful part of Vermont."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,As advertised. Lovely cabin. Perfect for a family of three. Setting was bucolic.
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good location and nice layout in house. Perhaps better for winter stays. There was a large dehumidifier but with the amount of rain this summer, there was a musty odor. I was unable to connect with host. His phone number was screened and then the message was that the mailbox was full when I attempted to connect several times."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"From the moment we walked into Jeff's lovely home, we felt cozy and comforted. Our host welcomed us with chocolate and a bottle of wine. The kitchen was fully stocked with everything we needed to take advantage of Vermont's fresh food. Our bed was supportive and comfortable. The living room had great books to read and board games to play. And the deck was our favorite place. The view was incredible-a field full of wild flowers, butterflies and hummingbirds leading to a hill covered in trees. Mornings were beautiful as the fog rose through the trees, and at night we saw so many stars! It was also charming to be next door to horses and hear little kids giggling as they took riding lessons. When we ventured out, it was easy to get to the D&H Rail to Trail, the Rutland Farmer's Market and Speak Easy Coffee. It was also an easy drive to both Middlebury and Burlington. After a pretty stressful year, we really needed a mellow, quiet vacation. Jeff's place delivered. Thank you, Jeff!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was an amazing stay the home is gorgeous and everything is immaculate and organized all you have to do is walk in and put your bags down. We barely left the back porch with the amazing view it has and the location is amazing
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jeff's property is amazing. The great room is such a great place for any amount of people to get together and do an activity. The high ceilings give you a feeling of grandeur. The views are great you can see mountain ranges all around. And in the back there's a horse farm in sight. You can walk to the back Stretches of land and it's so nice. Great retreat from city life, and it's also close enough to super markets and Rutland that you can still go get everything you would need. Definitely would recommend."
2021-05-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice view from the deck however there seems to be a bee issue and not able to enjoy sitting out as much as we would have liked to. Furniture could use an update as not too comfortable but bed was very comfortable and cozy. Coffee provided was delicious and robes left for guest use came in handy. Jeff left us chocolate and a bottle of wine which was a nice gesture. All in all it‚Äôs a great place for relaxing and Jeff was very nice and his home seems like it‚Äôs been a labor of love. Thanks again Jeff!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jeff‚Äôs home is very comfortable and was the perfect get away from NYC. It was a treat to be able to sit out on the deck and enjoy the lovely view (and the horses next door!) It is centrally located to great hiking, beautiful drives and more. The house is in a quiet, pretty area, but at the same time is just a few minutes from grocery stores and other conveniences. Our communications with Jeff were great."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a very spacious and beautiful home with wonderful view.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely home for a weekend away. The horse farm next door provides cute views to go with the mountains. This is perfect for a hiking weekend or ski weekend.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The stay was wonderful! Everything we could possibly need was provided and the home itself was beautiful. I was only sad that the cold weather kept us from using the deck and fire pit.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We just had a great weekend at Jeff's house, which was perfect for my husband and I and our toddler. Lots of space for her to run around! :-) We also really appreciated the ""welcome"" wine and chocolate! Communication with Jeff was seamless and quick.

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Jeff's place - large living space with a lovely deck and view and a fully stocked kitchen for cooking. The heating works well and quickly (as well as hot water). We were able to work comfortably from the Airbnb as the WiFi was fast.
The house is a close drive to Pico and Killington. We shopped and dined in Rutland which had everything we needed within a 15 minute drive. The drive to Woodstock was not too far either - it took us around 45 minutes to get there so worth spending a day there."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jeff‚Äôs place was so clean, open and bright! We did some amazing hikes in the area and had great dinners at the Rustic Rooster. Jeff‚Äôs home provides all you need for a beautiful escape! Highly recommend"

The house is beautiful- open floor concept, lovely deck with mountain views, and accommodations such as complimentary wine and chocolates made us feel very welcomed. Jeff was very responsive to any questions, and there were helpful notes around the house. As for location, downtown Rutland was only a few minutes away and had a grocery store, restaurants and shops, and approximately 30 minute drive to both Okemo and Killington. We would definitely recommend- 10/10!!!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything about this place says accommodating. Very clean and liked the notes to help make the stay easy.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jeff‚Äôs place is awesome and in the perfect location for Okemo and killington, both about a 30 minute drive. Downtown Rutland and all of its amenities (grocery store, shops and restaurants) are only a 5-10 minute drive. The house itself is super clean, very cozy, and has everything you need for the stay - the chocolate and wine was a lovely touch! The place is large, much larger than what the pictures show and it‚Äôs also bright in all rooms with the sun. The view out the back is beautiful with the horses. My husband, 2.5 yo daughter and I had a wonderful week stay, my daughter had a great time looking at the horses, running around in the back, toasting marshmallows over the fire pit and playing with the barnyard cat. We had everything we needed to cook most our meals but were also close enough to grab takeout a few nights. What a great stay, can‚Äôt wait to come back!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had such a great family getaway while staying at Jeff's home. There were many aspects that made it special such as the open floor plan with mountains views, being greeted with complimentary wine and chocolate, the neighboring horse farm which the kids loved, and it's proximity to hikes/ parks as well as being only about a 30-35 minute drive to the Killington Ski Resort. Jeff was very responsive and a great host. We would definitely stay here again!"

2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place with great views! Very clean, tons of space, and anything you would need for cooking is in the kitchen. There was a clean robe left in the closet, and board games on a shelf for when it was too cold to go out. Very fun to watch the horses next door. The two bedrooms are equal sizes, so it would be great for a pair of couples looking for a group trip. Overall I recommend!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here as two sets of couples and it was perfect. The home was complete with a beautiful backyard view of some gorgeous countryside and horses! Check-in was easy and everything was clean and ready-to-use. One bedroom was slightly colder than the rest of the house, but there was a space heater kindly provided for that room so it was no problem. Jeff left personal touches and notes over the space to answer all of our questions. It was a great stay!"

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jeff‚Äôs home is an absolute hidden gem. We spent the weekend in Vermont celebrating my husbands 30th birthday. The home was charming, and you can tell Jeff put a lot of love into his home. The home was so clean, and gave such a welcoming, warm vibe. There was a bottle of wine and chocolates waiting for us, which was a nice added touch. The views from the home of the mountains and horse farm were beautiful- make sure you catch the sunsets while relaxing!

The vibe was just so cozy, relaxing, fresh (if that make sense lol)... they have the neccesities we needed for our stay; plus you get a chocolate and wine as a welcoming present :)... overall, the place was just so homey.. if you are looking for a place to just get out of your busy life and just want to chill this is your place..we could have ask for a better weather but the place was just perfect. it was our home away from home.. it could be yours too... our host jeff was very accomodating and responds to you concerns efficiently."

Rutland is the nearest city center less than 10 mins away to go for places to eat and there were quite a few good options with outdoor seating to allow social distancing. The house has excellent views and the deck faces mountains which was our favorite spots in the house. You could enjoy the morning coffee and sunset (deck is west facing). That was truly relaxing.

The weather was beautiful and Clarendon was central enough for us to do a good job of exploring Vermont during our week-long visit. We highly recommend a farm-to-table dinner at Cloudland Farm in Woodstock, a sunset cruise on Lake Champlain with Whistling Man cruises and hiking.

2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Immediately upon walking into the home you can‚Äôt help but to admire the beautiful wood work and Mountain View. We were welcomed to the spotless home with a bottle of wine and chocolate. The house is perfectly located where you can visit the shops and restaurants in Rutland, as well as a short ride to the Killington area, but still have a relaxing escape. Check in was very easy and the host provided a great deal of brochures for places to visit. We enjoyed the house so much we requested to extend our stay one night. Jeff answered my phone call right away and was able to accommodate us with no problem. I highly recommend staying here, we plan to return ourselves."

The windows overlooking the deck to the mountains were terrific and the sunsets were magical! There was plenty of space for our five year old to play and spread out. The Christmas lights were so welcoming that Santa had no trouble finding the house. Our son Lucas loved visiting the horses next door! Close to shopping and Rutland restaurants.

Spacious layout, good kitchen, lovely setting with great views yet a serene sense of privacy. All exactly as advertised. Jeff was a kind, available and helpful host."

2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at Jeff's home in Claredon was nothing short of amazing. We were so comfortable and relaxed. Jeff is a great host and left so many thoughtful amenities. He was communicative and was there for any questions we had. The view from the outdoor deck is spectacular and watching the horses next door was an added treat. The house is very clean and comfortable. Stores are not too far away. Ask Jeff about recommendations on places to eat.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Awesome house with thoughtful amenities and a great host.
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great space. The pictures don‚Äôt do it justice.

Simple and easy checkin with easy to contacts hosts."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was great for our family get away! It's close to the Appalachian Trail , which was one of our goals while there. Theres a great little town just minutes away. Definitely a beautiful
comfortable space tucked away in the counryt but easily accessible to conveniences of town!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great quiet place to spend the weekend.
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were very happy with Jeff's place. Super clean and well stocked with needed items. The beds were comfortable. The pine floors, cabinets and other woodwork was really nice. Open, airy, and relaxing. Perfect size for a family of four (two children 8 and 5 yrs old). The location is great with Rutland, Killington, and Bomoseen so close. Many good hiking trails are not too far away and the kids had a great time at Shelburne Farms. There is a lot to do in the area. The property is easy to get to and convenient."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nothing more to say than just perfect. The place has everything you may need and so many little touches that made the stay even better. The kids enjoyed the place very much. We had a great time and location was perfect: 10 min from Rutland and 30 min from Manchester.
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Jeff‚Äôs house is wonderful! Very clean and stocked with everything you need for a comfortable stay. Loved how everything was finished with pine. The high ceilings in the living room and all of the windows let plenty of natural light in and make it very peaceful. You can see the horses next door from the deck and we also saw wild deer, groundhogs, rabbits etc roaming around the property! Right down the street from Rutland which has a strip of every store you could think of, but it‚Äôs just far enough away to feel completely in the mountains. About 25 - 30 minutes from Killington as well. Would definitely recommend this house if you are looking to stay in the area!! - Sean and Allie"
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect size for a couple or small family! Very spacious and well equipped. The view is beautiful and the location is convenient. If you have any questions they will respond quick. Would love to return. We had an amazing stay!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If your looking for a place that is easy to get too and from, this is it."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place and host! We enjoyed the area and the easy access to MTBing and creamees üç¶The road was little noisy during day, but quiet at night."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A friend and I traveled to Southern Vermont and needed a place to stay for the night. I selected Joseph‚Äôs place because of its great location and the Rutland City Bikes connection - I am a bike rider and was interested in checking out his Rutland City Bikes shop, which is adjacent to the Airbnb.
Joseph met us at the door when we arrived and was extremely welcoming, friendly and helpful. The Airbnb was perfect for our needs, it was super clean and comfortable, great furniture and some really cool photos. It is very central to rutland and a short drive to local skiing and riding.
After we got settled I had a chance to check out Joseph‚Äôs shop, Rutland City Bikes and was very impressed- it‚Äôs a fantastic one stop shop that clearly showcases Joseph‚Äôs passion for bikes and boards.
I cannot recommend this Airbnb -or Joseph - enough! If you‚Äôre going to be staying in the Rutland area this is a great place to stay and a fantastic old school bike shop to check out - don‚Äôt miss it"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joseph was an excellent host, had helpful recommendations, and helped me get my car out of the driveway during a snowstorm. Now I want to go back and see the trail in the summer!! Highly recommend!!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed Joseph's place. It is conveniently located in Rutland and is clean, spacious and comfortable (especially the mattresses!). Quick and easy to drive to Killington for skiing and around town to get groceries or go to restaurants. Joseph is friendly and pro-active; he greeted us in person and gave detailed explanations about the accommodations and helpful suggestions about the town. We would be happy to stay here again!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A nice spacious home with everything you could need! Big beds, nice common areas, plenty of hot water, easy parking and 30 minutes from Killington Mountain. This was a perfect spot for a weekend on the mountain! Joseph was very friendly and easy to communicate with! We would definitely stay again soon."
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Good place not far from mountain activities. A short drive will get you to get to the center of Rutland where you can find restaurants and bars.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved staying here for a weekend ski trip to Killington; 20-25 minute easy drive that you can memorize after one day! Joseph's place was super clean and spacious. The kitchen had everything one could need and even more (e.g., French press for coffee). Moreover, it's near everything you could need being less than a 5 minute drive to the heart of downtown Rutland.
Joseph was very communicative, and I appreciated his flexibility as my check in time got pushed to the right considerably. Would recommend this place to anyone and looking forward to staying here again next ski season."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, roomy and comfortable Airbnb. My partner and I thoroughly enjoyed our one-week stay here. Great proximity to skiing at Killington.
Spacious enough for us to ¬´ work from home ¬ª for a few days. Kitchen was well equipped with essentials and we used it to cool meals during our stay.
Joe promptly answered all our questions, provided great local recommendations and helped us getting our car out of the snowüòÖ
Highly recommended place and host !"
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The house is very nice and very clean‚Äîit exceeded expectations based on the pictures. Joseph takes pride in his property and in his town. He has lots of helpful tourist information neatly displayed in the unit: trail maps of the local mountain biking park, walking map of downtown, info about nearby restaurants.
The only negative thing was a miscommunication about the price. When booking a place that says it sleeps 6, I was under the impression it would be the same price for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 people (like every other property I‚Äôve ever booked), so I didn‚Äôt pay attention to the fact that I hadn‚Äôt changed the # of guests from the default 1. Learning at checkin that it would be an extra $50 because there were 3 of us left a bad taste in my mouth. I still think the place was worth what we paid, but the surprise fee irked me.
I don‚Äôt think Joseph was intentionally deceiving, but I wish that the extra per person charge was made more obvious at booking."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joseph's place is my favorite when I visit Vermont. SO ROOMY, I could bring several guests if I chose to. Big, modern kitchen and bathroom, always clean. Thanks, JT for offering this place thru Airbnb. Look forward to coming here again!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Nice experience staying in This lovely house
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Vintage homey is my best description. Old home with creaky wood floors and I loved it! It was cozy warm for an old house and exactly as described. We did not use the kitchen to cook but it looked well appointed and the coffee maker and toaster that we did use seemed new. As did the washer/dryer. JT is a very gracious host with superb response time and very friendly yet respectfully distant demeanor. The location is on a busy road but perfect for visiting in West Rutland and traveling to Killington, both of which we did.
I highly recommend JT‚Äôs place for a home base when traveling in the area. We will definitely return and suggest for friends."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Comfortable, close to Rutland (1 mile to restaurants and theater)"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Joseph, Thank you for such the warm welcome we got from you. Deborah and I both enjoyed being able to spend some time chatting with you. You were just so kind and welcoming. You can tell that you go to great lengths to be sure your guests have what they need. It will certainly be at your place if we are ever back in that area. You have a lot to be proud of. I love your attitude about life and living it to the fullest, whatever that might look like for each individual. Again, thank you for being a wonderful host! This Airbnb is an absolute must-see and stay!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joseph‚Äôs place was lovely. Comfortable, and exactly what we needed. We were there to run Spartan races and it was the perfect location. Joseph was friendly and prompt in answering questions.
Thanks for a great stay!"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Joseph was incredible and very friendly! Gave us several great recommendations for a waterfall nearby and a local farmers market, both of which we loved! The place was spacious and clean and there was lots of nice outdoor space. The only downsides were that it is on a busier road, which we did not realize before, and several rooms smelled strongly of weed. Everything else was great and well worth the money!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Spacious place and good for Rutland trips and stays. JT great host!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A very spacious, first floor of Victorian house. Lots of room for a bigger group. Perhaps second floor available as well for larger groups? Would be a great ski-stay for those wanting to be very near cross country and downhill venues, but not at resort prices. Also for biking enthusiasts. Very convenient to good restaurants in downtown Rutland. Super clean. JT was great!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My family and I came up for a reunion in Castleton and JT's place was absolutely perfect! He was very responsive, flexible with arrival/departure times, and super friendly! We met with him at the connected bike workshop when we arrived and he gave us a tour around the place. The apartment was bigger than the pictures, the bathroom was clean, and the beds were very comfortable. Having a washer/dryer in the unit was a nice bonus and if you're only in town for a few days (and don't want to brew your own coffee) there is a dunkin right around the corner. We will definitely be booking this rental again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious and clean. Just a walk away from downtown Rutland. Perfect spot for tourists looking to enjoy the activities in Vermont - road cycling, running, mountain biking. There is a bike shop on site as well!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I really enjoyed Joseph‚Äôs place. It was basically spotless. The beds were super comfy as well!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"JT was an excellent host. He welcomed us personally and gave us good recommendations for dinner and breakfast. He has a bike shop in the garage of the house, and when we asked about e-bikes, he took the time to explain what to look for in a good one and even did a demonstration at our request!
The home is older but well built and comfortable inside; simply decorated and not cluttered. It was furnished with everything we needed.
Since the house is on a main road, we were concerned about noise, but the traffic quieted down in the evening, and it wasn't an issue."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay. It is a very short ride to pine hill park trails and also to town center with restaurants and bakeries. Pine Hill Park is a great little trail system with lots of variety. The road is a bit busy and loud. Would definitely stay here again. Joseph was very helpful with knowledge of local MTB trails.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joseph was incredibly accommodating and helpful throughout the visit. He was always helpful with any needs we had and so friendly. His place is very homey and comfortable-nice big kitchen, living room and dining room, which was great for being able to have common areas for work and visiting. There‚Äôs acreage behind the house for walking‚Ä¶I found it such a comfortable place to spend time."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Small simple bedroom & bathroom, but what made it really interesting was the full on bike shop downstairs.
Joseph is an outdoor enthusiast with a love for skateboarding & biking among other things. Was really fun to have conversations about living a simple life, pursuing one's passions & living fully. I realize not every visitor is looking for deep conversations with their host, but I found Joseph himself and the home & bike ship he built to be the highlight of my stay !"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean and spacious.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay. JT was very friendly and accommodating. The living and kitchen spaces are shared but the bedroom and bathroom are private and on the other side of the house. Has close proximity to hiking and biking trails as well as about a mile to downtown Rutland. Will stay again if we are in the area.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Joseph was ab excellent host and very friendly! Always down for a good conversation and an accommodating host. The location is awesome if you‚Äôre looking to drive around Vermont for the different ski hills and the town or Rutland has a ton of places to eat. Great location at a great price!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joseph is a friendly, well-communicating host that provided a great place to stay for skiing!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was well worth the money. JT was a great host, gave good local recommendations and was very personable and helpful. The space was as described, clean and had everything I needed. Perfect low key stay for someone looking to ski/bike Killington as it was a short easy 20 minute drive to the mountain."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy room, solid house. Nice walk to most of Rutland. Great host."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"JT was a great host. Super communicative, easy going / flexible (I got in past midnight for check-in and he was super chill and nice about it). I‚Äôve never shared a common space in an Airbnb before so this was a first, but I would say everything was exactly as advertised and as described in the other positive reviews I‚Äôd read. The place was clean and you get basically a private wing, with the bedroom, an extra room, and the bathroom, all sectioned off from the rest of the common space by a door. But I also really enjoyed chatting with JT too, so all around a great experience. Also, the bed was comfortable, there‚Äôs a Dyson space heater that worked really well and kept the room nice and warm, the bathroom was large and clean, and the shower was good. Definitely recommend staying here if you‚Äôre looking for a more affordable option near Killington!"
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Great spot if you‚Äôre wanting to shred some snow on Killington/Pico. Joseph is very friendly and everything was clean. Didn‚Äôt have a dedicated private area to work from and not a lot of furniture but other than that, great spot."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,JT was awesome. Very communicative and always in touch. Everything was great and he gave us killer restaurant recommendations while visiting for a shred weekend at Killington. Place is right outside downtown Rutland and 25 min from Killington. Awesome time! Might have to come up and stay in the summer to do some biking next!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"JT was a good host, very responsive and friendly. We had our own space with 2 large rooms, plenty of room to spread out. Simple but functional furnishings."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is 5-star and Joseph was incredibly accommodating. He even picked me up at Amtrak - and the train was 45 minutes late! Great messaging! Great location! Great accommodations! And if you live bikes - like I do - all the better!!

Close to downtown Rutland which has gentrified pretty nicely
Low price, especially cleaning price made this stay a very good value

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hands down the best Airbnb host I‚Äôve had or could have hoped for! From beginning to end, Joseph was incredibly accommodating, welcoming, and kind.

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super comfortable bed with a large clean bathroom. It's also in a great location just outside of a town with everything you could want.

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There are not many places where you feel at home. That was the one. The reason for is host.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful apartment with everything you would need! The location was super convenient for skiing, but was very loud (on main road).

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This apartment has everything an out-of-towner could want. We arrived really late at night but the host, Tami, made check-in convenient and contactless. Not only that, but she was super thoughtful. Knowing we were coming in from a looooong day on the road in really hot weather, she turned on the ACs so the apartment was a cool oasis when we arrived. We slept so well that night. The apartment itself is clean and modern. It has great amenities; nice new appliances including a washer, dryer and dishwasher; an enormous TV with AppleTV and sound system; fast and stable WiFi, a work station... just everything I could possibly want. The location is convenient to so many things. We discovered Stewart's homemade ice cream just a few blocks away. We strolled to a bar downtown to listen to live music.

I will say that the walls are a bit thin (no fault of the owner) so if you are a light sleeper then perhaps it‚Äôs not a good fit. But the space was clean, very easy to find, and the fresh baked cookies of course were a wonderful touch."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Stayed for a night, and we wished we would have stayed longer! Rachael‚Äôs place was much more than we imagined- clean, tidy, spunky, exciting. Very close to various small towns which makes it so central to explore by car! When we come back we will definitely be staying here :) PS if you get the chance to meet the woman who lives at the front of the property, consider yourself lucky!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I love it

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Rachael was an excellent host. She was willing to extend our stay when our closing was rescheduled, even offered to rent us parking for our moving truck if we needed to leave it there. She's a great host!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a perfect little spot for us! We look forward to staying next year. Thank you for everything!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed staying at this charming Barbiecore house. It was cozy, comfortable, and a quick drive to downtown. Rachael was super responsive and provided everything we needed.
We particularly appreciated the attention to detail including the pink lacroix in the fridge! We recommend it anyone staying in that area.üëç"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The room was amazing. Met all of our expectations and more. It was clean and smelled very good. Had the best time. Definitely recommend staying here. Amazing views and restaurants only minutes away ie The Garlic. By far our favorite trip yet. 10/10
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"even better than a BARBIE DREAM HOUSE YALL. My boyfriend and I loved this stay so much. The amenities and aesthetics were exceptional!!! The whole apartment is so lovely. The record player (with a couple of records featured) and bluetooth option were an incredible touch she painted pink herself‚ò∫Ô∏è Definitely High vibrations at this stay. Really good spot to stay at if you want to walk downtown and in the summer has an amazing farmers market on Saturdays!
She‚Äôs super friendly, a great designer, and has an awesome guide with what places to hit in the area! Nothing to worry about here- just book it."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Rachael‚Äôs place was so cute and clean. Quick easy walk to the Amtrak station with a nice stop for coffee along the way. Would definitely stay here again!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Loved staying here, it met all my pink expectations, and then some!! Was a super cozy place to stay, and we loved being able to bring our dog after the sitter cancelled. Rachael was so nice, and she even told me where she got all her wallpaper, so I can get myself some!! Loved the stay, can‚Äôt say enough good things. My boyfriend even thought it was cool!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place was everything to us. One of the coolest, coziest places we've gotten to stay maybe ever. We had a long month of subparly accomadated farm stays leading up to our stay. There are so many spectacular little details around. I loved all of the lights. They were all super sensory friendly as was the rest of the decor for a neurodivergent after a tortuous long drive. We were able to relax in a lowkey stimulating environment. There need to be more places like this!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Stayed here to attend a drag show at Merchant‚Äôs Hall and it was definitely the vibe! The maximalist decor was so fun and energetic.
The space was comfortable with a nice bed and the cute couch. We didn‚Äôt utilize the kitchen but it was nice to have if you‚Äôre staying longer.
It was walkable to downtown Rutland if you are used to walking. Walking back at night wasn‚Äôt a problem.
Highly recommend this experience for a girl‚Äôs trip, visiting Rutland for a drag show, or just getting decor inspiration."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Rachael‚Äôs place is one of a kind. Modern and funky which you can see from the photos. Squeaky clean and well equipped with everything one would need. The highlight for me was the record player. She had The Police, Synchronicity, one of my all time favorite albums. The place is pet friendly and Rachael left two doggie treats for my pooch. I will certainly be back!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such an amazing find!! So beautiful and clean. Great location and Rachael was such a great host! Would definitely come back for another stay!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a cute AirBnB! Rachael is a great host. She's responsive and clear. I goofed and misread the directions, but Rachael helped me out within minutes. I would stay again and recommend to others!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Rachael‚Äôs place is quite a unique stay, and that is something I look forward to in an Airbnb stay! My husband and I were on a road trip though New England and Rachel‚Äôs place had good location at a great price so it worked out perfect. While purple is my favorite color, I definitely enjoyed all of the upbeat pink decor! Was a big fan of the clawfoot bathtub as well. Great communication, clear instructions, would stay again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If the color pink offends you, look elsewhere. I had a very nice stay. Easy to find and the bed was comfortable. Neon signs and disco balls were great too. Didn't explore the area much but it seemed like things were close and walkable."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved Rachel and her approchability :)
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Rachel is a great host, very communicative and friendly. Her place was a great place for us and our dogs to crash for the night, it is very pink which I thought was cool but might not be for everyone."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was up for the eclipse and had a wonderful stay. The place was huge and equipped with everything we needed. Comfortable and big enough for 6 of us. The only problem was the stairs since 3 of us were over 65. But that is our age not the apartment's fault LOL
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great place near great skiing
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"We love this place! Convenient to go to ski resorts. Fits perfect for 6 adults with enough beds and restrooms. Hot water runs with no problem as well. Clean, quiet, and peaceful. We‚Äôll mark this place and come back next ski season"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great spacious place to stay in Rutland. 20min to Pico and maybe 30 to Killington. Place was bigger than expected which was great. Location seems strange at first (next to radio station) but once inside it is lovely and feels very private. Host was responsive to small issues. Would stay again.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was just as described. It is on the first floor, so approximately 18 steps, which was not a problem for us. What was important to us, it was 30 min from Killington Ski resort."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This AirBnB was a great value. You can tell it‚Äôs new (which means clean üëç) The beds and bedding were very comfortable. It was fun to tune into the radio station based out of the same property! Appliances are all new and work great. Loved the heater in the bathroom in the cold winter. Would return here for our next ski holiday!

Definitely recommend if you are looking for an affordable and nice place to stay for your trip to Vermont!
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"We were 6 adults plus a toddler and fit into this spacious rental just fine. The place was very clean. James (and Mike) were communicative prior to our arrival date and gave clear instructions on entry, etc.
There is a Keurig but not a coffee maker, for a large party you may want to bring one. I had checked with Mike ahead so knew to be prepared."
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"It has a beautiful mountain look from all windows, living space is big, nice kitchen with feebees and coffee to enjoy. I got a great value being the first guest of the apartment. Host was friendly and responsive! Highly recommend!!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is great! We stayed here so that we could be close to Killington & Okemo mountain, which turned out to be a great decision. There is plenty of space in the driveway for unloading/loading snowboards and other equipment. There is a Starbucks, chipotle, Walmart, Walgreens, restaurants and other stores <5 minute drive away. Neighborhood feels safe. The house was clean and enough space for 2 people. Also, Sravya responds quickly and with care!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sravyas rental was exactly as offered. It is on the third floor and was quite quiet. The apartment had a very comfortable couch and bed. This is a great location to spend a few night. It is close to downtown but far enough away for it to be quiet.
I would stay here again and would recommend anyone looking for a place to say."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place to stay while in the Rutland area.

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was very beautiful. The neighborhood was a little poor but still felt safe. The directions were clear and Sravya even gave us names of places to eat and things to do. The floors hadn't been well washed, as well as a few dishwashing items, but that's the only thing. Very satisfying for our 2 nights!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was just as described and perfect for our needs.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Will visit again
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Stayed at Sravya‚Äôs while visiting our son‚Äôs college, perfect spot for our needs. Helpful and timely information and easy check in made the trip real smooth. Thanks!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was lovely! I enjoyed the quiet location, and the downtown was well within walking distance. Sravya was extremely helpful, and even happily reimbursed me for something I needed for my stay that wasn‚Äôt even listed. Would definitely recommend this host and this location."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is very cute in a very large old house. But don't let that throw you off, all of Rutland is old! Very historic area.
I love the old kitchen. The place was very homey.
I felt very safe in the neighborhood.
Great place to stay when visiting your adult children and need to have your own space."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sravya responded quickly to my late afternoon request for a stay that same night. The place was clean plus had some things that I appreciated, like coffee for the coffee maker. I was comfortable and happy with my stay."

2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,üëçüèΩ
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sravya was an incredibly accommodating host and just generally very nice person! Rutland is a very cute and walkable town and it was very easy to feel at home throughout the trip. I definitely plan on coming back in the future!!
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sravya's place was great for the long weekend in which we visited family. It was quiet and comfortable. There was sufficient pans to make a quick breakfast. It is also within walking distance to downtown Rutland. The stairs to the apartment are very steep and narrow, so it would not be a good place for anyone with mobility issues. Fortunately, we can still manage the stairs, so we would stay there again."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Sravya was very responsive to my questions and provided clear instructions for my self-check-in. The apartment was clean and cozy with nice furnishings, complimentary wine, wifi, and everything I needed for a one night stay. My only comment about the lovely interior is that some of the blinds have broken slats which means you can't completely cover the windows. The unit is in an apartment building with other renters and there were a lot of people coming and going from the apartment downstairs in the evening, although after 10pm it was very quiet. The neighborhood is a run-down rental neighborhood and not a really lovely setting when you walk out the front door. As a woman staying there alone I was slightly uncertain about the neighborhood. Sravya assured me that it was a safe neighborhood so I took her word for it and slept soundly. My one suggestion is that I would have liked more secure locks on the doors. All in all it's a lovely place to stay for the price."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great place nice and cozy
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at Sravya‚Äôs place. It‚Äôs at a good location and it‚Äôs very clean. We would recommend it to anyone visiting Rutland!
2023-03-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The host is a good communicator and accommodating. However, the house was not cleaned before check in due to an cleaner issue."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in this apartment for almost a week for our Killington ski trip. It was very comfortable and had everything we needed. Sravya was very friendly, responsive and accommodating to our needs."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was comfortable, clean and everything we needed for our stay. The kitchen and bathroom included the necessary items, quality toiletries and a welcome bottle of wine. Sravya proactively provided all the details for a stress free stay."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sravya's place was really great for our 3-day trip to the Killington area. The place was clean and had a nice homey feeling to it. Sravya is a very attentive host as well.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay! Everything was clean and the space was cozy. Sravya was extremely responsive and gave us check-in and check-out details that made the whole experience super easy. Great location for skiing at Killington and Pico. Highly recommend!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We were up in the area to ski and we were looking for an affordable place to stay when we came across Sravya‚Äôs place. It was exactly what we were thinking for and we would stay here again.
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Good spot very close to downtown and close enough to Killington Mountain!
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Very clean‚Ä¶ in the middle between okemo and killington as far as location. Kitchen is outdated, but for a 1 or 2 night stay, perfect!!!!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for a stressless stay.
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Overall a pretty cozy stay. We came to town for a ski trip so we just needed a spot to sleep and maybe spend a few hours watching TV which it was well suited for. It is an older apartment so the stairs to go up are pretty steep and narrow but once you‚Äôre inside it‚Äôs fairly spacious. My main complaint was that the bed was a little rickety which was amplified by being on a creaky floor in the bedroom. All in all it was a good value though and wasn‚Äôt too far from the slopes or any other local attractions.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and nice, responded right away"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, comfortable apartment with nice decor. 15-20min walk to downtown area with great restaurants. Sravya's place is exactly as pictured and described in the listing!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay for a spur of the moment trip to Killington. Minutes from great food and restaurants in Downtown Rutland and a twenty minute drive to the slopes. Place was warm and cozy. Definitely try The Yellow Deli!
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here due to the proximity to Killington. It was very easy to get to and from the resort. The location is convenient to several good restaurants and Walmart where we picked up some supplies.
Sravya was very responsive throughout the duration of our stay. It was particularly cold while we were in town and the heaters had some trouble heating up the unit. Sravya sent someone right away to check on the furnace for us.
The unit was pretty minimal; we were given one towel each and I didn't see any extra blankets. It was enough for us as just a place to sleep after a long day of skiing. We did notice the walls were kind of thin and it was possible to hear the neighbors talking."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Good overall.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice host, place was exactly what was described."
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This is very nice and cozy 2nd floor apartment, easy to find, quiet street and close to some local resturant too. only 25 mins drive from the killington ski area.
We travelled with 2 kids and managed to sleep in sofa bed in the living room and queen size bed in the bedroom. Bathroom is clean with very good hot water.
Overall very nice place to stay."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cozy house in a great location near ski slopes.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a slight hiccup upon arrival. I contacted the host and she responded right away and got the matter squared away immediately. I would definitely recommend this place to stay. It was well worth the nightly charge.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, cute place. Thank You for the bottle of wine you left that was a great touch."
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a cute place in Rutland and very close to downtown was perfect for our 2 night stay. It was convenient to get around. The place does have steep stairs getting into the apartment but we were fine with it and had no problems. However, the bed was a little uncomfortable and that's an easy fix. Sravya was communicative and was easily accessible through messages. We'd surely come back."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing Air BNB perfect location, quiet neighbors, and amazing hosts!!!!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot! Easy check in, easy to find, cozy, and comfortable. I would certainly recommend it and stay here again."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Sravya's place was nice and well kept. The stairs are a steep challenge for an older out of shape guy but well noted in the description of the property.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here for our girls trip. The sleeping areas were great. There were plenty of amenities. Check in was super easy. The entry stairs were a bit steep but it‚Äôs an older house so that, Makes complete sense. Comfortable bed, good kitchen and bathroom, and nice sitting room. Sravya was easy to reach out to and quick to respond."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay, relaxing with Netflix on a comfy couch. Everything we needed was there. We appreciated the spacious closets for hanging our clothes."

The neighborhood is fundamentally quiet and residential, although during our stay there was one loud neighbor."

-there were five throw pillows in the living room of various sizes that we tried using i by the bedroom.
Two couches in living room, large kitchen, no dining table.
Very poor lighting.
Ceiling fan in living room was dangerously low. I hit my hand on it while changing my shirt. I‚Äôve never had that happen with a ceiling fan ever.
Not a restful stay."

2022-07-01,3.0,Stayed one night,The area was less than ideal home was cute but not comfortable as far as no air conditioner and being on the second floor. The stairs are a little scary but that all I honestly have to say for negativity home is cute and spacious host seems very friendly.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a great stay & would stay here again. Tons of room in the unit, worked super well for a part vacation-part work remote trip. Sharon is a great host and made sure we were right at home when we arrived. The place was comfortable and had everything we needed.
The beds were notably comfortable (my friend kept commenting on how well she was sleeping!). The space was functional and adequate for two people space teleworking, with separate spaces so we could be on calls at the same time or making lunch and not disturbing each other. It‚Äôs also an easy and comfortable walk to downtown Rutland, for food shopping, restaurants, and other shopping/events."

It is very spacious, comfortable and homey, exactly as described and worked well as a base for my trip. Sharon is a very responsive host. She met me when I arrived and showed me around which was very helpful. The house is peaceful and on a quiet street. There is dedicated off street parking. I recommend Sharon's place which is an excellent value for someone seeking a less expensive housing option."

2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a nice week at Sharon's home in Rutland. It was a comfortable and spacious place, and we were able to walk to town and easily get to nearby skiing and hiking spots. The home itself could use a little updating, but it was a good deal for the price and we enjoyed our time out of the city. Sharon was lovely and welcoming, and very easy to communicate with."

It has a warm, welcoming feeling as does the host, Sharon, whose graciousness and kindness we'll never forget. She adds to the personality of the house which is filled with an aura that makes you feel that you are home. And that's the bottom line. Sharon's place is a lot like home. As if you're supposed to be there. As if you're not a guest but rather that you live there. It was overall the nicest Airbnb experience we ever had."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Stayed for a month and enjoyed the extra space to work from home and have some guests stop by. Sharon is very friendly and quickly responded to any questions or needs.
Walkable to downtown. Parking is tight for 2 larger vehicles."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Amazing home, comfortable and spacious, much bigger than expected. Also lots of light and very good temperature control. We stayed two months in winter and it was always warm and comfortable inside.
Sharon is fantastic host! She regularly inquired if we need anything and we felt so welcome. She took great care of us and made us feel at home.
We skied at Killington which was a short drive away. Lots of restaurant options and very good grocery within walking distance.
Kitchen and bathroom were very well supplied with everything we needed for the long stay.
We had a very good time in Sharon's apartment and are looking forward to being back next season."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I had a wonderful extended stay with Sharon! She went above and beyond to make me feel at home, even hand drawing me a map of a bunch of walking/hiking spots nearby. The place is so spacious - I was able to really spread out and enjoy. The kitchen had everything I could need, and the bed was comfortable. The neighborhood was quiet and the driveway was a great place to park! The house is older, but I ran into no issues with critters or anything. The internet works great!"
2022-08-01,2.0,Stayed over a week,"The host is very welcoming, helpful, responsive and accommodaing. The location is very convenient - 10 min walk to the town center. The house is old with lots of character, but it is at the point when the charm can no longer compensate for the needed renovation. Unfortunately, I had to move out after spending 2 nights, because there was a mouse in the kitchen."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time staying in Sharon's first-floor apartment while moving to Vermont from out of state. The place was very big and the kitchen well-enough equipped to cook most meals at home. She accommodated my request to set up the third bedroom with a work table and office chair, and I had a very good Internet connection that enabled me to work from ""home"" while there. Sharon made us feel at home in Vermont and had lots of useful tips about where to shop and what to do around Rutland. The location was great, only a short walk from downtown and a short drive from a number of shopping centers."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We loved staying at Sharon's place for nearly two months during our move back to Vermont (late Spring/early Summer).

Also nice was three bedrooms, two for sleeping and one for storage and a remote office! Functional kitchen for when we needed to cook and in-unit laundry. A charming house with lots of character. The one issue we had was fixed within an hour. Sharon is super responsive also helped me with local recommendations too numerous to mention. Pretty yard and grounds and off-street parking! We would stay again and not hesitate to recommend."

I would definitely stay here again if I‚Äôm ever in the area."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Staying at Sharon‚Äôs place was great. It‚Äôs a great location that is central to all the things in Rutland and a good hub to get to pretty much anywhere else In Vermont - only a 20 minute drive to killington. The scenery is GORGEOUS being surrounded by mountains everywhere.
Sharon is a great host. She did everything to make my stay pleasant and was a true pleasure. I was by myself so didn‚Äôt need all the space but it would be a great place for a group as well.
This is an old house with a lot of charm. For me, that works. If you want something fancy and modern this may not be for you."

2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sharon‚Äôs place was great! Very spacious. The apartment has its own driveway so parking was super easy. Sharon was very kind and helpful.

We drove into a historic looking neighborhood, full of beautiful old northern homes, with friendly neighbors sitting on their porches. Sharon met us outside and showed us into the first floor unit. It is a warm and inviting space and it is very evident that she takes great care in the home, both in cleanliness and in the way of hospitality. There were gorgeous fresh cut peonies in a vase and the beds were perfectly made. We all felt right at home. When I asked her if she had a hair dryer, she responded within a minute and the next minute was downstairs with one.
Everything was just perfect. I really couldn‚Äôt ask for anything more!"

The house was clean, the beds firm and clean, the water pressure is great and there's plenty of hot water.

2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This a great value. So much room to spread out. So clean. Rutland is a bit of a drive away from Killington but the room and proximity to Rutland shops/etc. makes it worth the drive. Sharon is very helpful and accomodating.

We would definitely return and stay with Sharon again.
,,,"house has a video surveillance. cameras were not turned off after entering the house.
She kicked us out of the her house with 2 young children when outside snow storm. I had to go home at the risk of my family's life."
,,,Bernie's place is next to a neighbor that operates some kind of body shop out of the yard. Super noisy and felt unsafe about the general neighborhood. We ended up driving overnight to our next stop and not staying.
,,,"I had to leave a day early because of rude behavior by the host. I felt uncomfortable when he remonstrated me about something I was not aware of or should have been. There were no light bulbs in the fixtures of the entrance room to the bedroom I believe that to be a safety issue. He has extension cord wiring in the bathroom with blue painters tape holding it against the wall above the sink. The house smells of stale beans and wood smoke. During my stay was an extremely cold spell and the one Dyson Space Heater did not suffice
There are stains all over the carpet where the guest area is located, especially coming up the stairs. I was not expecting 4-5 star accommodations for the price I paid.
And the wifi is really bad or doesn't work at all."
