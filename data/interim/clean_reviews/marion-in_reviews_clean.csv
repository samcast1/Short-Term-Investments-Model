2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lasana is an amazing host! She was very attentive with my stay. The home felt like home.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Listing was as described and matched the photos. Host was responsive with any questions I had. The garage is a nice feature so you don’t have to leave your vehicle outside in an unknown area, although the neighborhood seemed very safe and friendly. The backyard is a nice space to hang out and relax with family/friends and is private with the fenced in yard. Would definitely recommend this property to anyone and if I’m in the area again would definitely stay here again."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"This was one of the best Airbnbs we've ever stayed at! The home was clean and updated, the beds were comfortable, and it was a short drive to everything we needed. The host was responsive and SO kind! We would 100% stay here again."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a cool and unique place, with an awesome host to boot! Getting to stay in an authentic Frank Lloyd Wright home is a rare opportunity. The home itself still has most of what look like the original fixtures, and is true to the architect's vision. Matthew was always super welcoming and responsive. An added bonus for kids: there is a really great park right around the corner with an awesome playground. We hope to be back soon!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We found this Gem available for our last minute travel plans, that also allowed our four legged family members.
We are Frank Lloyd Wright fans and this masterpiece was everything we could have imagined and more.
We were blown away by the house and the amazing park down the street. Just perfect for a little getaway and immersed in a gorgeous piece of history."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I enjoyed spending a weekend at Woodside with my family and friends. The adults, including two architects, got to learn about the house while the kids explored the grounds. We were to go out to eat, but the kitchen was so well equipped we cooked instead."
2024-04-01,4,Group trip,"Such a treat to experience this home! Each view is something to pause and take in.
Know that the house has quirks and you have to be flexible to look past them. Best to travel with close friends / family."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay at Woodside!!! If you're passionate about interior design or architecture, staying in a Frank Lloyd Wright house is an unparalleled experience. It wasn't just a place to stay; it was a chance to live within a work of art. This particular Airbnb was exceptional, offering a well-preserved example of Wright's genius. For any design enthusiast, it's an opportunity not to be missed."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I cannot express how beautiful and seamless this experience was. An incredible slice or architectural history and such an enjoyable stay.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The pictures really don’t do the Frank Lloyd Wright House justice! It is beautiful and Matthew made our family Christmas special.
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"We had the most magical stay at Woodside. Words can’t describe the warmth and comfort that emanate from each room. But if you know anything about this house I’m guessing you know that already! So here are the other details of our stay- the place was spotless, the kitchen had everything you could ever need, and the beds were super comfortable. The owner, Matthew, is hands down the most responsive and helpful Airbnb host I’ve ever encountered. It’s clear that he’s doing everything possible to maintain it exactly FLlW would see fit. Don’t pass up the opportunity to immerse yourself in this work of art!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a unique experience to stay and feel what it’s like to live in a Frank Lloyd Wright House. The house is unexpected and peaceful. The heated flooring so cozy. We really enjoyed our stay at Woodside.
The bed arrangement is slightly different than in the pictures. On one wing there is a large master room with a king bed, and adjacent bathroom. A single twin bed in a room with seperate bathroom, as well. On the other wing is a bedroom with a single bed & a bedroom with a full sized bed. Both those have an en-suite with shared shower. Next to that those two rooms is a sitting room with fireplace and balcony. There is also a powder room off the main hallway. The main living room is amazing with the high ceilings large fireplace, big windows and tipi inspired architectural details. A true treasure and treat to stay in!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Amazing house, comfortable beds, very well-equipped kitchen. We had a great time."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you. We have had a great time there with golden Fall times
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Really cool!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,It’s hard to put into words staying at Woodside. You feel like you’re transported back in time to a beautiful piece of history. I’m so grateful for the short time I was able to stay and can’t wait to go back!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place is beautiful. We really enjoyed our time here and felt really at home. It’s a 70 year old historic home so it comes with some wear and tear, but it’s part of the experience. This was our honeymoon and we look forward to coming back to visit soon. Matthew was extremely responsive and he helped us find the booklets on the history of the home. If you are a Frank Lloyd Wright fan, I highly recommend taking a look through it."
2023-09-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"Loved getting to enjoy first hand the architecture and seeing how the lighting changed the vibes. Seating and beds were comfortable. The kitchen was phenomenal. Loved cooking meals there. The house sound system was nice.
A few things we didn’t enjoy so much- the back door was open on arrival. Everything was fine except it was hot. It took time to cool down and the main air unit became noisy and annoying.
The house is dated and needs some repairs. The electrical system appears to be original to the house. Many of the switches did not work or were touchy. There were areas where tiles were missing on the floors and in the bathrooms. There were no shower curtains and the jacuzzi tub was not functional.
The main bedroom was musty and hot. A window unit cooled it down but the result was cool musty air.

The outdoor deck should be replaced. It bounced when walked on and the steps were falling apart.
While we enjoyed the experience overall I don’t feel it was worth the $$$."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"It was a thrill to stay in a Frank Lloyd Wright home. We very much enjoyed our stay. We’ll equipped kitchen. Wonderful outdoor terrace. Clean, neat house. Spacious. Huge living room. Beautiful artwork. Kid’s wing. Wonderful grounds. As those of you that understand the complexities and oddities of a old Frank Lloyd Wright house, this one, too, is a work in progress and upkeep. The owner is obviously working to maintain the property. But don’t expect everything to be in pristine condition. The owner is great to work with; very responsive and understanding. I hope to stay there again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Davis House is a rare ascending space in Wright's oeuvre, a Usonian house that seems to combine the characteristics of the Guggenheim Museum. Rare blue print drawings can also be seen. The owner is very helpful and friendly. It was a very impressive stay. Thank you very much."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a wonderfully preserved Frank Lloyd Wright home and in great condition. A must-do for any Frank Lloyd Wright fan. Plus it's in a very quiet area, perfect for a weekend getaway. Loved it!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and unique home, Matthew is a great host!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing!
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"I grew up in this town and always wondered what the house looked like on the inside. Then I married a BSU architecture grad and big fan of FLW. So fast-forward many years when we had to travel back to Marion for a family wedding - it seemed like the best place for our family to stay while in town. It was also for a special treat for my husband.
It was everything we expected and had such a cool factor. It’s unique and quirky and exactly what an original FLW house should be. It was an amazing experience to stay in this home.
Matthew was responsive and a great host. The house is fully stocked and the kitchen has everything you need…and then some!
What a gem."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We feel privileged to have been allowed to stay at this landmark. We enjoyed exploring the fascinating story behind it. It is very beautiful. The owner was responsive and helpful.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a great time and am looking forward to staying again.
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,We had a great stay and it was exactly what we expected. Matthew was a great host and if we had any questions he was always available to talk to. The kitchen was wonderful. We enjoyed learning about the history of the house. We hope to be making reservations to stay there again soon.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Five Stars all around for this house and the host! Staying in a Frank Lloyd Wright house is a fantastic experience! Each different time of the day/night showed light and shadows that were so intentional and picturesque. Our daughter is a huge architecture fan; this was a fun way to create lifelong memories with her! Matthew was an incredibly generous host with his time and he shared stories about the house and previous owners. He had a fire ready for us to start in the fireplace, which was magical! We were planning to go out to eat, but the grocery store was only a mile away, so we made steaks and had all the trimmings. Super easy! Thank you for everything, Matthew! We highly recommend this getaway and look forward to returning!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A very rare opportunity to stay in a Frank Lloyd Wright architected home - we loved it! We came for a weekend to stay for my friend's 60th birthday. She is a huge FLW fan, and we surprised her with this trip. We were blown away by the architectural integrity, the documentation that was provided telling about the home and the history, and the high end appliances in the kitchen. Matthew answered all of our questions promptly, and was a joy to work with on this stay. The home has tons of room, and was more than what we four needed. We loved being able to stay in this home which is on the registry of historic places as well! The caretaker had a fire built and ready for us to light in the iron stove, and we took advantage of that. If you are looking for a peaceful escape and a place to cozy in for a few days, you couldn't go wrong here."
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,Great stay in a unique home. Nearby Matter Park has a great disc golf course. The full kitchen was great.
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,I was looking for a unique and memorable place to take the family to celebrate New Years Eve. This place exceeded all of my expectations and left us with such wonderful memories. How often do you get to spend a night in a museum? The Host was super responsive and you can tell loved to be able to share his piece of history. A great experience I highly recommend.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a great stay in this FLW house. Enjoyed the wonderful kitchen and the expansive great room with fireplace (wood stove). Matt was a very responsive host and made check-in super easy. This was a wonderful post-Christmas relaxing retreat for our family.
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"In the theme of Thanksgiving: We were grateful for the following:
1) Matthew sharing his incredible Frank Lloyd Wright home with us.
2) The well stocked kitchen to prepare our lovely Thanksgiving meal.
3) The opportunity to be with each other in front of a roaring fire.
4) The extremely relaxing weekend because the home is located in a very quiet neighborhood.
5) The mild weather, so that we were able to take advantage of the backyard and look at the brilliant night sky.
Our experience was magical. We will be back!!!!😊😊😊"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very nice experience for FLW admirers.
2022-09-01,3,Stayed with kids,Timeless architecture. Good location. Easy check-in. Responsive host. No hot baths.
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,Amazing historic home
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We're grateful for the chance to stay at Woodside and to explore Marion. Such a treat to stay over at a Frank Lloyd Wright home and read its history and explore the design. Wonderful location and great, easygoing host. Highly recommend!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay at Woodside. The spaces are extraordinary and the kitchen is fit for a chef! Thanks for sharing your Usonian treasure with us!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Walk in and see the true hand of the master. One room, thousands of angles, it’s amazing. How many Frank Lloyd Wright houses can you stay in for two days?…a handful and less every year. Don’t wait. Thank you Matthew"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Not many opportunities to stay in a Frank Lloyd Wright house and there couldn’t be a better host. Matt was super helpful and check in was flawless. Our group really enjoyed it. We opt for Air BnBs for work trips so we can relax more and this was just the ticket. We will be back next year for the same event.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a must stay, especially for architecture fans. Frank Lloyd Wright home from 1955. The design is amazing. Huge ceilings, long hallways with tons of windows allow for a great breeze throughout the home. With 3 fireplaces, this would be great and cozy in the winter.
If you have many friends, definitely a group area, with all private rooms, enough bathrooms to go around, and a well stocked kitchen for any and all cooking needs.
The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful, and at night it's quite easy to see all the stars you don't see in a city.
A large deck and yard provide enough space to hangout with friends without crowding, and have a fire or two on chilly nights.
Everything was clean,tidy, and welcoming for our stay. It was great to see that there were some updates to the home, but most of it is kept original to FLW design.
The host communicated quickly to answer any questions we had, and check-in was easy and painless, letting us get right to enjoying this beautiful home."
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,Precious experience. You have to stay at this house to fully appreciate it. Matthew was quick to respond to all of our needs. Very gracious host.
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"It's a legit Frank Lloyd Wright house! It's beautiful and has a lot of history. The outdoor area was great, and the indoor+outdoor sound system was fun.
The accommodations were more rustic than we expected. It felt more like glamping than a luxury home. Only one room had working air conditioning, and the house was generally pretty old. For example, we didn't open some of the doors because of visible bugs and cobwebs on the outside. The furnishing are in need of an update - such as shower fixtures . For the price, we expected better amenities than a motley assortment of old soap bottles on the floor of the shower.
The kitchen was great, and we cooked a lot. We had some issue with plumbing, though, and the fridge has a noisy pump that causes an unpleasant reverberation throughout the kitchen.
The listing said that there was a stationary bike, but it was in a separate building that was locked and inaccessible."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cannot describe how special this place is! A true gem. The special attention given to light within the home is unreal. How the sunlight hits each room at particular times of the day gives such insight into how thoughtful this piece of architecture truly is. Thank you, Frank Lloyd Wright and thank you, Matthew!"
2022-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Great spot for architect buffs. There are original blueprints you can look at and a 20 page document written by the original owner about his relationship with FLW and the building process. Very cool spot. An ideal destination in the fall or winter.. we went while there was a heat wave and the AC struggled to work.
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"The house is amazing and beautiful. It is a historic home and is purposely staged and maintained in a way that is authentic to the times of its design. There are books, photos, and documents about the history and designer which are fascinating. There are some quirks to this home because of its uniqueness, but it did not detract from our stay. It was an amazing place for us!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Matthew was really helpful and communicative. The house itself was simply amazing and it was an opportunity of a lifetime to spend a whole day exploring every part of the house, from original features to later upgrades. Oh, and all the other reviews are right - the kitchen has all you could ever ask for!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Highly recommended for FLW fans. And very grateful that Matthew shares it with everyone. Check-in was simple, communication was excellent, and the house exceeded our expectations. Matthew went above and beyond."
2022-05-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"This is a classic Frank Lloyd Wright home, and it should be experienced. Mattew has great communications, and the home was great for the 6 of us to enjoy."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Woodside was such a fantastic place to stay. If you like FLW and have ever wanted to stay in one of his properties, this is a fantastic opportunity to do so. The neighborhood is quiet and serene. The house has a fantastic kitchen and fireplaces to get stuck in and enjoy yourself!"
2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,A very unique home in a residential neighborhood with otherwise conventionally designed homes on generous treed lots. Nearby park has very nice public garden with fanciful sculptures and fountains.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,One of a kind experience. Great house with lots of privacy when you want it with fantastic shared spaces when everyone is together.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home and thoughtful touches to give people an opportunity to enjoy a FLW home.
2021-07-01,4,Group trip,What can you say about the thrill of staying in a home designed by Frank Lloyd Wright? There was a unique feature around every turn! Matthew’s furnishings compliment the space so well. This is an old home that needs to be treated with respect.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This home was amazing. The spaces are so unique. We wish we got to spend more time in the home as it was a quick in and out trip. But definitely encourage anyone who is a fan of unique stays to book this home!
2021-04-01,5,Group trip,"Great opportunity to stay in a FLW creation. The owner added décor adds to the overall experience. The kitchen has everything needed to prepare a gourmet meal. We wanted for nothing in this gorgeous home. I live close and will definitely rent again, and will suggest it to everyone.
I brought my own plates, pots, bakeware and flatware because I did not know what to expect. There was plenty of the owners items to have left mine at home. There are stemless wineglasses available that pairs well with the huge wine cooler including room for your favorite bottles. Linens and towels are nice quality and plentiful.
The price tag might look high, but the experience was worth every penny. This is not just a place to rest your head; it is a place to enjoy."
2020-11-01,5,Group trip,"What an amazingly unique home! Staying in this original Wright home is something all of us will remember. The available articles and history of the home were great to read and gave a good perspective. There is plenty of space to spread out and/or entertain. The two distinct ""wings"" make it very accommodating for a multiple family gathering. We'll definitely consider coming back."
2020-08-01,4,Group trip,"Our group of 6 had a great weekend in Marion at the incredible Frank Lloyd Wright home. It was really neat to walk around the house when we first arrived and check out the creative and historical architecture and all of the nooks and crannies built into the place. The kitchen was off the charts and we never wanted for any plate, pot, cup, pan or utensil. The setting is spacious and great for conversation, games, and eating. It will be worth the trip and worth going back."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,We brought the whole family out to Katie’s place for my daughter’s IWU graduation. It was a comfortable home base for all the graduation events. It was so nice to relax together in the living room and around the dining table for meals. My senior parents really appreciated the recliners as my mom has back problems. They were a welcome and appreciated surprise. The fenced backyard is large and quiet. We loved watching the squirrels. Plenty of parking space in the wide driveway and the code lock made it easy for the 6 of us to come and go without worrying about sharing a key.
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Katie's home was very nice and very well kept. The description was accurate and fit exactly what we needed. Overall a great spot!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I traveled to IN for a family wedding. The house was cozy, peaceful, and quiet. Close to stores and food as well. The house was clean. My only concerns would be the roof is now black, not blue like the picture(we passed it), and I would have loved if there were some throw blankets and access to a washer/dryer. However, the listing did say there as a laundromat close by but I missed that part. Overall, great stay. Thank you from NC!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Katie was an amazing host. Even became a hero through my stay when I unexpectedly locked myself out. She was attentive and friendly. The house was comfy and warm. Would definitely recommend.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Katie's place was clean, comfortable, and cozy for our stay. It matched the description and had everything we needed."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Katie’s place was so clean, well organized and she was always attentive and helpful! We tried to book it for our next trip and it had already been booked! Highly recommend!"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Katie’s place was a beautiful, peaceful place with great decor. it made us feel right at home. Access to restaurants and shopping if that’s what you like to do or sit around fire pit andcrelax.
we had a great time and planning on booking for next year
thank you katie for the wonderful accommodations"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My family had a lovely experience with Katie and this air bnb. We had a quiet vacation planned to visit our daughter. The house was sparkling clean, warm, and cozy. We would definitely stay there again!"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"We rented Katie's place because I wanted a home close to Indiana Wesleyan since we were coming to Marion for the NAIA Outdoor Nationals and we were traveling with a 5 week old baby . It was easy to drive back and forth from campus to this location. The house was clean and the beds were great for sleeping. It was so nice to come back to this space to relax and chill after being at the track and it was really nice for my daughter-in-law and the baby to have this house instead of a hotel room. The kitchen is well stocked. They also have some great games that we played one night. It is also in a good location if you want to go for a walk. As a host, Katie answered all my questions and recommended some great places to eat. It is easy to see why they are a Super Host. This is a great house to stay in if you have a little bit bigger group!"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,We’ve stayed here a few times & it’s great.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, very central, just off the main drag, and walking distance to Popeye's and Culver's! Katie was very accommodating and helped us resolve some rescheduling issues with the reservation. The place was great for hosting a small gathering with a large dining table and family room. The private backyard is fantastic although the rain kept us from enjoying that."
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"The place was perfect for our stay.
We have already booked for another visit."
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,The house was clean with a fantastic open floor plan! Exactly what was promised plus even a little bigger than what we expected. We enjoyed the fire pit in the backyard and our stay overall. Thanks Katie!

Great hospitality!
A++++"
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"This spacious house was the perfect place to call home for a special family event. The kitchen is full of everything you need to cook & store leftovers. Way more spices, pans & utensils, etc than most Airbnbs. I went for walks on the track across the street. AC worked great during a heat wave. We’ll be back!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home is warm and welcoming. It’s very clean, smells amazing, is spacious and has a large backyard. My favorite spot in the home is the closed in porch.
Katie communicates well and attended to my needs. I was delayed getting inside due to me using an additional keypad near the door which is not the keypad to use for entry. The next day Katie left a note apologizing and a bouquet of flowers to celebrate my upcoming ordination at IWU. That was a sweet gesture."
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,Katie's house is very clean and well kept. The kitchen was fully stocked. iIt's in a quiet neighborhood. Our family enjoyed the fire ring in the spacious backyard. It was worth every penny. Thanks so much!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home was a great option for our family to be together our the youngest daughter’s college graduation. Many homey touches throughout made it very comfortable for everyone. Even games and puzzles A/C worked great. Beds were comfortable Kitchen is well-equipped. Location is quiet but not far from restaurants, stores, etc. Katie is a great host. Had a couple questions and she helped us right away. Would definitely recommend for other families staying in the area."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cozy place to come “home” to at the end of each vacation day. House is well stocked and an very comfortable. Wished it wasn’t so rainy…..the fire pit looked so inviting!

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a lovely location! Everything was great in this place. It was clean, warm and had every amenity you can think of. The host were amazing. Thanks for the fruit basket and the muffins were so delicious."
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is very pretty, comfortable, and new. It was super clean and had everything one might need. Fully stocked big bathroom with plenty of hot water, sizable furnished kitchen with coffee pods, washer and dryer with detergent provided, and king size bed. The bed was a little hard for us, but may be perfect for others. We did not find the common work area that was noted to be shared by the apartments, but there is a little table and chair in the apt to work on. The host was gracious in turning up the temp as it was a little chilly the first evening.
There are 2 signs that say “bed and breakfast” at the entrance. Each morning we smelled some fantastic breakfast food being cooked somewhere, but if you want some food to go with the smells, you will need to bring your own food and cook it in the nice kitchen. We did ask the host if breakfast was included, but we did not get a response.
The place is a little hard to find, as the GPS takes you to the wrong area to access the drive. I had looked at the satellite overview before we left and noticed this, so we made it fine. Due to some internet issues at the facility for the hosts, we were a little late getting the code to get in. Host was helpful in getting us the code in a reasonable timeframe after we arrived.
The entrance to the apartments (there are 2) is a shared entrance, and the door to use is marked FARMHOUSE, but no instructions were provided as to using that door to access the apartments that are upstairs on a landing. Once we figured that out, we were good. The host did respond to messages, and we eventually got the info.
As for internet, their Wi-Fi internet access is through LTE, and really doesn’t support the workspace they promoted. It didn’t work but for a few hours while we were here at the apt. The host did try to fix it but didn’t get it solidified."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a cozy stay & perfect for my recent work trip. It had a well stocked kitchen & the hosts are very responsive. Would book again!

2022-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The unit is beautiful BUT you do have to climb around 17 steps to get up to the unit which is located over their 3 car garage. I don’t believe it was listed under the description when I chose the unit. It was challenging for my sister to get her luggage up. We had late nights with family and planned to sleep in, with headboard of the bed being over the garage door (opening several times) it was not happening unfortunately. I did miss it was controlled temp which would have been okay had a fan been provided. Two middle age women with hot flashes so had to open the window in the bedroom. We were in unit 1 however I do think unit 2 may have been quieter (because of the garage doors opening). All in all it’s a nice place in a secluded located but definitely could not stay again."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of the best airbnbs I’ve ever stayed in! Accurate to pictures!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place! Highly recommend
2022-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The place looks really nice. There is a complimentary fruits and snacks provided which is a sweet touch. Communication with the owner is good as well. We encountered internet problem that is the only downfall, my boyfriend wasn’t able to connect for work and on our last day of stay he has to go to Starbucks but other than that it was a good stay it is quiet too. They did some remedy to help with the internet which is nice but it just didn’t work well at some point."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The host have thought of everything to make a stay comfortable. The location is convenient to town yet
very peaceful. The well stock kitchen allowed us to cook meals and save money. The host were very friendly, helpful and attentive."

It’s a nice touch for those staying longer than a night or two."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great and beautiful space!!! We loved our stay. The rain shower head was awesome, and the welcome basket was a kind touch. The kitchen was well stocked with supplies too. Only note - the apartment unit is over the garage, so you will hear the door opening and closing when the owners come and go. Not an issue at all, but just something to be aware of!"

2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed here for our anniversary. The place is very clean and very nice. Was a little hard to find, especially in the dark, but we figured it out. Parking was more than adequate and it is a nice property away from town. The bed was comfortable, which is coming from someone who has a hard time sleeping well on anything but my own bed. For breakfast they had a basket with muffins, nuts, fruit and caramels, all of which was great."

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is one beautiful place! If you have a reason to be in the Marion area Daniel’s apartments are a great place to stay. The space is luxurious and the fixtures and finishes are farm fresh and fancy. It’s off the beaten path but minutes from anything you could need. There’s some noise during the day and evening since the apartment is above the garage but nothing excessive and exactly what I would expect in any apartment building. It’s quite spacious and loaded with extra touches. One of the cleanest spaces we’ve stayed in as well. Great space!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Lovely room! Beautiful, quiet, well stocked room. We would gladly recommend this room to other."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great stay, clean & comfortable with plenty of room!"
2021-07-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"Pros:
We had zero issues finding the spot with the detailed directions they provided.
Keyless locks made lockouts impossible. Very convenient.
Cleanliness was up to par with every review you'll read. Nearly spotless.
Cons:
Communication, kind of lacking. I asked maybe 2 questions during our stay and it took quite some time to get responses back. There are clearly 2 rooms they rent out, but I believe we were the only ones there at the time.
Internet. At .26mbps ( yeah, I've got the screen shot to prove it ) you'll be pressed to load simple websites. That is, if you're able to even stay connected to the router at all. If you need to get any work done over WiFi, you won't be doing it here. The solution to the latter? Unplug the router for 10 minutes and plug it back in. Did it help? No. Use your cell service and move on.
Food Basket. Yeah they went above and beyond with the basket of treats, but when you have to deal with fruit flies is it a bonus or an annoyance? If you enjoy looking at wilted cherries and swatting at pesky insects, you'll enjoy the basket.
Noise. No pets allowed to stay here except the dogs that are right underneath you barking through the night. Nothing like waking up at 1AM and not being able to fall back asleep from the constant back and forth. They claimed to have sound monitors for their self-imposed quiet hours. Too bad their dogs are subjected to the same respectful rules.
The weeks prior to our stay I was excited. We left thouroughly unimpressed. But I suppose this is better than the crime ridden city just 5 miles from here (Marion, if you care to look it up). I'm sure your stay here would be better than ours and I hope the best for anyone booking a stay here"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay, everything was very clean as well as very professional. All amenities were great, and on the second morning we received a muffin and fruit basket which was wonderful! The condo had everything we needed and much better than any hotel we’ve been to. I would completely recommend this place to anyone thinking of staying here!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Traveling for work, stayed here to escape the monotonous hotel life and it was great! It was super clean, quiet, and the shower was super fancy! Bed was comfortable, washer and dryer in unit for use was helpful. Hosts were very accommodating as my stay was last minute and they were so kind, allowing me late check-out since I work night shift and I needed sleep before leaving. The 1st night they left me a cute basket with some baked good treats and fresh fruit which was unexpected, such a nice touch. Hope to stay again :)"
2021-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"It's a nice place, out in the country and quiet."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great space! It’s a little difficult to find as we got there later at night, but they sent us a link to get there safely. It’s a beautiful place inside, and it’s very peaceful. The bed was super comfortable, and the bathroom and kitchen were both beautiful and functional. Very stylish and cozy! They left muffins, nuts and fresh fruit, as well as coffee, tea and hot chocolate Keurig pods. The hosts are very friendly and helpful, and went out of their way to answer questions about the space and the area. If we’re in the area again, we would definitely stay there. :)"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely place - great amenities, new, spotless. Very attentive hosts!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,If you’re visiting Grant County it’s the perfect central location. Everything seemed brand new and meticulously clean. It’s very unique because muffins and fruit are provided. Not to mention sugar and cream for your coffee etc. I often travel and have to stop at the store after arrival when I find the necessities aren’t there. This place had everything you need. It’s also gorgeous and well thought out and designed. I’m already in the process of rebooking.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This apartment was super clean—it almost felt like we were the first guests to ever stay there. And the bed was very comfortable. I wish we’d had time to sleep in!

2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,The space was impeccably clean. Bed and linens were super cozy. Loved the cabin feel paired with grey decor and modern fixtures. Fully equipped kitchen with new appliances. Great washer and dryer in closet inside unit. Bathroom sink was a little bit high which would be hard for children to reach.

It is beautifully decorated and the added amenities such as the Keurig with Kcups, sugar & brown sugar, bottles of water, and the goodie basket show how much the hosts care about their home and guests.

The king-size bed is oh so comfortable and the rainfall shower is exactly what is needed after a long day.
We will definitely be back as nothing in Marion compares!!!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed one night,They were great to work with and provided outstanding hospitality!
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This apartment is beautiful. The pictures do not do it justice.
The hosts were welcoming, kind, very responsive, and thoughtful.
It was extremely clean, tidy, and well prepared and stocked for guests. And, it is extremely close to town, but has the benefits of a quiet seven acres.
The beds were very comfortable, especially the queen couch bed. There were plenty of linens, pillows, and blankets.
The shower was amazing with great pressure. However, for this that like to take baths, it is a shower-only unit.
There were only a few things that I wished I would have paid attention to in the description or would have known.
This is an above the garage apartment complex, housing two units. You will be responsible for packing you things up a flight of stairs (15 stairs, if you would like details).
There is not a dishwasher or a full-pot coffee maker—only a one-cup maker. Both, not deal breakers, but other travelers should be prepared. We simply ran to Walmart and purchased a $10 coffee pot that worked well for our weekend.
Honestly, the only downfall was the sulfur smell of the water. It wasn’t overwhelming, but lingered in the apartment after washing dishes or taking a shower. However, I wouldn’t let that stop you from renting this place.
You will love this cozy and modern apartment."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, clean and enjoyed the private entrance. Daniel and Valencia were pleasant host, looking to book again when I come home again!"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,such a wonderful place to stay. quiet country setting with BEAUTIFUL living space. hosts are accommodating and kind. looking forward to staying again.
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, well appointed, and hosts were very responsive awesome stay."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely space! You can’t ask more from an Airbnb. You can tell the space is brand new and it was thoughtfully built. Just 2 notes: there was a bright exterior light on all night right outside the bedroom. The curtains blocked the light but it still filtered into the room above the curtain rod—this is just in apt 1. Also the water has a bad smell to it, which probably can’t be helped. These are not reasons to not book this place though, it was great!"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful place and a perfect little getaway!!
2020-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,From the Keurig to the hairdryer no detail is unnoticed in this cozy space. This was the PERFECT place for an extended stay. Daniel and his wife were so kind and accommodating. Cannot recommend their place enough. A truly wonderful experience.
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Daniel's Place to get away for a relaxing trip. His place was absolutely spotless and has a fully functioning kitchen along with a Keurig and complimentary K-cups! They filled the place with sweet touches like home baked banana muffins and tips on good restaurants in the area. When we arrived we were having trouble getting the wifi to work, which was a big deal for us as we needed it to get some work done. Daniel saved the day and bought and additional router just to ensure we could get the connection we needed! He was very quick to respond to all of our questions/concerns. I would definitely recommend staying in this place and would do so again!"
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very clean. As described. Road a little busy but quieted down after dark. 1.5 blocks off the main road with easy access to all the restaurants etc. Sleeper sofas worked well for extra beds. Plenty of on street parking right in front of the house.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It is a beautiful home with great amenities! It was very clean and even came with a washer and dryer for clothes! Thank you Doug for a wonderful stay!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little house close to IWU.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,This is the second time my parents and I have stayed here. First time was for my junior recital and this time was for my graduation. Both stays were fantastic and everything is how we remembered.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,House was clean and great for a short stay!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location for my conference at Indiana Wesleyan University.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I never stayed at an AirBnB before, as I typically stick with hotels for the convenience. But after staying here, I think I'd prefer it over a hotel! I had complete privacy for me and my partner to stay in. No loud guests in other rooms to worry about. The place was clean and smelled nice. We had a full kitchen to enjoy use and could even do our laundry as needed without having to share with other guests. The location was perfect as it was close to everything I needed to go to. The heating worked great, as it was fairly cold the weekend of my visit. The bathroom had a nice deep tub. The bonus of a security system and lock made me feel nice and safe. And the price was cheaper than most of the local hotels and was 100× cleaner and nicer than the more affordable rooms I could have rented. Next time I come to Marion, I would definitely rent this exact house again if it's available when I come into town."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"You guys! Our immediately family (now all grown adults) left our spouses at home and used this house to celebrate the baby brother’s masters graduation. We were close to the university (IWU), close to the Meijer and MAY I RECOMMEND- close to OBI’s BBQ downtown!!!! We all slept comfortably, table was great for late night cards and bagels with coffee each morning. We knew there was one bathroom- so we navigated that with 6 adults… ABSOLUTELY worth it for this price and this friendly of a hands-off host."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is our second stay at Doug and Sarah’s place. It is warm and cozy. They are both very responsive and pay close attention to detail. We asked to check in early and they accommodated our requests. Anytime we are in Marion we plan to stay here! Awesome place and hosts.
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,It was as it was described. Close parking.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay and appreciated that everything was clean and tidy.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"It was true to the photos, amenities, the fine details, quiet and very cozy. We would stay there again. In fact one of our family members booked this home in a couple of months."
2023-10-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The area was a little noisy with neighbors and police at the neighbors’ (next door) less than 30 min after we got there. Inside the house was great with new nice furnishings, clean home and wonderful sheets. The only issue was the musty smell and towels/washcloths smelling like pet urine. They were clean but once they have that smell, you can’t get it out and they need replaced. Other than that, inside the house was great! We loved the big TV, comfy bed and stocked kitchen. My granddaughter loved the filtered water in the kitchen. We had no more issues with police noises after that initial incident. Overall, it’s a great deal for the money. We appreciate how clean the place was."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"House was very clean,"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Doug was lovely to book with!! He moved check-in and out around for me based on my needs. I was attending a friend’s wedding and he adjusted accordingly, and responded very fast. Loved the smart TV, coffee pods and creamer included, Tide pods too! Very roomy and large. Porch was very peaceful as well. Thank you Doug, so much!"
2023-09-01,3,Stayed about a week,"This place is not bad, but it wasn't for me. For the most part, it meets all a person's needs."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed at Doug's place (Room4more@1204) multiple times. It is perfect for our needs and always very enjoyable. I would highly recommend it.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Doug's place is awesome. It is extremely spacious and comfortable and is exactly as described. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook full on meals every night. The only challenge was that only one of the four burners on the stove worked, but we managed to work around that.
The street was quiet, with lots of street parking available. We would definitely stay here again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean place. Would stay again.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our 2nd stay here while attending our grandson’s Allstar Baseball Tournament in Sweetser. Perfect location, just 5 minutes from the ball park. The house has all that you need and is nicely decorated. No complaints for “Room 4 More!”"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have rented this place before, due to you get the whole house rather than a rm, this place is in a great location with the conveniences of close shopping. Has an issue with the air conditioner, i called, and he had it fixed, up and running within a couple hrs. I will rent this from him again and encourage others to do the same."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tasteful, comfortable, and clean! Close to the university & plenty of restaurants around! Doug was a great host!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"overall the stay was amazing. the house was clean and comfortable, the neighborhood was quiet and in a great location the only comments I have is I would have liked to have been able to check in earlier, it would be nice if the listing included what type of coffee maker was present, (Keurig or drip) so that we know what kind of coffee to bring with us, and if it were me, I would have talked about the parking in the back option as part of the arrival instructions. otherwise, this was definitely I. my top 2 of positive Air B&B stays."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"the place was exactly what we were looking for and was perfect. it was clean, spacious and perfectly priced. loved staying there"

2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great place two cars couldn't park in the back because of broken glass from maybe a mirror in the back alley. I've nearly been hit twice as well as Kyle crossing the street. Nothing wrong with actual house though great house. Loved it and beautiful.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I really enjoyed our stay at Doug’s place. Everything was clean and how we were expecting it to be! We would definitely stay there again!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,This house was close enough to IWU to visit but far enough away to get away from campus. We were pleasantly surprised with the electric fireplace. We also loved the complementary Netflix and Amazon video on the TV.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is older but modernized with electronic locks, a smart thermostat, large tv, new carpeting and furniture. The bed was wonderful and the space was clean. The decor gave the house a pleasant personality."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Doug’s house is excellent and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a place near IWU. His house made for a great stay on a weekend away. Everything was well cared for and exceptionally clean. They provided everything needed for a comfortable stay. We will stay again soon!

Friends joined for the weekend. It was clean, quiet, and easy to access. Couldn’t recommend enough!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little house that was perfect for our needs. We weren't there much during the day, but it was a great space to come back to in the evenings to relax and get some sleep. The main bed was very comfortable and we were also pleasantly surprised by how comfortable the pull out sofas were. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend this location to others looking for a nice, clean house to stay at."

2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and well appointed. Not terribly close to IWU, but near the other hotels in the area. A little steep for game day weekend, but overall a very enjoyable stay. It was very close to the entrance to the bike path, which was great."

2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Having to get to the only bathroom through the 2nd bedroom was a little inconvenient especially for 3 guys over 60. Otherwise everything was as advertised.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a peaceful stay at Doug and Sarah’s home. It was clean, open airy, well decorated, and thoughtful. I loved the record player(my daughter bought me the same one). The indoor porch was perfect for when my family came
to visit. Marion was beautiful this weekend too! Thank you, Lucinda"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was perfect, very clean, good communication and flexible owner!"
2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Doug’s place was very nice, well appointed and conveniently located. My business partner and I stayed here the bed was great the couch bed was pretty standard so not great. Wouldn’t suggest sleeping on that if you are my size or bigger 6’0” 220lb. Definitely will return if it’s just me."
2022-07-01,3,Stayed with kids,Good value and clean. We stayed for a softball tournament and it was a bit out of the way for that but all the essentials that you need are there.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was super cozy. The screened in porch was a great place to relax and watch the sun go down.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just perfect!! Room4More is all that it says it is and more!! Such a comfortable space; no complaints at all!! Spacious, clean, very comfortable bed, kitchen has all that you need and great laundry facility!! We were looking for a place close to Sweetser for a baseball tournament and this is just 5-10 minutes from the ball diamonds! I’d you’re looking for a great place to stay in Marion, THIS IS IT!! Thank you, Doug!!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,2nd time staying at Doug's place and would highly recommend!!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hosts are quick responders! Doug helped us get back in, once we had locked ours out… the place was cute and roomy! Several fun and thoughtful touches around the rooms. Great location and nice neighborhood! Would definitely stay here again!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The home was very cozy and the host was super friendly!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, very clean and the hosts are quick to respond, helpful and very polite!!!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice house, clean, looks exactly like the pictures. Just what we needed for our mini family vacation! I never needed to contact the host, check in was super easy with the security app and the info folder in the house answered any other questions I had."
2022-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"This was a very pleasing house, the neighborhood seemed very nice and safe. The parking was on the street, although an option was given to park in the back, I never parked back there.
The door lock was a little tricky but it worked out very well. I do recommend this house as it is very clean and the bed is comfortable. The porch on front is a nice touch with the small-ish picnic table for relaxing and enjoying a cool evening.
However, the only drawbacks of the house were the second bedroom and the bathroom. The second bedroom had a pull-out couch for your bed. Not what I was expecting. Not only this but you've got to go through the second bedroom to get to the one and only bathroom.
So, if you've got another guest with you on your stay, then you must go through their bedroom to use the restroom. Awkward, if they are already in bed at the time!
The second issue is the bathroom. Whereas everything was really nice and clean, highly commend Doug and his wife on cleaning, the issue was with the commode! The commode must have been a kindergarten or elementary school commode.There is no way that a grown man, (6'1"", 265 lbs,) can sit on the seat then do (to put it politely), #1 & #2, without shifting forward or backwards for clearance. Seriously, it was small!
Other than these two issues, I do recommend this house as a one bedroom house. Doug was easy to contact, so over all I would have given him a 5 star except for the two issues."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, comfortable, and welcoming. Easy check in and out. Parking is available in the back."
2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The house is very clean and easy to get too. Doug is easy to get a hold off of you need him.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Darling place. Clean and inviting!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"this I can't say enough about in writing, the people that own it are amazing and sweet and super helpful and respond so fast, the home is adorable and I love the fenced in yard with a little one as well , and being able to do laundry being located so close to everything we needed I will absolutely stay here again when I come back perfect little cute very homey cozy feeling house. I miss it already and Ijust got home last night"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a very nice house on a quiet street in the center of Marion. It has everything you need including lots of plugs for charging devices. Parking is available in back.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely home and perfect for our needs. The location was convenient to shopping and Indiana Wesleyan University where we were attending our son's graduation. The house is exactly as described and immaculately cleaned and maintained. The bed was comfortable and the linens were of excellent quality.

Keep up the good work!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved this place. It's quiet, peaceful, and relaxing. Denise is an excellent host and is very good at making people feel welcome. The location is beautiful but the gravel driveway should be taken slow as to avoid a few potholes. All in all, I highly recommend it if you're in the area."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Denise is a lovely host! She responded quickly to our questions. The apartment was super cute, super clean and so comfy. The only downside was the ability to hear those staying in the next apartment, but Denise remedied this by instituting quiet hours, which we appreciated. This location is perfect for those visiting IWU. We’ll definitely be back."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bryce's place is excellent and he is an exceptional host.
The place was spotless. I am a frequent airbnb user and have been from California to Chicago to the Adironbacks to The Keys and all over Florida to Colorado and up and down the East Coast. His place is exceptional and is reflective of attentiveness to detail and hygiene.
I'm probably more demanding than most and his place allowed me to feel comfortable away from home. I can be rather hesitant to make use of kitchenware as most airbnb drawers are filled with crap the owner doesn't want in his own drawers.
This is not the case with Bryce. The pots, pans, dishes, knives (omigosh an airbnb with sharp knives) allowed me to prepare my food without hesitation or regret.
The bedding and towels and bathroom didn't make me cringe to make use of.
I hesitate to even write a review as I am currently working in the area and the options are less than abundant. But, he is definitely underpriced and more than deserving of a good review."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was super clean, well appointed, and exactly as listed. Good neighborhood and the location is convenient to all area businesses / colleges."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lindsay’s Landing II was the perfect place to stay for our weekend requirements. The interior was immaculate and definitely a better choice than a local hotel! The host Bryce was very proactive and hospitable. Bryce’s property will be my choice for future visits to Indiana.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The house is exactly as pictured and described. Everything was clean and comfortable. Check-in was easy with clear instructions. Although I didn't use much, the kitchen looks like it had everything you would need if you were going to cook. The neighborhood is quiet although it's on a well traveled street. Felt very safe walking around. Lots of restaurants around plus major box stores are nearby. Would stay again and hope that work takes me that way just so I can stay there."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was perfect and pleasant. We were comfortable and enjoyed some of the simple touches. We would come back and stay!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Bryce’s property was an excellent place to stay during the total eclipse. The Matter park was an excellent discovery! Everything in the home was well organized and new. We loved it!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,...
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jonathan's University Limestone quiet and peaceful home is a short walk from the Indiana Wesleyan University campus and from a nice spot to grab a classic diner breakfast. It was a great space for both our six-year old daughter and my mother, and we really enjoyed cooking a few meals in the gorgeous kitchen. It's also worth noting that the house is a very short drive from a large grocery store and not far from the ""Cardinal Greenway,"" a great trail for hiking, biking, or running."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,We enjoyed a great weekend. The house was perfect and walkable to the university. My only recommendation is to add an ice cream scoop to the kitchen.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful place to stay. We were there during cold and snowy weather and the driveway and front walk were shoveled and salted. It snowed some more the first day and the next morning everything was cleared again for us.
Very comfortable living area, lovely kitchen, garage and washer and dryer. Huge tv. I normally don't care about this, but we were enjoying the Australian open during our free time and it was amazing on the large TV. The owner has a no shoes in the house policy so you might want to bring slippers. The property is on a very quiet street."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,I was so impressed with this charming home. I am a stickler for cleanliness and there wasn’t a single space that wasn’t 5 star hotel clean. It was more than enough room for us and our two young kids. The tv was huge and perfect for movies too!

2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"We arrived to a well kept house. Almost everything we needed was there. We left a corkscrew for everyone to enjoy bc after 5 stores I finally found one:-)
Beds were comfy, everything was just clean, easy, well kept. We locked ourselves out and the response was super quick! Washer/dryer were great to have.
Air conditioner took a little bit of figuring out. It’s different but not hard at all.
The comments from my OCD sister in laws were:

2)All the dishes/utensils everything to cook with is here!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here for the Eclipse, and it was such a great weekend! The house is quaint and cute and the kitchen had everything we needed and some bonus items too which were thoughtful and appreciated. There were pots, pans, & utensils as well as cooking spray, tinfoil and some other things like that which I ended up needing and was grateful to have.
It is an old house, so it has creaky floors and the bedroom doors don’t all close properly. This was not a problem for us but might bother someone else. Creaking aside, it was well maintained and did not feel at all dingy like old houses tend to do. The space was clean and the beds were comfortable. One of the bedrooms is a little bigger and has a nook that perfectly fits a pack n play. There is also good space for luggage in closets & dressers.
The neighborhood was quiet and it suited our needs perfectly.
As a host, Amy was very responsive and helpful and made us feel welcome. We loved our stay and would gladly do it again!"

The large 3-season porch is a very peaceful spot. The house is in a quiet setting, set back from the road. This is a home that just feels good to be in.
The location worked out very well. We biked the Cardinal and adjoining trails and found it easy to get to Indy and neighboring towns to meet with friends. The parks and garden house in Marion were fun discoveries, as well as the friendly towns of Sweetser and Converse.
Travis and Margaret were friendly, responsive and very kind! We highly recommend Caitlin’s Cottage and we hope to stay again."

It is beautifully decorated and updated. The kitchen had lots of needed cooking utensils and appliances. They even had a few essential ingredients (sugar, flour, tea, and more) that we found helpful. Plus, a few snacks in a cookie jar.
Everything was very clean and in great shape. We didn't get to enjoy the outdoors or sunroom because of the weather, but it seemed nice.

The shower has small built in benches which is perfect for shaving your legs when you are not in a bathtub! Definitely will be staying again!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was very helpful for us in location to IWU and Taylor! Nathan communicates very well and provided an excellent stay for my family of four (two babies).

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy home and Nate was very accommodating and quick to respond to any questions. The location was quiet and convenient to many of the restaurants and grocers. It was perfect for my needs over the holiday weekend.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I stayed at this Airbnb while transitioning into the area. I felt safe and secure the entire time. It took a while to get used to the heat in the ceiling, but I woke up every morning warm and snug, and really enjoyed the high-speed wi-fi and stocked kitchen. It doesn't hurt that the grocery store is 5 minutes away! Selby Street Suite comes recommended!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect place for two people to stay, especially if you are there to visit IWU….it is so close. Super clean and comfortable. Everything we needed was provided and Nathan was great about answering any questions right away. Highly recommend!!"

It’s small but very clean and cozy! The coffee supplies were very nice also. We definitely will be back!
Thanks so much Nathan!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Nathan’s place was small, quiet, and cozy. The bed is hard but not too uncomfortable. Although, we had to clean some part’s of the bnb due to other guests staying previously, I would definitely book again.

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nathan's place is a nice spot close to Indiana Wesleyan University. It is just a few blocks away so within walking distance.

Nathan and crew keep the house clean and he is very quick to communicate with you if you have any questions. FYI: Full bed 😉"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nathan's place was perfect for what I needed! It is exactly as described, and the host responded quickly to any questions. This location would be ideal for a single person or couple visiting IWU as it's easy walking distance from the main campus. The wifi wasn't working yet, but Nathan let me know that prior to booking. I wouldn't hesitate to book here again."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"A quiet place to sleep and get ready for the days activities. Black out curtains would be nice in the bedrooms!
A good amount of space but not an abundance of “comfort” seating.
No laundry detergent available but can’t remember if it was to be provided or not.
Clean bathrooms appreciated!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Perfect location for Taylor University graduation. Beautiful country setting with good space for the dog. Very comfortable bedrooms & family room!
2024-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Enjoyed a peaceful weekend in the country. Neighbors horses were relaxing to watch. We did kill quite a few bugs and a few hornets in the house, despite the house being very clean. All the necessities were there. Additional seating in the living area would have been nice, wasn't really comfortable for family movie night (5 of us). Had an issue with the key pad, due to impatient teen. Host was there in 15 minutes to let us in."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,It was a great place.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay, very responsive host and helpful. Even left a little gift for us knowing we were going on the Garfield trail. Great touch. Will be back."

2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at this home. It was just what we needed; close enough to family and private space for our immediate family.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We LOVED this place! It was extremely clean and fresh! It was super quiet and peaceful! It matched both the description and pictures accurately! The place was just downright comfortable and wonderful in every way! And the hosts! EXCELLENT! When we got there, the heat wasn't on. We called them and they came right over! Come to find out, the gas company had come out the day before and installed a new meter -- and had neglected to turn the gas back on. The hosts called the gas company right away, and the gas was turned on within minutes! They were SO helpful and attentive to our needs! Kudos to them! We'd return in a heartbeat -- and we may, since our son and daughter-in-law now live in the area! Thanks, Donna and Joni for such a great stay!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely weekend at Donna and Joni’s. The house was immaculately clean and very welcoming, we felt right at home. The setting was beautiful, the beds were comfortable, and the kitchen had everything we needed. Will look to book here again in the future."
2023-11-01,4,Group trip,"The bedrooms had very little room to walk around the beds. The shower had a leak that didn't get addressed during our stay, so we went through a lot of towels to clean up the mess. Their floor will likely be damaged if that leak doesn't get repaired. The skillets were all scratched up, which they were quick to replace - thank you! Overall, we were happy enough with the home and the quiet environment. Three of our five didn't sleep well at all on the beds. Mine was also not particularly comfortable, but I slept well enough because of sleep meds. If your stay depends more on bed comfort, consider this review fair warning. The property was well cared for other than these complaints and the neighbors are friendly horses."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"We really enjoyed our stay - close to Taylor University campus. Beautiful rural setting- so peaceful. Well maintained and clean. 3 beds, 2 bathrooms made it easy for everyone to spread out and then come together later at night to play games - great selection. Kind hosts w/ good communication. Hope to stay again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Really enjoyed our stay. Peaceful area, with great access to both Taylor University and IWU. Nice place to relax. Hosts were very responsive and friendly. We appreciated staying here!"

2023-05-01,4,Stayed with a pet,nice home and clean
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is my 2nd time, it is a good location, Wesleyan U, shopping and restaurants close by. Nice back yard with fire pit. Only downside, if you make casseroles or want to do any baking there aren't baking pans for it. I would definitely rent again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely stay! Clean, spacious and nicely decorated. Kitchen is abundantly supplied and modern. Big back yard with nice fire pit which we were able to enjoy. Also enjoyed morning coffee on the back porch which was nice. Spacious driveway, lots of parking. Easy to locate. Close to all amenities in Marion. Lots of towels and linens, laundry facilities in site. Comfy clean beds. Bryce was responsive and non intrusive. Would definitely request to stay here again when back in the area. I would highly recommend."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Bryce was very gracious in allowing us to check in early so that we could begin a 9 hour volunteer project at IWU. The house overall was clean but hair was found in bathroom drawers. The master bed was not completely made: there was a fitted sheet on the mattress, but no flat sheet put on the bed. Fortunately we found extra sheets in the closet and finished making the bed ourselves. 38th Street has a high level of noisy traffic hours per day; light sleepers could have a problem. It was unusual to have a coffee brewer without some packages of coffee for guests. Travelers do not usually come with coffee, and this is the first Airbnb of many we have stayed in that did not provide coffee for guests. The internet was quite slow, with simple emails taking long to load. I teach online, and responding to students, posting graded papers, etc. were all quite slow when working in this house. Overall Bryce is a good host, with a few things needing attention in order to earn 5 stars."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Always an enjoyable stay!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place and great host. The space has been nicely updated.

The backyard was a great bonus, and our family loved just being able to spend time together."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"What a delight. Place was exceptional: new, clean, little welcoming touches and all high quality. Too offer AirBNB hosts are overselling worn out, dirty and poorly equipped properties. Not the case here. We’ll be back and you shouldn’t hesitate to book."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful home.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Lindsey's Landing was VERY nice! Back yard and fire pit were private and so nice. It is on a road that gets traffic but was never bothered by it. Will certainly stay again if in the area. Very nice decor.

We were able to eat out one night and cook dinner at the house the other nights which I loved. The house was nicely decorated and had nice amenities. The AC worked wonderfully at keeping the house nice and cool, which I greatly appreciated coming back from being in the 90 degree heat all day! That may not be important to some but it's extremely important to me! It is in a central location to just about any area you would like to visit which was very convenient. Communication with the host was very good as well! I would definitely stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lindsey's Landing was precisely as described! It accommodated me and my family easily! Everything we needed was at our fingertips.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The house was very cute and comfortable. Someone had turned the central air on before our arrival, which was very welcoming. I loved the sprawling backyard with firepit. We watched hundreds of lightening bugs twinkle over the lawn. Shopping and food market were just 1/2 mile up the road."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The house is exactly what I needed for myself and one energetic, young dog. The house is equipped with what I needed. Bryce is very responsive if you need help with anything. I liked that it was so close to a main road which was easy for me to get to the SW country roads for my three day geocaching adventure. Lots of restaurants nearby too. If I’m in the area again, I’d definitely stay here. Bryce’s house versus a hotel room - Bryce’s place wins! Just like home!"

One negative you might consider is the road traffic and outside lights if you are a light sleeper. They did have a sound machine available. Wasn’t a problem for us but might be to some."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lindsey's Landing was perfectfor graduation weekend. Everything was as listed. It has nice beds and towels. The one semi-con I would say is that the kitchen and showers are made for people way taller than me, but they do keep a step stool handy."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The house was clean, lots of room and a huge backyard. It is on a busy street, however with the backyard being so large, I was comfortable letting our kids run around(with supervision) without having to worry about them being next to the road. There were reviews about the noise, but with the provided sound machine and Echo/Alexa to play music in the bedrooms we had no issue getting to/staying asleep and the traffic/noise in the middle of the night was minimal. We will definitely be back the next time we are in town."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was the perfect getaway! It looked just like the pictures. Bryce reached out right away and was very helpful. Quick and easy check in.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Excellent home for a family of five! The only downsides were the noise from the cars driving by and the street light from the pole outside. Bryce tried to mitigate the car noise by providing a noise machine. I highly recommend this place!
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"We planned to have 6 of us stay at this location to visit our boys at college. We wanted enough space for our family to comfortably stay. In the end, not everyone could come on the trip; however, this property could easily have accommodated at least 6 people. It had a well-stocked kitchen and many amenities that made a very comfortable stay. My only complaint is that this property is extremely popular so it’s not available the next time we are in the area. It was a great stay!"

Would highly recommend!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Bryce really provided a great stay. We really appreciated his (apparent) renovations and his attention to detail with some very nice touches like upgraded bathroom faucets and showerheads. He also provided *everything* we needed - all the linens, cleaning supplies, dishes, utensils, etc. that we needed. All we truly needed to bring was food and our clothes...we wanted for nothing. The place was immaculately clean and everything worked flawlessly. This was an A++ place for us to stay."

The internet handled traffic for three working professionals, while the fourth in our party streamed movies. The kitchen was well stocked. The bathroom are clean. The bedrooms are sparse but comfortable. The front bedroom (street facing) may be a little noisy for some. I would recommend Lindsay's Landing to visitors of Marion.

This house was very pleasant, with nice furnishings and decor. We appreciated the board games and books, too. I was really impressed with how clean and orderly everything was in the home. I am a bit of a neat-freak, so I truly appreciated this. I could not believe how quiet the neighborhood was, too. We will definitely consider staying here again if we find ourselves in the area for a baseball tournament again."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have been traveling to Marion for the last four years. We have stayed at five different hotels and one other Airbnb over the years. Jonathan's place is by far the best place to stay especially if you are visiting a student at IWU!
