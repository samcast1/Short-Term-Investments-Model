2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great location for our purpose. Even though we did not travel with children, the home is very accommodating to children and dogs. We had everything we needed for preparing meals, with a grocery store within walking distance. The photos of the home were helpful in preparing for our trip such as coffee necessities, parking, and pet needs. The home is well supplied with information of the area attractions. Great job Kelli, we will be calling on you again!"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Comfortable place with backyard for the dogs. Access to backyard is outside and is separate access from house. Beautiful town with lots of surrounding hikes.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Stayasaurus was ideal place to come home to. My family has a ranch in the area, and after a day of work it was delightful to come back to such a welcoming place. I will be staying there again. Thank you Kelli."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When I found this place, I knew it was the one. I mean, the DINOSAURS!!! If you have a love for dinosaurs like my son & I do, this is the place to stay while you explore the dinosaur capital of the US! This was such a fun place to stay and perfectly comfortable. Wonderful shower with great hot water and cozy beds at the end of the day. We did not have a single issue our entire week. Would definitely, most certainly, stay here again! And Vernal is one of the best secrets I've ever found!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Stay-a-saurus is the place to stay in Vernal. Kelli has the place set up with everything you need for a comfortable stay. The decor is fun and fitting for the area. The location was perfect. Located in a quiet neighborhood not too far from the main streets of Vernal. Quick access to restruants, grocery stores, and attractions. Highly recommend this place for a short or long stay."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kelli's place was just right for our stay in Vernal. The dinosaur theme throughout the house is whimsical and fun, and we were very comfortable. It's a short drive from the museum, dinosaur monument, and Moonshine Arch, which were the places we wanted to visit this time around. Kelli was also very responsive and friendly. I recommend this place, and would definitely stay again."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet neighborhood, not far from the main road that runs through town, very clean and more than worth the price for the space and privacy. The kitchen is well stocked and we loved all the dino decor as well! We didn't have a dog with us, but there are lots of accommodations if you do (pet blankets, water bowls, leashes, etc.) Kelli takes good care of the space and we're glad we got the chance to stay. ❤️"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The stayasaurus house was very cute, clean, and comfortable! Seriously one of the nicest Airbnb properties I’ve stayed in. The neighborhood was quiet and peaceful. Vernal was a great town and served as a great home base for outdoor adventures in the Uinta Basin."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was perfect for us as we explored the area. So many thoughtful homey touches that made us so comfortable. We each said multiple times - I could live here just as it is. Very well done!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at Kelli’s place for three nights and we felt right at home. From the dino toys for our son to the kitchen amenities and laundry access, it checked all of our boxes and really helped to make our stay a comfortable and memorable one. Thank you!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay here. The access to the home was incredibly convenient. Kelli’s detailed instructions and clear communication meant we had a smooth, hassle-free check-in. Kelli, as a host, was exceptional. She was helpful and quick to respond to our questions on the Airbnb app.
A standout feature for us was the well-stocked kitchen. It had everything we could possibly need, from cooking utensils to a fantastic selection of Keurig coffee.
Dog owners will be happy to know that Kelli’s place is not just pet-friendly, it's pet-cherishing! Our dog was treated as an esteemed guest with dedicated dog blankets, and food and water dishes readily available. Our furry family member felt right at home.
The home has a cute dinosaur theme that thrilled our kids. Every corner of the house is tastefully adorned with dino-inspired touches, which we really enjoyed. Thanks again to Kelli."

The house was extremely well stocked with all the essentials you'd expect plus more (example: no need to make a Walmart run to pick up dishwashing tablets or laundry detergent or Ziploc bags). If we're ever back in Vernal, we'll be staying here for sure."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Excellent experience!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely LOVED the Stay-a-saurus! We loved it so much, in fact, that we booked an extra night to our stay! This home is adorable and tastefully decorated with a dinosaur theme throughout. Kelli even had tiny pink souvenir dinosaurs for take-home gifts. My daughter had dinosaur sheets on her bed that were so cute. The living room was warm & cozy, and we enjoyed looking out the floor-to-ceiling windows. Great sofa and rocker! The kitchen was fantastic and well-appointed. Kelli made our little dogs feel right at home by providing doggy bed & blankets, bowls, and dog bones. They loved playing in the fenced yard and walking around the block. There was a nice visitor's information book about the area attractions and places to eat. We loved this place so much that we didn't want to leave. It was the best place that we stayed on our two week trip. We hope to come back someday!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful house, and location. It’s a great little house. The bed was the perfect amount of soft and firm. The yard was perfect for the doggies. 10/10"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved Kelli's place and would definitely stay again! It's close to everything, cozy and comfortable. There is not one thing Kelli hasn't thought of amenity-wise in her home. Fun games, blankets, everything you need for cooking, recommendations for in town, etc.
Her place is also super dog friendly which is a nice change from people who allow dogs but kind of make you feel unwelcome or send you a giant list of rules. She had dog bowls, a bed, leashes, blankets, etc, and a nice fenced yard for them."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Stay-a-saurus was a perfect landing place for our family trip to Dinosaur National Monument (in fact, I think our six year old might have been more excited about all the Dino toys there than the actual monument). This place has everything you need—very comfortable, clean and with many thoughtful touches. Wholeheartedly recommend!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"On our long trip across the US staying at many different places, Kelli’s house is by far the best place we have stayed out. It was very clean, innovative decorations, and well provisioned.. Wish all our stays were this good."
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nice little place, clean, tasteful furniture, Dino-themed. Small for more than two adults."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kelli’s house offered the perfect stay in Vernal! It is super cozy, beautifully decorated with lots of thoughtful touches.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Kelli's home was perfect. It was well stocked, comfortable, conveniently located, and full of thoughtful details. Her generosity, thoughtfulness, and beautifully decorated home made our trip that much more fun!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place was clean, comfortable, convenient for our trip. It was a short drive to Dinosaur National Monument and close to a great grocery store and Thai restaurant. Our dogs were happy and comfortable. They loved the yard and having back-up supplies was helpful. Check-in was a breeze and the owner was communicative."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was our second stay here and we will be back.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A nice place to call home while discovering the area. Close to main street which has everything you need.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Stay-A-Saurus sure lived up to its name! Every nook and cranny is thoughtfully appointed with dinosaur themed touches in every room. The home was well stocked with freshly laundered towels, wash clothes, and even robes. The beds were comfortable, with plenty of pillows if you need them. The water pressure in the shower was ample with plenty of hot water if you enjoy long showers. The bathtub is deep if you prefer to bathe.
The kitchen was well stocked (perhaps that’s an understatement) with everything you could possibly need to prepare your meals. Every drawer and cupboard was neatly organized making finding what you need a cinch.
The washer/dryer ran quietly, but boy they got the job done. I love coming home from a week-long vacation without any dirty laundry to wash. It’s the little things, I’m tellin’ ya.
The home is on a well-lit street in a safe, quiet area near parks, and baseball fields. Our kids were able to make a few friends in the neighborhood during our stay.
An ice cream truck even stopped by! The backyard is completely fenced, perfect if you’re traveling with your pups.
Checking in/out was a breeze. The check-out to-do list is short, and sweet.
It did not feel like we were staying in someone else’s house. We all felt right at home. ❤️
We will definitely book with Kelli again any time we’re in town to visit our families.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Comfortable, clean, convenient and full of dinosaurs, if we are ever in the area, we will be back!
The host was responsive and helpful and the location was close to the things we wanted to do!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Everything about this bungalow is simply awesome. Our experience from booking to checking out was just first rate. The home is very cute, nicely decorated and just very homey. I could live here…lol!! It’s in a safe and friendly neighborhood that is close to everything in town. We were in town for an unfortunate reason. My husband was in a motorcycle accident and had to stay in the hospital. Kelli was very quick to respond to me trying to book a place while stressing out over the situation. I really appreciate her fast response and great communication. Check in and out were super easy. We highly recommend this cute home if you are staying in the area for any reason. Definitely in our top tier for Airbnb stays and experiences. Thank you!!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cute, clean, and quiet place. And good location for seeing the sights in Dinosaur."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is your perfect stay if you’re going to dinosaur national Monument! I highly recommend you also visit the natural history Museum in Vernal as well as flaming gorge. Kelli also provided pamphlets of lots of other things to do in the area. There are a few local restaurants where you can eat and plenty of fast food options. There’s a Walmart within driving distance. We came up for my sons eighth birthday and he absolutely loved it. Great family stay!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! House is very nice and location is close to Dinosaur National Monument Park and Vernal Brewery. The surrounding area is beautiful to see.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Kelli’s place was great for our stay while we were in the area to visit Dinosaur National Monument. It was extremely family friendly for traveling with our kids, ages 3 and 5. The house was really clean and had everything we needed and more! Definitely recommend!"

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We booked a hotel for our 2-night stay in Vernal but at the last minute decided to cancel that and find something with a little more space.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was one of the best resort rentals I’ve ever stayed in. Very comfortable and the dinosaur touches were well done and very tasteful. They made the house very unique. It’s in a very quiet neighborhood and everything about the house has class. The sheets and towels are high-quality. Vernal has everything you need if you’re on a road trip and want to re-supply.

As the host suggests, eat at Betty’s and get a cinnamon roll!!"

2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Cute and convenient! Host has thought of everything you may need and provided it for you.
There is an air conditioner— window unit in one room. There is a swamp cooler in another, plus fans. We happened to go when it was very hot, and the window unit was not enough to cool off the whole place.
We had a great time at Kelli’s place!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very conveniently located to so many fun things. The house worked great for my husband and two kids. We were there over the fourth and watched the town fireworks from the yard. They were only a couple blocks away, so it felt like we had a front row seat."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The property is a great value and very conveniently located quite close to all the services you will need in Vernal, UT while still being in a quiet residential neighborhood. It serves as a great base to explore the surrounding area, especially DInosaur National Monument as it is less than 30 min away from the Quarry Visitor Center.
The house was quite clean, had all the amenities for a comfortable stay and it was clear that thought has gone into everything throughout the property. It is also dog friendly which was much appreciated."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Stay-a-saurus was a wonderful place! The quality of the appliances and furnishings made us feel as if we were staying in a home, rather than a rental unit. The little touches, like welcome chocolates! and area restaurant and activity information was much appreciated. The little dinosaur decor throughout the house was entertaining. The bed was comfortable, the bedroom window curtains dark for sleeping, and the kitchen fully stocked with everything we needed. The neighborhood was a pleasant residential area with off-street parking for our car. Thanks so much Kelli!"

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kelli is a great host! We felt welcome the moment that we stepped in the door! She absolutely thinks of everything! What made this stay even better is that we were able to have our two mini Aussies with us, they enjoyed the fenced backyard and we found a wonderful walking park just down the street, which was great for all of us! The neighborhood is nice and quite and convenient to parks, shopping and dining. We had some fabulous food from 4 of Vernal’s restaurants, which are open during COVID and we highly recommend all four! Betty’s for breakfast, make sure you come hungry.. the ham steak and fried potatoes are fantastic! Antica Forma has a great wood fired pizza and salad! We ate at Plaza Mexicana for lunch, we loved the enchiladas, the mole sauce is amazing! Our favorite place was The Quarry Steakhouse & Brewery.. the best Ribeye ever! We were in Vernal for an ice fishing tournament with Ice Addiction, we loved our stay so much that we have already booked the Stay-A-Saurus again this summer so that we can explore more in Vernal and fish and ATV. Thank you Kelli, we can’t wait to come back!"

Extremely easy and central home base for visiting Dino Nat'l Park and several petrogylph locations, Vernal as a town is very easy to navigate and also has everything you'd need for a short or long stay. Kelli was a terrific host and handled even tiny issues immediately, we really couldn't have asked for a better experience. The best recommendation we can give: we have already made plans to stay here again. Thank you Kelli!"

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a wonderful stay at your place in Vernal! Thank you so much for having us - we really appreciated the thoughtful little touches like the chocolates on the kitchen table, and we were so happy and surprised at how well stocked the kitchen was :) we ended up cooking quite a bit, which was perfect for one of the particularly cold days we were there. The dinosaur decor is amazing, all the furniture and beds are super comfy, and the kitchen is a space you’ll want to spend every morning in. We loved staying with you. Thank you for your hospitality!"

My girlfriend is a huge dinosaur nerd and she was taken by all the little dino-details in the BnB. Very delightful touches!
Kelli has some coupons for a local Mexican spot too. Beware how much you order, because the portions are huge!"

I loved the style and comfort Kelli’s place provided. This Airbnb feels like a cute little boutique hotel with all the amenities of home. The guidebook pointed us to some great fun and my dog enjoyed being a special guest as well. I will definitely be booking again the next time I’m in Vernal.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was very pretty and looked just like the pictures! She was very kind and answered all the questions I had. We didn’t have to text her the whole time during our stay because the instructions were very clear and easy to follow.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Suite Olive was the perfect stop after a long day of driving. Located in a quiet beautiful area with plenty to do. The suite itself was stunning, clean, spacious and very comfortable, and for a great price! Strongly recommend!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"When a listing has been designed with the end use in mind, it truly shines. Everything was perfect, everything you could think you would need was supplied. Just a great design and really well implemented. Would absolutely recommend."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place, in a quiet neighborhood. The place is super nice and very clean. It had everything I needed for my visited. Very close to “downtown”. The awesome local pizza place was only 4 minutes away. About a 20 minute drive to some really cool outdoor adventures."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was a welcome retreat after a day spent hiking throughout Dinosaur Nat'l Monument. The kitchen had everything we needed to prepare our dinner, the beds were comfy, and the shower was awesome - large, great shampoos, and plenty of hot water. Knowing that this was the basement of the owner's home, we expected to hear some overhead noise, and that was very minimal and definitely not distracting. Getting to Dinosaur is really easy from this location and we'd definitely stay here again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"As a new user, i was worried, for no reason.
The location was amazing. Great house and amazing sights nearby. 100% recommend."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I was at first wary about booking a place with only two reviews, but am so glad I did! The unit looks brand new, with a beautiful kitchen and bathroom. You can tell it was recently built/renovated. I felt very comfortable, and would not hesitate to return. While I stayed only one night, the unit would be perfect for a long-term stay, as it has everything one would need (including laundry) to feel at home."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"New, clean, modern, and well put together! ......Like a nice hotel suite but about half the price! We especially liked the built-in electric fireplace, kitchen styling/functionality, and large shower with amazing tile craftsmanship."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lisa and Erik’s tiny home was a perfect place for our family to spend the night on a roadtrip. The views of Dinosaur National Monument from the property, even right outside our front door, could not be more spectacular. The location is very quiet and private with amazing stargazing. Lisa’s detailed instructions for how to find the place were very helpful, especially since we arrived in the dark. The fact that their private airport sits on the same property is super cool too. The king bed was very comfortable and there was just enough room for our 2 kids to sleep as well using the sofa bed. The home is small and cozy, with just the amenities we needed for a comfortable night and morning. The bathhouse is a separate building right next door, but was also exclusively for our use, and everything is brand new and private. We will definitely stay again when in the area!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Absolutely beautiful place! Loved the location. The surroundings were pretty and peaceful. Definitely would stay here again!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We cannot say enough good about this place. It is beautiful inside and out. Well-designed with very comfortable furniture—some of which is handmade. Quiet with a gorgeous view and private area out back, all of which draws on the natural beauty around the place."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My adult family and I stayed 3 nights while exploring Dinosaur National Monument and Flaming Gorge. This location is out of Town offering a beautiful and peaceful spot. We picked up some groceries before arrival and were able to enjoy the evenings after days of driving. The theater room was a real bonus. Comfortable beds, peace and quiet. It was my second stay and I would not hesitate to return again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is squeaky clean! It felt very private, even though it is connected to their home. The design provides privacy and comfort. This home has high end furnishings, beds, etc. It felt like a retreat. I was there for work, but will definitely bring my family back for fun. They will enjoy the theater room. Sherrie provided excellent directions and prompt communication."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Stunning location with an incredible view. Just as described. The theater room was better than we could have imagined. Beds were comfortable. Lots of space to spread out. We loved the popcorn machine with the supplies. A short drive to all the attractions in town. The host was responsive and offered great check in and check out directions. Loved the recommendations book! Would stay again for sure.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying a short drive from the main town. Sitting outside and watching the sunset in the quiet was a great way to wind down after a day of hiking. We indulged in popcorn that was graciously provided in the media room a few nights.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I would stay here again.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Looking for an excuse to go back to this beautiful part of the country and stay in this extraordinary home again. If you require cleanliness in order to relax and unwind, then this is the place for you. By far the cleanest AirBnb I have ever stayed in."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Sherrie is a great and accommodating host.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay at the ranch. Good communication, even early check in was possible that day which we highly appreciated. the flat is huge and the private cinema made our stay very pleasant. Thanks!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place and location. A little awkward with the late check-in and early check-out if you're only staying one night. Cinema is an amazing bonus!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed one night here and loved it.
It’s a great location to Vernal and a perfect spot for a small family. Very pretty views and the place is spacious and worked well for us. The only downfall is that the beds are more on the firm side and I wish she had more places outside to sit and enjoy the views. I played outside with my kids and they loved the little yard space too. We saw 3 deer come right up to the fence line which was a fun little surprise. We will definitely stay again if we are traveling through Vernal!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow. Sherrie’s place was absolutely beautiful and so much more than adequate. Stayed here on a sister’s get away, and we had no intention of watching TV - until we saw the theater room. Then we enjoyed watching old shows we hadn’t thought of in years.
It’s well out of town, so we checked out the stars before bed and they were bright.
I really hope to return for a longer stay."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here. Very clean, comfortable, quiet, private and relaxing. We enjoyed it so much we extended our stay. Loved watching the deer in the evening, catching the sunset after a great day at the Dinosaur Monument Park and watching college football in the super cool TV room."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Sherrie’s place was immaculate. The location is beautiful. Tons of space in the Airbnb. It was incredibly clean.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay - I would highly recommend her place
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Sherrie’s! The place was super clean and the instructions provided in advance were helpful. The theatre room was a fun touch. There was a binder of information for local restaurants and things to do.
The only drawbacks were the mattresses were super firm and there is no way to control the temperature in the space (basement). There is a fan in the closet to use for circulation.
Overall, we had a great experience and would recommend!"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Pros: movie theater room. Popcorn. Clean living space. Fireplace. Coffee. Location.
Cons: The beds were terrible, probably the two worst beds we have ever slept on. There was no breakfast foods,not even snacks. Idk if the host knows but they are on ""airbnb"" which stands for ""bed and breakfast"". The beds need to be of higher quality. There needs to be breakfast food available. I've stayed at cheaper places that offered at least some breakfast options."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sherrie's place was exactly what we were expecting given the online descriptions. The Airbnb was immaculate, quiet, and spacious. We appreciated all of the recommendations Sherrie had left us for local attractions. Dinosaur National Monument is close by and we spent two full days there, on the Utah side one day and the Colorado side another day. We could have spent more time hiking on both sides! It was wonderful to come back at the end of a long day to Sherrie's Airbnb!"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying here. It is a little far from town, but it is worth it for the peace, quiet, and views. The space was clean, and the theater room was very nice. This was a very nice place to stay."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely breathtaking inside and out! The home was very comfortable and had everything that you might need. The view out back was so peaceful. We would definitely stay again with out a second thought. This home and host is a step above super host!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"One of the rare places that was clean enough I was actually comfortable without shoes on (my socks were clean every day). We had some water heater issues and they responded within minutes and worked to figure out the issue same day. Clean, comfortable, spacious."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place. Quiet and peaceful,view of lake was magnificent."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is wonderful. One of the nicest airbnbs I’ve stayed in. Everything was CLEAN, the kitchen is HUGE, the bed is comfortable, and the movie room is a huge plus! You won’t regret staying here!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a fun place to stay in a very beautiful part in Vernal.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a beautiful stay! If you’re out in this part of Utah do yourself a favor and book Sherrie’s home! We had such a lovely night and enjoyed the home theatre. But the real icing on the cake is the view from the property along with the animals. Clean and easy to find! Would 100% stay again.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful property
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was very nice because it was very friendly
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wow!!!
This is the best location in Vernal! Close enough to the city to get anything we needed but far enough a way to see the stars and enjoy nature. Views included the green pastures with horses and deer and the lake.
Kids loved watching movies in the home theater. Kitchen is enormous. We loved the stay! This will be our first go-to for future Vernal stays.
Thanks Sherrie!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had 4 day vacay/wedding in Vernal. Sherrie’s home was beautiful and it was 5 minute drive into town. Gorgeous surroundings coming from California we wanted the Utah feel and we felt it. There movie room is a bonus, plus popcorn.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a great air bnb! My daughter and I stayed for one night (we wish we could of stayed longer) everything was wonderful! It is a great space!
The theater room is so much fun!
We Loved that we could logon to our Internet, subscription accounts, and watch Netflix on the big screen TV!
My daughter thought the giant bean bag was the best to chill out in!!!
The view of the lake is serene!
Parking is super way too."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing little apartment. Only 2 minor things that I would say go against it. 1. You heard every last step and word from the family up stairs. And there was no cell service inside the apartment. Which I suppose did end up being fairly nice not hearing my go off every 10 minutes. The views are amazing, and the apartment was immaculate. The host was more than helpful and incredibly receptive about everything."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful location. Movie room is a nice bonus. Not too far from Dinosaur National Monument. Host was responsive.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super cozy and beautiful place. We had a very pleasant stay that exceeded our expectations. The cinema room was my personal highlight. I can only recommend the accommodation.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely quiet property. Beautiful views. We found the bed quite uncomfortable but liked the theater room! Thank you for a nice overnight stay.
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lake Ranch -lovely- out on the northern side of Vernal, not a right turn but a left. We are an older couple, which is important because of several small frustrations...but first the good stuff. Ranch looks like photos. The night skies were incredible and the quiet of the countryside perfect. The place was spotless, beautifully decorated, and a fun entertainment room that had a popcorn maker, but bring your own drip coffee.
For us, the short comings, I believe will mostly be addressed. We had a time with the front door lock combo. The lock was not opening all the way. The youngest of our party of 4, was the only one who could put his shoulder into it and get us in ...and out. He repaired a jammed ice maker. The front kitchen had notes to place dishes in the dishwasher but with 4 plates, washed/reused, but no hot water at the kitchen sink. The frt bedroom bed, very high, steps up on one side. We chose the second room. The note of a $40. charge if we didn't properly lock up :("
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is in a beautiful location and close to Dinosaur National Monument. Great stay!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay. The house was actually bigger then we thought it was going to be and provided us plenty of room and privacy for us and our 4 little ones. They had fun card and board games that our kids loved, and the arcade was an absolute hit. Lots of wonderful little touches around the house that made it feel very much like home. It was just a short 10 min drive to downtown, and only 20 min drive to Dinosaur National Monument. If we come back to the area we would love to stay again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home, very comfortable & beautifully furnished. Enjoyed my stay and will definitely be staying again when in town. Thank you for letting us stay at your place!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We drove in from Texas for the week. Jacob's home was absolutely adorable and felt like home. Our kids enjoyed the games and the neighbor's dogs and by the time it was ready tonleave they were asking if we could move here. The area was rural and the home was clean, appliances were great, that tub was perfect. having a tv in the bathroom is dangerous. I could have stayed in there the whole time. Jacob sent me a list of all the good stuff around the area. we took a drive up to the moonshine arch, green river dam and to fantasy canyon. absolutely must sees. they were beautiful. pictures don't do them justice. if we ever go back to vernal this is the place we would want to stay."

The house is on the outskirts of Vernal in a lovely rural area with lots of animals next door which was fun to watch. The games room was great with the retro arcade games and table football, took me back to my younger years. Every room had a tv, even the bathroom.
Thanks for being a great host, would definitely recommend a stay at this property."

Neighbor has lots of farm animals that are so friendly and entertained my little ones for hours! The farm fresh eggs left in the fridge was such an amazing touch!!
Arcade games were a blast and all the other games available at the house made for a fun evening.
If I could give this host and home a 12/10 review I would!
We will definitely be back next time we are in Vernal!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a great stay! The whole place was very clean and comfortable, plus there were some fun touches like local-themed games and puzzles.

The property was in the country and was peaceful and inviting. The beds were comfortable and I loved all of the fresh, clean white towels and linens. We felt very at home during our stay. There is a little farm on the property next door, and the animals are fun to watch! I enjoyed hearing the rooster crow in the morning! The home is very roomy and has a fun game room with large bean bag chairs to sprawl out in. Our grandson loved it! The kitchen has new stainless steel appliances and a nice little coffee setup on the counter. Jacob was an amazing host!! He was friendly and very communicative. He gave us a list of places to eat and visit. They were all great recommendations! He made us feel comfortable and welcome from the moment we rented his home. I would highly recommend his home, and can't wait to go back!!!! If you're visiting Vernal, this is the place to be! Great stay!!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Super clean and comfortable. Great for kids and adults alike. Responsive host. We spent three days exploring dinosaur land and were always happy to return to our home away from home.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a fantastic find! Jacob's place was spotless inside and very comfortable. From the time I walked in, I felt right at home. The instructions for entry were made clear prior to my arrival and there was a small fireplace on and waiting for me when I entered. Everything was clean and tidy. The bathrooms were very modern and nice. I stayed there by myself, but with three separate bedrooms, the house could comfortably sleep five. The game room was a fun touch. The Star Wars game specifically took me back to my younger years. There were even four deer who paid me a visit on several occasions, just outside the back fence. Jacob was quick to respond to questions. He also provided a number of recommendations for things to do in the area and places to eat. If you are ever in Vernal, I highly recommend Jacob's Cozy Hideaway!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This home is new, beautiful, and cozy. Every room is brightly lit, with nice furnishings and open spaces. The beds are the most comfortable vacation rental or hotel beds we have slept in. The kitchen and bathrooms are spacious and very nice. We had a blast playing the Pac-Man and Star Wars video arcade games and foosball with our teenagers. I especially enjoyed relaxing in front of the electric fireplace while also watching a movie on the big screen TV.
The weather was great for February and we thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Dinosaur National Monument, which was an easy drive from Jacob's place. Everything felt perfect. We'll be back to visit very soon."

2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a great stay! The property was easy to find, with simple entrance instructions and well-lit. When we arrived the gas fireplace was going and everything was in order, which made it feel very cozy. The property is newly updated with modern conveniences and amenities, comfortable beds, and lovely bathrooms (I especially loved the big bathtub in the master bathroom!) I can tell the host planned the property to anticipate the needs of the guests with nice touches and helpful comforts. My kids loved the arcade-style games and it was so nice that everything was in good working order from the dishwasher, oven, garbage disposal etc. Jacob was extremely responsive. He let me know when the property was ready and promptly answered questions. My family was very comfortable here - we will absolutely stay again the next time we are in the area! Thanks for a great stay!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home was a perfect home away from home for my fiance and I. The scenery was beautiful and so peaceful. Close to everything we had plan to do, and not to far from town.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home in the country. We were able to walk around and we fed the horses and saw cows with baby calfs. Very friendly neighbors. We loved the place.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice, cozy home in Vernal."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There were four of us ladies that stayed at John's place in Vernal Utah from the 6th to the 9th. When we walked inside the house we were thrilled to find a very clean, cozy and very nicely furnished house where we could feel at home during our stay. It would have been nice to have the key code and the check out instructions the day before we left on the 6th because my phone was not receiving email updates. The only problem was that I needed the key code and checkout instructions the day before leaving on my trip because my email on my phone was not working for some reason. Once at John's place I called Airbnb and they were able to provide the key code. The house is very nice - overall I give it 5 stars."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,John’s Airbnb was very comfortable. It was just a short drive from downtown. My family & I are from a big city. It was nice to sit outside & enjoy seeing all the stars & the quiet peaceful surroundings. Away from the light traffic & bright lights from downtown Vernal. We hiked as many trails as we could during our stay. It was wonderful to come “home” to a comfortable place to get a good nights rest. The Airbnb had everything we needed. 2 of us are a little on the OCD side. We both were impressed with the cleanliness. We will be recommending John’s place to family & friends. We look forward to another stay at John’s Airbnb.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"John has a lovely place with split bedrooms which is great for privacy. We loved the responsiveness of John and the beautiful, peaceful, private setting!"

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious and comfortable house in a rural setting. Nice view of Split Mountain. Just 14 miles to Dinosaur National Monument.
House had comfortable furniture and adequate amenities with new washer and dryer. Good air conditioning.
John was a responsive host. He was having an issue with the housekeeper which he stated would be resolved (Incomplete housekeeping when we arrived)."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was excellent, exactly as in the pictures, possibly nicer. We only stayed for a quick 2 nights to visit Dinosaur NM and it's a very easy drive from this house to there and also back to Vernal for dinner and other essentials. The house was spotless when we arrived and we enjoyed our stay!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I really enjoy these Airbnb homes that are in rural places yet close to anything you need. Perfect spot between Dinosaur National Monument and Vernal Utah. Completely satisfied with the stay.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is literally perfect !
Book this ASAP if it's available, you'll be glad you did.
John was simply the most accommodating amazing responsive host I've ever interacted with on Airbnb.
We really wanted to extend our stay after arriving, but sadly it was already booked up.
Excellent experience with this place and with John !"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing experience !!! The inside of the house was way bigger than it looks from the outside and the pictures. In the middle of the the country with beautiful views and 7 minutes from town. Everything inside was pristine clean. Very quiet and private indeed. Everything was available, coffee, shampoo, conditioner, towels, etc. I called John to ask him a question and he answered the phone on the spot.
I had an Amazing experience and definitely recommend it to anyone.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Glad to stay here again!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved this perfect house, it was roomy for our family and the perfect distance between Vernal and Dinosaur National Monument’s Quarry Hall. My wife loved getting up in the morning and drinking her coffee outside listening to the cows mooing and staring at the mountains. My kids loved their roomy & comfy beds. we traveled to the local trails and great hikes and came back to rest at this awesome home."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,beautiful and clean!
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! I would definitely stay there again!
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Lovely cabin. Very spacious and comfortable beds. Kitchen is large and well stocked with plates, glasses, silverware, pots and pans and everything else you might need. It's location was perfect for us, about 6 miles from town in a peaceful, quiet location. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely book this cabin again. The only thing I would recommend to the host is leave a few extra bath towel, but nonetheless, this place is definitely five stars!"
2023-05-01,2.0,Stayed with kids,We stayed 2 nights at this place. It is off the beaten path and that is what drew us in. First impression when we pulled up was it was very run down as compared to the photos. The yard needs a lot of maintenance. The second thing was the front door was very difficult to open and close because of how bad it would bind on the frame. My kids couldn’t open it. Second was they didn’t provide enough towels for all of the listed guests. We inquired about getting more towels and was met with no response from the host. We also had a couple other inquiries while we were there to which the host didn’t respond until right before we had to check out. Communication was very difficult with this host. To culminate this trip our last night there ended with seeing mice running around inside the family room. The host did say they would take care of the mice problem. All in all I would probably not look into renting this place again unless significant changes were made to the management of this house.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice place to stay!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great hosts! Very happy with the experience. Definitely felt at home, spacious layout, and very comfortable. Would come back here and rebook, for sure!!"

2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed a couple of nights here when visiting friends. It was a little out of the way on a rural road but if you don’t mind a few extra min works well. We were glad we had our own basic cooking things like oil, teapot, etc because it’s a little bare bones but other than that everything worked just fine and we slept comfortably. A solid option in this area."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,One of the best kept secrets in Vernal I loved this place so much I may just go back by myself to get away!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"John was a great host, helped with check in. Everything you need it was like home away from home."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time in the beautiful log cabin house during our short 2 night stay.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to make a pit stop before flying out of Vernal. Clean, quiet, and completely painless check in. John was super helpful and communicative throughout. One thing to note is that you will need a car to get around OR use a local cab company (not Uber, there are very few drivers and we were only able to successfully call one once) as there’s really nothing in terms of bars, restaurants, etc within walking distance. Regardless, would stay again."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We stayed here for over a week and not once did it feel like we weren’t in our own home. Everything was very clean and comfortable. The location was so perfect. You’re nestled away from traffic with the most incredible views of the gorgeous mountains and yet it’s just a short drive to any store or restaurant. 10/10 we would recommend staying here.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great homebase for our weedend adventures in Vernal. It is half way between Vernal and Dinasaur National Monument.

2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"We have stayed in quite a few Airbnb’s, this place was by far the best! It was everything described and then some! The only downfall is now my wife wants to remodel our home with the warmth and style of Desiree’s place! We will definitely be booking again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This cozy cottage is absolutely adorable, with everything you need to feel like you’re in your own home! Truly one of our top Airbnb finds (and easily the best master shower of any place we have ever stayed). Our only regrets are 1. that we didn’t add an extra day to our time here so that we could explore all that Vernal has to offer above & beyond Dinosaur National Monument, and 2. that we couldn’t pack up this house and take it with us as we continued on with our road trip adventures. Don’t hesitate to book this house! We would love to stay here again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,The Cozy Cottage was absolutely lovely. The location right downtown was great. The home was clean and beautifully decorated. Desiree’s communication was great. We will definitely stay here again when we are in Vernal!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a wonderful place to stay! Desiree’s home was equipped with everything that our family needed for a quick two day visit to the area. It was close to restaurants (Vernal Brewing down the street is great, by the way), the Utah Field House of Natural History Museum, and an easy drive to Dinosaur National Monument. The house is well stocked with supplies and toys for kiddos. The beds were comfortable and the showers were awesome. Thanks, Desiree!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was by far the best experience we’ve ever had staying at an airbnb (and we’ve stayed at a bunch). The check in process was just as described and super easy. The house was IMMACULATELY clean, absolutely perfect. There were tons of extra linens and towels, instruction guides in each room that were so helpful on our first day, and the kitchen was SO WELL STOCKED- maybe better stocked than my own kitchen. We truly were lacking nothing throughout our stay. Desiree had a cute little basket waiting on the counter with goodies for our family, they have so many fun board games and toys for the kids, and she made sure to have a travel crib waiting for us so we didn’t have to travel with ours. We could tell that Desiree put so much love attention and thought into this rental, it truly was a Luxury experience that was worth every penny. We have zero complaints! 10000000/10 recommend staying here!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was one of the most lovely stays we have had with Airbnb! Desiree’s place was extremely well decorated and had an exceptionally well stocked kitchen.

Truly lovely place for a family with an appreciation for design to stay!

She was immediately responsive to a few things we asked about and she gave great recommendations for local holiday events happening. There were many personal touches and we felt right at home in her updated and remodeled cottage. With the first seasonal cold front coming through the area, her family did great at salting the sidewalks/stairs for us. My kids really enjoyed playing with items in her toy cabinet, and found everything we needed in the home as well as excellent restaurants in the area. We are looking forward to a return trip in the future!!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Desiree’s place truly is a cozy cottage. It felt like home away from home.

The kitchen was spotless and well euqipped which is important to us as we cook all of our meals. The beds were comfortable and the bathrooms were also spotless. We arrived late and felt safe in the neighborhood.

We wanted for nothing!
Desiree was very kind, responsive, and helpful. I had an issue with our reservation cancelling unexpectedly just a few days before our arrival. I reached out and she took care of it promptly so there were no hiccups. Check-in and check-out were super smooth.
I'd book our stay here right now in advance of next year's conference if I could! Highly, highly recommended."

The kitchen was loaded with every possible utensil and appliance you could ever need (a rolling pin! An electric tea kettle! And everything was very cute and high quality). Even the shampoo and conditioner in the bathrooms smelled amazing. My daughter kept making me smell her hair.
We didn’t realize it but our stay also overlapped with the Vernal Rodeo. We were so pleasantly surprised with a beautiful fireworks show we watched from the porch.
It was absolutely magical. Highly recommended."

Of course all of the basics were covered, but Desiree also added a personal touch by providing bottled water and cookies when we arrived. I would stay here again a hundred times over. We were sad to check out."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We were in town for 1 night to watch our son play baseball— found this little gem and it was the the most adorable place we’ve ever stayed. Desiree’s attention to detail in this cozy cottage was the incredible. It made me want to go home and do some DYI projects. Because we were only there for a night we didn’t need to use many of the amenities but I can tell you— you do not need to bring anything. She’s thought of everything from lotions and soaps to everything you would need in a kitchen. A cabinet of games and books and things for the little ones in the game room. TV’s in every room. Extra linens. Even makeup removal clothes! I loved the layout of the cottage too- we had another set of baseball parents staying with us and so my husband and I took the queen bedroom next to the twin bedroom that our boys stayed in with our own bathroom and our friends stayed on the other side of the house in the master king bedroom/suite. Super clean too. Wish our stay was longer!!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As soon as we walked in the door, we were impressed: clean, light, and roomy for the two of us. Photos online can’t accurately describe what a wonderful home this is. Kitchen was well-stocked with pots/pans, plates , cups, and flatware; plenty of “Tupperware” as well as foil and plastic wrap. Bathroom had quality products and towels. Bed was comfortable, and lots of closet space.
Very simply but beautifully decorated; a lot of thought has gone into hosting, and it was a joy to come back from a couple days of hiking to such a comfortable and welcoming home. Vernal has a lot to offer, and we were in a quiet residential neighborhood with easy access to everything.
It was a joy to meet Brent, who drove by while I was in the front yard; he and his wife take pride in what they offer, and rightfully so. As I told him, we were ready to move in! Thanks for a great care-free, easy stay."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our second stay at the property, and we were not disappointed! It is a wonderful place to stay when we are in town visiting family!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We would definitely stay again, loved the Dino themed house, it was cute and cozy and felt like home. It was in a nice quiet neighborhood (very easy to find just look for the dinosaur outside) and 5 minutes away from Walmart (which is always a plus 👍). Loved the place and would highly recommend."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cozy house.
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Great cute little place in Vernal. The inside was beautiful and was the perfect size for us.
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Located in a quiet neighborhood
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Simple but delightful! Great location.
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Very clean and organized. The kitchen had everything we needed. Lots of DVDs but a player wasn’t hooked up. We found the DVD player in storage but couldn’t get it to work. The hot water is an issue and runs out too fast. 3 minutes into the shower it was cold. Also the shower drain doesn’t drain so you stand in 2 inches of water. The dishwasher was not empty when we arrived which isn’t a big deal but I would have liked it ready to load. Laundry on site is wonderful. Beds are pretty comfortable too
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little house on a quiet neighborhood street. Complete with everything one needs for a stay - I used it as a base for a couple of days at Dinosaur NM. Not walkable to stores and 'downtown' Vernal, but that is OK - short 5 min drive to either."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing house to explore Vernal and surroundings. Super well equipped and clean house. We loved all the children books it had, as well as the play structure in the backyard. Communication with Brent was super easy and quick. Thanks! We will definetely be back"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in Vernal! First thing we noticed when we arrived was how fresh & clean smelling the entrance was…same was true for the rest of the home! The host provides everything you could need for a comfortable stay. We greatly appreciated the gas grill outside to cook dinner. Highly recommend this Airbnb!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I liked that you could enter through the kitchen. It made it easy to unload the vehicle and get everything situated. The rooms are set up nicely and had everything you needed. This was my first time using AirB&B and I was impressed at how easy it was.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice home. Was very clean in a quiet neighborhood. Would definitely stay here again.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Brent’s place was clean and quiet, in a pleasant residential neighborhood. The home was comfortable and adequately stocked for our quick stopover. The hosts were timely and responsive and I would choose to stay at the Dino Den again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Will book again and hopefully regularly!
Thank you Brent! Our family definitely made a precious memory this weekend in Vernal- fantastic pizza (forgot in the fridge-sorry!), a clean home and open backyard to actually play in, Dinosaur Quarry, some tweens that weren’t too cool to put their phones down for a moment to grip swings, rings, climb and not forget it’s ok to still be a kid! Thank you for paying attention to the details that matter to a family that wants to try to do a family bond trip planned by my best friend (Thank you baby!) The makeup wipes, Dino salt and pepper shakers, each room feeling complete, solar twinkle lights, the sound of crickets, thunder and lightening in the distance, cool breeze carrying the smell of rain. The calm. The peace. Reconnecting with my family- your place is a piece of heaven. Thank you for helping make our weekend stay magical."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute place. Kids loved the back yard.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place. Comfortable. Clean. Would def stay again! Great family.
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"I have stayed at a lot of Airbnb's and Brents place was the top of my list as a great and amazing place.
He had everything we needed. Beds were comfortable and the icing on the top is that the bathroom towels were very soft. I know that seems silly, but most places I stay, the towels are like sandpaper.
Brent was very accommodating with our needs.
I would recommend Brents place to my friends."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The place was nice and clean. Coming back in a month
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved our quick stay at Brent’s home for a NICA bike race. The home is darling and everything was perfect. Will definitely book again if we are in the area.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at Brent's - lots of space and beautifully decorated. The yard with swing set was a big hit with the 2 kids and was a real plus. I'd recommend this house to anyone and will come back if we're ever in the area again!
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,The house is great with a lot of dinosaur themed decoration. Everything was very comfy and it felt like home. The kitchen is very well equipped with almost everything you could possibly need.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We came into town for a conference at the Uintah Conference center, which was an 8 minute drive.
You can see a lot of thought went into Brent’s place, nicely decorated, loved the vanity light in the bathroom, plenty of towels and nicely stocked kitchen.
Brent stopped by the first day to make sure everything was ok.
The queen size bed tended to roll towards the center, so we moved to another bed (there are three).
I checked in with Brent to see if there were instructions on how to leave the Airbnb, (each one has different requests such as “place towels in a location”, or “run dishwasher”, etc. ) but I didn’t see any nor did I hear from him prior to our departure, so I removed trash, gather towels, started dishwasher etc. out of courtesy. I also realized I accidentally had silverware of his, which I promptly alerted to him and returned (used it to eat lunch at the conference center).
Other than that, there’s a cozy place to sit outside, which we enjoyed."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,will stay here again!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay at the Brent’s dinosaur-themed home in Vernal was a blast! The house was clean, well-equipped, and had a fantastic backyard with a barbecue, which made it an ideal home away from home. Plenty of fun and games for the kids and just a stone’s throw away from Dinosaur National Monument. Brent and his wife were responsive, kind, and thoughtful. Seamless check-in and check-out process. This house was one of the highlights of our family vacation, and we owe a huge thank-you to Brent for making it such a memorable experience. 🦕"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was wonderful. My 8 year old was over the moon about all of the details with dinosaurs! The house was clean and as advertised. Everything we needed was available.

We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stopped at Brent's place for just one night. Our family has been on the road for over 3 weeks, mostly camping. So this was a wonderful stay. Real beds, a kitchen to cook some meals for the next leg of the trip and hot showers! Our kids thoroughly enjoyed the playset and all the books also. If we're ever this way again we'll definitely look up Brent's place! Thanks for the wonderful stay!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great little renovated house, exactly what we needed for a brief stay in Vernal. It took us a little while to figure out a couple of the electrical outlet/switches--Don't know if there were instructions but we figured it out pretty quickly. The playground area in the fenced backyard was great for my 5 year old."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Brent's house is so clean and just as described in the listing. It was a great place to stay and my daughter loved the dinosaur theme throughout the home. A great place to stay when in Vernal!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My paleontologist 6 year old absolutely loved the dinosaur theme which, I thought, was tastefully executed.

Brent was an incredible host and made us feel right at home. Whenever we had questions or anything like that, he immediately responded and resolved any issues that came up. Our friends and family also adored the house! Overall, we were in love with our time at the Dino Den. If we ever need another stay-cation, we will for sure be back. Thank you for having us!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Really clean, quiet place. Had a play set in the backyard, books for the kids inside, and there wasn't anything breakable in reach so it was a nice spot for a family with littles. Pretty good location for experiencing all the dino stuff in Vernal and Jensen."

2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"The Dino Den was perfect! Great location, very clean, comfortable beds. We were only in town one night and it suited our needs for comfy beds and privacy so we were ready for 2 days of adventure outside."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house was clean, comfortable, and had a great layout. It’s small but really uses the space well. It’s kid friendly and our children loved the playground, picture books, and cozy blankets. It was a pretty short drive to both Dinosaur National Monument and the Red Fleet Dinosaur Track trailhead which our kids loved. It was much more affordable than several other Airbnbs in the area as well. Would highly recommend it!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is great, its very affordable convenient and comfortable."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home and it’s host were fantastic!!! This was our fourth stay in Vernal in the past year, and our accommodations this time were by far and away the best that we have had!!! We will definitely plan to stay here again for every return trip!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice 3 bedroom house. It was Clean and comfortable.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything was great. The inside was extremely clean and well setup for the space. He had boot trays which was nice for us because things were really muddy the weekend we were out there and it helped keep it clean inside. Great value for what you pay. One thing to keep in mind is the water heater is electric so you may need to stagger showers. But that wouldn't stop me from renting it again.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you need to spend time in Vernal, spend it here. Very comfortable home away from home."
2023-03-01,4.0,Group trip,"We had a hard time checking in due to the lock not taking the code. After we received a new code from host the new code worked only once and we were once again not able to unlock the door. The lock issue was a big deal to be honest. Also when we arrived the blankets were still damp and wet, and we had to dry them before using them. Besides that, the place was neat, clean, and had our necessities."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Awesome place, and awesome host. Was the perfect stay, will definitely be back and recommend to everyone"

The kitchen was stocked with everything you may need. The carport! I loved the carport. It snowed each evening during my visit. It was wonderful to get in my car and go each morning, rather than scraping ice and brushing snow. Communication with Brent was exceptional. Prompt and thorough responses and communication. I hope to stay here each time that I visit Vernal!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Easily one of the best Airbnb's we have stayed in. Perfect for families as there are 2 living spaces- one with all the things to keep kids occupied. We felt instantly at home and wished we had stayed longer. Clean, comfortable, and there was even a little care package when we arrived. We can't wait to stay here again next time time we are in town."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Nice place, had a great stay. Definitely recommend to stay here."
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Totally recommend this beautiful home and has everything you need and more. She was always on top of my questions. And or comments.
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great experience! It's obvious the owners were intentional when they envisioned the property and what guest would need, it has everything. The kitchen has everything you'd have at home; we made homemade rolls, salads, and other sides for Thanksgiving and only bought food. Bedroom are spacious, beds are super comfortable and so are the pillows. We had eight adults with plenty of room for all. Everything in the house worked as expected. Bathrooms were beautiful too, no lack of hot water (overnight was 19 degrees) and the HVAC system kept us plenty warm. The fire pit and swing in the backyard were tempting but we just didn't have time to use them. Plenty of parking too, we had 4 cars and could have fit 3 more. The house is less than 10 minutes from 3 grocery stores, dozens of restaurants, and a ton of shopping. The family we went to visit was eight minutes away, so this house is very central. One note, the house is on a somewhat busy road, so keep an eye on small children when outside."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great place to stay
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was a great experience and a wonderful location giving us access to a lot of great restaurants and tourist attractions.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic house in an ideal location in the heart of Vernal. Everything was “as advertised” and the house was really comfortable. The house also had a lot of nice little touches that personalized our stay, including the coffee bar, snacks and a list of recommended restaurants. Would definitely recommend due to the quality of the house, its location and great hosts."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay, the house is amazing, especially with the separate kids play area WITH door. The area is nice and quiet and a short walk to the Dinosaur Museum. Would love to stay here again if we visit again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best homes we’ve ever stayed in. Desiree has thought of everything. So many amenities. She even left snacks! So clean and the beds were very comfortable. Prompt help when we were having a problem getting the tv to work (super easy fix). The coffee bar and fire pit were the best! Although we didn’t have kids with us, this place would be great for those who do. Easy walking distance to dining, shopping. Just a perfect place. Will definitely stay again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautifully renovated home, was exactly as pictured. Hosts were prompt in responding to questions. Plenty of amenities- loved the coffee bar!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was perfect for our group. There were 10 of us and it never crowded. It was clean and we'll stocked. It was close to everything we wanted to do. Great hosts!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I came in for a funeral. Desiree’s house was perfect for my family of 5. Well stocked with everything you need and nice little touches to make everyone feel at home. The kids loved the swing in the backyard, the air hockey table and the Xbox. Kept their mind off of why we were there. We would absolutely recommend this house for anyone visiting the area."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved this stay! We travel a lot and felt like the extra details made this place stand above so many, like the quality full size lotion, body wash, shampoo and conditioners in each bathroom. Two ply toliet paper and really fluffy towels! All the beds were comfortable, the AC worked great and the backyard swing and sitting area was a wonderful place for our family to hang out. We were just a few blocks from restaurants, parks and everything you could want. We were there for a nieces wedding, so we had events to attend, but we also went golfing and looked at a lot of fun local hikes and things to do. I hope we get an opportunity to come back as we would love to stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Best-stocked Airbnb we have ever stayed in. They thought of everything. So fun for kids—they loved the swing in the back yard.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This location was two minutes (literally) from everywhere I needed to be in Vernal.
I had a special request that I sent to the host before booking and she was more than accommodating and responded within minutes.
Super Clean, Very well stocked, they knew I had plans for the BBQ so checked the functionality and even replaced it when the electric ignitor didn't work on the old unit (Thats amazing I would have been happy with a long lighter and a note!). Anytime I had a question I got a real time response.
This was perfect for my needs and the house received several positive compliments from coworkers who stayed in the local hotels who wish they would have booked this location."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family had a great stay! The home was beautiful. There was plenty of space for all of us, and the beds were very comfortable. The rooms were dark in the morning, which we really appreciated. There was a lot of seating for all of us in the kitchen and living rooms. The special touches around the house stood out to us, such as the air hockey table, the snacks set out for us, the welcome book, and toys, etc. The kids had fun on the swing in the backyard.

Looking forward to staying next year too!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Desiree’s place was our home base while exploring Dinosaur National Monument and all the cool areas near Vernal (Red Fleet, Moonshine Arch, Fantasy Canyon, Flaming Gorge to name a few. This home was perfect for our family of 3. More than enough space. The kids area with the air hockey and Xbox was a hit. Another win was the toys - specifically the football we were able to use in the backyard. This home was set up perfectly for us to stay at - we felt like we were at home and able to relax after hiking and heat filled days. We took advantage of grilling out and sitting in the backyard. Beds were comfortable. As a mom who likes to have things staged for the day, having the space at the front door was so helpful. Desiree has put a lot of thought into making this a welcoming home to stay at and relax - which we appreciated. We would stay here again on a future visit to Vernal and we’ve shared it with our friends and family as well."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable home with lots of extras. One of the best vacation rentals we have stayed at.

We walked about 15 minutes to town every night for supper, and there's easy direct access to the main E, W, and N highways. Desiree' was excellent with communications. All in all the best US AirBnB we've stayed at, highly recommended. Vernal itself was also fine, friendly people and lots of stunning scenery within easy driving distance."

Our family went out adventuring each day and this home really felt like coming “home” after each excursion. Our kids loved the Xbox and air hockey, games and toys. The adults loved that the kids had somewhere to go where they could play and be loud and there was a cozy living room for adults who needed a place to relax and visit. The kitchen was well stocked, appliances all worked great. And the location was central to all our activities.
Definitely on our top 10 list of airbnbs we’ve stayed at!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is an amazing place to stay. I have stayed in many Airbnbs but this is one of the first times the pictures of the listing don’t do the place justice. The remodel was amazing and each room was bigger than we were expecting. The bedrooms were very large and the beds extremely comfortable. Kitchen was beautiful and well-stocked including snacks and everything you need to cook at home. Our little boy was excited for all the games/toys and the Xbox was a pleasant surprise.
The home does border apartments but you can barely notice you have neighbors and felt private to us. It’s a great place to stay and we highly recommend it to anyone staying in Vernal!"

Coffee maker (with coffee), shampoo/conditioner, towels (quality), and several other things that people have at home they usually miss or forget when traveling. Nice touches that show they care."

It was as clean as could be, had all necessary cooking tools, and included wonderful amenities (the air hockey table was a huge hit with the family). We were cool as cucumbers with the central A/C, the beds were super comfy, and we had more than enough towels. The host left welcome snacks and a useful guide to answer basic questions a guest may have. Having a washer and dryer was also a welcome luxury. We enjoyed the proximity of the listing to Dinosaur National Monument. Additionally, the home is less than a mile from the Utah Field Museum as well as the OARS rafting company (also highly recommend their day trip on the Green River). On the morning we left Desiree’s place, everyone agreed that we wished we could have stayed longer. 😊"

I wasn’t a fan of only having one air conditioner just in the living room and was grateful for having regular fans in the bedrooms. The bed was comfy, but the heat got to me, but it had been 105 degrees out. The sound of the traffic was bothersome, so next time I’ll not forget to bring earplugs and my sleep mask. Overall, I would absolutely recommend staying there."

We were greeted with a hand written thank you card, locally made mint chocolate truffles, and the cutest little pink Dino, which is the mascot for the town of Vernal. Cottage was cozy with updates on the kitchen and bathroom. It had the cleanliness and modern amenities of a boutique hotel and the decor honored the cottage that it is. The bed linens were close to new, comfortable, pretty, and great quality. In the kitchen we were offered a cute little basket of paper plates, plastic cups, and silverware as well as normal plates, etc. We also found a ton of suggestions for daily itineraries, local sites, and activities in the surrounding area.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great house and better host; super accommodating and incredibly informative. One of the best experiences I had on AirBnb.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place to stay! This is a beautiful home that is a great launching point to all of the interests in the area - Flaming Gorge, Dinosaur monument, and endless miles of hiking through beautiful mountains. Communication was fantastic with the owners! It was very easy to gain access, and the home has been updated beautifully. We very much hope to stay there again on our next visit to the area."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great hosts, cozy little home to stay in. The pillows were so comfy, and they had nice fleece blankets on the bed. The home is located about 5 minutes from Main Street and 30 minutes from Dinosaur National Monument. Oscillating fans in both rooms and a nice ceiling fan in the living room for maximum air flow."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just as described. Clean, comfortable, and a pretty quiet location. Really close to Dinosaur Monument Park. Bruce let us check in early, which was much appreciated.
We'd definitely stay here again."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in Vernal.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home was perfect for our trip to Vernal! Cozy, warm and very welcoming! Description was spot on and the place was super clean! Perfect location! If we come back to Vernal this is 100% where we will stay again!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location was a good one to pop over to Dinosaur National Monument and see the petroglyphs at the Ranch. The hosts had lots of extras, in case you forgot anything as well as brochures and info on the local area. Also just a few blocks from a walking park for an early morning stroll."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend staying at Bruce’s house! It is very clean and very well done thanks to what looks like recent renovations. The house is also fully stocked, but I would note there is no central A/C as noted on the posting. It was pretty hot the first day or two of our stay, which made the evenings a little toasty. 😊"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you plan to stay in Vernal, this is the house for you! The owners have done a magnificent job of renovating this small farmhouse, adding all modern conveniences in a pleasant and comfortable design. We enjoyed having the washer/dryer and we’ll equipped kitchen. They’ve even stocked the medicine cabinet in the bathroom which items you may have forgotten such as toothpaste and combs. There are many brochures in the home describing the local attractions and the location of the house is convenient not only to Dinosaur National Monument and the Utah state natural history museum, it’s just a short drive from the petroglyphs at McConkie ranch as well. There is a brand new family owned Mexican restaurant across the street where we had an excellent meal (don’t be fooled by its modest appearance) and for some good clean fun, stop by the unique dinosaur themed car wash on the east end of town. It was a real pleasure to stay in this home."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful and relaxing stay! This place is very clean, great location, and great and kind hosts! The location is great, so close to grocery stores, and other businesses. I would stay here again, and again."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,amazing place. great location easy to get to. very comfortable furniture. my group will definitely be back. highly recommend to anyone
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely what we needed. The location was great for us, as we were doing local sight seeing and the Dinosaur National Monument. This was our first non-hotel trip and I do not believe that we will go back. Bruce's cottage allowed all of us to truly relax and still divide out personal time. The back sitting area was a delight. We did not see any animals, however you can hear many song birds. Do not let the main road sway you away from the cottage, as the traffic is practically nonexistent after dark and none of us were awakened by any road noise. We are from Colorado and are accustomed to opening the windows after night fall and boy were we glad we did here too. The crisp area fills the cottage in no time making sleeping something to look forward to. The beds were a bit on the firm side and for a larger person the only choice was the master bed, as it was softer. We were also happy to see that the washer and dryer are full size. Only one load and done! We are also accustomed to coming fully prepared and did not need to use any of the house offerings, with the exception of the dishes. But we soon found out if we forgot something the cottage most likely offered a substitution. We are extremely happy with our stay at Bruce's Cottage and hope you choose it for your stay."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This charming farmhouse was a very comfortable place to stay. It was very clean and provided lots of amenities. Bruce had many brochures available to help plan activities.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bruce was such a gracious host and we were so grateful to stay in his wonderful place. This little home has everything - it is perfect and immaculately clean! So comfortable and every need has been thought through. Bruce even has a wonderful collection of information regarding local history, maps, information on the Dinosaur Monument, etc. The town is just down the road with several grocery stores, local places to eat, plus other businesses that would take care of any need a visitor might need. There is some road traffic/noise but it is only during the day and at night, the area becomes very quiet. Not a major thing for us because we were out and about during the day but thought it should be mentioned. Definitely a place we would come back to when we go to Vernal again!!!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great base for running the Dino Half, exploring the McConkie Ranch Petroglyphs, and visiting Vernal / Dinosaur National Monument. Plenty of space for a small family, nice and clean. Well-stocked, including Keurig coffee with creamer/sugar; only thing we really missed was a baking sheet or tinfoil. Several board games were great for lazy mornings."

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is even lovelier in person--super clean, plenty of space, lots of thoughtful touches and amenities along with a sweet note from the host upon arrival. This spot is a perfect location--a great home base for adventuring at nearby parks and at Dinosaur National Monument, and convenient (just a few minute's drive) to downtown Vernal for dining. Highly recommend-we will certainly be back ourselves!"

We weren’t crazy about the location and a bit spendy."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Extremely clean and well-maintained home. Looks small from the outside, but is a well laid-out and a great use of space, and looks to be recently updated. Great for a family visiting the parks in the area!"

The cottage was well taken care of, clean, and charming.
They clearly have given a lot of attention to making sure their guests are comfortable and at home.

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a really nice, clean place, especially for a party that needs two bedrooms (e.g., two couples). It's a fantastic value compared to multiple hotel rooms.

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A prefect little home away from home for a family or two couples from opposite sides of the country getting together. Everything was clean and welcoming.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at the cozy cottage. The house is very comfortable, they have truly thought of their guests comfort. The chairs on the back deck are so comfortable and the sunrise was beautiful. The kitchen is stocked well, I loved sitting in the chair in the bedroom and reading in the mornings and evenings, they are very pretty bedrooms. I loved the carpets, they reminded me of my grandma's house growing up but the carpet was new and nice. It's a small bathroom but remodeled to use the space very well and oh so pretty. I would definitely stay here again."

It was near Main St., easy to find and access, cool during the heat of the day, cozy at night and had everything I needed: deluxe shower, well appointed kitchen, reliable internet and softest sheets ever.

The hosts live farther back on the property and are available to help with anything you need. Superb communication and such a personal experience. It felt like we were staying with old friends! We found everything we needed and more, from pots and pans, to laundry detergent, to extra pillows, to a couple of fun games to play and books to read. All in all a phenomenal stay and we would go back in a heartbeat!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had the privilege of staying at their cozy cottage and it exceeded our expectations.
From the details setup throughout the home, the cleanliness, and the private space it sure felt like home away from home during our stay in Vernal.
I’ve stayed in many AirBnB’s and this was one of the best prepared for me and my family.
This property and host earns my highest recommendation.

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Really appreciated all the visitor info, maps, etc… I’m typically not a hot tub fan. Used this both nights.

Thanks again,
The Blues"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We were very happy staying at Kevin’s place. It was perfect for what we needed and you couldn’t ask for a friendly your host. My next trip to Vernal if his place is available will be our first pick.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,this is my very favorite place to stay when I'm in town!!
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice little house
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had got a hotel the previous night that was terrible. We have never used Airbnb before but Kevin made the experience amazing. We will be doing this way more often!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a great experience from the start. Kevin has been very responsive from the beginning, and we were so impressed with his flexibility regarding our schedule. Super accommodating. The rental was very quaint and cozy, with more than enough amenities to ensure we were comfortable. Very roomy as well for our family - so much better than a hotel! We had plenty of room to hang out together, but also for everyone to have their own space. We loved and utilized all the food recommendations, and the kids LOVED the hot tub! Location was also brilliant for us. Just minutes away from everything. We don’t plan to go to Vernal often, but if/when we do again, we will definitely try to book with Kevin! Thank you for a great stay!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"It worked perfect for us, will try and get for next year, thanks Kevin"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommended! I was here on business and wish it had been on vacation because this house was loaded! Very clean and homey. I was able to get to enjoy the hot tub fr one of the nights, and it was much needed after a long trip and heavy lifting! 10/10"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our stay! only a block from our venue!
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was the cutest little home! Worked perfect for what we needed! When we go back to Vernal, we will definitely book here again! The home is so clean, comfortable, and close to everything! Kevin and his wife were also so nice!"
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"House was comfortable, instructions for things were thorough, filled our needs sufficiently."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Kevin and Katelyn were such wonderful hosts! They responded to text messages immediately, and checked in with me during my longer stay to make sure everything was still going well. House welcome book has a whole list of things to do for whatever you're in to, and even if you're a local like me visiting family, there are things on the list that surprised me! Last time I was here, it was summer, so too hot to use some of the great amenities like the hot tub, amazing soaking tup upstairs, and the fireplace in the dining room. This time around, I got to use all three, and Kevin responded immediately with questions.
The best part about this home for me, is that Kevin allows dogs, which is a must for me. This was my puppy and I's second stay in three months and it really makes me heart happy to be able to include her in family gatherings and know she is safe and happy running around the fenced in back yard!
This really is a perfect, charming place to stay if you are in Vernal!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We absolutely loved our weekend at Kevin's home. The house felt very warm and welcoming, the mattress on the bed was super comfortable, and we adored the access to the hot tub. The hot tub was private from the street with the way the lid flipped up. The neighborhood was incredibly quiet, and we were within walking distance to the main street (we walked to the bar Little B's one afternoon). We can't recommend this home more!"

They are a very nice young couple and we’re helpful"

2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"The place was good for a place to rest our head for the night. Was close to a main street but the place itself felt dated. The furniture was very old, the back door was hard to close and latch, but the sky was beautiful and always a plus with a hot tub."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Kevins Home was very well appointed. Only one block away from the conference center, and two blocks from the main street & I felt safe in the neighborhood.

I hope to stay here again next year."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The stay at Kevin's was amazing. We wished we could have stayed longer because it was such a beautiful place and perfect for our family. We came to town to attend an event at the Uintah Conference Center, a short walk from the house! We were just looking for a place to crash in the evening, but it was so nice and created such a fun gathering place with all the amenities of home, we wished we had booked another night! Next year we are staying longer and seeing more of Vernal now that we've had such a wonderful experience this first visit. Thanks Kevin!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Everything was amazing. My family felt right at home. The house was stocked with necessary items and everything was easily found with labels, an excellent little touch. It was close to all activities and restaurants. We can't wait to come back and stay again next time we spend more than a day in the area, we were disappointed that it was booked and we couldn't stay another night!!!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful stay! Spotless, spotless! Charming. Great fenced yard for chuckit with the pup. Wonderful for families, though there was just my wife and I and our border colliie. Felt spoiled, including the hot tub in the morning before we left. Nice recommendations. Priced very fairly, and amazingly so for a family who needs the entire space. Felt so homey and supplied thoughtfully and well. Would definitely stay here again.

I highly recommend staying in this home as we loved every moment we were there!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Ideal place as we came to see Dinosaur National Monument. We had our grandkids and daughter in law. They liked having their own space upstairs. The hot tube was a plus after a long day of traveling. Our 9 year old wrote an outstanding review in your book.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kevin's place was perfect for what we needed. There were three adults and we each had our own room. We stayed only one night, but the place was easy, comfortable, and Kevin was responsive and accommodating."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Fun old home with character. Great for families. Fun hot tub & air hockey. Fancy soaking tub w/fireplace on the wall. Host communicated well. Lots of gathering space/seating. We had a large group and rented 2 houses and gathered here for some meals. Pull-out bed was only a foam pad you could feel all the springs through so kids slept on the couches instead. Upstairs is hot in summer but there were fans for both rooms.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our time at Kevin's place in Vernal. The house was only 2 blocks from the main strip with all the restaurants, shops, and occasional bar. The place was spotless and had everything you would need in a kitchen--even a waffle maker! There was plenty of parking as well. Despite being nearly 100 degrees outside, the downstairs still stayed comfortable with a well-working AC. Little things showed that Kevin really cares about his guests: local maps and activity brochures, lotion and room spray in each bathroom, Q-tips and cotton swabs, ample towels and more. A+ host all the way!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was a very quaint, quiet home. Very comfortable and central to the city. Beds were clean and comfortable.

For our 3 night stay we were able to walk to local museums and activities. Our host has made great efforts to make all age levels and furry friends comfortable and entertained. As GrandMuM traveling with 3 of my grandchildren, I felt totally safe in this neighborhood. I especially enjoyed my morning coffee and puzzles on the porch outside. Vernal is a great hub for adventures!"

the house is very conveniently located near main routed yet back far enough so you do not hear traffic at all. the hot tub was a nice extra and much needed after a long day driving/hiking.
i would stay here again if i ever come through again. the only suggestion is bring your own coffee, there were plenty of filters, but no coffee. not a big deal alot of bnb ive been in are this way"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Kevin’s house in Vernal. While it’s not fancy and represents many different time periods, it had everything we needed. I grew up in a 250 yr old house that had lots of different time periods so it was just right for me. Kevin was so easy to work with. When we thought we blew a fuse, he was there in 5 minutes. It was an awesome place to reset, do some laundry and cooking for the next 3 months of our trip. Thanks Kevin and your helpful neighbors."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I enjoyed Kevin's place. It was close to downtown Vernal but far enough away to be peaceful. Everything we needed for our dog was already in place, including lots of toys. The place is spacious and clean, and the fenced yard was a plus. The kitchen was stocked well enough for all of our cooking needs. Our granddaughter really appreciated the the mixed pastel children's dish sets (so cute, she wanted to bring them home). The price was very reasonable, so we would definitely stay here again."

Lots of brochures and recommendations for the town and surrounding areas. Jacuzzi tub and hot tub were relaxing and much appreciated! Everything was easy to locate inside the home. Although we didn't bring any animals, the animal pet area outdoors was impressive. We live on a family farm and it still impressed us with the size and shelter provided. Will stay again!"

Bathroom fully stocked with any toiletry a person might have forgotten, definitely above and beyond the call of duty. Stayed during a snow storm (20+ inches over the course of a week) and the driveway/sidewalks were always shoveled first thing. Hot tub was wonderfully hot, perfect for sitting and watching the snow come down. Everything was very tidy and clean. Kevin couldn’t have been a better host.

Our married children were happy to be able to take their dogs with too. The house is old but he has done a beautiful job renovating it. The bathrooms are new and nice as is the kitchen which has plenty of dishes, pots and pans. There's also a washer/dryer and a nice TV. He provided books, puzzles and games, guidebooks and maps for local attractions and a list of good places to eat. There are nice touches like night lights and plenty of towels for a big family. Eating space is really great - a big table with 6 chairs, a breakfast nook that seats 6 or more and a table outside on the deck with 3 chairs. We didn't need a pack-n-play or booster seat but those are also there. The house is just a few blocks off of Main Street (191 and 40) so things were easy to get to. It's a quiet neighborhood that was nice to walk in. You can even walk to the Utah Field House of Natural History, a very cool museum a few blocks away.
We look forward to staying at Kevin's house again! Thanks!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at the silo! We were only there for one night while we were traveling through the area to visit Dinosaur Monument. The set up was great! My older kids took the upstairs apartment and my husband, littles, and I took the downstairs. We did cook breakfast and had everything that we needed.

Highly recommend!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"After my daughter's cancer diagnosis, we try to get out and do little trips as a family. Her son is in a dinosaur phase and being that we are a large family it is difficult to find accommodations for us in places where our interests lie. Sarah's lovely place fits the bill perfectly. We had a lovely time and was able to rest peacefully in this unique B&B after a long day of dinosaur adventures."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The silo is a unique property that was a huge hit with my family. Conveniently close to Dinosaur Natl Monument and plenty of space inside. It had separate living spaces on the first and second floors that made it plenty of space for our 2 adults and 5 kids. It was much better than the 2 hotel rooms we usually need and the novelty of staying in a silo made it something to remember, a highlight of a road trip that included 5 western states over 9 days."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome and unique apartment in a retrofitted Silo.
Very comfy space and effective air conditioning. Close to Dinosaur Monument and 10 min from all the stores in Vernal.
Nice to have 2 separate spaces but if you have small kids note the upstairs and downstairs are connected by an external staircase only so you can't hear kids if in the separate living space given no internal connection.
Wasn't a problem for us because there were enough beds upstairs for us to all sleep there.
Would highly recommend!!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a wonderful place to stay on our family road trip across country. There was plenty of room for everyone and the kitchen was fully stocked with everything you would need to cook your own meals and even things you may have forgotten were provided. The host communicated real well and was very accommodating! We would stay here again if we find ourselves in the area!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a true family friendly stay! No hassle check in, plenty of space, kitchen utensils and laundry available and even some toys to play with after the car ride. We were so thankful to find this little gem of a place on short notice."

Every little nook and cranny has something to do or see. The host has stocked it well, games, an awesome large wood ark with animals, Barbie dolls with a large doll house, (that alone kept our grand kids entertained), paper service, information. The beds were nice, and everything was clean! The communication with our host was clear, prompt and polite. We just enjoyed our stay, had fun seeing the Dinosaurs and exploring what was around."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect for our little adventure.
The upper floor was fitted for the kids and they were so excited to have their own ""place"".
Downstairs was a nice little ""getaway"" for us parents. We were only there for bed and waking up but it was just perfect and such a fun little experiece.
If you're looking for something unique, one of a kind and close to attractions, this is it! So fun. Quiet little neighborhood."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This renovated silo was a great place to stay at a nice value and close to Dinosaur National Park! The host sent detailed instructions ahead of check in, which was a breeze. We really appreciated the upstairs for our teen to have a break from the close quarters of road tripping with parents. The listing was very clean. As non-Christian travelers, we were surprised to find Christian and Mormon art throughout and bibles by the bed that were not part of the listing pictures or description. The beds were comfortable and we appreciated having use of all of the amenities."
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,It’s very close to town and not far from Dinosaur national monument. The host also gives a binder of great restaurants and activities to do. From the outside it doesn’t seem like there’s much room but it is very spacious inside! Great place!

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at the silo for just one night, but would have enjoyed a much longer stay! It is really well set up inside with lots of room for a family to spread out - a great use of the space. The tap water is also super tasty, which is always a bonus. The surrounding neighborhood is incredibly quiet and peaceful - we enjoyed eating dinner outside at the table provided, while listening to the birds and far-off farm animal sounds, and watching the sun go down over the nearby fields (can you tell we are city people starved for the simple things?!). It was easy to go into Vernal for food, and close to Dinosaur National Monument, which was our destination the next morning. We would definitely stay there again!"

Sarah was great at communicating info before and after our stay and has great notes posted everywhere, so you have no questions while you are there. It had everything you could need for your stay and more. And we LOVED all of the decorations and character added to the place inside. There were only two of us and we utilized the kitchen downstairs and slept upstairs, but it would be so great for an extended family. There is plenty of room and extra sleeping space and blankets, etc. We will definitely stay again when we are in Vernal!"

We cooked dinner both nights that we stayed and the process was easy. There was plenty of disposable dinnerware, and most of the little Items you would need, like salt, pepper, oil, ketchup, mustard, etc. were right there!
The sleeping arrangements were awesome and comfortable. Do note that if you have younger children, the bunk bed upstairs is not going to work for them most likely as there are no safety rails and it is quite high. I expected this though due to pictures and brought tot cot beds for my little ones. Sarah has a pack n play, stroller, and child hiking carrier available though and the down stairs bathroom has a tub for bathing little ones. The children and dults all loved the novelty of staying in a converted silo, and there were toys, games, movies, books, etc. to entertain all.

Sarah has the place stocked with two large screens (one on each floor), DVDs, children's books, paper goods, plenty of towels etc... You will find everything you need.

Well situated by Flaming Gorge, Red Fleet State Park, and Dinosaur National Park/Monument. Far more sleeping options than would be assumed from the size of the unit. Most kitchen necessities available and cooking was easy enough with the provided equipment. We arrived slightly ahead of check-in but had perishable goods that we needed to get into a fridge, and Spencer was responsive and understanding of the request."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We made last minute plans to visit the Vernal Temple with our daughter before she leaves on a mission. Spencer’s Airbnb fulfilled all our needs and gave us an easy way to stay in Vernal without using a one-room motel, which never works well for sleeping in our family. We loved the recommendations for other things to do and ventured out to the main petroglyph panels at McConkie Ranch. They are not to be missed. We will definitely stay at this Vernal Adventure retreat again…a quiet, easy to access place. The interior has been tastefully remodeled and felt comfortable all around. We also look forward to exploring the Vernal area more. Thanks for creating this retreat!"

2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Place was nice on the inside. Updated house, paint, trim ect.. very clean. It is a single level duplex and one night I could not sleep due to some whirring machine being used next door. Unfortunately it was right next to the head of the master bed. Not the forced are furnace or a bathroom fan or anything like that. Loud and annoying. Knocked but the machine didn’t stop until after 11pm and I had traveled from Alaska and sleep early. Messaged host through app. Haven’t heard back yet. Probably not the hosts fault, upsetting when you can’t get to sleep. Otherwise I had spoken to him earlier that day and the place was nice. Only one night like that."

,,,"When we showed up at John's place, it was very dirty. The floors had good crumbs lying around all over the house, used bandaid in the bedroom, stains on the kitchen counter, muddy kitchen floor and soil in the bathtubs. I messaged him and let him know of the state of affairs and John's response was that he was willing to refund part of the cleaning fee. I didn't care about the refund but traveling with young children including an infant meant my wife and I decided to clean up the place a bit ourselves to get it to be habitable. While we were trying to do this, we found mice running around in the house. That was the final straw for us. I messaged John and asked him to call me right away but he messaged saying his kids were in bed so he couldn't talk then. So I had to work with Airbnb reps who cancelled the reservation for me after I sent them photographs of the place including some of the mice.
Ended up having to find a hotel room at 1 am by the time the whole ordeal was over."
