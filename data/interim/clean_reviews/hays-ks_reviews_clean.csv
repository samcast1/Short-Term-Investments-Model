It's also a nice neighborhood with plenty of parking, easily accessible for arriving to town from a couple of directions, and adjacent to some shops when we needed to run out for a couple of errands. Kristina was great to work with and flexible with our arrival."

(leg amputation). Only thing that could make it better is if it was located in the mountains. You can't go wrong here.❤️"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay very much. The layout was great for our family of six.

Thanks!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Kristina's place is better than the photos! Even though I didn't even chose the place based on the photos, I was just happy to find a place near family in Kansas to visit. It was a very cozy and comfortable and CLEAN feeling. I normally feel a little bit grossed out at Airbnbs or hotels. I normally want to rinse all the dishes off before I use them or not step on the bathroom floor and I didn't have any of those types of feelings at this Airbnb it was so spotless. We especially like the king size cozy bed and all the personal decorative touches. My dad and niece drove down from Plainville for dinner and then they came back in the morning for breakfast and the kitchen had everything that we needed to make food and coffee and the house would have been plenty big enough for them to spend the night if they had chosen to. It even had a little high chair for our 7-month-old. Our favorite part though was the beautiful fireplace"

Renting this home is well worth the extra cash rather than going to a hotel; this was an amazing place to unwind after our day of driving through on 70. Our son loved the home and backyard and it truly felt like an extension of our vacation rather than just a “stop” along the way. The towels and bedding were also so soft and, again, cozy!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"A sucker for some MCM (mid-century modern) accommodations, this overnight did the trick. Trying to figure out a good half-way point for driving through Kansas, Hays did not disappoint. Really like the, ""no cleaning fee"" strategy. We are always willing and usually strip beds and make it easy to turn over. Last place we rented charged $350 a night , $200 cleaning fee and provided a long list of chores. This was NOT that. Affordable, clean, easy check in. Anyway, really appreciate offering no cleaning fee if you just help out...no problemo!
Hays is a super cute town and we do not hesitate recommending this spot."

2024-01-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay was great. Super easy if you follow the directions on the door lock. I would have felt a little safer if the back door would have had a lock that didn't use a physical key, but that's just my preference being a woman traveling alone. The back yard was covered with snow but it looks like it's a nice place to sit when it's not freezing out. I wiped out and injured my knee on the back doorstep trying to kick the ice away so I could open the door to let my pet out, but other than that it was a good stay. Comfy beds, warm and homey. Great location!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We will check to see if this place is open every time we are in the area. Loved it. Thank you!

The location is walkable for restaurants, perfect for our dog, easy parking and we enjoyed exploring the neighborhood.
If I had a bigger group we would've tried their house next door which shared a cool back yard.

We very much appreciated a quiet evening with good food options close by and a good night's sleep while moving across the country.
Larissa was the perfect host, very responsive, helpful, and really made the guest experience 10/10"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The decor is very inspired and immediately makes the home feel warm and have character. The location is great! We were just a 10min drive to the museum. The home has a small but well thought out layout that worked great for our 2 kids and dog. everyone was very comfortable and happy in this home. There were some pill bugs that seemed to have migrated inside overnight but they kept to themselves and out of our way. HIGHLY recommend!

The neighborhood was great for walking the dogs before getting back on the road and was close to the downtown area. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stop to and from CO. Nice to have the amenities of home while traveling.

Otherwise, no complaints. We would recommend this place to anyone and would book again if needed in the future."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Just needed a place to stay for the night and Larissa’s place fit the bill! This was the first time I stayed at an Airbnb that transfers you to a different website to pay for pet fees. So just make sure you read the house rules. When you check out on Airbnb that is not your total cost if you are traveling with pets :)

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Mid mod on 6th was very cute, with lots of mid century charm! We only stayed one night but it was great to have a place with some room for our pups to hang out and for us to relax. Bed was very comfortable, shower had good pressure and we loved having fresh eggs for our breakfast! The front door was a little tricky to open while holding a dog leash and a coffee, I learned the hard way! But we would stay here again if we stop in Hays."

2022-12-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"As a MCM ranch owner, I always enjoy running into one of us in the wild. Very cute apartment in a convenient location. The bed is very firm, so if you're a side sleeper take heed. My husband and I both woke up with various numb body parts."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very unique house in what appears to be a budding downtown area of Hays. In walking distance of at least 3 trendy breweries/restaurants. House was extremely clean. Beds were comfortable. Strong shower/water pressure. Parking is on the street directly in front of main entry, which is convenient. We have 3 younger kids, so we were a nervous wreck that they were going to break one of the really cool vintage pieces of decor. Luckily, we were only there for the night! The kids did love the step back in time, and enjoyed going to sleep to the sound of 50's love music on the record player. FYI: For those looking to get donuts at the nearby Daylight Donuts, be advised that they only take cash?!? What?! Felt odd to leave an Airbnb (complete digital transaction) to a full cash establishment! Anyways, if you're looking to stay in Hays, STAY HERE. You won't regret it!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Larissa's little one level apartment was just like stepping back in time! We loved reminiscing about the 60's & 70's, as well as my husband dancing with his 91 year old mom to songs from the 50's playing on an original console phonograph! Super clean and comfortable, Larissa has thought of everything. The fresh eggs were wonderful to have for breakfast, so we had picked up some sausage and English muffins to have with them. She is wonderful to communicate with and check in was super easy. We loved every part of this walk down memory lane! We ate supper at Gella's which was very close and had wonderful food! If you are driving across Kansas, this is a super place to stay! It made our long trip to Colorado very enjoyable!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This short stay while waiting for our house to close was phenomenal. The space is very functional, inviting, and moments away from food and entertainment. Breweries, Water park, and downtown dining all within 5 minute walk. The space itself is so cool. The little touches make you feel like stepping into the by gone era. I cannot recommend this location enough. One of our most memorable airbnb stays."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Stylish mod-60s themed place complete with fully functional record player. Dig! Swing by this hip joint and rest easy overnight in the friendliest city we’ve ever stayed. This throwback themed spot was the perfect stop along the cross-country road trip our family took this summer.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cleanest Airbnb I’ve stayed in. The decor was great, comfortable beds, and easy check in.

We will stay again for next!"

2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Was the perfect place to stay for graduation!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was spotless! Perfect for our needs. We came from kcmo for a wedding in Wakeeney and needed a place to get ready. Unfortunately the check-in time was at the same time the wedding was to begin. The owner worked with us to get us in a bit earlier and that really saved the day! Plus a good amount of board games available after the wedding so we did family game night. Neighborhood was quiet & peaceful. The only thing I gave 4 stars to is curbside appeal & that's not important to me especially for such a short trip. Huge fenced in backyard as well, just didn't have time to enjoy it!"
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,"My family had a great stay for our road trip. The location was near stores, but the neighborhood itself was very peaceful. We enjoyed the comfortable interior. Would come back if in the area again."

2023-07-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Pictures show inside well, nicely remodeled but watch your head if you turn on the fan by the bunk bed. Outside has not been renovated yet. Inside temp was 80° when we arrived about dusk. 3 hours later it was only down to 78°. Internet was out, would not reset. Messaged host twice, an hour apart. No response for 3 hours, well after bed time. Response was AC was working properly and nothing could be done about Internet until the next day. Additionally remotes for some lights/fans had dead batteries. Kitchen sink quit working in the morning. It appeared to be battery controlled also so probably more dead batteries. I think it may have just been an unfortunate day for us but it was far from pleasant. Given a profile stating they run dozens of homes, we expected better."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is really great and Adam was wonderful. The inside of the home of clean and well organized. Plenty of places to sit, sleep, hang out. The beds are comfortable, kitchen is spacious and appliances are great, bathroom is a great size and has a cool ceiling Bluetooth system, back yard is huge. We had everything we needed and more. Adam answers quickly and was super friendly. This is kind of away from the “busy” parts of Hays so it was quiet. I will seek this place out any time I need a place to stay!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was the perfect place for us to stay when visiting family for Christmas, love the location too."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great communication
2022-12-01,3,Stayed with kids,"The place was newerly renovated inside, however its dating for lack of maintenance and deep cleaning. There’s a film across the baseboards and obviously hasn’t had a deep clean for a very long time. Renters do most of the cleaning before they leave. Or you will be charged an outrageous charge.
The kitchen/living area has damaged flooring that can cut and trip.
There’s was decent space to sleep, however the pull out couch had chip crumbs and advil gels caps down in it. It was pretty dirty in there."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Don’t let the exterior scare you. Interior was all remodeled nicely. Beds were comfortable with plenty of spare blankets. Heating worked wonderful during our cold stay. Good wifi and lots of open space. I’ve stayed at at least 5 other affordable Airbnbs in Hays and this one is my favorite.
2022-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Along with a small cleaning fee the guest will be expected to take trash to the bin in the back alley, wipe down counters and fridge if used, wash towels used and strip the bed. Not too much, but it is worth noting so you can plan your departure day accordingly. With a checkout time of 10a there is not much time in the morning to have breakfast, pack up and clean.
The neighborhood leading to this place is nothing fancy, just a basic tidy neighborhood. The exterior of this house reflects the neighborhood as it too needs a little TLC. The interior looks updated, the design is nice. There is a big crack on the kitchen floor, beware of bare feet getting scratched. The cleaning is lacking a little. Maybe I'm picky but it is clear this place needs a deeper clean than it has been getting. Communication with this host was easy. The responses came in a timely manner and were always clear to read. I would consider a revisit at a slightly lower rate or at minimum no cleaning fee."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Place was great for our overnight. Thanks yall.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I stopped here for the night on a holiday road trip, this was just what we needed - easy to find and access, house was just as described.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay with easy access to everywhere you would need to go in Hays. As stated in other reviews don’t let the outside of the house fool you because the inside is beautiful. Huge backyard is a bonus.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect stay! The inside was perfect and while people have mentioned the outside leaves something to be desired, it really has all anyone could need and more inside.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was the most well appointed home I’ve ever stayed in with Air BnB. Excellent amenities, brand new appliances, and a quiet neighborhood. I can’t wait to come back and stay here again as we visit our kid at FHSU."

2022-08-01,3,Stayed one night,"Beds were very comfortable so if you are just looking for a place to stay to sleep, this is good. The outside of the house needs a lot of work, driving up to it didn't give us good feelings. The inside is very nice though."

It felt like we were staying in a brand-new house. Plenty of beds for a large family. Very comfortable. Great location close to the highway but in a quiet neighborhood. There was also a great playground nearby for the children (Kiwanis Park). A short 4 min drive from the house. We’ll worth the drive."

2022-06-01,3,Stayed with kids,"The house had been remodeled on the inside and was very cute. There was a crack in the floor in the kitchen/hallway area that I did not notice and scratched my foot on. It was very clean. Super hot water which was excellent. The bunk bed was more like a futon mattress so my son said his back hurt. The ac was not working well at all. It was 69 degrees outside, ac set to 65 and it was 74 inside. With a ceiling fan and my fan I brought along with me I was still sweating while trying to sleep. Made for a very long day today so far. House is convenient to Walmart and fast food. Adam was responsive until I messaged letting him know we were checked out and the ac would never cool down the house. The house is small so it definitely should have cooled quickly."

2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay on the way home from Colorado. The house is on the outskirts of Hays in a quiet neighborhood. The exterior of the house is a little outdated but what's inside is very cool. It has a fully updated kitchen and a nicely renovated bathroom with three bedrooms. Out of the three bedrooms, two of them are good-size ones and have nice beds, lights, fans, and barn-door closets with extra blankets stored inside. The kid's bedroom is tighter but works for my two sons.
It's cozy enough for my sons to play Battleship while we are cooking dinner and for me to watch TV on the couch afterward while they are getting ready for bedtime. It is truly cheerful."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This house is perfect! we could not have asked for a better place to stay for our friends wedding. The hosts go above and beyond to make it feel like home. I will definitely be staying again the next time I'm in town.

My husband walked to Casey's every morning to get tasty breakfast treats! The host Adam is great. He is responsive and very nice. He was wonderful to deal with.

Negatives aren't deal breakers, -not enough trash receptacles, the fans were on the same remote, causing us to turn off and on each others lights. Some trash behind beds. Late check in and early check out is too early on both for price point. If you need lots of bedrooms it is great but details were lacking."

I have stayed at several AirBnB places and this one is a favorite. It is a fully furnished apartment in which one (or two) could be quite comfortable for an extended stay. The bed and linens were very comfy! The neighborhood is quiet and the homes all are well cared for.

We felt right at home and both commented we felt like we were having a sleepover at grandma's- it was just that delightful. Erin has added many thoughtful touches to make for a wonderful stay. The location must be close to train tracks, as I heard it pass by a couple of times in the night. My husband slept right through it, but next time I'll be sure to bring some earplugs. This darling airbnb is an excellent value for the money. Thank you Erin for a lovely stay!"

2023-12-01,4,Stayed one night,Ok for the price. We're getting a little old for stairs
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Visiting daughter who lives in Hayes. Very close to where she lived and to downtown area. Good restaurants and easy to get around. Mostly stayed inside with puzzles and games and eating at the apartment. Had the essentials for cooking. Very warm and cozy when it was very cold outside. Comfortable bed and a very large bathroom that was fully supplied for extra towels and extra essentials . Good hot shower and even bath salts for a soak. Will stay here again when in the area.
2023-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,"I was surprised upon walking into the apartment to find messy carpets and floors considering the rules stated that all guests should take their shoes off at the door. There was leftover popcorn and other food on the kitchen floor and inside the drawers.
We turned on the heat when we walked in - it had been set to 67, and after a few hours there wasn't much of a change in the temperature. After some back and forth Erin checked the pilot light and it was out. She told us to use the mini splits as a backup heat in case it went out again, which it did. The heat from the mini splits doesn't make it to the bathroom so that was freezing in the morning.
I was hoping for a better alternative to hotels in the area but I wasn't very impressed with the apartment, it was cold and a little rundown."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic short stay on our way from Arkansas to Colorado.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice place, good location."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfectly suitable, quiet, comfortable, clean accommodations for not much more than you'd pay for a dingy room in a Super 8. Had some trouble operating the coffee maker and Erin kindly and quickly helped sort it out. Would -- and probably will -- stay there again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great cozy place in a peaceful neighborhood! Very clean and well-stocked kitchen. I would stay here again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a great one night stay. The Casita is truly one of the best airbnbs I’ve ever stayed in. The decor is really cozy and unique and filled with thoughtful touches. Erin is a great host and would absolutely stay again next time I’m in town
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Always great to stay here. Clean, close to events, priced just right. Thank you again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had stayed at Erin's place once before and enjoyed it. This second time was just a good, or better! The Casita is roomy, comfy, and clean. Filtered water in the fridge, packs of oatmeal for breakfast, coffee available. We weren't missing anything and felt right at home."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Casita! We were close to family and the neighborhood was quiet. We had the added bonus of watching the squirrels play in the treetops each morning. Erin did a fantastic job ensuring our comfort!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our second stay at Erin’s, would stay again!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was easy to get to Erin’s place off of interstate 70. The place had everything that my wife and I needed, and we could’ve stayed there for a week."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I were in Hays for a weekend event and stayed 2 nights at “The Casita”. The location was great for downtown/FHSU campus activities yet was far enough from both to be quiet. The neighborhood was well maintained and safe. The Casita was well furnished and stocked with all the things a traveler needs. The bed was very comfortable as was the living room furniture. All the appliances worked flawlessly and the laundry was a very handy extra. The second floor arrangement was not a problem for us, but could be a challenge for travelers with mobility issues."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,An excellent place to stay off I-70 while traveling through the middle of the country. I felt very much at home. Excellent and spacious accommodations. I would definitely stay here again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything was exactly as described in the listing. Very clean and cozy! Erin is a great hostess.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Erin is lovely and as stated in other reviews very responsive and compassionate for the fact I was staying over as I was moving across country. She helped ensure my belongings would be safe so I didn’t have to worry.
The place is decorated with such unique flair and there are so many great touches. I also really appreciated the outfitted kitchen! The bed is super comfortable as is the tub!
The only suggestion I have is to add blackout curtains to the bedroom and a fan in the bedroom. The security light and light from neighbors cars shown through and woke me a couple times but otherwise was a great stay!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a nice place to stay
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Erin is truly a super host and her Airbnb is beautifully appointed, spacious, and spotless. Her many touches, both artistic and functional, are evident througout the space. She takes great care in anticipating all the needs of her guests and is an excellent communicator. The property is located in a nice residential neighborhood and is a convenient walk to the downtown of Hays. This is the second time we have stayed at this Airbnb and we enthusiastically recommend it to other travelers."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,Such a charming place! Many thoughtful touches and amenities made us feel at home. Very comfortable bed too!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a good stay. We enjoyed looking at the maps and quotes on the walls. Seemed like a nice quiet neighborhood.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome place! One thing we loved was luggage racks! We are often surprised how few homes we've stayed at had these. The space is incredibly clean and nice. Wish we could have stayed longer!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We were very pleased with our stay. The property was exactly as described. The bed was comfortable as was the living room furniture. We were in town for a quick visit to the university and especially enjoyed the location's close proximity to FHSU. Will definitely consider staying again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Erin's place was perfect for our overnight stay in Hays - great location on a quiet neighborhood street, yet close to the highway: spacious, cozy, tastefully decorated to make you feel at home, and thoughtfully stocked with toiletries and little things that a traveler might need. Would stay at The Casita again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"La Casita was as pictured and very well worth the price. Erin is a responsive hostess in communication and thoughtful in the amenities, ie. a first aid kit, a small sewing kit and some extra toiletries in the bathroom. The bed was comfortable. Hubby and I slept well. The well stocked kitchen offers coffee, tea, powdered creamers, sugar and non sugar packets, hot cocoa, instant oatmeal and popcorn. There were 2 ice trays so I could have ice in my cooler the next day. The space in La Casita is generous and the furnishings and wall decor are unique and thoughtful. I liked the stacked suitcase bedside table and the stacked trunks in the living room. Erin has put together a nice and easy to read notebook of house rules, how things work and check out procedures. Also, she left suggestions for dining out, including 2 discount cards from LA Casita for our use at the place of our choosing. I pickeout many items of interest about KS, off the brochure rack. We hope to come back. Thank you."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had a wonderful stay during a road trip. The host was really responsive, and the place was clean. Cute neighborhood and easy to find/follow directions. Everything matched the description and pictures. I’d definitely stay again on another road trip."

Clean home cozy. I loved it wanted to stay longer. Thank you for treating your quest so nice. I would love to stay longer."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The Casita was the perfect choice for my week-long stay in Hays. The apartment was cozy, quiet and well appointed. The keyless entry made entering and leaving so easy, which was very much appreciated.
The bed was super clean and comfortable, as was the living room furniture. Hooray! (There's nothing worse than booking a cute place only to discover it has a super stiff sofa or a saggy mattress!)
Erin also includes several thoughtful extras, like coffee, tea, spices, basic condiments, feminine products (yay!) and more so you have a few basics covered upon arrival.
The neighborhood is perfect for morning or evening strolls and is also conveniently close to downtown's shopping and dining options, as well as the town's smaller grocery store.
Highly recommend this place for your next trip!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautifully appointed casita for an overnight while on a road trip!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Accurate description of everything. It was nicely decorated and welcoming. Erin has a talent for it. The bed was the best. I had a long drive of 8 plus hours from Texas and didn't get in until 4am because of delays. I slept like a baby in the comfy bed that had amazing sheets. It was quiet and peaceful the whole time which I really really needed. Great variety of coffees and I loved the milk provided as I use milk in my coffee. I didn't have time to cook but there is everything you need and is labeled and easy to find. I would definitely book here again if I'm ever in town for a Larks baseball game. Thank you Erin !
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This is exactly what I needed for a night. Perfect place to crash! Had everything I might need and more. :) cozy and well decorated! Clean and organized. Host was kind and communicative. I recommend to all considering.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was the perfect place! I needed a spot to stay in as I traveled back home from Colorado. After a long day of driving, the Casita was a welcoming home away from home to really rest and unwind in a safe, peaceful, and clean place. I have saved this spot in my favorites and we will make this our usual stop on the way to and from CO in the future! Erin has thought of all the little extras and has decorated it so very well. I love the travel theme of the apartment, and I particularly loved the scriptures and quotes as you climb the one story staircase! LOVE IT!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Clean
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Erin’s place is a great value. The apartment is spacious, comfortable, and Erin provides instructions for everything along with friendly quotes, and funny comments. She responded quickly to questions, and was very helpful. We wish we could have stayed longer at her apartment. Note, there are about twelve steps to get to the apartment but there is a designated guest parking space in front of the house"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very spacious and clean. In a good area close to the downtown (try Gella's Diner and Brewery, it is great). Would love to stay for more than one night if I am ever in Hays again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely LOVED staying here! Erin is a phenomenal host and made the space feel like home. It was exactly what my partner and I needed after a long day of driving on our road trip. Genuinely the best AirBnb I’ve stayed at in a long while, I will definitely stay here again the next time I pass through Hays! Do yourself a favor and book here, you will not regret it."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home. Very well organized and comfortable.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Erin’s place is great! Just off I-70 so great for a rest stop. She obviously put in a lot of efforts in decorating the place coz there’re a bunch of cool signs. Complimentary breakfast items also made my life much easier. House manual is extremely clear we checked in at close to 12 am effortlessly. Would stay again if we drive by Hays again 🎉
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved the place. It was in our price range and quite larger than I imagined. Best communication of any place we’ve ever stayed. Thanks for the eggs! I was able to work remotely also. We’d be happy to return.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"After a few stays here, it’s starting to feel like my home away from home."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Erin’s place. It was simple and so comfortable. We loved the many windows for fresh air. The location was perfect for a walk to downtown or campus, and the homes nearby are full of old charm. Mostly, Erin went above and beyond to make us feel at home. The kitchen and bathroom were both so well stocked and there was so much attention to detail. We also found the bed super comfortable. Thank you for a terrific stay!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect place to stay
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Erin’s place is so great and I was very excited to stay there. Unfortunately, I had an unforeseen change in plans and was not able to keep my reservation.
But I was very impressed by Erin’s response, communication and patience. She sounds like a genuinely kind and wonderful person! I was very disappointed that I didn’t get to meet her.
I think her listing is very inviting and was perfect for what I was looking for.
I hope to have another chance to stay in Hays and will most definitely reserve her place again, if it’s available."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place to stay. Highly recommend.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute place and felt cozy!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay at Erin's and it was just as great as the first time. It's just really well thought out - every detail has been considered. And you know when you're traveling how it's the little things that make all the difference? She's Queen of the little things. Example: Two fresh eggs in the refrigerator. Who does that? Well, Queen does. :) She just makes it very easy to settle right in and get that small town, Kansas vibe going."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very clean. Host provides little things like toiletries if you forget something. The instruction manual is actually in the house in a notebook instead of on the app, so look for that if you have any questions."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our visit here! Was the perfect space for what we needed. Hays is a cute little community!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved the travel decor and quotes! Great place! I would definitely return if I have another solo trip to Hays!

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Casita was perfect for our stay! It was very central to all of our weekend, events, and the house was warm and inviting. The very well-stocked coffee bar kept us out of Starbucks all weekend! We have family in Hays, so we will be back to the Casita every time we visit."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was my second stay here, and it was just as great as the first. The Casita is clean, comfortable and convenient to I-70. I highly recommend and would definitely stay here again."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our short stay. All the extras was nice.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I hope there's enough space here to say how grateful we are to Erin for providing this wonderful garage apartment. It was our second time here and everything was perfect-- just like before. It was bitter, bitter cold here the first week and the place was nice and warm, bright, comfy, and a very nice kitchen. Erin went to the trouble to sweep a path in the snow all the way out to our parking spot. And just to make sure we were good and toasty, she dropped off a very nice radiator-style space heater for us to put in the bathroom.
The place is a hop and a half'a skip from FHSU campus where my Wife was attending her classes. It is right near Downtown and all its good restaurants. The neighborhood is gorgeous and nice and quiet. There is a Dillon's grocery store very nearby, and I even got to see a local Farmer I know, David Svaty, when he came to town.
Erin has spoiled us! I seriously can't see why we'd ever stay in a hotel ever again if we can find places like this to stay!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This immaculate spacious and private large apartment had everything needed for my stay. The full kitchen even had all the items I needed to cook meals. The host was wonderful !
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,I stayed here one night while driving across the country. I loved The Casita! It was very comfortable and had lots of extra little touches that made me feel right at home. The Casita is very convenient to I-70 and I enjoyed exploring the town of Hays. I will definitely come back.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay and the host was very proactive with communication. We'll be back.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent place Erin is a great host the house makes you feel at home.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful place to recharge for those who are doing a long, cross-country drive and want to stop in Kansas. The casita had everything I needed for a 2-night stay. It was located in a quiet neighborhood and was walkable to the downtown area (though it might be considered a long walk by some). It was also a short drive to other amenities and access to the highway. The host graciously accommodated my last minute request to stay and had the unit ready by the time I rolled in later that evening."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Erin was an incredible host and the stay was wonderful! Recommend for any stay in Hays, America!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I stayed at The Casita for a night to break up a long road trip and we couldn’t have asked for a better place!

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Erin's Casita was a wonderful retreat from a long road trip. It was very comfortable and included a bunch of great little amenities. There are cute helpful signs throughout the home to navigate the place.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a gem of a place. Erin doesn'tspare any details in making guests feel comfortable. It was nicely decorated, everything in the kitchen was labeled and the guest book had great instructions. If you are staying more than one night, there is plenty of tourist information as well. As long as being on the second floor is not a problem, this is a great place to stay. I definitely would again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great stay on way to Colorado! Second time here. Clean and well appointed.

She truly is a super host and we will not hesitate to stay at her Airbnb on future trips to the area."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Erin’s Casita has been built with so much care & attention to detail. We really enjoyed our stay!

The location two minutes from FHSU was key for us and allowed us to walk on several occasions .
We highly recommend The Casita and will gladly return on our next trip to Hays !!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Will definitely stay here again!! Very clean, cozy, and stocked with several thoughtful items (coffee, toothbrush, toothpaste, chocolates, etc.)"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Erin’s place is adorable! If you’re like us and have a hotel reservation that you can cancel, do that and stay here! I’m so glad we did. Erin’s attention to detail is nothing like we have experienced in other rentals. There is a coffee maker if you wanna make a pot of coffee, creamer, sugar and also a Keurig! The fridge had little packets of hot sauce and other sauces. The bed is very comfortable! That was especially important because we had come from a rental where the beds were not comfortable and to be able to get a good night’s rest the last leg of our trip was wonderful."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great space and location. Erin is a wonderful host and communicated very quickly to all of our questions. We will definitely be back and reccomend to all our friends.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Erin’s place is even more charming in person. She has thought of everything you need. The personal touches she has added make you feel right at home.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a brief but pleasant stay at the Casita. It's roomy, relaxing, and very well-organized and well-stocked. There are lots of homey and humorous touches. It's obvious that Erin has put much thought and care into this place. Highly recommended."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Spacious apartment in a quiet neighborhood. A home away from home. Will stay again next time.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Everything was just perfect-- the neighborhood, the place, the Hostess! This was our first experience after years of hotel stays, and wow, what a great experience. It was like we never left home!

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved Erin’s apartment and location. Very clean, homey, comfortable with thoughtful amenities. Wonderful location and could walk to the historic downtown area to eat at a delicious brewery. We will be revisiting the Casita again on our next trip from Alabama to Colorado. Very quiet at night and felt very safe in the residential neighborhood."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Super clean and had all the essentials. Very very cute place and felt very comfortable
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I think this unit is what the founders of AirBnB must have had in mind when they started the company. It was so well done, and really nothing overlooked. This was the best AirBnB night of sleep I've ever had. It provided everything for a good night sleep: cool, dark, quiet, and wonderful bedding. Even my husband, who is not easily impressed, looked around when we left and said, ""Wow. This is a really nice place!"" In short, Erin should be training everyone else how to do it."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We typically stay in hotels as we make regular trips from Colorado to Kentucky to visit family, but since adding a second child to the mix we thought that Airbnbs might make packing in and out easier, and perhaps save some strangers in abutting hotel rooms from having to hear the baby wake for feedings in the middle of the night.
It turns out that with a stay like the one we had at Christina's space we got so much more. We had a Pack n' Play waiting for us, Disney+ on the big screen to keep the older child occupied/distracted while we got loaded and unloaded, a much more comfortable bed than we would get at a hotel, and a full kitchen for healthier eating than a hotel breakfast."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Host was helpful with any question I had about our stay. Very neat little home that was described perfectly on the Airbnb app. Will stay here again if we have the chance!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Julisa's place was exactly as described. It's been recently updated and is decorated nicely. We stayed for one night but her place has everything one would need for a longer stay. Julisa also doesn't ration supplies like some other Airbnb's do. There was lots of TP, towels, cleaning supplies, etc available. It's located on the bricks and is within walking distance to the shops and restaurants in the area. There is a coffee shop right next door which is great but Julisa had specialty coffee for us in her place which was a nice surprise! We've stayed at several Airbnb's in Hays and thought Julisa's was the nicest of them all! Our student has another year of college in Hays so we'll definitely be back if it's available."

2023-08-01,3,Stayed over a week,"The place was clean and very comfortable. However, i was told that weekly cleaning came with my stay but i got 2 cleanings the entire 12 weeks i was there. Also it wouldve been nice for the cleaning lady to utilize the airbnb supply for the laundry instead of mine. Besides, the ac unit switching to heat or completely turning off in the middle of the night, the stay was comfortable"

The decor is so lovely and thoughtful and it's clear she cares about providing quality amenities to her guests (for example, even if you don't need to use one, look at the incredible bowls in the cabinet! gorgeous!). The parking was perfect and the location of the apartment was within walking distance of restaurants, coffee shops, and even a rooftop bar. I slept really well and didn't want to leave the next morning! One thing to note is that there was a church gathering- or something similar- that I could hear clearly coming from downstairs in the evening. Not sure if this is every night, but it didn't go late or disturb my sleep at all. I highly recommend staying at Julisa's place & I hope to go back sometime!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This air BNB was clean and accommodating for us as our wedding was also right downtown! We were so impressed with how “up to date” it was as well! We were close to The Fort too and any other downtown amenities!!

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a small but comfortable place just above the local coffee shop, smack in the middle of the ""city."" Like any in-town place, that's both good and bad. It was great being walking distance to everything, including a bike/walking path just two blocks south; I didn't need my car at all. But the bedroom is very bright at night from streetlights, easily fixable with some blackout curtains; in the meantime, bring eye shades. There was a bit of noise from the other apartments in the building, but overall this was the quietest college town I've visited. Solid place."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Really charming spot in the middle of downtown Hays. The place itself is very clean and comfortable. Close walking access to some great local places (try the brewery!) and just a great place to spend a night or two.

2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an adorable place to stay!! This cute little studio apartment is right in the middle of town, and there is so much to do that's in walking distance. We were able to walk to get coffee from a cute coffee shop downstairs, and walk to a fun brewery for dinner both nights we stayed. Julisa and April were SO accommodating from the very beginning.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We've stayed here many times. We love the decor, the large shower, and the homeyness. We find many airbnb's to be kind of dark with few lights, but this is very well lighted."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,10/10
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I stayed at their AirBnB on our trip back from the East Coast. And it was so nice to be able to spend time with each other in a homey environment after our long trip.
The first winter blizzard was starting as we were heading out; we had gotten a few recommendations from the locals on our way back into town because of the storm that was being forecasted.
The Hanss Guest House was a blessing in disguise. The beautiful exterior and interior, plus the friendly kind - faces we were greeted with, was exactly what we needed. This place is definitely worth checking out.
Maybe you’ll even find another perfect place to spend time with your significant other, to just relax and recharge things. Plus, there is a cute spot to be able to do laundry together and catch up on work.

Thank you Brad and Yvette for allowing us into your home and giving a safe and warm place while the storm passed through! We truly do appreciate everything.
-Taylor + Lexxie <3"

Yvette was a fabulous host and whenever I wrote to her with a question she answered quickly. It is very clean and as I said very homey and comfortable and her guest book had lots of information that was very helpful. The neighborhood is very nice and traveling by myself I felt very safe. I highly recommend.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,One of our favorites! Very clean and comfy!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,This Airbnb was perfect for our stay! We just had a quick overnight visit with our daughter who attends FHSU and this house was close to campus and walking distance to The Bricks shops! Really enjoyed our stay and will definitely plan to stay again!

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Yvette was so wonderful to work with.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great stay here, would definitely recommend to others!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were making a long trip by car across the State and decided early in the day to look for an airbnb location about half way through. Yvette's guest house was perfect for us. Not too far off of the highway and very easy to find, but also tucked away in a quiet, lovely neighborhood with easy access to a great breakfast place (Breathe Cafe) and a clean, quaint downtown. Hays does a great job of restoring and maintaining historical architecture, and we enjoyed walking around after breakfast. The guest house was larger than we expected, with a super comfortable bed and everything we needed to make a simple dinner and coffee the next morning, which we sipped on the quaint front porch. The interior was relatively new, spotless, and comfortable, and our hosts were friendly and accommodating. We will keep this place in mind for future trips into central/western Kansas and beyond!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Yvette’s place was perfect for my and my girlfriends to stay while we traveled back to the Midwest from Colorado. It was so clean and a beautiful private home. We’ll definitely be back!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My spouse and I have each been using Airbnb (& other private-lodging platforms) for a long time. We both came away feeling that our stay at Yvette's guest house was by far the most positive experience we've ever had.
The cupboards are fully stocked with any serveware, cookware, and small appliances you could conceivably need for a longer stay. The place is spotless enough to eat off the floor, but homey enough that you don't feel like you can relax and make it your temporary nest. The king-sized bed was a dream, and was outfitted with great linens and pillows (there were lots of backup sheets and blankets had we needed them).
It was the most immaculate home and easy stay I've ever encountered. I'm so appreciative of the serene and beautiful space she's created for travelers like us. I hope we get to visit again; I didn't realize how lovely Hays is and would love to explore more. This home is the perfect springboard for that. Lots of great tiny touches."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Guest House was absolutely adorable, impeccably clean and perfectly comfortable for our quick trip to Hays! The hosts were very friendly, too! We loved sitting on the pretty front porch to talk and drink our tea/coffee. :) Everything we needed was provided. We had 6 in our family stay and the kids enjoyed the fold out couches and air mattresses. The queen bed was very comfortable, too. There were some toys and games our kids liked, too. We would stay again. Thank you, Yvette! :)"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a perfect place for us to unwind and recharge ourselves! Quiet and peaceful neighborhood. Very clean and neat house with modern feel! Yvette was accommodating and stayed in touch with us. We’ll come back again another time to visit our alma mater FHSU!

It is stocked with about everything you can imagine a little rental would need. We really enjoyed the swing on the front porch. And you get to arrive on an appealing old brick road. We'd definitely stay here again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We fell in love with The Guest House beginning with the nicely lit private porch. The first room is immediately pleasing and comfortable. The kitchen is incredibly well equipped. Supplying laundry detergent in the laundry/powder room was a great touch. The bedroom was likewise comfortable and included luggage stands, a couch and a bathroom en suite. Both tvs were easy to operate. There was a reassuring abundance of extra blankets, towels and other items.
Yvette’s Guest House is located on a quiet, beautiful residential street and a short drive or easy walk to a lovely Main Street.
We are eager to return to The Guest Suite."

Yvette’s place is always spotlessly clean and super comfortable! Our oldest can conveniently sleep on the twin pull out in the master bedroom and our youngest in a pack n play in the laundry room or master closet. If you need a place in Hays, book here!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The space is clean and as pictured. Amenities offered are good as the house is stocked. The neighborhood feels safe and we slept well. I like that the lock code was custom to my stay. Although we did not have time, it was nice they offered an assortment of physical board games and retro console games. Despite paying a $30 cleaning fee, you will be expected to do your dishes, strip the bed and place used linens and towels in a collapsible hamper hanging in the bedroom closet."
