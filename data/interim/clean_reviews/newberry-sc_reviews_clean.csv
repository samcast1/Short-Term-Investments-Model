2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Stayed overnight to breakup a long trip. It was perfect for our small family of 3 - better than paying the same price or more for a hotel. Jane was very responsive to our questions.

Thank you
Cherry"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was great. We were in Newberry at the beginning of the week and many places were closed. I would enjoy going back on the weekend and explore the stores and restaurants.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Jane’s apartment was perfectly appointed and very accurately described. The apartment is surprisingly comfortable and spacious inside considering its actual size….my son loved the curved shower! The use of space in the kitchen is well designed and very functional.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for a private, cozy location in downtown Newberry, it doesn’t get any better.

Amenities are great, and several fun restaurants and shops are within a few steps of the place. Highly recommend!"

2023-10-01,3,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was as advertised. Very clean with comfortable beds and fluffy towels. The appliances were a little difficult to work. My husband had to read the manual to figure it out. The outside pool area was not as advertised. There are multiple animals roaming the property so it made is difficult to sit outside. If you are not an animal lover this is not the place for you. The host Mariana is friendly and we enjoyed the few times we chatted.

We are thrilled that this is available now. The host has created an unbelievable oasis & has paid great attention to every little detail. There is so much to say about how wonderful she is & the home. Our family greatly enjoyed the beautiful pool as well. Towel warmer is a wonderful luxury!Communication was excellent, she immediately responded. The pull out sofa received approval from our 19 yr old college student. The bed is insanely comfy, husband & I immediately fell asleep. I just can’t say enough, but this gem has everything!! The host is super sweet & truly cares. We asked if she possibly had an item we needed while we were enjoying the pool, within minutes she came outside & ran out to get it!! This is a host who goes above & beyond!! That was just one example! Don’t wait to book your reservation!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Highly recommend Marianna’s guest house!We loved staying! Very clean, comfortable and well organized. We loved having a pool to relax in. The kitchen had everything needed to prepare meals. There were lots of thoughtful touches, like bottles of water in the fridge for our use; pool towels available; toothpaste/toothbrushes available in case you forget them; first aid supplies; extra blankets and sheets and a bottle of wine if you like. Our children were very cozy on the couch sofa at night and loved seeing the chickens out back; as well as the 2 outdoor cats that reside there. It felt like home away from home!
And it’s in walking distance to all of downtown Newberry for restaurants, entertainment and such.
We look forward to staying again when back in town."

2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"The host was communicative prior to check in and check out. The home description and pictures accurately described the home and their amenities. We felt right at home and the home was recently renovated with nice upgrades; which made the stay even more pleasurable. The location was located approximately two minutes from Walmart and 15 minutes from our friends family lake house, so our drive was only about 15 minutes from the home. We will rent again when we go visit our friends family. Thank you for an enjoyable stay."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is by far one of the best Airbnb‘s I’ve experienced. I will not stay anywhere else when I return to Newberry to visit family. The pictures do it no justice. The bathrooms are amazing I could’ve stayed in the shower all day. She was a fantastic host, because I had a few workarounds with my job. She was very gracious and extremely responsive. It’s located right in the middle of everything you could actually walk to get something to eat. I am definitely not a fan of Newberry but this home made it great. Suggested restaurants I would say would be Figaro and The Palm. The next time I come back to visit family, if this spot is not available, I would seriously be heartbroken. She is sure to be a super host real soon."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Everything was as advertised plus additional amenities were supplied so that we did not have to bring anything extra from home. It was perfectly cleaned and ready for respite! Would definitely book again!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home lives up to its name. My father-in-law and his parents are originally from Newberry, so my husband took his Dad, brother, and aunt to visit their kin. We were so happy to find such a beautiful spot in Newberry. He could not stop raving about how beautiful this home is- -not only on the inside, but on the outside. An eye-catcher as soon as you pull up. They loved having their own bedrooms, and sufficient space. Beautiful and updated furnishings! The photos tell no lie. Once they arrived, their Newberry family came over to visit, and they even remarked how they witnessed the transformation of this home, and all the work put into it! My husband loved all the windows and natural light, as well as the back deck. Our host stocked it with everything needed to feel like your own home, and bonus- - it's literally 5 minutes away from all the eateries and Walmart. I wish I could keep it a secret for our next visit, but you must stay here."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was beautiful. Not too far from great food and only a short drive to lake murray. Would definitely book again

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I would take additional towels if planning to stay multiple days. I also think a mini fridge, coffee pot, and microwave would be beneficial.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just what we needed for a quick weekend trip! We like the simplicity of the Airbnb.. it was exactly as described in the listing. Thank you for being great hosts! We really enjoyed your she shed!
2024-04-01,2,Stayed a few nights,Super clean and private space but no kitchen. I like to cook when I’m out of town and I didn’t have have that option. And if I did decide to cook there was no place to clean up my mess. Just not for me.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place worked perfect for what I needed. Would highly recommend. Only one concern, internet was sketchy. Could use a better connection."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for our nephew’s graduation from Presbyterian College and this was the perfect location to stay! Very close walk to campus, basically across the street. The place was clean and very well stocked with dishes, crockpot, microwave, air fryer, etc if you wanted to cook. The pool area and backyard is beautiful and very peaceful. We had a busy weekend of graduation activities so we didn’t have time to enjoy the pool but enjoyed sitting poolside. Mr. Kitty is super cute and friendly! We enjoyed visiting outside with him. Lisa has the best book of food and activity recommendations we have ever seen and we’ve stayed in a lot of air bnbs. The towels were new, absorbent and soft and my husband said “these are nicer than our towels at home”! There were fresh flowers in each room and popcorn and instant oatmeal along with coffee and tea. I can’t think of anything she possibly could have done better! Clin’on: where the t is silent but oh so sweet. ❤️"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was a return visit for us because we were so happy with the accommodations in the past. We were not disappointed and will return again when visiting our son and family. It's very quiet and the back yard and pool very private. It is exactly as described and Lisa is so friendly, welcoming and helpful. She gets 5 stars from us :)"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa was a great host at her College View Cottage & Saltwater Pool location. We were coming down for a recruiting visit to PC for our daughter and we had plenty of flex time to check out the surroundings. Lisa provided us great check in instructions and things to do while we were in Clinton. The accommodations are exactly as they're described. Living area and bedrooms are very spacious and comforting...beds are very nice. The backyard surroundings with the pool, firepit and lounge chairs are a great feature. The fresh fruit was a great touch! We had time to visit the town of Laurens for a great dinner and went to Greenville for a half-day visit. Clinton is a small town who takes pride in their community and of course the PC Blue Hose! Can't wait to visit Lisa and her place again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa’s Airbnb is one of the nicest (if not THE nicest) at which I have stayed.

The shower has great water pressure and the bathroom amenities -including a flat iron-were nice. I was visiting my daughter, a student at PC, and loved that Lisa has a washer and dryer where I could help my daughter get laundry done without having to deal with the communal dorm washer. The house is conveniently located so close to PC which is perfect for my trip's purpose. Lisa reached out about our arrival time and made sure to leave a lighted walkway to the suite and inside lights for us since we arrived late night. The carport parking space is also very nice! Lisa is very friendly and loves hosting. She is so easy to communicate with and I look forward to my next stay!"

The pool was fabulous, and had chairs, floats, grills, nice tables, etc. The apt. was spacious, clean, and had all the amenities for what is described. You can tell Lisa is not new to this, and is always looking for the extra upgrades she can do. It is one of the many reasons to look for that Super host sign.

He went running in the mornings and felt safe in the quiet neighborhood. We did not hear anything while in the home-very quiet and calm vibes.

Lisa was so welcoming from the moment we set foot on the property. She met us at the carport and walked us over to the apartment, showed us how to get in and explained all the amenities inside. Absolutely nothing was lacking.
And the decor! Every room was beautifully themed and welcoming, as was the living area. The whole apartment is so nice and cozy, with plenty of things to keep people of all ages entertained. My 9 month old loved walking along the ottomans and was mesmerized by Lisa’s cat. He enjoyed her beautiful yard as well!

A little cool for swimming during our but we sat on the edge of the pool and put our feet in one night. There were also fire pit and grilling areas which we did not use.
Lisa made a point of greeting us and checking in via text as needed. She has created a welcoming home away from home for guests. Thank you Lisa!"

2022-08-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"You are staying in a basement under there house it’s a ok setup but the feet walking, and conversations You hear when they talking was a lil to much for me. No sink to wash dishes if u stay more then one day. Also they have a hymnic that you can lay in an as I was out there enjoying nature they started cutting grass. It’s not a great setup to me."

The unit is very clean, spacious, comfortable, welcoming, and well appointed with everything we needed. Lisa even thought of those items one might forget at home, which I really appreciated! As a coffee lover, I was happy that there was a Keurig as well as a traditional coffee pot. A girl likes choices!
Though we tried many the local eateries, it was nice to have the ability to cook/grill a quick meal in, had we chosen to do so. The lovely back yard and swimming pool was a much appreciated added bonus, that we enjoyed for daytime play and nighttime conversation and relaxation. It was so nice to enjoy living space, both indoors and outdoors.
This was my first Airbnb rental experience, and I couldn't have been more pleased with the whole experience. When in the Clinton area, Lisa's College View Cottage is a great place to stay and Lisa couldn't have been a better host!"

We had lots of room, comfortable beds, a beautiful yard with a firepit to lounge around on those crisp, cool evenings, and although it was too cool to enjoy her great saltwater pool, my granddaughter managed to lay out and catch a little sun on the warmest days of our visit!
Thank you, Lisa, for providing us with such a nice home-away-from-home experience and being an exemplary hostess! You know our plans are to return to College View Cottage anytime we head to South Carolina!
Sincerely,
David & Barbara Stevenson"

I like the Comfort Suites, but Lisa's Air B&B is less money and way bigger. Way bigger. At least 3 times bigger than a CS room, maybe 4x. And, it's appointed much nicer: A huge, comfortable couch in the living room, an entire dining area. Oh, my goodness. If you're visiting someone at PC, NHC, Woodbridge, or in Clinton for any reason, this is the place to stay."
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As this thirteen-day stay with Lisa was our first Airbnb experience, my husband and I cannot express how fortunate and thankful we were to have found the perfect place to spend these past two weeks while caring for a family member. The location was perfect for our need to be near Presbyterian College, our two bedroom-one bath was SPACIOUS, oh so comfortable, and very clean. Our host, Lisa, was the epitome of Southern hospitality (She cooked us our first Shrimp 'N Grits...Yum!) and treated us like dear family. When future travels take us back to South Carolina, we sincerely hope we can book our stays right here with Lisa and her adorable dog, Oreo!"

2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lisa has an amazingly clean and spacious airbnb. She is quick to respond and a very thoughtful hostess. If I could give her a 10/5 I would.

(In my case I commented to my husband that her house gave off the same feeling that my grandparents house did growing up!) :) Thanks again Lisa!

Super convenient location.
2019-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is my second stay with Lisa. My family and I were in town to attend a local event and based on our past experience, we knew that this would be a convenient and comfortable space for us while we were visiting. Lisa, as always, is quick to respond to questions or requests, and she is ever the cordial host. My 13yo daughter's highlight of the trip is getting a peek at Oreo (Lisa's dog) so she checked that box off for this trip as well. Highly recommended location if you are in the Clinton area or surrounding communities."
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed with Lisa for 6 days last week and had the best time!
Lisa is so kind and friendly.
The house is so pretty and cosy! We arrived late at night but the house was so welcoming! It was cosy and spotlessly clean.

We cannot recommend Lisa and her house enough and are already looking forward to planning our next trip!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first stay at Lisa's place. I was unfortunately in town while my mother was a patient at Hospice of Laurens County, but this was so convenient - located 1.2 miles from the hospice house - that I felt comfortable being here because it was so close to the facility. The apartment itself is comfortable and accommodating. There's a big couch if you want to watch TV, and a round table area for meals or getting some work done. WiFi works well, and the bathroom is spacious with plenty of hot water. The neighborhood is 1 block from Presbyterian College and is a great and safe location for a morning walk or run. Lisa is a gracious host - frequently checking to see if there is anything you need, and she even surprised us with chocolate croissants a few times during my stay that lasted 13 nights. For the last few days of my stay, my kids and wife joined me, and my 13yo decided that even though it was mid-October, it seemed like a good time to make use of the pool, so she took advantage of that amenity which seems like a rarity for most AirBNB spaces. I would not hesitate to stay with Lisa again the next time I am in the area and need a room!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent stay!
2019-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"As a Presbyterian College alum, this was the perfect spot to stay while visiting campus! Everything was perfect and Lisa is quite the cook!

2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The perfect location --- a block from PC --- in a cozy apartment all to oneself with an ever so kind and gracious host! I'm already looking forward to my next stay in this hidden gem...even though I have no idea when I will be back. :-)

The screened in porch overlooking the pond was a great bonus and can't wait to book again.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great few days of rest, relaxation and fishing! It was the perfect getaway not too far from home. The cabin is behind a working farm with a huge pond stocked with fish. We could hear the birds, cicadas, frogs, crickets and what sounded like a woodpecker. This was our 3rd trip and we're already looking at dates for our 4th! We'll definitely be repeat customers and appreciate the reasonable prices."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is our 10th stay at the cabin. We stayed the weekend for my wife's 40th birthday. The cabin is only an hour from where we stay so it's our go to when we want to relax. Thanks again Michael!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The cabin was amazing. We wish we could have stayed longer. We loved the stay and love to visit agin. The pictures and description do not do this place justice. So much better than expected..
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our family had a wonderful time.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Love staying here!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect for a week away! Lots of fish to catch, and amazing sunsets!"
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Private paradise Everything I wanted for my birthday
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and his friends stayed at Michael’s place to attend an event in town. The location was perfect. Very quiet. Beautiful piece of property! Most definitely recommend!
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very peaceful and relaxing place

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time with my wife and my dog. Such a beautiful and peaceful place. I will be back!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was our second time staying at the cabin. Peaceful location with beautiful views.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was our 4th stay at the cabin. Very relaxing and peaceful. My husband loves walking down the hill to fish. We will return.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a nice stay at this secluded cabin. Quiet and peaceful. Thanks!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cute, private, cozy cabin."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a lovely and restful place!
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is a nice-looking cabin, both exterior and interior. The location is very quiet and remote. If you are looking for a rustic remote stay and you have an SUV or truck then I would recommend this place."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,This is the perfect place to just sit and enjoy the sounds of nature and just enjoy the silence. It was perfect for our family gathering who came from different states. so private and so much beauty. Will recommend it to friends!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michael was very responsive and helpful from the start! His cabin was exactly what we needed for a little peaceful getaway. There is some road noise that can be heard from time to time in the distance, but the view at sunset over the little pond and the stars at night make you totally forget about anything else. We loved sitting on the porch swing and heard lots of birds, owls, and even some coyote one night. The cabin is very homey and the pictures don't really do it justice. Honestly, the cobwebs in some of the corners just added to the vibe. It felt like we were staying at a family member's home, especially with how accommodating he was. If you're a light sleeper the bed is squeaky from even little movements but there are other options like in the loft upstairs, the soft couch, or the super comfortable blue chair in the living room! If we ever find ourselves in SC again, we will definitely look into going back!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Always enjoy our times there and husband enjoys the lake so much. Love the privacy and country.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our fourth year at Michael's log cabin. My family loves the place, the kids say it is their home away from home. The new railings on the loft are beautiful. Lots of fishing, baseball/softball practice, roasting marshmallows, and cooking up a storm. This was the first time I had met Michael, who happened to be out on the farm. He is a wonderful host. Answers questions quickly, but allows us to just relax. Will will be back again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Michael is an excellent host! We had such an amazing getaway in this cozy cabin! We will definitely be booking again! Gorgeous views and private!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at this cabin! The photos do not do the place justice. It was a quiet, relaxing getaway tucked away privately with beautiful scenery. We enjoyed catching fish in the pond out back! Everything you need to cook is provided and plenty of towels and blankets as well. Grocery stores and restaurants were all 5 minutes down the road. Michael was a great host who always responded promptly with any questions or concerns we had during our stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Michael is a great a host. Cabin setting is beautiful, very peaceful sitting on the back deck in the evening."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Michael was a great host, he was very helpful and answered any questions I had very quickly. This cabin was exactly what we needed, it was very peaceful and relaxing. I plan on renting this cabin a lot, especially since my son goes to PC."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Quiet secluded area. Fishing was good dispite the extreme heat. My husband saw a large buck swimming across the pond. Great place for a family to relax and enjoy.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"awesome cabin - we loved how peaceful the location was. hopefully, we will be back in a few months when we have more time to enjoy the amenities of this cabin. thank you so much for sharing it with us."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a fantastic place for the price. This would be the second time my brother in law and I stayed here for a family time. We go to metal detect and get a peaceful weekend from responsibility. Michael is a great host. We will be back for sure.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,To say that the location was peaceful would not truly do it justice. Felt like we were in the middle of nowhere but only 5 minutes away from town. While drinking my morning coffee on the back porch I just couldn't help but think of the mention of the fully stocked pond that I was looking at. I finished my coffee and drove to the local hardware store for a cheapo rod and reel and some worms. 45 minutes later I was cleaning our dinner for that night...fish and grits with hush puppies. I could retire in a location like this without hesitation. Highly recommend
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The cabin was beautiful. It was secluded and peaceful.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Our stay at the cabin was wonderful! Beautiful location!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This cabin is well off the road, very peaceful and perfect. It is a cabin in the woods... and comes with woodsy stuff! The kitchen had everything we needed, the beds were good and it had sat TV! I have no complaints and really enjoyed the few days we had here!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful place…comfy cabin transports you back to a simpler time. Peaceful open field and back screen porch with large deck and path leading to pretty pond.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Michael was very accommodating. We loved the Cabin and would definitely go back.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A much needed break from adulting! The cabin was immaculate and had everything we needed for the weekend! Just needed to bring our groceries!
Close enough to stores and far enough to enjoy the quiet.
Will definitely stay again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect place to get away, peacefil, beautiful. Had everything needed."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was our third visit and looking forward to another! Love the cabin, it feels like home away home for us. It’s a great area to walk or hike and the horses make the driveway walk so much mote enjoyable Thanks Michael. See you soon!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful property dogs loved he pond
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The pictures of the cabin and its surroundings do not do justice to it’s rustic and natural beauty. Great place to enjoy nature and disconnect from distractions.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A wonderful serene and secluded cabin! Enjoyed mornings drinking coffee on the front porch, walking around the beautiful lake, and lounging on the spacious back deck.
Michael was a great host, and very communicative! I would love to return for another getaway"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Awesome Log Cabin getaway. (Yes, it's an actual log cabin). Michael (although we didn't get to meet him) was very responsive to my texts and told us if there's anything we need, just ask. The cabin itself was away from any city noises and was totally peaceful located by a large lake. Inside the cabin the living room was complete with large couch, chair, coffee table, tv/cd player and a huge fireplace (Yes, Michael had plenty of firewood available for us to use), several hunters trophies above the fireplace and an upstairs for additional guests. The kitchen was very clean and had all of the necessary cookware that we needed. It also had a full refrigerator complete with ice maker. The bedroom had that lazy country relaxed feeling with clean sheets. Plenty of closet space and a dresser for our use. The back area had a large screened in porch which would be great for summer months. We were looking for a place to ""get away"" for a few days and relax.........this was the place."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is one of my very favorite places to be! The cabin is perfect for a quiet get away from the chaos of life, and my pup absolutely loves all the space to run, and usually doesn't want to leave. Michael is very easy to communicate with and responsive, but you have a beautiful secluded setting to yourself with everything you need to unwind. Highly recommend and I will be back!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place plenty of room and quiet. Micheal was a fine host
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is our third time staying here. We absolutely love it! We keep coming back!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,The cabin was great! Private location with beautiful view of the pond. Short drive to grocery store and restaurants.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is beautiful inside and out! We live up by Lake Erie in Pennsylvania. We wished to spend Christmas with our daughter and son-in-law. The cabin was the prefect size. We had Christmas dinner there.
It is way back off the road, so we could let the dog run and stretch her legs and not worry about traffic. Michael respond to all our request. We hope to stay there every time we visit our family in South Carolina!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was our second time at the Cabin. It feels like our second home and we feel so comfortable in it. The fishing was great and walking the long driveway past the horses is a beautiful way to get some exercise each morning. Quiet and peaceful. Can’t wait to come back. Thanks Michael.
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,Great quiet spot!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Michael's cabin is a beautiful rustic cabin with great amenities, extremely private, extremely peaceful, beautiful pond in the back, awesome property nestled behind a beautiful farm with amazing horses, we will definitely go back, Michael is a great guy, love the cabin we felt right at home."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved this rustic cabin and would love to come again! It was just as described. Thank you!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We noticed that the cabin could use some small fixes here and there and may have a bit of a ladybug problem, but overall it was what we expected and we had a lovely time. It gave us a “glamping” feel and was great for the dogs. There was plenty of room right around the cabin for running! If we are in the area again for further activities we’d happily book here again!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"First, it’s a cabin on a pond and a good ways off the main road with trees surrounding you and the pond. It’s got a huge back deck… part is a screened porch and part is like a party deck. This place is great for families, small group retreats, hunters, fisherman, or just folks who enjoy nature. Michael was very accommodating and stayed in touch. He never was too much or too little. Honestly I could live here and I might have found what I want for a retirement home one day. If you’re looking for a 5 star resort go to a 5 star resort but if you want a relaxing and comforting place that feels like home but with the peace and quiet of a cabin by a pond surrounded by nature this is it. We will certainly be back."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful, secluded and lovely cabin which gave us a quiet, peaceful and perfect getaway weekend."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great communication, great location, great way to unplug!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were looking for a getaway close to home and this was perfect. From the moment we walked in,we felt at home. Everything we needed or would need was provided and town was just minutes away."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great cabin. Had everything we needed for a nice get away with the family.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was our 3rd visit. Each time the weather is perfect and the fish are biting. we look forward to the 4th time. Love our time there!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michael was one of the best hosts we’ve ever encountered. He rapidly took care of any problem or need in a friendly, respectful manner. The cabin is definitely rustic, not perfect or fancy, however, that’s exactly what my husband and I, plus our 2 fur-babies enjoyed. The surrounding area around the cabin is gorgeous and very quiet! The lake and ducks were a special addition. We look forward to going back again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,So peaceful and calming. Love the quietness . Log cabins have always interested me. Husband and son enjoyed fishing in the pond.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Second escape to the cabin, 2nd therapy session 😎✅😇... biking, fishing, sunning, and listening to the owls and rowdy coyotes!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely amazing. Micheal was very helpful. Check in and out was super easy. The cabin has everything you need and was the perfect spot for our vacation. So peaceful, no phone signal, no traffic, no lights, no sirens. It was perfect. I am already planning our next trip!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a beautiful, peaceful, perfect cabin; this is where you want to be. This is our second time staying here and will definitely not be our last.
The log cabin is so perfect with a front porch, screened in back porch and a huge deck overlooking a pond stocked with fish!
We so enjoy drinking coffee and swinging first thing in the morning while listening to the crickets. We are going to have to come back in cooler weather to enjoy the huge fireplace just waiting to warm up the cabin.
You cannot find a better host than Michael either. Our precious dog got sick while we were on our way to the cabin and he recommended the perfect Vet for us. We peppered him with questions and he would immediately answer them!! You can NOT have any better host! Thank you Michael for letting us borrow your cabin one more time. See you next year!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Had a wonderful stay great place to take a family! Beautiful private setting enough room for your pets to roam as they please the pond is also a great place to be. The screened in back porch is also very nice sit outside with no hassle of bugs the cabin was very clean and the owners very easy to work with simple check in check out highly recommend to anyone around wanting a nice quiet getaway
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, peaceful retreat. If you are looking for a spot to unplug this is your place."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If you love the outdoors, a peaceful, semi-rustic setting and fishing, Michael's cabin is a great place to stay! The cabin was clean, comfortable and Michael was very helpful in answering all our questions. Check in was very easy. We loved seeing the horses and the little colt running in the pasture and our dog loved having the freedom to roam and explore around the property. We plan on returning when the weather is cooler and we can enjoy the stone fireplace."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is the perfect getaway to recharge and enjoy the outdoors. The dogs enjoyed being able to go off-leash and the nearby hiking trails and waterfall were a treat. The process of checking in was easy and the cabin had absolutely everything needed for a relaxing and stress-free stay.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We were looking for an entire place that was secluded. And this was exactly that. I would highly recommend. We didn’t see anyone the entire time. We took hikes around the property with the dogs and hung out on the porch. Visited Musgrove Mill which was a great shaded hike and all of us got in the river to cool off. Fireflies at night and the smell of the forest brought back good old memories. We will be back!!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Excellent stay! The fish were biting better in the morning for us. We caught 2 brim and lost a bass because we got tangled up in a small tree. We got him out of the water and then broke the line. The large, back screened-in porch was our favorite hangout and the even larger back deck was super nice. All of the amenities of home with the exception of only 3 TV channels and no iron. But who irons there clothes and watches TV when there's fish to catch, right???
We will definitely be booking again, but not in July- too HOT!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Cozy cabin in a peaceful setting with everything we needed. We were traveling with dogs and they had a blast running and playing in the lake. Michael was an outstanding host. He took the time to answer all our questions about the cabin and the area. Would definitely recommend.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great value.
2022-05-01,4,Stayed over a week,"We enjoyed our stay at the cabin, very peaceful and quiet. The cabin has a beautiful deck that overlooks the pond and there is a swing bench on the enclosed porch which also overlooks the pond that I very much enjoyed. The long driveway is a great place to walk and seeing all the horses and their babies was most enjoyable. Great fishing at the pond, my grandson caught a 5 pound bass. We will definitely return."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cabin is perfect. This was our 2nd stay at Michaels cabin. Cabin is quiet and close to everything needed or fun to do. Highly recommended.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a very nice cabin! We loved our stay, and the dogs loved having the pond just out the back door to play in every day. Michael was great with communication, or any questions we had throughout our stay.
The whole area is very nice. On Day 2 of our trip, my car broke down. The local mechanic got us in the very next morning, and repaired by the end of the day. It was amazing, and everyone we met was extremely nice and helpful.
We will definitely return and stay here again!"
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,We had an awesome time. We felt so far away from everything even though we were only about 45 minutes to Greenville. Spent two days just relaxing and fishing.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our 2nd stay in Michael's cabin. We absolutely love staying there - it is always such a peaceful trip. Michael is a great host, communicates well and the cabin is absolutely perfect! Looking forward to next year!"

My 2 dogs really enjoy walking without their leach, my 11-month-old baby slept very well and was able to enjoy the weather and the environment. my husband prepared some delicious BBQ meats. I recommend this place 100%."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place is absolutely beautiful. We spent our Christmas here and we had a wonderful time. My family and I enjoyed every minute of our stay. Very secluded and peaceful. Our 11 year old son caught a 8 lb bass out of the pond! We had a great time and look forward to our next stay!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"In my professional environmental consulting business, we stay in Air-Bnb's all over the USA and we have not experienced ANY others that top this one located near Clinton, SC. The log cabin is located at the end of a nice gravel driveway and nestled within a picturesque 300-acre farm surrounded by pristine horse pastures and mixed pine and hardwood forest. The cabin had wonderful decks both front and back, and the back deck overlooks an approximate 2-acre fishing pond. This Air-Bnb features two very nice additional amenities that are extremely hard to find, a wonderful wood burning rock fireplace, and the freedom to have your family dog! I traveled here from Idaho just to go deer hunting for a week, but we were so impressed by the Air-Bnb and our great host, that my wife and I are already planning to return simply to enjoy the peaceful location and setting of this rare gemstone."

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great cozy cabin to get away with the family and pets!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This pictures do not do this Airbnb justice! This is a wonderful, relaxing place! The fish were biting, the sun was shining, the fireplace was burning. Lots of free, open space for kids and dogs to run"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is our go to spot for R&R. We have stayed several times and will be back many more.

We also enjoyed hiking at a state park 25 minutes away. I appreciated being able to also take my dogs--plenty of room for them to explore!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was so much nicer than the pictures looked. It’s very spacious with a beautiful screened in porch and large back deck. It rained almost the entire time we were there, but that wasn’t a problem at all. There is a grocery store right down the road and the kitchen was well equipped, I just brought a couple cast iron pans. Overall this was the perfect place for a lazy weekend with the dogs."

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is peaceful and not fancy, but it has what you need (unless you must have Wi-Fi - I was fine with just my cell phone). Water pressure good on the shower. There's a porch swing and a charcoal grill. I wasn't there to fish but it's nice to have water close by. There's a window unit upstairs so if you're sleeping up there, you might want to bring ear plugs (it didn't bother me). Nice place to chill out and unplug."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cabin is the perfect quiet get away. It is just you and fire flies at night! You can sit on the front porch in the morning and have your morning coffee or tea. Then in the afternoon sit on the back porch and read a book.
2021-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet and secluded sweet cabin on a beautiful farm. If you are looking to get away, unwind without much technology and relax this is a great place. The views of the land and lake are lovely! Loved sitting outside in the screened in porch with the wooden swing. Very peaceful and a great place to read or journal. Our dog felt at home and loved taking a walk to see the horses too!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place! Super cozy!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This cabin was such a blessing! Everything was so beautiful and peaceful and the owner was quick to respond to any questions. We were thrilled to find this gem & hope to return!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a storybook cabin to rent, this is it. Secluded and private but close to shopping. Very comfortable accommodations. You won’t be disappointed."
2021-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is great for getting away from everybody and everything and just chilling. My family and I got a few nibbles in the pond, grilled and just relaxed. I couldn't hear any road noise from the cabin. Just the crickets outside. Will definitely go back! Hopefully in the winter when I can make use of the fireplace."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is absolutely gorgeous! I would love to own it!! The setting is heavenly and ever so beautiful and peaceful. You can NOT get a better place to stay or a better host!
I understand why Michael is called a super host. He responds within minutes to every question, and the cabin is stocked with everything that you could ask for and more."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A hidden gem. Beautiful property. So peaceful, enjoyed by the whole family. Would 100% recommend."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved - loved - loved this place! It was exactly what we were looking for - secluded- quiet - lots of nature around. We could let our dogs off leash because it sits in the middle of a farm. Nice pond down the hill from the cabin - has an elevated deck and screened in porch - so lots of options for outdoor sitting. Very “cabin-y” decor - wood and rustic looking. Had everything you need to cook and the bed in the downstairs bedroom was comfortable enough. Only issues I would say is that the railing up to the loft is loose - could use some strengthening- but I didn’t think it was a hazard or anything. Also if you don’t like animal heads - there are 4 or 5 on the wall above fireplace - but that’s personal preference. Neither of these things were a damper on our weekend- we really loved it!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best place for R&R!!!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome hidden gem! Great for a peaceful get away!

2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Had another great time on our 2nd trip to the cabin. There is a huge pond and we wanted to take our almost 3 year old grandson fishing. He wasn't too impressed with the fish we caught so we spent most of our time riding the golf cart and looking at the beautiful horses that are there. The last night, we all sat on the porch looking at the lightning bugs and listening to a whipperwill. So relaxing! We will definitely be going back!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such an amazing spot! Did some fishing and couldn't of asked for a better spot to kick it with them fam, will definitely be back in the future!"

2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,2nd time we have stayed here and it was just as good as the first. Will definitely be back again.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for a stress free get away on a beautiful piece of land and get away from all the noise that life can bring, this is the spot. Our dogs loved the freedom and we would definitely book again with Michael!"

2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location and kids loved the pond.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is amazing. The pictures don't do it justice. It was more than enough room for me and 3 kids plus a dog. We stayed around the pond most of the time. The store is just a few miles away so if you forgot something. I plan on coming back.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We booked for an Easter get away with our daughter that attends nearby Newberry College. Absolutely beautiful scenery and cabin was comfortable and cozy! Plenty of space for our dogs to run and enjoy. Michael was helpful with suggesting close places to hike! We will definitely be back!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This cabin is everything you need to detach from the world! Shopping is still super close and a small downtown area will fit all your basic needs. The grounds are picture perfect and the lake and cabin give you all the tranquility in the world! Michael is great, he checked with us via text a couple times to make sure we had everything we needed or if we were low on supplies. This place is truly magnificent and we hope to come back again!!"

2021-01-01,5,Group trip,"This cabin was more than I expected, I can't stress enough that the pictures do not do this place justice! It is tucked back into privacy with a ton of land to roam (especially good for my dogs), and the pond in the back if you like to fish. It was an absolutely perfect getaway from the rest of the world. We are planning on coming back because it's impossible to get enough of this place:)"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I had a wonderful time relaxing and unwinding. It was very peaceful and quiet. We enjoyed walking around the property enjoying the pond and the horses. We will be going back when it's warmer to do some fishing.
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place to bring in the new year! Michael’s cabin is located off a private drive of the farm that offered plenty of room for our dogs to explore and run around. Inside there is a large screened in porch as well as a massive deck area with a charcoal grill and bench seating that overlooks the spectacular lake. The kitchen is well stocked with dishes and cookware and the family room is kept cozy with comfortable furniture, throw blankets and a wood burning fireplace. There is a DVD player with a small selection of DVDs and games/puzzles/cards. There is a walking path that winds around the lake and throughout the property for you to get some fresh air. If you are looking for a chill place to relax and unwind this is your place. My friend and our 2 dogs stayed 3 nights and are already planning our next stay back. Thank you Michael for a lovely stay!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"First of all I want to thank Mr. Michael for all his help and for being so nice! The cabin is beautiful !!! In many years I have not been able to sleep with such peace as the one you feel there! The cabin is equipped with everything! On the porch you can see spectacular sunsets and the view of the pond is filling you with new energy! , The kitchen has everything to prepare your food! The cabin is adorned with ancient objects! I definitely recommend it 100% and we are already planning to stay longer next year! Thanks Michael for sharing your beautiful cabin and giving us a little of that peace that can be breathed in that place! my husband, my dogs and I already miss being in this wonderful place, we fell in love! my dogs enjoyed the most because they can run freely. My people to describe and that they can understand how it feels to be in this place is to be in heaven !!! Mr. Michael see you next year!"

On the ride home, my kids said it was a nice place and they would definitely stay there again. I would too!"

2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you’re looking for peace and seclusion, you’ve come to the right listing. The cabin is comfortable and functional. The patio and porch are one of the highlights of the property. The cabin has everything you need to get away from the hustle and bustle. The property feels safe and secure. Somehow you walk in and it instantly feels like home. Don’t miss this special place."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was looking for a quiet place to rest and rejuvenate from our busy, crazy, COVID-filled world and Michael's cabin was just what I was looking for. The sunset's over the pond were beautiful! When in the area, I will definitely stay here again!"

2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our stay at Michael's place was very relaxing. There's plenty of space to wander and explore the landscape. Fishing in the pond was fun too! It's a nice place to reconnect with nature. Michael is an A+++ Host!!!
2020-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,This cabin was EXACTLY what we needed and Michael was quick and easy to communicate with. Great fishing. Awesome & sizable screened in porch.

2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Michael was an amazing host. The home was very clean and only had time to see about 10 of the 300 acres. I will recommend to all friends and look forward to staying again.

2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You’ll find beautiful views and everything you need to make yourself comfortable from: fireplace to grill to porch swing and a fishing rod with lure. What a neat place to stay! We’d certainly recommend it.
2020-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,The cabin overlooking the large pond was a fabulous place for us. Our dogs loved running free in the fields and trails. Our son loves to fish so he loved the pond. We will definitely be back.
2020-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a great cabin in a private setting and private lake. Dog and kid friendly. Definitely would go back. Perfect for a family. Exceeded my expectations for a cabin.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was amazing
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for a weekend fishing trip & it was great. Excellent location, landing across the street & good food across the bridge."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Stay was amazing. The only reason the cleanliness wasn't 5 stars is because apparently there was a communication snafu with the cleaners and they hadn't been there after the last guest. Carlos was very apologetic, and very responsive in getting them to come & clean. I'm sure that won't happen again.
The lake was so peaceful, and the screen room was absolutely perfect! So comfy, and nice to be lakeside without worrying about bugs. The home was comfy, and the sheets were amazing - so soft they felt like silk! Wi-Fi worked perfectly.
Granddaughter visited and really enjoyed swimming, fishing and the kayak."

Carlos is a great hose and very friendly. He responded very quickly to my emails."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We really enjoyed our stay here it’s such a perfect getaway. Carlos was great at communicating with us and we will be back to stay here again !
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for tournament fisherman! We put two trucks and trailers in the driveway with plenty of places to plug them in. 2 ramps within 15 minutes
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Nice little weekend spot on the lake. Came to visit our daughter and son-in-law before 1st Grandson comes next month.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Carlos was very responsive, helpful, and kind. He was very detailed about instructions and answered any questions we had. I rented Carlos’s place out for a birthday trip and it was peaceful, relaxing, and a beautiful view of the lake. The place was aesthetically pleasing and everything was clean. I definitely recommend this place and will be coming back!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We really enjoyed our stay. We were in town for a wedding and loved staying at a place so peaceful and pretty. We liked it so much we look forward to coming back sometime just for fun!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was great!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Peaceful, beautiful, cozy, lake front home. My family stayed here to hike part of the peak to prosperity passage of the palmetto trail. Sunset jewel had everything we needed for a quick, weekend getaway in a tranquil location, but close to restaurants. The digital lock was great to get in and out....the easiest I've experienced with air bnb rentals. My son took out the kayak and my other son enjoyed watching him from the floating dock. The home was spotless and felt like home for our weekend away. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great visit! Everything was just as pictured. Beautiful surroundings and everything that was needed was there. Definitely would recommend and will go back if we are ever in the area.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, peaceful getaway. VERY clean, and loved the lake view!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful time! The house was perfect with such beautiful views! LOVED the screen porch! The grandkids caught lots of fish off the dock. Great location. Exactly what we were looking for 😊

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful little house, perfect for small family or 3 adults. Absolutely loved the screened in porch. Fell asleep Saturday night out there listening to nature. It was relaxing. Very close to public ramp if you have a boat to put in as well. Wonderful stay. Thank you!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If you are looking to relax and unwind look no further! This is definitely off the beaten path in a great little cove that is quiet. There is a public boat launch one road over if you want to bring your own and then dock at the private dock at the home. The outdoor screened living space was my favorite place to be for our visit, if we weren't fishing that's where I was. There are a couple of restaurants one mile down on Marina Cove if you don't feel like cooking. I love what was done with this property and we plan to return in the spring again. Both Carlos and Elise responded to my messages almost immediately with a couple of questions I had, excellent hosts. Thank you!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The property was lovely, just as described and shown in pictures. The screen room right next to the dock was the best, even in 96 degree temps there was a little breeze off the water made even more comfortable by the ceiling fans. Watched a family of deer come for a morning drink across the water every morning."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our 4-night stay was fantastic! The house was just as the pictures on the listing, and everything was clean.
We enjoyed fishing, kayaking, paddleboarding, and swimming during our stay. The view from the house's sliding glass door is fantastic, and you have a clear view of the water from the house. Our dogs loved that they could get to the lake from the shore. Public boat access is also within walking distance of the place, which was a perfect distance to walk our dogs. We only left the house once to run to the grocery store, a 15-minute drive, but even the drive was beautiful. If not sooner, we will return next year as we are considering renting again this fall."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Amazing place to stay! Very clean, awesome lake view, perfect size for my family & graham our Shih Tzu . Carlos was very responsive to answering my questions. We will definitely be back!!! The screened in area was perfect"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Good place to stay
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our stay at Carlos's place! It's exactly as pictured and located in a quieter estuary a short distance off the main lake and gets nice morning and afternoon sun.
We rented a center console motor boat from Lake Murray Boat Rentals 10 minutes across the lake and had a great time while using Googl Maps to cruise around the lake and it was easy to dock it at his pier. His rental also comes with a kayak and equipment that we didn’t use, but it was nice to have available.
Carlos was very responsive, friendly, and helpful, and we highly recommend renting from him! 😊"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We really enjoyed our stay! The house was clean and exactly as pictured. The lake is beautiful and we loved the screened in deck. Would definitely come back!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great little cabin right on the water! Perfect for 2-4 people and dog friendly which was great. Spotless and well thought of rental, everything you need was provided and Carlos was a great host quick to respond. Will return when in the area."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Clean, comfy and cozy!
This vacation rental was the perfect place to relax with family. We especially enjoyed the huge lakefront screened-in porch.
We rented a pontoon boat for the day and it was delivered directly the pier…making it so easy for us to explore beautiful Lake Murray.
Thank you for sharing your home with us Carlos!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Peaceful and very relaxing. Felt right at home at the lake!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay will be back
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Beautiful little house with amazing views and a fabulous screened in porch. Would absolutely stay again!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"my husband and i stayed here for our honeymoon, we had looked long and hard for a place to stay on Lake Murray and we’re so glad we found this place. it’s been the best airbnb both of us have stayed at. amazing price for right on the lake, so many places to enjoy the view of the lake. The nature around is just breathtaking between all of he ospreys, eagles, turtles and more. it’s very peaceful and with lots of amenities! we would absolutely come back if we ever get the chance and highly recommend this place to anyone!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at Sunset Jewel was the getaway I needed! The host was communicative and thorough ensuring I’d have everything I needed for my stay. The home is beautifully decorated and was clean upon arrival. The clear labels on light switches and remotes made it easy to find my way around and make myself at home. The screened enclosure just off the water was my favorite! It’s so relaxing and comfortable. It was also a great place for my 13 year old chihuahua, who has become sensitive to the sun, a perfect way to enjoy the outdoor serenity while staying cool. The added floating dock was really nice for fishing. I didn’t get a chance to check out the kayak or the fire pit; there was just so much to do, and I didn’t have enough time to do it! Next time I’ll book a longer stay!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,It was perfect for what we needed.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I agree that Carlos is definitely a super host! He has thought of everything with this Airbnb and I think we’ve helped secure even more visitors because of how well done this lake house is! We’ve enjoyed the peace and quiet, privacy, fishing, and appreciate that we were able to accommodate our dogs as well. (Not an easy task!) We definitely plan on booking again this summer when it’s warm and we can put our boat in!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We love it! It's like a cute little cottage but the best thing about it for us was the screened in porch on the water. It's almost like another little cottage. We stayed out there all day and night. So peaceful. We will be back and I think all of my friends and family are going to be renting after seeing all our pics lol.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Sonia's place was perfect for our visit to Newberry. The beds were super comfortable and the backyard and patio were serene and peaceful. The home was also well stocked with anything we could have needed. We would absolutely stay again!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Again I enjoyed my stay at Sonia’s!! Great location, easy check in, comfy beds, wonderful back patio and yard!!
Excellent host, great communication, and VERY accommodating!!
I booked a last minute trip and Sonia responded to my reservation request immediately!!! THANK YOU, much appreciated!!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Our stay was delightful, the home is located in a nice location. Hosts were wonderful!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Relaxing, cozy, quiet place to stay!!! I stayed a week at Sonia’s house and would definitely book again! The porch was wonderful, loved listening to the birds every morning while enjoying my coffee!! The neighborhood was very quiet, great location if you are visiting Newberry college! I was able to work remote while there, the WiFi worked great!! Beds are comfy and we enjoyed doing the puzzle Sonia left for us! Sonia was so friendly and was great with correspondence. Thank you for sharing your home with us, we enjoyed our stay🤗"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sonia is a wonderful host - truly cares that we were comfortable and had everything we needed. The backyard patio is a beautiful little space to listen to the birds, relax, and do plenty of reading. I would most definitely stay here again!!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great! The home was very cozy. The host went above and beyond to make the home comfortable.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Sonia was an excellent host; she made sure I had everything I needed for my 30 day stay and communicated regularly. The free housekeeping was appreciated, as well. Would book this home again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Again Laura was a great host. I really enjoy staying at this air bnb. Very homey and relaxing environment. Laura is very good at communicating and response times are good. Would definitely recommend staying here when in the area. Very happy with my stay again. Thank you so much Laura!!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful place. The vineyard is AMAZING! Walking our dog was great. Laura is great. Definitely will be back again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,These owners were so nice. The cabin was so nice and clean. We will tell everyone we know to stay here since we loved it.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Just got home to Ontario, Canada after a 6-day stay at the cabin. I wish I never had to leave! The place was amazing from the start to finish & I can’t recommend it enough. Thank you Laura & Richard for your perfect little spot and wonderful hospitality!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was a perfect fit for my stay. Enjoyed every minute there and Laura was a great host and very prompt with responses to any questions I had. Would definitely recommend this cabin to stay at and the great hosts that run it.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay here was amazing!!! My boyfriend and I were looking for a quiet night away and this cabin was perfect! Beautiful surroundings! Quiet and peaceful. Also had the option of karaoke but we opted out. CLEAN! Very keep and beautifully decorated cabin. Had everything we needed and plenty we didn’t need. Full kitchen and beautiful bathroom with towel warmer. Can’t say enough of this! We are already planning our next stay!
Almost forgot to mention the WINE! Neither of us are big drinkers but the wine she left for us was amazing! We drank the WHOLE BOTTLE! She also offered wine tastings during business hours!
You will not be disappointed! Can’t wait to go back"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Wonderful place with wonderful hosts! They catered to a calm check in for my reactive dog which made it much smoother getting her comfortable with the new environment. The grounds were great for training and conditioning her - and the hosts two dogs were very mature and well behaved and helped me get my dog more comfortable being calm around other dogs.
Waking up every morning to the sunrise over the vineyard was great.
Great chalet - all amenities you would need. comfortable and great for 1 or 2 people for long or short stays. Several small towns nearby for shopping, groceries and wandering. Lots of open spaces and nature too.
Oh and it's on a vineyard with plenty of wine!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Nestled at the lovely, country hillside of the Enoree River Winery, this private, hand-crafted cabin has amenities galore! It was built for comfort and convenience with attention to detail in mind. Laura tastefully decorated to design a bright, warm, cozy atmosphere. Laura is a visionary to create a most relaxing retreat; so, this Airbnb became nothing short of an exceptional place to stay. Some of our favorite perks were the screened porch, accessible ramp, towel warmer; and, the list goes on. Most of all, it is pet friendly and close to town. Laura is attentive and graciously helpful in every way. Thanks indeed. Joshua 24:15"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"There were 5 adults and one child under 5 and we had more than enough room. Being able to fish from the back yard and private dock was one of the main reasons that we booked.
After being denied a booking from a different host, Evolve accepted our last minute rental even though I'm new to AirBnB. There weren't any reviews on this property and I was afraid to book. I'm glad that I did!
The wind blew away an item and Alicia (local contact) told me not to worry about replacing it. She was very quick in responding ( only had to contact her for the key code and about the item as the place was perfect). We are already looking at our calendar to book another trip."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This stay was beautiful! Exact picturing and descriptions, Amy was very supportive through the whole stay! Definitely a great spot to relax for the weekend and adding as a personal favorite."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Amy really helped us out in a pinch. She responded quickly and the place was awesome. If you’re taking a bass boat to Lake Murray it’s the ideal spot with plenty of space and you don’t have to worry about you boat in a hotel parking lot. Highly recommend
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amy and Doc are great hosts! Very responsive and flexible. I changed my reservation at least 3 times. I ended up checking in a day earlier and stayed 2 additional days. The unit I was in has an awesome audio/visual system. They have clear instructions for operating and interfacing with the system.
I was there to attend a wedding and had family staying at different locations around the lake and they all complained about how bad the mosquitoes were. I hardly saw any and spent several evenings on the front porch. The entire property was well maintained and cared for.
I would definitely stay here again if I'm in the area. Highly recommend."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"WOW! A lot of thought went into the many beautiful details in this studio. Great colors (red is my favorite), nice big TV and a sound system. The bed was super comfy and we loved the sheets. No problem with parking either. Plenty of space. We were welcomed with a lovely note from Amy. This is definitely a new favorite of ours."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,One of the best Airbnb’s I have stayed at and friendly hosts
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I've stayed at dozens of ABnB's over the years and this was among the top of the list in terms of value, cleanliness and ease of access. The space had some unique flair, but more importantly had everything you'd need for a comfortable stay."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Doc and Amy’s place is absolutely perfect! Private location 20 minutes from Dreher Island State Park, minutes from several great restaurants and would stay again there in a heartbeat!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful home in close proximity to downtown Newberry. We had a great stay!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed the place and our time there. Would certainly come back.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful old home. In love the old pine floors. Maintained well and rightfully renovated/updated.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"My group and I had a very positive experience with our stay at Joan's place. The home has a ""historic"" feel to it and Joan has gone above and beyond to decorate it in a most appealing way.
She was very responsive to questions and got back to us quickly. It is a charming place and we would welcome the opportunity to stay there again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,What an amazing place. Need 6 stars for this one. Highly recommend!
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"It was our second time there which should mean something to other quests. Location is perfect for walking everywhere. Check in smooth and easy. Large spaces and plenty of room to relax, eat, sleep and the house had everything needed. Southern charm at its best."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Cool place
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic home! It was the perfect place for our family to stay for our daughter’s graduation from Newberry College.
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"What a fantastic and amazing place to stay in and lots of history to that house and lots of room
Will definitely be back when I'm up in that area"
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Amazing experience!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,another great stay!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a treasure! We are lucky to say this was our second time staying at Joan’s beautiful home in Newberry and hoping it will not be our last time! Not only is her home gorgeous but it has everything you need while being in a great location. We had a family emergency during our stay and Joan was so kind helping us with whatever we needed! Very grateful for her hospitality! Thanks so much Joan!!!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,My friends and I stayed at Joan’s place to see a show at the Newberry Opera House. None of us had ever been to Newberry and we had a great time. The house is an easy walk to downtown and the opera house. Will definitely recommend Joan’s place to friends
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great value stay. This place was like a movie set. What a great experience and stay in historic Newberry
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I highly recommend this house. It’s charming and located in a great location. It has everything you need and plenty of space.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place. Great host. Love Newberry. Will be back for sure.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Joan’s place is amazing! The front porch was perfect for enjoying the evening, while watching fireflies. The pictures don’t do the house justice. It is beautiful and has so many interesting pieces of furniture and art that you find yourself wandering from room to room. The location makes it easy to walk to Main Street where there are great restaurants and bars."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Very impressed. Highly recommend!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Bautiful home. Beautiful town.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Joan was an excellent host. Loved the charming house.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a perfect place to stay while we were in town for a wedding. We didn’t have any time to go out in town, and the house provided plenty of entertainment in the meantime! My toddler loved looking at all of the decor and finding pictures of animals in each room :) The house itself is very big and roomy, and all of the bedrooms very comfortable! We weren’t able to enjoy the yard due to weather but it looked like a great place to be able to relax in your downtime."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time staying at the Inspiration House, we’ll definitely be back!!!
Thank you for sharing your home with us!!"
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,Joan was exceptionally easy to work with and quickly responded to any question. Joan has many beautiful items in her home - a bit overwhelming for me in that sometimes searching for space in the bedrooms to put my own traveling items. Found the downtown area to be somewhat depressed; restaurants not really open Tuesday/Wednesday nights but this could change come May/summer and perhaps more events scheduled on Newberry green.
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"To me location is key on AirBNB getaways. To see Newberry this is the perfect location. Literally one block off Main Street and a 5-10 minute walk to the Opera House. We never moved our car, and we had a couple in their 80's with us and we all enjoyed the walks. Try the steak at Figaro's restaurant. one of the best ever.
House is big, we had 6 people and were comfortable."
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"great place, beautiful and plenty of room - we will definitely stay there again!"
2023-03-01,4,Group trip,"Unfortunately, we were visiting Newberry for a funeral. Joan was great about letting us check in whenever we arrived in town and extended the checkout time. I know she wouldn't always be able to do that, but she made a point of blocking the next night to provide us late checkout. Joan was prompt to answer when I had questions.
The home was beautiful but keep in mind that this is an old home and that may mean a few inconveniences. For example, most of the electrical plugs outside of the kitchen are near the floor, so if the cord on your hair dryer or curling iron isn't long, you may have to slouch while styling your hair!
While I obviously didn't sleep in all the beds, it seemed that they all had mattress toppers. That made them a little too soft for me, but that's only a personal preference"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"I can't begin to express how great this place is! Everything you need is provided. The kitchen is well stocked with supplies. The seating from the kitchen to the front porch and everything in between was plentiful and comfortable. Speaking of comfort, the beds were very good quality. The shower had good water pressure and I was grateful to find a hair drier in the cabinet because I had forgotten mine. The back yard was very sweet, especially the lights in evening. It was a perfect setting for a spiritual activity were did. If I had to complain about anything, it would just be the nature of a very old house, and the kind of musty smell that can be detected by those of us sensitive to that sort of thing. If you have this issue, just remember your allergy meds, but by all means don't let stand in the way of checking out this beautiful home."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,We came to see a show at the historic opera house we have heard so much about. Our stay in this gorgeous Victorian house just completed a most perfect adventure. Now my husband is so inspired by Joan’s decorating ability. It was truly like stepping back in time. We’ll be returning.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a wonderful place. Way more than what we expected. Will definitely recommend this place and stay again!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place and an easy walk to the downtown area! Wonderful night out!
2022-12-01,4,Group trip,Beautiful place. Great location
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Another great stay!
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful unique place to stay! Would recommend!
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,This is a very beautiful historic home very conveniently located to the downtown area. Everything was nice and our stay was very comfortable.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely house!
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"The Inspiration House truly lives up to its name. What a beautifully decorated home with many special touches. Joan was the perfect Hostess preparing for our arrival and being easily accessible during our stay. She even decorated the outside with Halloween surprises. How fun! And the beds were a delight…like sleeping on a cloud. We stayed at the home for our College Girls Weekend and couldn’t be more happy with our choice. We definitely recommend The Inspiration House to anyone looking for a beautiful, well appointed, and comfortable home-away-from home!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This house is a gem! Great location for attending Opera House or other events on Main Street in Newberry! We love this charming old house!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Sensationally appointed home in lovely, quiet neighborhood. We will treasure our memories exploring the home’s art and artistry, which is endless! Joan is a terrific host—communicative and responsive, welcoming and gracious. Newberry is peaceful and quaint but with modern amenities (Starbucks, etc). A one-of-a-kind Air B&B experience!!!"
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"The house is beautiful, we really enjoyed our stay!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had loads of family in town for a destination wedding. This Airbnb was a smash hit! It is located perfectly for a walk to downtown, close to all the bars and restaurants our guests needed.
The kitchen and bathroom were fully stocked and overall everything in the home was as advertised. Well decorated with lots of charm and history.
Check in and check out was very easy!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and spacious home. Lovely fully stocked eat-in kitchen. Joan was so nice and easy to contact. She let us check in early and the self entry was a breeze.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location !
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is an Amazing Home within walking distance of everything you want to see and do in Newberry. It is immaculately clean with ample space! Not to mention it is historic and renovated beautifully.
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"If you’re looking for a super cool host, I recommend staying with Joan! The property was awesome and rich with history and charm. I will always stay with Joan wherever she has a property."
2022-07-01,4,Group trip,"This spacious house was a great place for our family gathering. Located in downtown Newberry with easy access to restaurants and the Opera House. Joan is a great host and was available if any issues arose but never did.
We look forward to staying here again for our next family gathering in Newberry,"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful and spacious house, I can only recommend.
If you want to spend time with family or friend this is the best place. Nice rooms, very well equipped kitchen, beautiful garden and porch, our favourite place during our stay.
Joan is very helpful it was a pleasure to meet her."
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,Such a nice find in Newberry. Recommend.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Second time staying. Always a easy process and amazing home to stay in. Thank you again for being a amazing host and providing and outstanding place to stay.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing house and location with tons of charm. Joan was so easy to work with and extremely responsive to all questions. I highly recommend and the front porch is a great place to relax in the morning with coffee and in the evening with a glass of wine!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Well presented home away from home feel. Supplied our needs and the location was perfect for visiting Newberry. Would definitely recommend and stay again.
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful home! You can spend hours just exploring all the historical touches and decorating schemes. Not to be missed is sitting on the large front porch with your friends or family on a warm evening. Bonus: Joan is great to work with and can be contacted immediately with any questions. Definitely coming back!
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"This house was amazingly beautiful. I loved the decor and the colors. It is like the photos. There was coffee in the refrigerator and plenty of kitchen supplies to cook, though we did not. We stayed here after my mother's funeral. The beds were comfortable, and I had a good night's sleep after a week of not sleeping well.
It was my first time back to Newberry in several years, so enjoyed going downtown and wandering into the opera house. The next morning, we went to the Figaro Market. Newberry is a very quaint town.
If you are elderly or just not steady on your feet, you do have to walk up stairs/steps to the front porch or back entrance. One of the bedrooms is on the first floor however.
We parked on the street and walked to the back and up the stairs to the lockbox."
2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home! Great location. Beds were very comfortable. None of the showers were walk-ins and all were very awkward to use. Narrow and steep outside stairs to get supplies into house. Difficult for older people. We loved rocking on the front porch.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had the most wonderful Newberry experience. We had friends join us for fun shopping , porch talk, dinner at Figaro, and Queen’s Six at The Newberry Opera House, followed by dessert and conversation back at The Inspiration House. Everything was in walking distance of our Airbnb, and we were pleasantly surprised by the charming and spacious house. Thank you Joan! ❤️"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful grand old house, located walking distance from all the down town sites, and minutes from the college. Ample room for sleeping, eating, relaxing, and hanging out. Beautifully kept house. Joan was easy to contact and prompt in responding."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If visiting Newberry and plan on being near historic downtown, this is an awesome location. Everyone in Newberry was super friendly. Historic house has tons of character and a couple quirks. Wonderful to have large front porch to kick back on. Went for a couples weekend, the only thing I would change would be bringing a third couple as house has ample space to accommodate many quests."
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,"Joan is great to work with, great location and beautiful home!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is the best AirBnB we have every stayed in.
Joan's place was fantastic. We were in town for a baby shower and retreating back to our ""home"" was wonderful. Plenty of room for our large group to spread out and unwind and we had everything we needed for a perfect stay."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at The Inspiration House exceeded our expectations. We were in Newberry for a girl's weekend and event at the Newberry Opera House. The location was perfect for all we had planned. As an early riser, my mornings on the large front porch were a welcome respite. Joan was a most gracious host and communicated wonderfully. The house was beautiful, each room taking its own step back in time. One of my friends had never stayed in an Airbnb before. After this experience, she said she will never stay in a hotel again. We look forward to returning."
2022-02-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Joan was incredibly helpful - allowing me to get a package at the house since I'm traveling so much. She also invited us to check in early, which was great since I'm working from the road. The house was full of incredible decor and furnishings, in some ways it felt like staying in a museum. The house is very large for the price! We had plenty of space to spread out. I also appreciate that she didn't use any strong scents - so many airBNBs have lots of glade plug-ins that accost you as soon as you walk in. It's a super easy walk to downtown Newberry! Really cute shops.
It's a very old house and has grand rooms with high ceilings so it got pretty cold some times. The kitchen is huge and well equipped, it was just a bit hard to find things. For a family, we didn't feel super comfortable to relax. The beds were comfy but none of the sitting areas felt cozy and relaxing to us. It's more of a romantic & fancy experience."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Incredible and unique home. Highly recommend! Super cozy.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great experience. It was like stepping back in time. The house is well appointed, close to all the downtown Newberry experiences, and just overall a lovely accommodation. We will stay here again."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,wonderful home with so much charm!!!

2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This house is a gem! Great location - close to shops restaurants , and bars! Newberry Main Street is precious! Joan is a great host! She has thought of it all! So thankful that she shares this historic, beautiful home!"

The house is within walking distance to Main St. shops and restaurants in Newberry."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful spacious, Federal style 1800’s home in a historicn neighborhood & truly within walking distance to downtown Newberry & Opera House. Everywhere we ate or shopped was a pleasant surprise. Definitely returning soon. If you are interested in a local bar within walking distance, Martin St Bar 2-3 blocks downhill is the place to go. It’s been in business 75+ years & they were very welcoming to our group."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"There is a lovely haven in Newberry SC waiting to welcome you with gracious hospitality! Joan has created a beautiful home with everything you need for a great stay. The beds are honestly the stuff of dreams, there are lots of towels for your use, the kitchen is big but cozy and great for meals and gathering. There is so much room. Enjoy rocking on the porch! You are within easy walking distance of restaurants and shops.
Relax into the friendly small town atmosphere and the very special warmth of Inspiration House."
2021-10-01,4,Group trip,Enjoyed our stay for homecoming weekend! Would definitely stay here again.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect place to unwind! The attention to detail in the decorating was great, every time you walk through a room you see something different.

2021-10-01,5,Group trip,Love the house!
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,"This wonderful historic home is even more beautiful than its pictures. We were so blessed to be able to celebrate our families September birthdays as well as host The Diamonds singing group who were performing at the Newberry Opera House.
Joan was a fabulous host and made everything from booking to entry so easy. She was so very accommodating and we are so grateful for her allowing us to book her beautiful home. It had plenty of space for all and I highly recommend it if you are ever in the Newberry area."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fabulous place - artsy , hospitable , and very clean -."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you like a small, quaint town like Newberry, SC
This is the house to have your experience.
We felt as if we were staying in Downton Abbey. Historic, beautiful and well decorated and equipped.
We ate at Figaro’s dining room and it was fabulous.
The rest of the stay we cooked or ate at the house.
Such a great experience"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Staying at Joan’s place was great!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This house is very large and super cool. lots of interesting decor. It's even bigger than the pictures make it look. The location was convenient to central Newberry and Joan is very responsive.
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,Such an interesting home. great location right in the middle of Newberry. We really enjoyed our stay and will be back.
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful house in downtown Newberry.

2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Excellent home. We attended freshman orientation for Newberry College and the home is less than 1 mile away. The house is huge and well decorated. This home has a bed & breakfast feel. The entire process from booking to check-in, was quite simple. Great communication. This Airbnb will be our second home while we attend Newberry events for our son over the next four years. See you in August."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had one of the most amazing vacations spent in Joan's lovely home. Joan made the experience even better with recommendations since I was new to the area. She was so pleasant even though she was dealing with other obligations she was quick to respond and resolve a minor mix-up.You will not regret staying in The Inspiration House! I was in awe of the home in itself but upon entering you are taken into history preserved and compiled of so much love and appreciation that will stand the test of time. The way each item perfectly placed made the home even more impressive and inspiring. This home can be described in so many ways however the name fits it best because it is truly inspiring!

2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,clean well stocked house with a great front porch and easy walk to restaurants downtown
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Seems like a sleepy town with not much to do, but that's what we were looking for! There are 3 sitting rooms, which we made great use of two of them just chatting it up! The beds and furniture were super comfortable, which is anot always the case at other homes.
Our host, Joan, was a great help in finding a great nail salon. Newberry Nails in the Wal-Mart shopping center was a lot of fun and did a fantastic job on fill-in and pedis. We had a 2-hour wait so went to Cato and Burke's (just opened, similar to Ross). We ate at Shealey's BBQ which was okay, and The Front Porch in Richburg, which was fabulous. Make sure you stop at Laila's for donuts and icecream in the historic district. Enjoyable, quiet and a fun house to sit and ""look"" at everything."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If I could give this house 10 stars, I would! The pictures do NOT do it justice. It is a stunning home. Spacious & perfectly decorated. My guests could not stop raving about our stay! Will definitely be back!!!"

2021-03-01,5,Group trip,"Three couples traveled to Newberry for a weekend getaway. The Inspiration House exceeded all expectations! Not only is it very comfortable and “homey” despite being very large, but staying there was like staying in a museum (in a good way!). The photos,artwork furnishings and memorabilia were fascinating. So much to see and enjoy!
The house was very clean and the kitchen was well stocked. We cooked all our meals at the house and had everything we needed. The beds were super comfortable and the bathrooms included thoughtful amenities like shampoo and body lotion,etc.
The location is perfect-just a short walk into town and all Newberry has to offer. There was ample off street parking for three cars.
Joan was very responsive and helpful. The perfect host. We can’t wait to return for another weekend at the Inspiration House."

2020-03-01,5,Group trip,What a fascinating old home. This house is beautiful with many sitting areas. If it had not rained I would have loved to spend time in the back garden and on the front porch.

2020-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Joans house is absolutely a dream. It was large enough to fit our entire family for the extended weekend. She had an incredible location right next to the college and downtown area. Her home was so welcoming and she had everything we needed. Would 100% recommend this for someone who is looking for a comfortable home away from home.
2020-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Inspiration House is a gorgeous old home which was perfect for our family 6-8 people. We had a wonderful and fun time visiting our daughter at college. The house had everything we needed, we were able to cook meals but also close to man street for coffee and some restaurants. Joan was helpful and very easy to communicate with. Would definitely recommend Inspiration House!"
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed staying at Joan and Ryan’s lovely home. We had way more space than we needed, but really enjoyed the majestic home. So many extra special touches, and a quick walk to Main Street and shops and restaurants. I can imagine big families gathered around the large dining table, kitchen, and in the various sitting areas in years gone by. The decor was perfect and there are so many antiques to look at and photos and Joan and Ryan’s own photo books (be sure and spend some time looking at those)! We would love to spend more time in Newberry and in Joan’s home specifically...perhaps we can in the future, but we feel blessed we were able to have this special time. Thank you again!"

This was our first visit to Newberry and we came here for a wedding on Main Street and it was a very short walk to everything that we needed! The house was in very good condition and was very clean and the neighborhood was very safe and beautiful as well. Thank you so much for a wonderful stay for my family!
