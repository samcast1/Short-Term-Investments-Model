2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Very quiet place that was centrally located to restaurants and the bay. Bree was super responsive and very helpful. We would definitely stay here again!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place, well placed to access the I98 to the south beaches or to Mobile / Pensacola. Very clean, well decored, some attentions from the host (really appreciated, thx). Very reactive host. We will recommend this place or rent it again for our friends and familly."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great accommodations at a reasonable price. Close enough to restaurants and attractions on both sides of Mobile Bay. The condo was clean and nicely decorated and exactly as described in the listing. It was the perfect size for just one person. Great recommendations for things to do and places to eat, too. Easy check-in/out. Would definitely consider staying here next time I’m in the area."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Super clean and quiet. Plenty of restaurants and shopping close by. I would stay again.
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Condo was in a great location and was clean. Took us a few minutes to find the exact unit though, but maybe we just misinterpreted the directions. The unit has a strange bathroom layout in that the toilet area is a step up from the vanity area so bring a nightlight if you go to the bathroom during the night. First night we had no issues at all. The second night however, the neighbor upstairs was walking heavily/stomping across the floor constantly from about 10:30 to at least 12:30 (confusing since it is such a small unit) so we were unable to sleep and then I never fell asleep after that until after 5am after more heavy walking around 4 am. No other reviews complained about the upstairs neighbor so maybe they had a guest in their unit?? I tried to read to relax but could not get bedside lamp to work. Bree was kind enough to mail back my pillow case after I left my pillow there and was sympathetic to the lack of sleep and planned to talk with the neighbor."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The condo was very nice and matched perfectly to the cleanliness that was shown in the pictures. The host were very responsive and engaged in answering any and all questions I had about the place. Overall a great stay and I would most definitely would stay here again.

Also some nice restaurants near, that were easy to get by walking."

I had everything I needed and the bed was comfortable for this side sleeper. I thought it was an excellent deal! I would say if you are older and need support going up stairs there is no railing on the few steps coming in and there is a step up to the toilet and tub (with support within reach). It has a large tub and I wish that I had made time for a soak.

I want to express our heartfelt gratitude for being such an amazing host during our stay in your beautiful cottage in Daphne. Beverly was in contact with us even before we left the UK to make sure we had everything we needed.
The coziness and comfort of the cottage made our experience truly memorable. The town of Daphne, and its wonderful people, added an extra layer of charm to our visit.
Being greeted every morning by the local cat, Tippy, was a delightful touch that added to the overall warmth of our stay. Your attentiveness and responsiveness made us feel incredibly welcome, and nothing was too much trouble for you.
We highly recommend your Airbnb to others and look forward to staying with you again in the future. Thank you for creating such a wonderful experience for us.
Warm regards,
Dave & Laura"

2023-08-01,3,Stayed over a week,"The place was beautiful. No problems there.
I had it reserved and paid for well in advance. However, something VERY important came out and I needed to cancel the stay. Unfortunately I was over the cancellation date limit for a couple of days when I found I could not use the place. Still about three weeks before our scheduled arrival date.
I asked the owner to allow me to cancel all the same or at least get a partial refund, but she wouldn’t budge. It was get right, yes, but she could have met me half way.
Did not! Very unhelpful."

2019-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We could write an essay on how wonderful it is to stay at Beverly's. Fluffy blankets and bedding and a glass of wine doesn't even begin to describe the journey that is The Little Cottage on Main. We loved being able to cook an early dinner and go for a walk to watch the sun set on the water. Almost everything one would need is within walking distance so certainly within driving distance. Beverly is knowledgeable of the area and always had great recommends. Her cottage is incredibly clean and cozy. Trust me, you won't want to leave."

Every room was tastefully decorated and exceptionally clean. Proximity to shopping and/or restaurants both driving and walking worked well for us (seniors)too. Since we stayed during MADI GRAS , we were able to watch an evening parade from the edge of the property. Jeff & Beverley were gracious hosts and also included us in their after (Mardi Gras) parade party..

Each room feels spacious because every square inch has been used thoughtfully, leaving plenty of space for storage and floor space to move around. For instance, the bathroom is has a pedestal sink and no ledges around the sink. But they’ve added a small storage unit above the toilet that should hold all the necessary amenities you bring. The bed and other furniture is very comfortable, including the porch furniture. The quality is even better than I expected. Beverly is very sweet and responsive.

We always feel spoiled staying this close to the bay. Being able to see the wildlife, waterfowl and spring flowers without a lot of traveling is splendid!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at the Crabshack for several days over our anniversary. It was nice to come home to a quiet place in a peaceful neighborhood after a day of exploring the area. The balcony was a pleasant place to begin and end a day. The view of the bay is just like the picture in the listing!
The shower was warm, the towels were soft, the bed was comfortable, and all the little details were taken care of. One morning, we rode the supplied bicycles and found more hills than we expected 😜. We also walked down to the water at McMillan Landing.
To sum it up, this is a good base for exploring the surrounding Eastern Shore area and also a nice place to stay in or take quiet walks in the neighborhood. We look forward to returning!"

It was cozy and quaint and hosts had so many little touches that made all the difference- bottles of drinking water, travel size meds and bowl of chocolates. We were happy to have a toaster oven as it's our primary appliance we use and love.
The view of the water and peacefulness of all the mature trees and nearby Macmillan Bluff was just dreamy.
There was this little sound that was distracting to me at the start- my husband had to really strain to hear it. I figured out it was the fridge and we put some low music on and after the first night it didn't bother me.
We had a relaxing and quiet and restoring time together. Just what we needed.
Thank you!
We ate at the Dragonfly Tavern and it was bomb! Sooo delicious."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Couldn’t recommend this place more, especially if a relaxing getaway is on your agenda! It’s right in the center of Daphne’s downtown historic area, bay access two steps away, and perfectly in between Fairhope’s shopping and fresh seafood options on Mobile’s causeway. As for the stay, the space is clean, private, and ultra comfortable! The hosts have truly thought of everything and you will be well taken care of. We can’t wait to be back!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was wonderful and well equipped. The Crab Shack was very clean and quiet. I wish I could have gone down to the dock and watched the sunsets, but it was a working weekend and busy. I would recommend their place to anyone staying in the Daphne area."

Beautiful views of the bay, with a park and access to an overlook within in a few minutes walk. Easy travel to Gulf Shores/Orange Beach for a day trip, and a good base for other excursions. Troy and Susan provided several extras like snacks, water, and coffee that we really appreciated. Quality linens, and the bed was comfy. Overall, probably the best Airbnb experience we’ve had."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful, peaceful, super clean and unique place to stay.

Sitting on the deck reading books and walking down the little nature trail to the beach access across the road was the highlight of each day of our stay. The sunsets over the bay were lovely!
We ate at East Shore Cafe three times...Totally recommend! Other wonderful places to eat nearby are: Moe's BBQ, Whit's Frozen Custard, El Rancho, Wacky Shrimp and Guido's.
Also...visited the local park boardwalks, B&B Pecan Farm and enjoyed the wildlife and birds during a day trip down the eastern bay coast on Old 98.

Easy access to the property. The neighborhood is very quiet and the loft had a great AC and ceiling fan with cozy decor and even some little accessories you didn’t remember to pack. The Keurig coffee machine and kitchenette were great. Enjoyed nearby Fairhope and Point Clear. We took a short drive over to Bellingrath Gardens and walked the beach on Dauphin Island. We would stay at this property again."

Thanks so much for the true southern hospitality experience!"

The loft was the perfect size for my kids and I. There was everything we could think of and then some. They left little extras (stocked coffee bar, snacks, toiletries) in case we left anything behind. We especially liked that there was a Netflix account available to use.
We just loved our trip and hope we can do it again next year!"

2021-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,Great value if you are looking for somewhere to lay your head while you sight see other places. Not a good place for couples with kids. There is no privacy because it's a studio apartment. Very hard to have quality adult time. But the place is perfect for couples!

Everything they say about the location, views, and sunsets are spot-on. It’s a lovely, quiet street but an easy 20-minute walk to several restaurants and other amenities of Old Towne Daphne. Beautiful (and short) drive to nearby Fairhope. Highly recommend!"

They had water, coffee (k-cups, so if you aren’t into that bring a French press and your own coffee!), and snacks out for us which was super nice. The place had everything we needed. I’ll be adding this to my list of places to stay when I go down to the coast in the future!"

We wish we could’ve stayed longer and would absolutely book again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had nine people and two dogs that stayed at Tammy's place for my graduation. Everything was as described. If desired, it can feel like two separate houses with the two living rooms, two kitchens, and two washer/dryers. Kitchens and rooms were fully stocked with everything we needed. As with anything with multiple stories though, be aware of sounds coming from the second floor if you are staying downstairs. Also, there is only the master bathroom downstairs so if someone else is staying in the second/spare bedroom, they will either have to share the bathroom with those staying in the master bedroom or go upstairs. We totally enjoyed staying here, we appreciated the Christmas decorations as it made it feel even homier. Parking was ample and the place was easy to find. If we are visiting Mobile and Tammy will have us in the future, we would definitely stay here again."

However, after driving over 10 hours, I wouldn't have thought we were needing to wash the linens and towels. The upstairs island and kitchen along with the utensils wasn't cleaned at all. The floors were filthy. But... on the brighter side of things, Tammy had responded quickly and we were refunded our cleaning fees but I would have liked to be reimbursed for two days out of four because it took the whole family to clean and who wants to do that on a vacation? I like to be pampered while being on vacation."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,We loved this place.. It felt like home. It was clean and a quiet neighborhood. Will definitely want to book this one if we were to come back.

It was immaculately cleaned and well stocked with everything we needed.
The extra touch of having coffee available really made such an impression for us.
The other extra things provided like laundry detergent, starch for ironing, shampoo and other bath essentials made our 5 day stay a lot less stressful. (We were in town for a family wedding.)
Plenty of towels, pillows and extra blankets.
The size of the house was perfect for our family because there was plenty of room to spread out. There is a comfy breakfast nook or a large table in a different room.
The covered patio with fans and a large TV made our evenings at the house even more enjoyable. We felt very at home from the minute we arrived.
Tammy was responsive, friendly and very helpful when I had questions.
We will definitely stay here again when we come back to visit family!"

Plenty of space and everything you need. Beds were comfortable and everything was clean. we really enjoyed the outside area. location was great and a short drive to fairhope and many different restaurants.

The home is in a quiet walkable neighborhood. I loved the unique organization of bath towels in baskets in bedrooms and powder rooms!
This house is as pictured, with large rooms. Multiple areas to eat, read, watch TV. Tammy has earned her superhost status, responding within minutes when we had questions and making sure we had no issues with reservation, finding and entering the property. We will definitely seek to stay at her home for future trips to the area!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is so comfortable for a large group. Tammy has so many dishes and silverware that you can run the dishwasher when it’s full, not because you run out of dishes! Perfect to have two bathrooms. The hot tub was a wonderful way to end every evening when we got back to the house. The backyard space is an added bonus! The one thing that might be of concern to some is two of the beds mattresses are soft. Other than that , there was nothing negative. I would definitely stay here again!"

There was a hot tub (though we did not use it). Great neighborhood - quiet, secluded, wooded with walking trails. Easy access to shops, restaurants, and gas stations.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Overall this place was exactly what we wanted and needed for our trip!
Just like the other reviews, the house space is much bigger in person which allows plenty of space throughout the house for larger groups.
We used it for family time and it was absolutely perfect!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We have stayed in a few Air BnBs and Tammys was the by far the best. They had basic accommodation like spices and sugar that other people dont think of. We would definitely choose to stay there again. They even left their TV loged into the apps so we didn't have to.

Shower in the master bath was amazing!! Plenty of water pressure and hot water! Didn’t have time to try the hot tub , but the patio was pretty. Worth the money"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Everything was great . Just be mindful when booking that nothing is within walking distance and the nearest store is maybe 7 minutes-driving. Besides that the house had all the amenities we needed. Very spacious…

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I was in Daphne to decorate for my Neice's wedding. I had a lot of flowers to arrange offsite of the venue. She knew I had my older parents driving in from a long trip. She allowed me to check in early due to no one renting the day before. When I arrived, she greeted me, remembered my circumstance, and even offered to go get any extra tables or supplies. Not many hosts would do this!!! My parents absolutely loved it. I think my dad stayed in his pajamas all day until wedding duties called him out, and my daughter in law ordered door dash for her, her 2-year-old, and my parents. Definitely recommend this house!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,This home is a hidden gem! It was actually much more spacious than it looks in photos and fit our large family perfectly. The dining room is my absolute favorite part of the home. It is decorated so beautifully and very homey. We will stay here every time we come back to visit.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing woman! One of my first bookings with air bnb and she helped me with some questions and responded fast! Amazing place and beautiful peace ful neighborhood
2023-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Very nice house that had everything we needed and was clean! Neighborhood is lovely and peaceful. We enjoyed the two ""living spaces"" as one had an oversize table that was perfect for jigsaw puzzles. Daphne is a nice town, close enough to Mobile if you want to go there and far enough away to not be subject to the traffic. We enjoyed our week."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very quiet neighborhood. Not too far off of I-10. Our stay was short, but it was just the kind of place we were looking for."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This home was wonderful and I will definitely stay again. They actually had more amenities that I didn’t even see in the description. For one the outdoor TV was a plus. Also they had put up Christmas decorations and a tree. This was a very nice and thoughtful touch. The home was located right in the middle of Daphne so we were close to restaurants and attractions. 👍👍
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"Thank you for a wonderful visit! Everything was perfect with the house with every last detail attended to. The house was very easy to find and check in was a breeze. I was born and raised in nearby Mobile and we return to visit family frequently. In the past, we have stayed at various hotels in the area but no more! This stay was SO much better and really made it feel like we were ""home"". Thank you!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was as pictured. Cozy and comfortable, and able to host just a few folks or a big family dinner. The beds were just right.
The kitchen was great for light meals and 4-5 people. Anything more involved needs more utensils. We didn't see anything kid-sized for eating ware. We enjoyed using the grill in the back.
The couch was SO comfy! Once you get snuggled in, it's hard to want to leave. Especially when you have a good book.
We don't recommend putting the fan on in the room with the bunk bed if anyone is sleeping on the top bunk. Our boys loved the beds and the cool steps up to the top.
Tammy had all the baby stuff you could need and one of the rooms had a great selection of children's books."

The location was great and we loved the neighborhood. Easy check in and check out. We loved the fenced in back yard for our dogs. We stayed on the patio a lot.

This home is so centrally located, and close to everything you could, or would want to do in Fairhope, Daphne, and Mobile. This sweet house is quiet, it was our sanctuary after a long day of visiting friends and shopping. It was genuinely nice to come home to a quiet reprieve. The beds are comfortable, the house is clean, the kitchen has just what you need to cook at home. There is a laundry room, if needed. We had a great sitting porch on the front with rockers as well. I really enjoyed our time here and would absolutely seek out Austin's place again when we come back for another visit. We absolutely loved it! Thank you!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really nice!!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were first time Air B & B'ers. But the communication with Austin was easy and he was very responsive. The house was CLEAN and 🚫 bugs. Honestly, that was my biggest concern since we've had stays in hotels/condos before that was subpar when it came to cleanliness. I loved how he provided filled bottles of hand soap, paper towels, even extra toothbrushes (if needed). The TV had lots of choices of what to watch on it, minus the Auburn game but maybe he's an Alabama fan so he had the channel permanently deleted 🤣. There's even boardgames for the kids to play on too. My only negative comment i would have for the house would be the beds. I believe they were memory foam beds and more on stiffer side than I would prefer. My husband has back problems so it was great for him, but I prefer more plush. But honestly, you can't make everyone happy when it comes to beds since personal preferences varies so much. All in all, it was a great, clean, and affordable house to rent. We highly recommend!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at Austin’s place!! It was even better than the pictures, and a perfect location. Super clean. We come to Daphne several times a year to visit family and friends and if he will have us we will definitely be back!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Stayed overnight on drive to Florida for the holidays. It was a safe and quiet neighborhood. I had my two dogs with me and it was great for them to run around and stretch their legs out back. Big enough to throw a frisbee around. There were plenty of restaurants to pick for food. Location was far enough away so it was quiet but close enough to the highway to hop back on easily in the morning.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Driftwood had everything we needed for our stay. We were in Dalphne for a church conference. The kitchen is tiny but well stocked. Dwight responded quivkly although there were no real issues. He had live plants in the home and outside which I loved. Beds were comfortable and enough spsce for the 3 of us. Book it if you need a place in Dalphne.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Dwight had every question I needed to ask answered before I could even ask. He was definitely ahead of the game. Very easy to deal with!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was very comfortable and homey. The balcony was beautiful and the beds were clean and comfortable.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Dwight was an excellent host. The Driftwood was the perfect place for us to relax while waiting for our new home construction.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Dwight lives in the condo area and made sure we knew he was available if needed.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dwight's condo in Daphne was great for our weekend visiting family. The neighborhood was quiet and easy to get around from. My only caveat is that none of the map apps do a very good job finding it, and it's hard to see the numbers on the buildings after dark. Heads up-- whatever your map tells you, keep going and it's the one straight ahead after the stop sign when you enter!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was amazing! It was very clean, quiet, and felt like home away from home especially the fact the host Dwight allowed me to bring my dog with me. Checking in was very easy, and Dwight was very proactive in telling me all the amenities, directions, checking in/out process, etc. Plus he even had a dog crate and gate he said I could use which saved me from having to pack those bulky items. Finally the place is updated and furnished very well. It has easy access from the front and back porch and it is a side unit so it is private feeling. Thank you again Dwight for allowing me to stay at your condo! I will be booking again in the future when I have to come back to visit Fairhope/Daphne!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Clean and comfortable condo. Landlord left wireless chargers in handy places and lots of other useful things. There is everything you need in the kitchen and bathroom. The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. Residential recommended.

We would definitely stay there again and advise anyone looking for a place in that area to stay there.
We had everything we needed and more. Our host was so accommodating and if we had questions he was prompt to answer.
5 stars"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Dwight was proactive and helpful. It was a little confusing finding the place until we realized he had a map in the photos. very nice!

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I don’t even know where to start!
Dwight (Dain), provided an extremely comfortable place for my family and I.
He accommodated to all our needs! (we had 2 dogs, 2 cats, and a newborn baby!)
He is very knowledgeable of the area, and is close-by if anything arises!
The condo is perfectly situated against a green-belt, and he’s got private shades on one porch, a smoker, and a grill out back to use!
It’s conveniently close to Publix, gas stations, food, EVERYTHING you need. It’s right off highway 10, so it was very convenient for me to get to Mobile for work (10min tops).
Has 2 beds, 2 bathrooms, a dog gate if you need it. A full functioning kitchen with a toaster/coffee-maker, a washer and dryer that functions perfectly, and a very comfortable living room. 100mbps internet, perfect for work/streaming!
We felt very safe during our stay as well, with spot lights surrounding the entire property if you were to walk around it.
I can’t thank Dain enough, STAY HERE! You won’t regret it <3"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Dwight was such a great host. He lived near by so we communicated often. He was very nice and accommodating. The condo is close to the water and has Kayaks to use. I will certainly stay again. Very clean condo and open. Bed very comfortable in the master bedroom. The condo has a great setup for families or friend's traveling together since there is a lot of privacy for the bedrooms and bathrooms. The master can be closed off completely . Just a great setup. The condo has outside sitting and cooking areas. The location is ideal setup since you are close to everything and very convenient if your coming off interstate. Very quiet but close to eateries and shopping. Just a great stay!

The coffee station was top notch. It’s very nicely decorated and comfortable. We took a walk each morning around the neighborhood which we really enjoyed.
The hosts were very responsive.
The only downside was we could hear the neighbors walking around upstairs, and music next door. It wasn’t bad enough to give this place 4 stars, it was just a minor annoyance when we were trying to relax.
Overall I would recommend this Airbnb and stay here again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kyle and Amanda were more than generous by working with me to get accomodations last minute. They were very responsive and friendly throughout the entire process.

Kyle and Amanda have truly thought of every detail to make your stay comfortable and are one of the few hosts that deserve the title of “ super host “! Everything was clean, new and well maintained ! From the amazing, fully stocked kitchen , to the fluffy extra blankets , all the little extras made their place just like home ! We have been AirBNB guests for many years now and this stay was one of the few BEST stays we’ve ever had ! They have set the bar high for other hosts !

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! We were in town for a wedding in Loxley and this was the perfect location- easily accessible to both Loxley and Fairhope. Decorations were so cute and we loved having coffee on the porch outside in the morning. Felt very safe and clean. Joel was very accommodating with flexible check-in so we could get in and ready for an early wedding.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second time staying in one of Joel’s condos. I spent the month of April this year in Daphne, and absolutely loved the condo!
So when I had to come back for a week this time, I made sure to see if he had an available unit and luckily he did. Both of the condos were great, and it makes being away from home a lot easier when you have a great place to stay. The setup is wonderful, and all the little extra things really make it feel like a home. After these two trips I’m not sure I can stay in a hotel anymore. Thank you so much, Joel!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were in town for a business trip and Joel was very accommodating when our plans changed a bit. Very easy to work with. The place was just what we needed. Very clean and quiet place.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came into Daphne for a wedding and wanted to update our space from a standard hotel ...so glad we found Joel's cozy place. This place was so clean and let me tell you about the sleeping quarters -- probably one of THE most comfortable beds and pillows I've EVER used!!! We slept like rocks. I had a few questions during my stay (nothing wrong with the place, I'm just a first-time Airbnb'er) and Joel was VERY responsive. Definitely would recommend."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our three day stay and slept very well in the comfy king size bed. The kitchen was well stocked and the bathroom had all we needed. Thick fluffy towels and even a hair dryer. Quiet scenic area with a nice restaurant down the hill on the water. Conveniently located between Mobile and Fairhope. Joel was quick to respond to my emails and provided lots of maps and local info. We had a very nice stay.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joel is a great host, very attentive and responded quickly."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The studio apartment is beautiful. It is beautifully furnished and decorated. Kitchen has everything you need, including a coffee machine with coffee cups. It has a nice balcony to the backyard. It is an apartment complex neighborhood surrounded by trees, plenty parking and very quite. It is a short drive to Fairhope beach (which is not the best beach but works if you don't have too much time). It is further from Orange beach etc. (almost an hour). There are malls, pharmacies etc very near the apt. Joel was very responsive and attentive by text. I would stay again here!"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,It was a nice stay all around!

2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This was my first time to see the ocean. I thought our whole vacation was ruined as I broke my foot a week before we left. I was so glad to see that it was on a ground level and very easy for me to get around with my electric scooter. This was a much needed time away for my sweetheart and I. This also was my first time ever staying in an Airbnb. I would definitely recommend this route over a hotel.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Joel was friendly and professional from the start. The week before going down he provided driving instructions into the condo complex as well as using the key lockbox to obtain the keys to the condo. The condo was just like the pictures and not once did I hear a neighbor. The Keurig was a nice added touch as well as the provided coffee supplies. Unfortunately I went to have some beach time but Mother Nature thought otherwise and ended up leaving two days early because of the weather and continued forecast of storms. I didn’t ask for a refund nor expect one because Joel obviously can’t control the weather but he graciously provided a refund for the unstayed days. I would stay again and would recommend the place for one person or a couple.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,such a comfortable and quiet place! perfect for 2

It was clean, the bed was comfortable and surroundings are quiet and peaceful. Shower temp and water pressure was great. No surprises or disappointments.
There were multiple stores close by, restaurants and Mobile Bay. The condo was a short drive to Mobile, Fairhope, Orange Beach, Gulf Shores, Dauphin Island and many more attractions/cities. We were able to visit all in our short 4 day stay.
Joel himself was awesome. His communication and instructions from booking through post check out was superb. He typically communicated first and responded within an hour if I messaged him. He was open to suggestions and left a great welcome packet with emergency info, places to go, shopping and anything you needed to know.
We will be back and Joel’s will be the first
on our list of places to stay! Thanks for helping make our vacation relaxing and fun!"

Some things to note.
Glass above door lets light in at night, enough to light the room up slightly.
AC unit is loud and kicks off abruptly.
Shower water pressure is low, but that may change.

Thanks again for having us stay at your place.

2022-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great location for our stay while attending a wedding in Spanish Fort. Easy access to Mobile and then only a hour to the beach. Just as pictured but was older than I expected yet clean and comfortable. The king bed was amazing! Wish we had it at the next stay at the beach. Joel answered questions on local restaurants. Thanks for sharing your place!
2022-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice little place- small but good for two people. Location is close to shopping and restaurants! Bangkok Thai very close best Thai food!!!
2022-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay at Joel’s cute condo! Really short walk to the bay to see the sunset 😊. Not too far from activities on either side of the bay. Visited Bellingrath Gardens, Fairhope and Gulf Shores beach. The condo was very clean. Can’t comment on how well equipped the kitchen was as we ate all our meals out. Did enjoy the Keurig though!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place is perfect for 2. There wasn’t any drawer space for clothes but plenty of closet space. Great little place.

We were able to take a two hour trip to New Orleans and a little over an hour and half to Destin! Just a great stay!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Definitely felt like my home away from home as I stayed here for a month, everything was so nice. The details and thoughtful amenities made this place really stand out from other places I’ve stayed. Loved the location and all the recommendations, the bay view was the perfect addition to my morning or evening runs. My biggest complaint when I stay places is usually the bed because I feel none are as comfortable as my one at home but I couldn’t even tell the difference which is amazing!! I definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting daphne or even surrounding areas as everything is just a short drive away."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing get away! Great aesthetic and availability to mobile and Fairhope areas!

Lots of nice amenities and very spacious closet space. It’s a minute walk from some beautiful sunsets. I would definitely recommend it."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You'll love how convenient everything is. Mobile beach is still close, plenty to do and plenty of places to choose from to eat. Traffic is heavy coming out of the condo so be careful and wear your seatbelt."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host! Loved the place
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If there is a silver lining to our Hurricane Ida story, finding Joel’s condo is one of the shining threads. While searching last-minute for an evacuation spot from New Orleans, we were able to book this charming getaway. We couldn’t have asked for a better place to land.
Leaving behind the conveniences of home was not as difficult as it might have been, as the condo had all the amenities that appealed to our aesthetic sensibilities and creature comforts. The layout of the condo is well-designed and the space was tastefully decorated. We especially appreciated having the private back porch (with sliding screened glass door), the no-issues WiFi, the king-size bed, and the perfectly-sized kitchenette with a roomy refrigerator. Not to be taken for granted was the the parking space conveniently located near the front door. But the icing on the cake was the proximity to the bay. What better way to end each day than a 5-minute walk to watch the colors of the setting sun emblazon the sky as it melts into the horizon?
As a host, Joel was extremely attentive, responsive, and accommodating. Considering the situation, he made us feel welcome and comfortable at a time of great uncertainty.
We hope to make it back one day, preferably next time under more relaxed circumstances. What a gem!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joel is a phenomenal host. He communicated with us every step of the way making sure that we had everything that we needed. His instructions were clear, he offered suggestions for restaurants and entertainment; the location is awesome and quiet; the condo looks exactly as pictured. There is a full kitchen with everything that you would need to prepare meals if you like. There were also coffee pods so we didn't have to rush out for coffee the next morning. Thank you Joel for sharing your beautiful condo! We will be back for sure!"
