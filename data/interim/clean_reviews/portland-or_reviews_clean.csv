2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It's a very pretty, cozy and clean place. The neighborhood is safe and beautiful with large trees and flowers during spring time. The location is just perfect as there are a lot of restaurants, cafes and shops near by. It's not far from Mt.Tabor as well and the bus stops are just a few minutes walk from the house. Highly-recommended place to stay in Portland."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Ruby’s place and found it to be comfortable, quiet, and convenient. Street parking was plentiful and right near the entrance. Ruby recommended some great restaurants within walking distance which we found to be a hit!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ruby’s place was so wonderful and cozy. The decorations and the rugs were exquisite, a warm and homey space. The basement/apartment is located in the center of Portland with great restaurants near by. I would only keep in mind to read the description CAREFULLY, the ceilings are super super low and is not ideal of tall people who are staying long visits. The kitchen was short-staffed in some amenities like plates and pans. But the space was perfect for a short amazing trip.
Ruby was super responsive and a great host!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, clean, and convenient! A great stay overall. Very walkable and parking was easy too. I recomend tall people heed the warning about low ceilings, but for the average to short crowd, its an excellent place."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I had a wonderful 6-week stay here. Ruby was very attentive, kind and responsive. I have severe allergies and although the apartment is on the lower level, it is very clean, there is an air purifier and I had no issues with allergies. The bed was extremely comfortable with plenty of clean blankets. I particularly liked the kitchen, which has a full size fridge and enough utensils and cookware for my needs. I felt very safe here because the entrance is behind a tall gate and fence.
I struggled with getting enough light, but that is expected for a basement apartment and it is still getting dark early. There is also some noise from upstairs, but it didn't bother me and I was still able to get work done.
Overall I had a great stay and am happy to recommend it!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ruby's place is really nice, very comfortable. We got into the city really early and Ruby messaged us we could come check in a bit early, which was really generous. There was a huge winter storm during our stay, so we stayed inside to escape the cold, and the apartment was relaxing. We also appreciated how responsive she was and making sure we had everything we needed."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was gorgeous! Very low ceilings though, but amazing location. Easy access to portland and not too far from downtown. Ruby responded as soon as possible. Definitely recommend!"
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I chose Ruby’s place for the excellent location, which is just a few blocks from my daughter and son-in-law, and stayed over the Christmas holiday. Cozy, lots of ambient lighting, very comfy bed. As noted, you are in a basement apt with a family living upstairs, so expect to hear some footsteps, but it was quite peaceful at night, I slept well; I wasn’t there during the day much. Well appointed kitchen with coffee, tea, etc, it had what I needed. Shower and bathroom are on the smaller side, which is clearly mentioned in the description, I made it work just fine, but it might be not ideal for super tall people. Good value for the rate, responsive host, lots of bar/restaurant/food carts nearby. Very ‘Portland’ vibe. I’d have liked to see the garden and plants in spring or summer, it looks like it would be quite lush, but it’s a cozy spot in winter."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Wonderful place for a quick getaway

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A beautiful little basement cottage in a nice part of town. Perfect.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I loved the Art Apartment! A friend visited me and said it seemed like I lived there, I was so at home in the space. It was just perfect for my needs-- quiet, charming and peaceful, in a very walkable neighborhood with lots of gorgeous trees and plenty of restaurants and bars on Hawthorne, a 10-15 minute walk from the apartment. Mt Tabor park is a super pleasant long-ish walk away, which was perfect for me on one of the dry Fall mornings. The only thing missing was a bath tub, but that's okay! I would still absolutely stay at Ruby's place (or her other listing, a cute cottage on the property) again any time. <3"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A sweet, perfectly Portland hideaway"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Love the place, feels magical. I would love to book this place again. It was a cold night, and the heater warmed up the whole place. Very hot shower, very enjoyable. A little home, away from home."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for us. It is beautifully appointed, with comfy furniture, a well stocked kitchenette, and lovely art throughout. I especially appreciated all the cool rugs on the floor, and the thoughtful lighting. The back yard is very sweet, and chock full of interesting plants and sculptures. Everything felt well-loved and heartfelt. Ruby was very friendly when we needed to interact, but otherwise gave us total privacy. And the location is fabulous, right in between Hawthorne and Division, there are probably 100 great restaurants, bars, shops and other attractions within 15 minutes easy stroll. Loved this spot and recommend it highly to anyone who wants an authentic Portland experience. Thanks Ruby!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fun and eclectic place. Live the garden and courtyard which were peaceful and quiet. The interior was full of fun touches, and had all the needed amenities. Perfect location near everything. Would definitely recommend this place."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Ruby was incredibly responsive. We needed internet access for a class that extended past check out and she found a way to accommodate both our needs and those of the next guests. I love her space - so comfortable.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ruby’s place was beautiful and she was a great host. Flexible to what I may need and has a very peaceful apartment to stay in. Thank you Ruby!
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable and equipped basement apartment in an excellent location for walking to restaurants, shops and bars. The drinks and snacks were a great touch! However the outdoor area is a common space shared with the host and other air bnb guests so it didn’t feel very private. Additionally the sauna pictured in the photos is not accessible to use so it felt a little misleading. Some attention to detail to be desired. Over all we still had a pleasant stay."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Ruby’s place was clean and cozy, and in a great location. She was a lovely, communicative host. We would definitely stay again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Ruby’s place was excellent! Perfect location to explore the city of Portland and the surrounding areas! Ruby is also so sweet and down to earth. Will be staying with her again when in Portland!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The stay had a very nice backyard/garden area. Access to the room/back gate was easy and the downstairs it self was very comfortable
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is clean, well furnished, and allows you to be completely isolated throughout the stay in Portland. With that being said, Ruby was very communicative over text throughout our time and gave us ample warning of if there might be extra noise. Definitely recommend!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! What a gem of a place! Seriously, if you're visiting Portland, this is where you need to be. A short walk from Hawthorne Street will fill a weeks worth of adventures alone... Ruby is an excellent host with amazing communications and friendly tips. And she has a sauna and outside shower! What a treat that was. The place was spotless and had some snacks and beverages (our favorite Polar Water) for us as well. The ceiling is a little low if you're a taller person, but otherwise an amazing spot. We stayed for a week and loved ever minute of the cozy space. Thanks, Ruby!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ruby’s place was great! It was neat, clean and cozy with a most comfortable bed. The neighborhood was beautiful and close to restaurants, shops, and public transit. I would highly recommend it to any visitors to Portland."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. I wasn’t convinced about being in basement but it was really pretty and cool (literally and figuratively). The host has great taste!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super cute basement studio! Perfect weekend spot for me and my partner to explore Portland. In between Hawthorne and Division/Clinton so it was super easy to walk to both areas. Ruby was also very responsive and constantly checked to make sure we were comfortable. Highly highly recommend!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great space in a really lovely neighborhood! The sauna and outdoor shower was a really nice bonus
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Ruby's Art Apartment is within a private and secure setting, and the location is in one of Portland's most beautiful and convenient neighborhoods. We chose it because of its close proximity to people we were visiting, and the ability to walk safely to and from there even late at night, around the neighborhood, and out for coffee and meals, allowed for a sense of freedom we would not have had otherwise.
Ruby was an excellent communicator and we agree with the many reviews that mentioned the comfortable bed!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Worked out very well. Not far from downtown and Ruby has a beautiful yard and cozy basement apartment. Would definitely stay again. Ruby is also a Masseuse and my wife was able to get a massage with her. She highly recommends getting one as well. I went into the sauna during that time which was great. Ruby also offered great recommendations on restaurants and a hiking spot that would accommodate my wife’s limited mobility. The apartment had everything we could possibly need: extra pillows, blankets, toiletries, towels, travel books/magazines, games, iron and ironing board, French press, kettle, microwave, toaster oven, hair dryer, coffee and tea, and even essential oils for the diffuser. Everything was clean and decorated beautifully. Bed was comfortable with some of the softest sheets I’ve ever slept on. Nice fluffy pillows on the bed and sofa, too. The basement was quiet—no need to worry about it being too noisy from the house above. This was our favorite airbnb stay yet! Book it!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ruby's Art Apartment is great! It's cozy and comfortable. We had a vey relaxing time. The Apartment is a short walk to lots of great shops and restaurants. We will definitely stay here again. Thank you, Ruby!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You enter through a gated garden space which immediately made us feel welcome. Great cozy space to relax, extremely comfortable bed!
We used the pullout bed too, and I was also a comfortable sleep.
We loved it so much we recommend it to friends that checked in the minute we checked out!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Ruby's place is lovely and cozy! Although she was on her vacation when we stayed there, she was super responsive to any questions and even offered a flexible arrival/departure time. My 2 children and I stayed there and enjoyed the space, trampoline, sauna, and neighborhood. It was just like the pictures/description! The pull out sofa bed looked a little lumpy but my 10 yr old slept soundly on it without a complaint!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as described, beautiful neighborhood! Would stay again in the future."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Cozy and creatively furnished, Ruby's Art Apartment was a charm!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem in a wonderful neighborhood, beautiful sauna and space to relax just moments away from some of my favorite restaurants in Portland. Exceeded my

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This apartment and the yard are absolutely beautiful! The bed is THE MOST COMFORTABLE bed I have ever slept in. Ruby has thought of everything and then some. The art is not something just thrown up on a wall but actual gallery quality work. There were some essential oils available and the place smelled delightful. This was a much needed get away and I felt wrapped in a hug from the moment I arrived. I will stay with Ruby every time I go to Portland from now on. Just loved it!!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My daughter and I enjoyed our weekend stay in this cozy, charming, comfortable space."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Checkin was easy, and the electronic locks made coming and going very simple!

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This space was perfect for my son and I after a visit to OMSI. It was in a safe neighborhood, with plenty of parking. Clean and cozy, it felt just like home. We loved the art, the essential oils and the vibe. Close to New Seasons market and Hawthorne fun, it was a perfect place for our visit. Hardly noticed we were in a basement. Highly recommend."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ruby's place is just as described and pictured. Super easy to find, lovely neighborhood to walk about and a warm, cozy & comfortable little space. We enjoyed playing records while we cooked simple meals. Wish we would have had time to stay longer and enjoy the sauna since it was freezing when we were passing through town! Ruby is super responsive to messages - we had no issues at all. Thank you for the great stay! We enjoyed the lovely space you created."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful area and awesome place to stay. Ruby has the space set up perfectly! We visited Hawthorne theatre just a few blocks away and the neighborhood was quiet, family friendly and clean! We felt safe, relaxed, and loved sitting in the back yard space. Would book again!"

I highly recommend staying at Ruby’s if you find yourself in Portland!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My mom and I had a wonderful time staying at Ruby's ""Art Apartment.""

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My friends and I had an amazing stay at Ruby's home. The space was clean, cozy, and inviting. The tea, coffee and snacks were a huge perk after long flights to PDX! Ruby was very accommodating to a later check-out time requested by one of my friends, who was not feeling well towards the end of the trip, and needed a few extra hours to sleep in before her flight home. I highly recommend this spot!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved this Place. Ruby was a great host. The location is amazing, walking distance from restaurants and shops that we enjoyed the most in Portland. We’d definitely stay here again!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We came up to Portland from Eugene for a concert at the Hawthorne Theater. It was the perfect distance for walking and was super safe. The apartment was adorable!! Super quiet and clean. Couldn’t ask for anything better.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Ruby’s place was very comfortable, great communication, special extra touches and care that made us feel very much at home. The place was stocked with amenities and beautiful decor. The location really can’t be beat, SE Hawthorne, Mt. Tabor, and direct access to downtown."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location, and suite. Ruby was wonderful and the check- in was easy. Hawthorn area is Fab! I gave a 4 for cost/ value as the city charges 2 taxes, so the owner gets way less than 1/2 of the end cost. This I did not think was fair and is not my usual experience with renting in Air bnb? Thanks Ruby!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, bed was comfortable, neighborhood felt safe, not far from good food"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thanks again Ruby for making my bday special without even knowing you
All the best"

2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We had a quick and wonderful stay at Rubys place. Excellent communication and a lovely touch with welcome chocolates and dining recommendations.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay. I slept well. The bed was comfy and the space was clean. The art was very interesting too.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice, comfortable, clean, and everything you need for your stay…also close for coffee at stump town (recommended)."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a quaint place, wonderful Oregon vibes. The neighborhood was safe and quiet, the asthetic of the suite was perfect. Comfortable beds. Kind host! If you are taller, this may not be the best fit (literally) just gotta watch your head. I would stay again :) the sauna was beautiful and so relaxing. Everything I wanted and needed!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ruby has created a beautiful and peaceful place! Everything I needed was there, including some quiet solitude that I was needing. The space is gorgeous -- amazing artwork and incredibly comfortable. I would absolutely stay again :))"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was so adorable! Perfect location and walking distance to Division and Hawthorne areas. Check in was easy and we loved the personal note Ruby left us. It was four of us and it didnt feel too small, but we only used the space to sleep. Highly recommend!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My sister and I had a lovely stay in Ruby's art apartment! It was so peaceful and relaxing. We also love how close it was to the vintage shops in Hawthorne!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay here! It’s a quick walk to either Hawthorne or Division Street and either have a lot to offer. The apartment itself is clean and comfortable and honestly, has one of the most comfortable beds I’ve slept in at an Airbnb. Ruby is wonderful and we would definitely stay here again!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place. We loved how cozy the art apartment was and all the special details. The patio is totally great, we felt we were living in a creative space. Ruby was responsive and helpful."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,So well remodeled and clean. Ceilings are pretty low so watch yourself if you’re tall. Easy walking distance to things and also close to the bus lines if you’re wanting to venture out further and on the cheap. Ruby provides a lot of sweet touches like a handwritten card and treats and the space was just really cozy and well decorated. Outdoor lighting was a little bright for sleeping but otherwise such a lovely stay!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful, private spot near Hawthorne. Highly recommend!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My friends and I had a wonderful time staying at Ruby’s. She is an excellent host with great communication. We felt very welcome! The Airbnb is in a great location and the neighborhood felt very safe. We would return in a heartbeat.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I can only dream to have lived in a cute little place like this when I was a single girl!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay. Beautiful neighborhood and a beautiful yard. Ruby’s place is very comfortable. Ruby provided many thoughtful extras. We will definitely book again. Thank you Ruby.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our stay at Ruby's was short but sweet (we were only there one night but quite enjoyed it!). The neighborhood is cute and quiet and is walking distance to cafes/shops/restaurants/etc. Parking was easy and the space was clean and is decorated nicely and thoughtfully. There were 4 of us and for a short stay there was plenty of space. The chocolates and essential oil diffuser were great touches to make us feel at home.
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"A very cute ground level apartment, full of art, music and aromatherapy (candles and essential oils). Nestled in a good neighborhood close to main roads and east to park near.
You’ll walk through the backyard garden to find your entrance and then your inside the unit. There is a lower ceiling clearing of 7 feet that dips down to 6 feet which isn’t that big a deal. Big comfy bed and some houseplants to make it feel homey."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a lovely space with a lovely attentive hostess.One of my favorite places to date! We can’t wait to come back. It’s located close to grocery stores, great restaurants, record stores and vintage shops- all at a walking distance. We loved the vibe! Thank you Ruby ! ☺️"
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Ruby’s basement apartment was cute and quaint accessible via a magical little yard backyard. Great location and she even gave us good recommendations on food in the area.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute and cozy basement apartment in a wonderful Portland neighborhood. Easy walking distance to some fantastic food and parks. Great place for a walking and eating weekend!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to stay. Cozy, clean and just right. Great location in a calm, residential, tree-filled area that's in between two streets with lots of restaurants and little shops. It was easy to take the bus into the heart of the city as well. Ruby is a great host. When we arrived, there was a card for us and little treats. She was also quick to respond to my questions. I would definitely stay here again. Also, everything was clean and the place smelled really nice. It's a basement apartment, but it doesn't feel stuffy or closed-in at all. You can see the greenery outside. The only criticism I might possibly have: There were 4 of us (2 adults & 2 kids) and perhaps it's better suited to just two people in terms of eating arrangements if you're planning on making dinner. And there was a little bit of noise from other kids playing, but not a big deal and this is mentioned in the description anyway. These aren't really criticisms - it's just good to be aware of these points. All in all, it really was a great place to stay and, as I said, we would stay here again in a heartbeat."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thanks again, Ruby! One thing to note is we couldn’t find a duvet cover for the pull out bed? Also, shana mentioned she had to sleep the other way around on it so her head was above her feet lol… we totally understand how hard it is to make pull outs comfortable.
We loved the stay and wish we could have stayed longer… didn’t have enough time this trip!
Thanks again!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"cute little place in a beautiful neighborhood, lots to do nearby"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a fantastic apartment! It is spotless clean, provides easy to follow directions for check in and out, and information for our stay It's nicely decorated with comfy bedding that has luxurious pillows and when it's rainy and cold, like it was during our visit, the heaters were easy to turn on and off and kept the place warm and toasty.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Art Apartment is well managed by the host. The art speaks to the copious details the host left us before we were to check in. The host thought of everything and let us know in advance, to make our trip as relaxed as possible!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Ruby’s place was perfect! The stay was so comfortable and in a great location. Lots of things to do nearby, and when we would come back to the airbnb it felt like home. Made our trip to Portland with our 10 month old a breeze. Thank you Ruby ❤️"
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ruby's place has a lot of thoughtful amenities like a large coat rack, an air purifier, nice kitchen knives, a Brita filter, and lots of spare bedding. We found the previous folks stowed dirty dishes in the cabinet, which was disappointing given the cleaning fee charged. We did wish for a full-length mirror and an iron that didn't leak water everywhere. Despite an earnest attempt, we couldn't figure out how to work the bizarre ironing board. If you have a nice event to attend, this place might not have the basics needed to get ready."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Just fine
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic spot, very cool and unique. Amazing location and great value! check in and out couldn't be simpler! thanks for everything, Ruby"

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Apartment was very cute and was stocked with drinks and such, I have yet to see that in an air bnb and it was a thoughtful touch. The “hobbit” bathroom definitely lived up to its name, but luckily none of us are very tall so it was no problem hehe. Would definitely rent from her again"
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, clean, and easy access."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An amazing experience with an excellent host - this place is everything it says it is and is in an awesome neighborhood close to bars, brunch, arcades and more.

2021-12-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Cozy, with nice furnishings. Tricky to unlock the gate when we arrived at night, but we got in. At first it was nice and toasty but we were unable to adjust the heat, which ran all night, so we actually had trouble sleeping from being so hot."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ruby is an absolutely amazing host! Both her responsiveness and the place have exceeded all expectations. The place was very clean, warm and cozy. Ruby provided clear check-in and check-out instructions and was happy to answer any questions we had during our stay.
The only sad thing is that we were so busy exploring the city that we didn't get enough time to try the sauna. It means we should come again! I highly recommend this place and Ruby as a host to anyone looking to have a fantastic experience in Portland."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great apartment with everything one could need -- lots of fluffy towels, great linens, nicely decorated, etc. Thanks for a lovely stay!"

But other than that. It’s a awesome place to stay"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place for a Portland getaway!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"PERFECT! PERFECT! PERFECT!
This is how an AirBnB experience should be.
It was just a short stop for us as we were only there for about 12 hours. With a short stay, there's no time for drama, etc. Couldn't have asked for a better stay.
Next time, I might try the unit that's detached from the house as that place looked cool also.
Thanks Ruby.
Cheers,
Paul"

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ruby’s place was ideal for our stay in Portland. We had a number of plans for dinners etc. around town and found ourselves shelving plans to walk around the neighborhood- everything was so close! If you’re looking to stay in the Southeast area, this is in the perfect location between major corridors. Ruby put attention into the smaller details of her home that made the stay comfortable- from wonderful doTerra sample offerings in the shower to having coffee for us during the stay to the apartment decor feeling warm and inviting. The apartment is cozy, bed is super comfortable, and she has really all the amenities you’d need to relax and have a functional home base for your excursions in the city. Thanks Ruby!"

I somehow missed this and my husband hit his head a few times.*"
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Cozy lovely basement space that was very clean and comfortable. Great location to walk to restaurants and coffee shops nearby. Adequate amenities. Can hear people walking upstairs but it didn’t bother us. Would stay here again.

2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute place in a nice location in Hawthorne. Bathroom ceiling is a little low. Host gives a heads up about it, but it still won’t be the most comfortable place to use the facilities if you’re over 6 foot. Otherwise great place to stay."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved this little Airbnb! The space was very clean and secure. It’s so close to restaurants and night life without being right downtown and we found the most delicious dinner at Farmhouse Thai Kitchen (highly recommend!!). Ruby was extremely communicative and took care to make sure we had everything we needed.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved staying here! The apartment is so unique and fun, the garden outside was beautiful, and it’s conveniently located. Ruby was also very responsive and friendly. I would definitely stay here again."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Although I never met Ruby her hospitality came through with little things like very fast communication and a very well stocked kitchen. We had everything we needed. And we loved their garden and getting to sit in the back yard. one evening when we were walking out the back gate a passerby even complemented us on the beautiful garden! The location is also very convenient to stores and restaurants on Hawthorne.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect spot!

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved my stay at this space. It was so easy, quiet, clean, and in a great location. It was the perfect Portland neighborhood to come back to after a day of exploring and visiting friends. I was really impressed with the way the space didn’t feel too small or even that it was really in a basement. Highly recommend!"

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A cute apartment full of unique art in a cute and friendly part of Portland. We have no complaints about the amenities or features of the apartment. super cozy!
Easy access to the bars on Division and the great shopping on Hawthorne. The neighborhood is pretty quiet at night which can be a good or bad thing depending on what you're looking for. Plan to have dinner early. Also take advantage of the numerous buses and the BikeTown bike share."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was an amazing stay! Ruby kept the apartment nice and cool! Highly recommend staying at her place if you need a place to stay in Portland.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really liked staying here—the location is perfect. The apartment is cozy, well appointed, and sparkling clean. My partner and I stayed, and it is perfect for two people (who know each other well). The ceilings are a bit low, but they are exactly as described in the listing. The bathroom might be difficult to navigate if you are taller than 5’10”."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a true gem! The studio is beautiful, artistic, and spacious, and the hosts were highly responsive and helpful. The queen bed was possibly the most comfortable bed I've experienced at an AirBnB; the kitchen and bath were both thoughtfully appointed; and the outdoor sitting area was adorable. The location is fabulous -- the house is tucked in a gorgeous neighborhood full of charming homes and gardens, and it's just a few blocks from great restaurants and cafes. This was the perfect spot for two adults. My only suggestion to the hosts would be the possibility of adding a curtain that could close off the bedroom area if needed, which would make the space even more suitable for kids and night owls. :-) We absolutely hope to stay here again! Thank you!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little space! Super clean and tucked away!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice location and nice place. Very spacious.

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is super cozy and all of the little amazing touches that Ruby added made it that much better. There was a temperature controlled kettle & tea to enjoy it with! There was a diffuser and so many different oils to choose from. Everything you could possibly need in the kitchen. We also got to use the sauna which was very easy to use!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Listing is just as described. Private space, comfortable bed, and very clean. We appreciated the thoughtful touches. Thanks for hosting us!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice place. Well situated. Great location.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lance & Nicole's space was a treat. It is always a pleasure to find a spot that is pretty much EXACTLY what you are looking for! We were attending a show at Moda Center and just wanted a nice place that was pretty close, not very spendy, and comfortable for a good nights rest.
This is that spot. I know the neighborhood somewhat so I knew it was a good area to stay. Tons to do around. Etc.
For just staying very briefly... we were still welcomed with nice little touches like snacks and very clear instructions to a very nice little VERY clean space. Bathroom was nice and clean and they had dishes and microwave and fridge for any meals you packed or possibly leftovers from great food near by.
Communication was flawless and street parking was actually super easy and not overcrowded.
When we plan another trip down to the area we hope this space is available as we really enjoyed the short time we were there.
Cheers Lance & Nicole! Thanks for having us : )"

Clean and comfortable. Looks exactly like the photos. I would stay here again in a heart beat."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved staying here! The place was so clean, so easy to get in and out of with the garage door, and so comfortable. The bed and bedding were lux, and I really appreciated the earplugs and white noise machine as a sound sensitive person. There was some afternoon drumming upstairs (someone must be a musician) but it only happened from maybe 2:30-5:30pm, not during quiet hours. They absolutely said in the description that there would be some daytime noise, so it was not an issue. The location was PRIME, I loved walking to the restaurants on Alberta and Killingsworth nearby. And the street parking was not an issue at all. They even left me two cookies and a bag of microwave popcorn 🥹 A lovely stay and I will be back!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lance and Nicole have really gone above and beyond and set a new standard for how incredible an Airbnb can be! You can feel the love and consideration that has gone into every single detail. I love the Alberta Arts District and hope we will be able to stay here again next time we are in town.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, clean, private space. Hosts were helpful with questions. Would stay again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The hostesses with the mostest. Lance and Nicole are the best! You won’t regret your stay here.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Lance and Nicole’s place was perfect for our one night stay in Portland.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place!
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pros: Clean and affordable. I have lived in Portland before and would say this neighborhood is extremely safe and fairly central to getting around. Street parking was easy each day. Entering through the garage is easy and there are multiple door locks once you are in the bedroom.
Cons: I read and understood in the listing that they have two young children however that is understating the noise level. I heard footsteps, conversations, and the sound of kids playing throughout the late afternoon and evening on my first day and in the morning and later evening of my second day. The bed does not have a headboard to sit up against and hard dining chairs are the only other place to sit. The listing photos are very bright but in reality the space is not well lit and there is only one small window above the bed with a view of a fence.
Overall a decent Airbnb option for a 1-2 night stay."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lance and Nicole's place was welcoming and peaceful- down to the cookies and popcorn. Great neighborhood with lots of restaurants within walking distance, but I was happy to eat in because I didn't want to leave. Bed was super comfortable. Highly recommended! I hope their place is available the next time I'm back in Portland."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This Airbnb was perfect for my boyfriend and I’s one night spent in Portland. It was adorable, and the hosts left cookies and two local beers:) it was the perfect way to end a long day of traveling. Thank you for the personal touches!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a hidden gem,10 minutes from downtown. Beautiful."
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a perfect location! Easy to walk to so many great shops and restaurants, and on a beautiful quiet street. The place was a bit smaller and darker than expected from the listing (it’s a basement with entry thru the garage, and only one window) but had great decor, a comfy bed, and lots of extra touches like snacks and a choice of pillows."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Just what we had hoped for!

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place. The only thing which was well described is that it does get warm in there and one can hear furnace but they supply ear buds and a noise machine to block out the noise. Greatly appreciated !
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our stay and Lance and Nicole's was just as described and perfect for what we needed for the night. Bed and pillows were comfortable.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay! They made such great use of the space they have. Very welcoming and beautiful place.
It’s always a guess if the bed is going to be comfortable. This bed is absolutely as comfortable as they come! Loved it!
The hosts are a young, lively and playful family. Thank you for having your wonderful place available on Airbnb!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I had a morning flight from PDX and needed a place to stay the night before. I had a rainy dark 2 hour ride from home to get to their place. There was parking on the street as promised; it is easy to follow the instructions for how to get inside. The kitchen area has lots of welcoming touches like tea bags (caffeine and herbal). Everything (kitchen, bedroom, bathroom) was spotless. The bed (queen? king?) was extremely comfortable. There is a bathtub in the small bathroom, which had hot water. I love being able to have a bath when I'm travelling. I noticed the address is a short walk from New Seasons Market Concordia. The space was great for an overnight. It is fairly compact for a longer stay and might be cramped for two travellers. I feel lucky I found it when I needed it. It is a welcome refuge."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was in town for a work trip and Lance and Nicole's place was perfect! I was very comfortable and really appreciated the thoughtful accommodations, including heat vent covers, ear plugs, and pillow options. The home is close enough to Alberta that you can walk to anything you want but still on a quiet street with plenty of parking. I will definitely be booking their place for future trips."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Another great stay at Lance and Nicole’s place. Clean, quiet and cozy spot, and walkable to lots of restaurants and bars. We’ll definitely be staying here again."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The stay as amazing. Perfect space for our trip. Very accommodating, clean and had personal touches. We will definitely look to stay here again!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for me staying alone. I felt safe and not bothered by anyone
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gonna preface this review by saying my friend and I flew into Portland towards the tail end of the ice storm: frozen trees, felled power lines, icy roads/sidewalks, the whole unfortunate kit and caboodle. Despite all this, Lance and Nicole made sure the suite was clean, warm, and ready. They even accommodated an earlier check-in, allowing us to dodge even more freezing rain later that day. Location itself was ideal and central to everything we did, and the surrounding roads were so heavily trafficked we had minimal slush to worry about driving on. We could hear their family above, but it didn't bother us, and they provided ear plugs just in case. Also, the bed was probably the most comfortable I've slept on in my life. I'm rambling now. They exceeded expectations, especially given the circumstances! HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The home was comfortable and clean, offering a cozy and well-decorated setup to get some rest for the one night I was there. Instructions to enter the property were clear, and I appreciated that I had my own dedicated entrance. I would love to stay again if I had the chance!"
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very lovely place very clean i felt right at homeb
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great stay! The place was easy to find and they had detailed instructions that made our self check-in a breeze. Everything inside was clean and well organized, while remaining a cozy space for our family, during our one night stay. They had a book of recommendations for restaurants nearby, we were able to enjoy a nice walk to one for dinner! Thankful we found this spot, last minute for us, and thank you to Lance and Nicole for providing a safe space for our family!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is in a great location, super walkable to Alberta Street, which has great restaurants and locally owned shops. There are bikes to rent nearby as well.
The bed is SOOOOOOO comfortable! The sheets and blanket were super soft and cozy. The bathroom was very clean and had everything I needed. I even took a bath on a cold day.
Check in was easy, the directions were well thought out, and I felt I had my own private space."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved it!

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Awesome place, great price, hard to beat!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I can’t recommend Nicole & Lance’s place highly enough! Everything is as described; amenities are plentiful, the bed is comfy (and big!), and everything has been very well-thought out. Major highlights: The private entrance (yes, it’s actually the garage door via the nicest, cleanest garage I’ve ever seen), the hang-out space/kitchenette (with homemade cookies!!), and the private bathroom. If you are looking for a well-appointed, comfortable, tidy place to stay for one night or one week to explore Portland, you couldn’t do better. We were there for only one night to catch a plane back home, but it was a restful, peaceful night in a safe neighborhood in a beautiful part of Portland. We would definitely stay again!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little place. They really go above and beyond with the details! Would love to be back.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lance & Nicole’s place was as advertised, cozy, clean and comfortable. Everything was clearly labeled and detailed instructions provided. We really enjoyed the higher touches, like our names on the board, welcome cookies, and a binder full of reccommendations!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really loved all the special touches of your place- thank you! Lots of nice little surprises - a nice little kitchen space with a great selection of snacks, which were a nice surprise:) I loved the little sitting area and how you’ve decorated! Thanks for the Portland share as well (needed that since not at all from around here)!
Appreciate all you’ve put into your place!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our one night stay at Lance and Nicole's. A short walk to the main street in Alberta Arts district. The space was compact and comfortable. The only downside was I could not control the thermostat. Having said that my husband and I slept well and woke up refreshed.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super great place! I loved the neighborhood as well as the recommendations they left for places to eat and drink. It was super affordable and clean. The bed was super comfortable as well. I loved all their recommendations as well as the cookies they left! We felt very at home.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"loved Lance and Nicole’s place, it was clean and quaint! they were super accommodating of early check in and left us cookies!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a lovely place to stay!! We really enjoyed it and had a great time just relaxing. Super clean and cozy. If you’re young and looking to party this might not be the place for you, but it’s great just for a restful weekend."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lance and Nicole’s place was exactly as described and just perfect for my visit. It was easy to find and had everything I could need or want.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,the room is perfect and they are very good hosts. Thank you very much for everything.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great stay here. I stayed for three days, and the place is perfect for a short term stay, especially if you plan to eat out or get delivery.
Hosts provided a flexible check-in which I was beyond grateful for as I was feeling under the weather. Easy check-in. Always responsive hosts.
Location is perfect for walking to all the restaurants and bars on Killingsworth. Just a short walk to my favorite cocktail bar in Portland: Expatriate!
The bed and pillows are amazinggg!! I can’t recommend enough… the best bed and pillows I’ve ever had at an Airbnb. Nice furniture in the living area also. Dining area is well stocked with refrigerator and utensils that you would need. Good WiFi. I never had an issue with upstairs noise, but it’s thoughtful that the hosts provided a white noise machine in the room!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lance and Nicole’s place was 10/10! The instructions to get inside were super easy, everything is nicely labeled, in place and organized. There was popcorn, cookies, water and beer (not sure if that was host or left but great either way!). The bed was SO COMFORTABLE. It was quiet the entire time except the last night we could hear some little kiddos upstairs but it wasn’t too loud and didn’t go too late. It’s not a LOT of room but it was perfect for us because we just needed a place to sleep and get ready. Location was great, I was able to walk 5 minutes and grab some ramen one night with ease. They were super responsive when I had questions, and I’d honestly recommend this cute little spot to anyone who needs a place in Portland."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Met the Nicole outside as we both pulled up at the same time making sure we were parked correctly & entered the airbnb how we were supposed to and she was super nice! The place is easy to enter and is downstairs from they’re main living. It is clean, very cute & private/secluded. A special touch of our names on a peg board welcoming us along w/ cookies & drinks which was a nice gesture & greatly appreciated!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hurry and book Lance and Nicole's Airbnb, you will not regret it!
Best bed I have every slept in and they have thought of every last detail for a great stay!
Exceeded my expectations!
In one of the best neighborhoods in Portland, can walk to amazing restaurants and New Seasons grocery store right down the street!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved staying at this cozy place near Alberta Street! I only stayed for one night during a work trip, but it had everything I needed for a comfortable stay. Lance and Nicole were so helpful when I asked about restaurant recommendations, and so many things in the rental were labeled with helpful instructions. For example: their heating/AC is all connected on one thermostat, so the unit doesn't have internal temperature controls. But they were sure to give helpful tips and make me aware of what I could do to stay warm/cool as needed. I would happily stay here again. Thanks, Lance and Nicole!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,place is small but we only needed it for sleep after a late flight. perfect for one person or two who don't need a kitchen. close to the airport and easy to get everywhere downtown.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,from start to finish this⁸ host pulled out all the stops. I really appreciated the early drop off service and also the late pick up on my check out day. apartment looked just like the photos and was very clean. I would recommend staying with Lance and Nicole if in town and want to explore parts of Portland. Great location and walkable safe neighborhoods and dining spots nearby to enjoy. public transportation was easy to navigate as well as many lines within walking distance.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay for what we were doing in Portland. Location was great for everything we wanted to do. Space was beautiful and clean. Very welcoming.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a nice place to stay. I loved the fact that there was a welcome cookie and treats when I arrived, and a ‘welcome’ sign on the wall. It really made me feel at home staying here. It seemed to be a super nice neighborhood but I didn’t really get a chance to check it out as my flight was delayed and I didn’t arrive til very late. Still, communication with the host was simple and they were very kind and welcoming. Would love to stay again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean! Close to good restaurants and shops on Alberta street, and easy to find street parking. The unit is long, but had everything I needed for the stay (no stovetop, but lots of food options nearby). Overall a very pleasant and comfortable stay."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean and exactly as described. Walking distance to Alberta Arts district for restaurants, stores and pharmacy nearby. Close proximity to PDX for easy commute.
Bed was comfy and sheets amazing. As informed we heard tiny footsteps above but not at all bothersome and they settled early and were respectful of noise. Nice kitchenette"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A lovely well-kept and trendy space to spend the night. The Alberta Arts District seems to have much to see and places to eat. There's no dedicated kitchen, but a kitchenette puts it on par with hotel rooms. The place felt clean and upscale. Personal touches and some complimentary snacks made this place a winner."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had an amazing stay, bed was super comfortable and the whole space was super cozy and nice. Would definitely stay here again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Extremely cozy bed and good size sleeping area disconnected from a cute little nook for getting your work done. The two spaces are separated by a door so that you don’t bother your partner.
Bathroom was beautiful!
This place was in a great location! My husband and I walked throughout the neighborhood very late at night without issues. The bar scene on Alberta Ave was just what we were looking for!
The entry to the space is through the garage. While a bit off putting at first (we didn’t want to make so much noise with the door!) it was actually extremely cozy and great. Super duper insulated. We were very warm all night. I can see this being a nice stay during the winter as well!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"this was a perfect place for a couple nights in Portland. extremely clean and walkable to fun neighborhood restaurants, coffee places and bars. they had many personal touches like bathrobes and fresh baked cookies. you are definitely staying below a family and can hear happy little feet running in the home above you, but this didn't matter to us. would recommend!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay within walking distance to many restaurants and cafes. Definitely recommend!!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay for us. Lance and Nicole were very accommodating, hospitable, and spot on with communicating on all fronts. Extremely cozy king sized bed.

2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The neighborhood we wanted to be in. Very clean. Bed was comfortable. WIFI was strong. Served our purpose. If it were a multi-day stay and we needed to be in the unit for extended periods of time, it would have been a little small."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Clean place and comfy bed. Perfect for a stay close to PDX and super cool neighborhood eateries and shops within a few block walk. Recommended
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great super walkable space. On a quiet street within a couple blocks from all the action. Place was clean and had some nice personal and thoughtful choices.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great time! Perfect location. All of our (great) meals were in walking distance! It’s a small unit, but we only used it for sleeping. And it’s got the all too rare king sized bed! Definitely recommend!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Couldn’t have asked for a more perfect stay. Fantastic location near so many restaurants and shops. Easy street parking and cute neighborhood to wander. They were quick to respond to questions and so appreciated being able to drop our bags early so not in our car. The space as spotless and so cute! Everything we needed and more plus little touches like cookies and drinks that greeted us upping arrival. Comfy bed and super soft sheets too. Wish we had more than one night! Highly recommend. Loved our meals at Tin Shed and Wilder!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great👍👍
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was our first time visiting Oregon and we had hopped around to 3 different Airbnb locations throughout our vacation. This is not the biggest Airbnb but it was by far our favorite. The place was nice and cozy and we really appreciated the clear effort Lance and Nicole put in to make us feel welcome and comfortable. From the cookies and beer waiting for us when we arrived to the quick response when we asked for their pack n play for our baby. For me, it’s the little things that count, and we really appreciated the hospitality. Thank you!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Enjoyed being able to walk to breakfast through the lovely neighborhood
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lance & Nicole’s place was perfect for our Portland getaway. Quiet & peaceful!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay in the Alberta area. Easy check in and great communication. Also amazing cookies left for us at check in! We would love to stay here again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful time at Lance and Nicole’s! They had everything I needed and some extra nice touches like beverages and snacks and records.
A lot of restaurants/bars within 5-10 minute walk (Alberta neighborhood) and parking was easy to find if you wanted to drive.
As others have mentioned, the family lives directly above the space but they were respectful of quiet hours and provided earplugs.
Thanks for a great stay!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lance and Nicole’s place was lovely! Private entry, clean, comfy, and hospitable. No issues with street parking right in front and easy private entry access. The cookies, beers, and water in the fridge were a nice touch. Super responsive hosts, a great PDX option."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely, brief stay. Quiet and thoughtfully appointed with everything I needed, really appreciated the signage explaining the little things around the place! Put me in just the part of town I wanted to be in at a great price, one of my fave parts of PDX. Would love to stay again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great little place. Everything is new and clean. Detached bathroom even smells new. Kinda off the grid. Wi-fi came in clutch because I didn't have service for about a 30 min radius - know where you are going! Crickets lulled me to sleep. The little patio was great for enjoying nature. It was almost 100 degrees when i was there, so they let me know before my arrival to make sure I knew what was up. I chose a few detours until the evening cool off. They had left a window fan on for me, and a 2nd larger one was ready in case I needed it, which I did. On my way out, I spent 10 minutes making sure my car I was ready to continue on my trip - they noticed and made sure I was good to go. Only thing to note is the gravel street and kinda steep kinda uneven driveway might be kinda scary to city folk. Great stay if I'm near that sparsely populated area. Totally worth it."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great, short stay in Portland on our way to the Oregon coast. This place is perfectly located by Alberta Street and it was an easy walk to everything, even with a toddler."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The perfect find for our last night in Portland. Super close drive to the airport, restaurants, and Portlands beautiful parks. The neighborhood felt very safe (night and day). Though we were a tad disappointed to find out the bicycles mentioned in the listing were no longer available for use, the great spot, great communication from the hosts, and extra little touches MORE than made up for it! We heard from our hosts right away and they were very flexible about a slightly earlier check-in. All the little details are planned out to make your stay as enjoyable as possible (freshly baked cookies and a personalized welcome sign were such nice, unexpected touches!). Top it all off with a super comfy king size bed! Would definitely recommend a stay here."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lance and Nicole’s place is very comfortable and close to the airport. Though we didn’t stay long, it was just what we needed."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lance&Nicole's place is very cozy. Feels right at home with private space. We were out and about so didn't have to deal with upstairs noise much. They did give heads up about that so it was fine. very clean, private. All the little touches they have made me feel welcome! The neighborhood was very walkable."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a great little spot close to a great neighborhood and amenities. Super clean and comfortable spot, with nice amenities and thoughtful personalized touches. The hosts were super responsive and communication was timely and informative. Would happily stay again. A+"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first stay and it was a very pleasant experience! It was conveniently located a couple of blocks away from family we were visiting for the weekend.
Very easy check in, descriptions were accurate and detailed, very clean and comfortable, with thoughtful extra touches like filtered water, cookies, popcorn, coffee, tea and beer. And it was great to have an iron available for wrinkled suitcase clothes! Also appreciated the white noise machine, as I usually like to sleep with a fan on at home.
We highly recommend Lance and Nicole’s cozy place and would definitely book again in the future."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing stay! Lance and Nicole really go all out!

We really appreciated all the extra special touches and thoughtfulness of the space. We were very comfortable, it’s so close to Alberta street, it’s quiet and overall felt very safe. We hope to be back again!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Not much to say that has not already been said.
These guys definitely know what they are doing
Definitely must book with them if you are good enough
Keep on, keepin’ on"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was perfect for our needs. Clean, comfortable bed, great shower, mini fridge, and easy parking. We love the Alberta neighborhood, there are so many great places to check out all around that area."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed at this adorable space just one night, but it was perfect and extremely comfortable. We love the area. Lance and Nicole have an amazing location, close to everything but just enough removed from the busy streets to be peaceful. We absolutely recommend this cozy getaway!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Clean. Great location. Thoughtfully prepared for guests. Some early evening and morning noise above from a young and busy family.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"small but very nice place, very modern and high-quality furnished, very large and comfortable bed, very large and comfortable bed, high speed internet, lots of little touches like beer, popcorn and chocolate bars, very friendly communication with Nicole and Lance, were there with our little daughter, worked out perfectly, highly recommended"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful space in a nice part of town. The hosts had a nice guide suggesting things to do, and had historical books about the city. They provided anything someone staying here would need, and more! Very clean, easy to get to."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lance and Nicole were great, they were very responsive and helpful. We had to check in very late and they were understanding and okay with it. Very comfortable and clean place to stay. I felt like we were staying with family, that’s how easy and laid back everything was. The area was great, close to many cute places to eat and shop. Would stay here again any time! Thank you so much for providing anything we could need and more, you both went above and beyond!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was my first time booking with Airbnb, Lance, and Nicole have set the bar high! This was a wonderful experience and I hope to book with them again next time I am in Portland."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nicole and Lance are perfect hosts - their cozy little place made the absolute difference to our stay in Portland. Easy to navigate to from the Interstate, easy to find a parking spot on the street, easy access. Beautiful and calm neighborhood, bars, brews and restaurants on Alberta St just 5 minutes walking distance, as well as a TriMet bus stop for the bus downtown. Question is, why go downtown these days (except for Powells Books maybe) - stay in the Alberta Arts instead!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Convenient location to the airport and nice space.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Lance's and Nicole's space. It was cozy, clean and comfortable. Very walkable as well! I would definitely stay here again."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The bed was comfortable and the location was great! I want to note that there was more noise than we anticipated given the description and previous reviews. The white noise machine was clutch, and we were able to sleep fine using it, but if you are looking for a quieter place, I would suggest you stay elsewhere."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We could tell Lance and Nicole put a lot of thought and care into decorating and furnishing their place. There were several thoughtful touches that made it cozy and functional. The king-size bed was extremely comfortable and the private entrance was nice. We also appreciated the cookies and treats!
The neighborhood was quiet, and we walked to one of several restaurants nearby. We also liked the proximity to the airport!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a very great stay! Very attentive hosts and at a great location
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommended Alberta gem! Spotless, clean, comfortable, fantastic location, friendly and responsive hosts—Lance and Nicole’s place just checked all the boxes for our small family (2+toddler). Would love to come back here again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lance and Nicole’s place is wonderful! It is tastefully decorated and very clean! It was the perfect place for us, as we were not cooking or in need of a full kitchen. We loved the fresh baked cookies and snacks which were left for us. Lovely place! We will most likely return at some point!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lance and Nicole's place is perfectly located in the Portland area and they were sweet enough to leave us some home baked cookies :) Hands down one of the top 10 cookies I've ever had. Thanks again for your hospitality!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This Airbnb was perfect for our family! Everything was very clean and organized. Definitely worth the cost, as we found it to be more comfortable than a traditional hotel. The one thing I forgot on our short trip to Portland was a way to charge my USB devices, but luckily they had a way for me to charge it there! Also very thankful that the owners were so responsive and helpful! They answered questions I had in regards to commuting places honestly. Overall this place was perfect and we had a lovely stay. Thank you, Lance and Nicole!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely place to stay in the heart of the Alberta district. This airbnb had everything I needed for my stay. Accessing the air bnb was easy. For being a hot day outside, I was pleasantly surprised that the unit was cooled down when I arrived and felt comfortable throughout the night. The space was very clean and matched the photos. The snacks, tea, and coffee available were a nice touch. The binder full of recommendations for local restaurants was very helpful. Thank you so much Lance and Nicole!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a great time staying in Lance and Nicole’s place!!! Area is super nice and entry was easy!!! They left snacks and clear instructions on where things went!! They were kind and not loud at all! It felt like they weren’t even there!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Would absolutely stay here again. I appreciated the little things, like a cookie waiting upon arrival and the white noise machine by the bed. As other reviews say, the neighborhood is very walkable and a short drive to the waterfront. Highly recommend taking a bike tour of the city with Cycle Portland (request Piers!). Nicole was very responsive and helpful. Can't wait to visit again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"AMAZING HOST!!! this was my very first solo trip, and i felt very well informed and incredibly safe!! wonderful space and in a great neighbourhood! such a great neighbourhood that i was able to go on runs alone. very close driving distance to every other portland hot spot as well!!"

Their place provides wonderful access to all of the dining, entertainment, and travel needs you may want. My wife and I are looking forward to our next opportunity to stay here again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lance and Nicole’s spot is located in our favorite neighborhood - close to Alberta, Williams, Mississippi and more. Street parking was always available, check-in/out was easy and the entire place was very clean. As noted in the description, we could hear quite a bit of noise from upstairs neighbors but it did not bother us and earplugs are supplied. The bed was very comfortable and the dimmable lighting was something we really appreciated. We would book again!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A really great little place to stay. This is my second time staying at Nicole and Lance’s Airbnb. I absolutely love it. I will definitely return.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had a fantastic stay at Lance and Nicole’s place. Great location, plenty of parking and easy check in. Short, easy walk to tons of restaurants and pubs. Cozy and comfy bed, and the entire place was clean and spotless. Would absolutely stay here again next time I am in town."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We adored this place! Easy check-in/-out, a binder-full of local sites and restaurants for every adventurer, a cozy bed with lovely linens, stocked toiletries and snacks, and many thoughtful touches - Our favorites included the magnetic vent covers and the bedside lamps; we loved the latter so much that we ordered a pair for our own home before we left! Perfectly located for exploring Portland and surrounding areas. We could not have asked for a better spot and hope to come back again the next time we're in the city."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a cute space and very close to the airport! The space was spotless and had everything we needed for a quick over-nighter. They really make good use of space, and that bed is way too comfortable, we almost couldn’t get up for our 7am flight. Tons to do around the area and they provide a bunch of recommendations in their guest book. Would definitely recommend Lance & Nicole’s!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a great, cozy spot in a wonderful neighborhood. I really loved Lance and Nicole’s Air B&B. Everything looked exactly like the photos, and no detail was overlooked. I was especially impressed with how comfortable the bed was, especially after being on my feet all night at a concert at the nearby Moda Center. That’s a quality mattress! The place was super clean, and my hosts were responsive and easy to communicate with, as well as being very helpful. I would definitely stay here again!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lance and Nicole were always quick to respond with any questions I had.
The space was exactly as pictured and described. I felt right at home.
The neighborhood is walkable and has lots of shops and restaurants to explore. It is also close to the airport with the number 72 bus route just down the street. This bus ran every 15-20 minutes, it seemed as I walked down Alberta street.
I would highly recommend Lance and Nicole as hosts. This was my very first Air B&B experience and I am 100% going to try it in other cities based on Mr experience with Lance and Nicole."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A perfect spot for a quick stopover in Portland. Cozy bed, snacks on our arrival (thanks!!), and close to great restaurants and bars."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely recommend staying with Lance and Nicole! They have thought through any and everything you could need in the space. So many thoughtful touches and very clean space. The area is great too, so close to various restaurants and bars. I would 100% love to come back here!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is great for staying in Portland on a budget and the personal touches are always so much better than a hotel. We got in late after a 15-hour day of travel and it was nice to arrive to the most amazing homemade cookies I’ve EVER had and local beer. The bed and pillows were deliciously comfortable and perfect after a day of navigating Portland. I wasn’t a huge fan of the door for the bathroom. It has to be closed for you to use the sink comfortably and it was also difficult to navigate because there’s no surface area to place your toiletries, but also not a huge deal.
Now, the noise upstairs may be a bit more than you’d anticipate. I read countless reviews and didn’t find a single mention of this (granted I didn’t read all 500+ reviews). The listing said we’d only hear noise during specific time frames in the mornings and evenings but we were unfortunately woken at 6am the first day and 5:30am the second day. This isn’t affecting my rating because it was otherwise great."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super cute, quaint place with thoughtful touches that made our short stay after a long trip very homey and relaxing."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great stay in the downstairs unit. It was spotless, has an extremely comfortable bed and all the amenities were as described. Easy self check in and lots of nice personal touches and treats. Several great restaurants and coffee shops within walking distance and close to transit. I would stay here again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! Clear instructions and everything is labeled. The hosts have thought of everything you could need for a temporary stay and there were even delicious cookies waiting for us upon arrival
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lance and Nicole’s place was fantastic for my work trip to Portland. Super comfortable and had everything I needed. Quiet, charming neighborhood - wished I’d had more time to explore. Hope I get to stay again soon!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Thank you Lance and Nicole for making your prices so reasonable! A wonderful spot with accommodating hosts. My daughter and I totally fell in love with your place and we will absolutely be back this summer.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing little stay in NE Portland. The unit has everything you need! Umbrellas to borrow, a microwave, some coffee/tea/snacks, plenty of towels and even a sound machine for sleeping. Perfect for a couple and situated in a great neighbourhood as well. Also, Lance went above and beyond responding to a phone call late at night to help me fix our rental car. Really couldn’t imagine a better experience."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay here! Felt like we were in a hotel suite (bathrobes sealed the deal). We were greeted with a welcome sign and delicious home made cookies. Does it really get better than that?? Comfy king size bed, clean bathroom with great hot water pressure. Bigger space than we were expecting. We were on a road trip and of all the places we've been crashing, this was one of our favorites! Great neighborhood with lots to do."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place for a quick getaway!

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a wonderful place to stay! Whether you need somewhere to land to explore all of Portland, or are just looking for a spot to rest your head on your travels. I booked Lance and Nicole's place to catch some live music at a nearby venue. Everything I needed for the short stay was easily accessible. So close to many restaurants and shops. The space itself was clean, and comfortable. I was delighted by a couple of sweet little personal touches (i.e. A welcome sign, and cookies upon arrival). I also appreciate when a host leaves a few favorites/recommendations from a locals perspective, and they offer a binder full. I will be back."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was perfection for our trip to explore Portland. Plenty of space for us to work remotely and very comfortable! Will hope to stay again next time we are in the area.
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Except public transportation is not very convenient, everything is good, except you can drive yourself.But because the downtown Portland is still a bit more convenient for the bus system.The host is very responsive, a good value for money for a solo trip or a weekend stay for two people"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had wonderful stay here. The place is clean, new and cozy."
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful and comfortable room,. quiet during sleeping hours, easy to navigate and especially great garage area to store bikes."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay at Lance and Nicole's very much. The bed was comfortable and amenities were great. There was a lot of thought put into the design of the unit. We would definitely stay there again!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is great space - exactly as described in listing and the perfect hub for exploring Portland. We drove around but there’s plenty of activities within walking distance. The hosts are amazingly thoughtful. They give great instructions so finding the place and getting in/out is stress free. They also had baked cookies waiting for us upon arrival which made us feel so welcome.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a lovely stay! Their place was super cozy/comfortable and we felt right at home. Really close to the Alberta Arts District (about a 10-15 minute walk). Loved the entrance and all of the little amenities. We were able to be very central to so many fun spots in Portland and then relax at home & watch movies at the end of the night. Thank you so much!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A quiet, clean, and cozy spot! Comfy bed and great water pressure. Would 10/10 stay here again!"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice host! Very clean place! Will definitely come here next time I come to Portland!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This BNB is in the Alberta Arts District which was only 15 mins to downtown. It was centrally located, quiet little 1 bedroom in the bottom level of the garage. Clean and has everything you need from a small fridge/microwave/coffee/teas/utensils/TV etc. The only thing was trying to find street parking can be tough. If you're early and come before 6PM you can find street parking near the house but we left and came back around 11PM and had to park 2 blocks down. That's the only downside. But otherwise, nice, quiet and clean stay. Thank you Lance & Nicole!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely little spot to stay if you’re in town for convention center events, or just looking to be in a quiet and safe central neighborhood near the bus lines. As is noted in the description, this downstairs apartment would not be the right fit for late or sensitive sleepers. We were up and busy early so it wasn’t a problem. Would stay here again for my next convention!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, comfortable apartment"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Outstanding hidden little gem of a garden apartment. Great location, fabulous host!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We stayed here for a show at the Moda Center. The place was just what we were looking for and walkable to our show.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kristen’s place was a great value, and a perfect home base for exploring Portland. It was private, comfortable, well-stocked, and had good Wi-Fi, so it met all my needs!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My stay was great, walkable distance to moda center, I liked how private it is with your own space, it was very clean and comfortable. I would definitely recommend staying here I had no issues, Kristen’s instructions were very clear and was able to answer any questions."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great stay
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was recently displaced from my apartment in the area by a fire in the complex, and Kristen's place was an excellent way to feel like I still had a home in my neighborhood while I regrouped. She was accommodating with an early check-in request and was quite understanding when I was accidentally late checking out. I especially loved the full kitchen - to be able to make dinner for myself including dishes requiring an oven was a huge relief."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a wonderful stay in Kristen’s apartment. Would come back again!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was cozy and clean and the location was fun to explore! Kristen was a great host with good communication and was very nice and welcoming! Would stay again!

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and a quiet, safe street. The place was a little dirty in some areas but overall tidy and did the job. Though the host did give a friendly warning about the noise in her description, it is incredibly loud and we may have booked elsewhere had we known just how loud it was. It was a great deal for the price and if you’re just looking for somewhere to sleep and not spend anytime in the space it’s a great option."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything you need for a short or long-term stay (including an in-unit washer and dryer, and kitchen with full-size appliances). Good location, especially for getting to the Convention Center. Felt private and homey. Nice host."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kristen's place was great for a night away from home construction. She got me in quickly, and everything was exactly as advertised. The location is fantastic for exploring Portland."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kristen has a cozy and thoughtfully decorated apt. It was a great alternative to stay off site of the conference I attended. Great quality and walkable to the convention center.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As described, enjoyed my stay"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Came to Portland for a conference and this was the perfect stay. Super easy check in and out. Host was a fabulous communicator. Do read the notes — there will be footsteps but very gentle.
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice space in a great central location! Appreciated Kristen’s proactive outreach to let us know the bathroom sink would be broken during our stay.
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The host was kind and informative. The furniture was older, but it worked for the night. kitchen had everything except for a coffee maker, even Condiments in the fridge. Contact free check in. sporadic parking on the street."
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,A classic row house basement apartment. Very nice layout. The bedroom is far enough away from the living room that you're not bothering anyone sleeping. All good sized spaces. The basement floor is cold(!) but the host as put many rugs down. Bring your slippers!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute space and looked exactly like the listing!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great experience booking with Kristen!! Would recommend for a cozy lil getaway

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host and a great place
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Felt very at home here ! Thank you so much :)
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful place
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We only had a short stay, but the place was nice, clean, and a convenient location to the Moda Center (and downtown for those who like to walk). Would stay again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This spot was exactly as described in the listing. Super cute, laid out well, comfy bed and a nice kitchen area. The neighborhood itself is so pretty; it’s off a main-ish road but with quiet tree lined streets, and everyone decorated their houses for halloween! I would definitely stay here again :)"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kristen’s place was great for us.
We had issues with the bed being too soft for our backs and sometimes the noise above was rough for us, but the noise was clearly stated in the description! If you book know that there will be footsteps of kiddos upstairs, which are heavy/loud if you’ve never lived with kids. We were prepared because of Kristen’s proactive warnings in the listing. It was very quiet in the morning and at night.
Otherwise, her place was perfect. The location is perfect and close to so many restaurants in Portland. It felt very private and it was nice to wind down and relax in the space. Lots of blankets to cozy up in, comfortable couch to relax in - perfect place to chill during a busy trip."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This space was very lovingly designed and is perfect for a short stay in the city. It had everything I needed in terms of amenities and comfort!
Right down the street from the Lloyd center, it is a great space for attending conventions and events happening in the area. It’s also in a fairly quiet and peaceful area of town.
Being in a basement comes with its quirks, like little natural light and quite a bit of sound from upstairs. But the space was truly lovely, comfortable and incredibly convenient.
I would happily book this space again. Thank you Kristen!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I just needed a spot for a quick overnight while seeing a show in town, but I could see returning for a longer stay. There is a good separation between the bedroom and the kitchen, which is great if you’re traveling with someone but won’t sleep/wake at the same time. The space was spotless, comfy, and has what you need to cook or reheat a meal. Kristen was friendly, flexible, and very responsive."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice walkable distance to the convention center. It was perfect for our stay during RCCC
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to take in the city!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I knew there were children but had no idea how loud it actually would be. Had I known the extent of the stomping sound above, I would have booked elsewhere. Otherwise it was perfect in every way. :-)"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as described! Easy check-in, nice and clean, and incredibly convenient to both nearby restaurants and the Oregon Convention Center. I would definitely stay here again for a future conference!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Space was comfortable, clean, and as described…thanks for having us!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great apartment for the price! Perfect for one person or a couple. Walkable area with a few little bars and cafes.
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"There was a lot of upstairs noise during my stay. I should have read the listing closer, as I did not realize there was no AC prior to arrival. With temps some days over or nearing 100, it was really warm inside during my stay. I could only get the internet to work in the living area and not in the bedroom which was another downside as there is no television in the unit. Overall, it was still a good value for the price."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Kristen is a great host. We have a good time in Portland and plan to come back again
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The accommodation is in a semi-basement. I waked up early in the morning due to hear the children running around. When I entered the house, several spiders were living in the bathroom. I was scared, but I did my best to catch the spider."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was nice to stay in during the middle of our road trip through Oregon! Close amenities, nice neighborhood, and everything less than 10 minutes away. Full kitchen set, gated door entry were also great factors!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay - nice to be in proximity to a family when staying alone but also good privacy. Super proactive and clear instructions and really kind providing of some things one might forget as well as recommendations for easy and quick grocery locations!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I highly recommend Kristen as a host for anyone looking for a pleasant and organized stay. Kristen is a friendly, responsible, and organized individual who goes above and beyond to ensure her guests have a comfortable experience.
One of the standout features of Kristen's hosting style is her clear instructions on the check-in process. She provides all the necessary information well in advance, making the arrival seamless and hassle-free. Furthermore, once inside the house, guests will find neat and organized instructions for various amenities, such as Wi-Fi access and guidelines for using different facilities. This attention to detail makes navigating the space effortless and enjoyable.
Speaking of the space, Kristen's townhouse offers a wonderful accommodation option. The dedicated bathroom, dining area, and kitchen rooms provide guests with their own private spaces within the larger townhouse. This layout allows for privacy and convenience, giving guests the feeling of a home away"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I didn't stay long -- just one night to do a little work, shower and sleep. That said, everything went well for the short time I was there. Kristen was a great host -- quickly responsive and nice. She also had clear instructions about the property on the fridge."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great, cozy stay and very convenient. Location was perfect for walking to restaurants but also a short drive away to other places. Description was accurate that you can definitely hear footsteps from upstairs, but didn't pose too much of an issue. Would stay again!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My only reservation about writing a rave review for Kristen's place is that I want it to be available the next time I need it! My sister and brother-in-law stayed here while visiting Portland and remarked that it's the first time they've stayed in an Airbnb that is actually BIGGER than it looks in the photos. It was quiet, comfortable and in a great location -- walkable residential neighborhood with easy access to downtown, transit, shops and restaurants. Kristen was a perfect host and I plan to book here again the next time I have visitors!"
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"good location in a quiet neighborhood, within easy walk of the convention center and good restaurants"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Loved staying in this cute little place. It was clean and exactly as it looked in pictures. I loved having a washer/dryer with laundry soap and coffee provided. Within walking distance to the grocery store and several cute restaurants/coffee shop. (Highly recommend TwentySix for coffee!) Kristen was very response to messages and helped me when I decided to extend my trip. You do hear noise above you, as described in the listing, however it didn’t bother me in the least."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,An enjoyable stay all around. Thank you.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Short but great stay while in town to see the Springsteen concert. About 15-20 minutes walking from the Moda Center. Space is quiet and private, with everything you need including laundry and a well-stocked kitchen."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,very east to get ahold of. Apartment was clean and perfectly located.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kristen's place was good and comfortable, providing a welcoming environment during our stay. The bed was comfortable, and the linens were clean and fresh, ensuring a good night's sleep.
Overall, our experience at the place was positive, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable and relaxing stay in Portland city 🏙"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay for a quick trip to Portland, but also would be ideal for any length of stay as it is so close to I-5 and easily walkable or commutable to a lot of great places. Will try and stay here again!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay close in PDX .Nice historical neighborhood with walking distance to park, restaurants, and grocery. Comfortable private accommodations."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great value in a walkable part of Portland. I recommend Tiny's Coffee for breakfast and Frank's Noodle house for Dinner (super full on a Friday night, get takeout!
I was here for a conference at Bridgetown church, a healthy but moderate 15-block walk East to an energetic, welcoming community. You should definitely check it out!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kristen it’s a wonderfully responsive host, and her place was perfect for my trip to Portland. Would love to stay there again and highly recommend."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place to land for a quick 2 day trip in a busy city! It was nice to stay in a quiet and beautiful neighborhood while being so close to the city. We were in town for a concert at the MODA, it was a bonus that we were only 5 minutes away. The host was so accommodating and very communicative, which made our stay that much better!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay central to Portland.
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Airbnb was beautiful and larger than I expected. It was very comfortable, located in a great spot, and close to some good food.
My only complaint was that my wife and I were woken up at 6am to some pretty loud footsteps and other noises, this continued until 8-9am and prevented any sleep until after 9am.
If you are looking to travel for work this is a great spot for you, if you want to try and sleep off a concert I would suggest another Airbnb."
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"It was a pleasant stay. Me and my boyfriend liked the neighborhood. Everything was well kept and organized. It was perfect space for me and my boyfriend (for just two). Only negative thing, there was no tv. However, it was a nice excuse to be more present with my partner!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Love this little cove! Kristen is very easy to communicate with and easily acomodable! She allowed me to drop off my luggage early while waiting for the room to get clean. I greatly appreciated it! Parking was a breeze and the neighborhood was lovely to walk through during autumn. So many lovely color changing trees! Would love to stay again whenever visiting Portland in the future :)
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,positives: Loved the decor and warm cozy vibes. Internet was good. Kitchenette area was small but functioned well. Close to lots of restaurants and bars.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My partner and I needed a place to stay short notice. I was so happy I found this place! Easy to get to, close to our destination, and very homey. I would definitely stay here again!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot and location! Enjoyed it a lot. Everything you need is available.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely little space in a nice neighborhood, within 2-6 blocks of buses, street cars, and light rail which was super convenient for us as we did not bring a car. Space was very clean and cute — instructions were easy to follow. This was not an issue for us but to note, the unit itself is basement level so you need to take about 4 outside steps down to get to it. Highly recommend anyone to stay here!!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect spot for Moda events, and public transportation is close walking distance for longer trips."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place for me.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved staying here! The unit is very clean and plenty of space for 2 people. Kitchen was stocked with everything you’d need to cook a meal. Bathroom was clean and well kept. The bed was very comfy! The host, Kristen, was very responsive and helpful with checkin! The unit is in a nice quiet neighborhood and has a lovely little patio outback to enjoy morning coffee! Great spot in Portland!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay, highly recommended!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was as advertised, easy parking on the street, clean and clear instructions for checking in and out. It was a great place to stay while in town for a wedding."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Exactly what we needed!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I highly recommend staying here. Super clean and very responsive host!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great place! Clean, as pictured, and homey. Perfect for two people. Proximity to fun things to do in Portland is great too. Host was awesome, communication was fast and effective. Stay here or miss out!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I cannot rate Kristen highly enough. My husband and I had an expected issue arise while we were in Portland. Kristen was very kind, and highly supportive of anything she could do to help us out while we were there to help make things easier.
Kristen's place was in a perfect location and really well appointed. I thought that is would potentially be too hot with the 100 + degree days we had while I was there. She sent through tips and tricks to help out, and the apartment itself stayed at a good temperature.
It was easy walk to the local Safeway and local cafes, and public transport around Portland and to the airport is a short walk away. The neighbourhood is very leafy and pleasant, and I felt safe walking around.
I would not hesitate to stay again, and also to recommend Kristen to anyone else I know going to Portland."
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, we had a good stay in the Kristen’s apartment. It is conveniently located in a quiet neighborhood close to the A/B StreetCar loop stops, and has everything one needs for a comfortable stay. As noted in the listing, you can hear sounds and footsteps from the apartment above, but this was not a problem for us, since our sleep schedule was not too different from that of the hosts living above. The apartment is in a daylight basement and is not as bright and sunny as one may think from looking at the main photo in the listing. There were mosquitoes outside the entrance door, and we had to make sure we enter and leave the apartment fast, so that we do not let many of them in."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kristen is a great host, communicating clearly and providing everything needed. The apartment is clean, comfortable, and quiet. The apartment is convenient to the convention center, which worked for me (at half the pice of a hotel room) and other parts of East Portland, although the immediate neighborhood is a little lacking. But if you don’t mind a fifteen minute walk or short car ride, the location is just fine. Best perk: an iron and ironing board!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Quiet and clean space in Portland. Would love to stay here again!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great Place to stay!

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place in great location.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a private, convenient, safe, well-equipped, spacious yet cozy place for a traveler. I definitely want to stay here again the next time I visit my son."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great Airbnb.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Adorable apartment that suited us perfectly. Love the little outdoor breakfast nook.

Would definitely stay again and recommend it for anyone visiting Portland."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay. Kristen is a great host and operates a very nice, clean Airbnb!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy basement suite in historic Irvington neighborhood, an easy 15 minute walk to the Oregon Convention Center. Kristen is concerned about the little details that make a big difference, such as making sure that the provided bath products are sustainably sourced and free of allergens and dyes that could potentially irritate a guest. I would not hesitate to stay here again while visiting Portland."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet neighborhood, everything you need. Kristen was a great communicator and even made the place extra cozy for my late night arrival :)
Tip: if you are a light sleeper, keep in mind that this unit is below the main unit so you may hear tiny footsteps in the morning running across the ceiling from the space above. Lol"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We couldn’t have asked for a better location or price for our Portland trip. Kristen was super helpful with recommendations that helped make our trip even better. The apartment is located close to so many major transit networks we were able to get around the whole city easily just using public transit! Sound travels in this apartment, but the footsteps above were no problems for us! Just don’t try to do late night laundry like we did, we canceled our load until the morning because it was way too loud, we were afraid we would wake the host’s family! (The laundry machines were so appreciated though!) we would love to stay again"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent space and host! thanks
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"There was some rather early-morning noise upstairs, but it was well-stocked with terrific amenities, and situated in an amazing location. Overall, it was a great stay!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy space in a very lovely neighbourhood, plus walking distance to Moda centre. Would stay here again!
The host was very responsive and helpful.
We also enjoyed adjustable heating (as the weather was uncharacteristically cold during our stay) :)"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This spot was perfect for a few day staycation! I was able to work from the Airbnb during the day, and was very cozy in the evenings. Kristen was super quick with communication!"
2022-03-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a nice place and good location but I only rated it 3 stars because I felt super uncomfortable while showering. There’s a window you can look out (or into) while showering that has no window film or anything similar. Having a full-size mirror would also be something great to add, it wo"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice place, easy to check in and great location."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent place to stay! Kristen was very communicative and the apartment is cozy and comfortable. The location is within walking distance to the Moda center and many bars and restaurants.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kristen's place is lovely! It's in an old, quiet neighborhood, but close to a lot of coffeeshops, eateries, retail, etc. For a basement apartment, it's surprisingly full of natural light. It's a wonderful place to stay."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Kristen’s place was perfect for my trip in terms of amenities, location, and comfort. While it’s not ideal for afternoon naps or sleeping in due to noise upstairs, I would still recommend it for those who are active during waking hours."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Kristen’s place is comfortable and in a wonderful part of Portland. Everything about my stay was quite easy. I’ll consider staying here again.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cozy place in a good location right by the Moda Center. Perfect for a quick weekend trip to watch a Trailblazers game!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice stay and a perfect location near the moda center
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kirsten is a superstar host, and her place is affordable, conveniently located, and super cozy and inviting. Kirsten was communicative and helpful at every step of the process of the stay, and I would definitely recommend her. 10/10!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Kristen was such an amazing host, easy to communicate and very kind.
Everything was clean and organized.
Very cozy place to stay:)"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Kristen was fantastic and super accommodating! She took care of everything and was very quick to respond. Enjoyed the stay and would come back again!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Very comfortable during our month-long booking. The apartment has everything you’ll need for longer stays. Kristen is incredibly communicative and accommodating.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Perfect spot to enjoy the Portland area without the hustle of downtown, but easy access to it"
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful spot: cozy, centrally located, nice neighborhood, great host. Only downside was poor sleep due to bad mattress. Lumpy and sinks in the middle. Maybe okay for one person? We were really happy with everything else."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,This is a nice basement apartment that is nicely decorated and with a well equipped kitchen. If you like to cook you’ll find what you need. There’s a nice patio outside. There are indigent people nearby just like in most areas in Portland. The host was great at communicating! And very friendly and welcoming.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cozy and clean space. Kristen was also able to respond very quickly to any questions we had before and during our stay.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Although this was a basement apartment, we found it to be very cozy. The plants on the little back patio made for a nice view. Irvington neighborhood is quite charming, and very walkable/bikeable to restaurants on Mississippi, Williams, Fremont etc. Great communication from Kristen."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little place.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in Portland! Small and simple but very cozy and in a nice neighborhood. 100% would recommend to anyone.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Kristin's place is located fairly close to the MAX (10-15 minute walk) and to the Portland streetcar (5-10 minutes). It's a quiet and nice neighborhood not too far from lots of nice restaurants near the Williamette.
The suite is clean, bed comfortable, with a stove and washer/dryer. Kristen was very helpful and accomodating during checkin and checkout and I enjoyed my stay."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Inviting in Irvington was a great place for us to stay for 3 months this winter. The apartment has all the amenities you need for a comfortable long-stay. Conveniently located to restaurants, grocery, etc. and parks! Really cute neighborhood if you indulge in exploring. Kristen is amazing at communicating throughout the booking & stay."
2020-10-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"Wonderful location and apartment! The apartment was very comfortable and had absolutely everything we needed. Me and my friend were without a car but did not have an issue getting around at all. There is plenty to walk to as well as multiple biketown racks and bus stops near by. Although we very much so enjoyed our stay, the noise from above exceeded that of the described “occasional footsteps and family going ons.” At times it seemed as though there was deliberate stomping going on above. The average sound level throughout the day itself was louder than anticipated as well. It was not ideal for me and my friend as we were college students doing schoolwork. However, the noise level was not a concern during sleeping hours. I would not recommend if you have any work or school obligations requiring quiet."
2020-10-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"We stayed in this apartment for 3 months during our summer in Portland. Since the apartment is in the basement (half underground) it does stay cool for the summer months which is good since there is no AC, but the lack of light was really challenging for us. We work from home and the internet wasn't always as strong as we needed it to be for video conference calls. Also, the apartment is stocked with all of the appliances and cookware you would need but there is no counter space to cook. Also, we like firm beds so the soft mattress that is there that caves in in the center was uncomfortable to us. On the bright side the shower pressure is fantastic and Kristen is an amazingly hospitable host!"
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was cozy and conveniently located. We enjoyed our stay!
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Good price, exactly as pictured."

2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kristen's place is very welcoming, clean and has everything what we needed. It is very close to the good restaurants yet very nice and quiet neighborhood. We loved it so much!
We were with our 3 months old daughter and it was her first overnight trip but it worked out great.
We hear some footsteps from upstairs but didn't bother us at all.
Thank you for sharing your cute place, Kristen! :)"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We booked this very last minute. Kristen had excellent communication and gave us awesome info on local spots to check out. The space was very comfortable, stylish, and clean. I would definitely recommend Kristen's space and would like to stay again."
2020-02-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"This place was so cute and convenient!
The only down side I would say is that this room/stay is a basement so that means the owners are above you. They were some early birds so I could hear them talk and run around the house very clearly.
Other than that everything was great."
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay with a larger space than I expected. I was only here for a show so didn't spend that long in the actual unit, but it was perfect for a quick stay in Portland. Host was very communicative and friendly."
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful stay, they were very accommodating. I would recommend to friends and family anytime!"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place! A friend and I needed a spot to decompress and regroup while exploring Portland for the weekend, and this was perfect. It's a quick Uber to the Pearl district but conveniently located to get anywhere in Portland."
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kristen's place is in a great location and really easy to check in to. It's a private basement unit with a full kitchen, bathroom, and washer/dryer units. Kristen is a great host and responded quickly to all my messages!"

2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a comfortable, clean, affordable apartment in a great neighborhood in NE Portland. Super close to everything, and walkable to some decent restaurants, shops and amenities. Having lived in Portland for an extended period of time, I find this to be the perfect, convenient location. Check-in/check-out could not be easier. Highly recommended for solo travelers or for a couple who seek convenience and affordability."

2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kristen’s place was great! Check in with super easy and all done on your own time. The house was super clean and cute. I really liked having the outdoor patio which light in a lot of natural light. Also the house was equipped with a full oven, fridge, and toaster. It’s always nice to have the option to cook. There is a very comfy chair in the living room which is great for getting work done. The neighborhood is safe and very quiet. Close to everything and all around a solid place to stay!"

2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Couldn't ask for better.

2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home is very cozy and has a lot to offer. Plenty of basics in the kitchen and restroom is fully sufficient for your basic needs. The downside is the neighborhood is in a place where it doesn't feel safe taking public transit at night and walking home (so if you drive it's okay). Otherwise, I'd still come back here because it's a great place!!!!"
2019-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Nice space! The walls are thin so we could hear pretty much everything going on upstairs. But other than that it was a clean place and convenient location.
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Kristen was very quick to respond and communicative when we had a delay for our check in. Very easy to feel at home and everything was where we expected to be. Would recommend to our friends!

2019-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful place with a wonderful host. Kristen was incredibly helpful and responded very quickly. It was a comfy experience at a great location. There is some audible activity from upstairs in the morning, so do be aware of that."
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kristen's place was my home away from home. This cozy garden apartment is well appointed, clean, and very private. Kristen was an excellent communicator throughout the process. Descriptions are accurate an self-checkin and checkout easy as pie. I am coming back next time I am in Portland. If you stay there, treat yourself to a run in the neighborhood north and east from the place. It had spectacular fall foliage in mid-November."

2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location to downtown and very clean
2019-10-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"A lot of things about this place are great. Space, furnishings, privacy etc. As long as you sleep from 11:30 -7 it will work out well. Outside of that, even with earplugs, it’s too loud. Also it’s pretty clean, but not sparkling. Host is nice and super communicative."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good place
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bob’s apartment is clean and the bed is comfortable. The entryway/stairs do have a weird smell. The apartment is pretty barebones. Old linoleum, spare furnishings, but clean. For the price I feel I could have done better."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed staying at Bob's. Very cute airbnb that had everything I needed, and in a very safe walkable neighborhood with lots of great food options all around!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Bob was amazing, came in early and hadn't planned for it, flawless booking, and quickly started communicating with us. The unit itself was beautiful. Favorite part was the little windows seat and the sunshine through the windows. Thank you!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved staying at this place. The apartment had everything we needed.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location near lots of restaurants, shops and other city amenities. We stayed one night in Bob’s apartment after a friend’s wedding. This was a good landing spot for us to get some rest after a beautiful ceremony. Some older finishes, but the functionality we needed was there. We were able to get right back on the road in the morning because of the proximity to I-5."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute place, loved the decor. Decent area in Portland. The only problem I had was there was basically no outlets that I could find. The tv was in a power strip that was completely full and I had to use the outlet in the bathroom. However, the art was nice and it was a peaceful stay. Neighbors are quiet."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and were in town for a wedding and this was a great relaxing space for us. Cute, quiet neighborhood, and very walkable to some favorite food and beverage spots. Bob was easy to reach and we had a really nice weekend!"

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"A good place to crash if you're doing something at Revolution Hall... you could speed walk there in 45 seconds. This is an older place that could definitely use a refit and update of entryway (carpet, smells) and various fixtures, electrical, etc. But everything worked and it is in a good neighborhood and very convenient!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Apartment was as advertised. Bed was wonderfully comfy. The heater was a beast so we nice and toasty! Parking wasn't difficult, although the signage on the street was confusing and we were a little paranoid of accidently parking in a timed spot. Definitely recommend overall!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great spot if you plan to be out and about most of your stay and are looking for simple value in your stay. Everything was clean & organized, no noise from neighbors, street was clean, parking not available but we found street parking on the main road a few blocks away. Is up a steep flight of stairs which was no problem for us but maybe should be noted if you have anyone with accessibility issues.
Overall a perfect spot for our one night quick stay!
Thanks Bob"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at Bob's place for two nights as I was attending an event at Revolution Hall. Would recommend staying for this purpose. It was great to have such a short stumble home.
The bed was very comfortable and the location was perfect!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The apartment and listing itself was awesome, no complaints! The only issue I encountered was lack of parking but what do you expect? It’s Downtown Portland!"

The kitchen has everything you need including Keurig coffee pods. The heat works really well and kept us warm at night. The bathroom is clean and the shower is nice. The bed is super comfy with lots of pillows. We slept great! The location is really great too. There’s lots of places to eat and bars near by, as well as public transportation. Really nice part of town and we felt safe even at night. We would definitely stay again next time we are in Portland."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay here. Central neighborhood and there was ample space in the studio for a solo traveler. Bob was very communicative.
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great experience overall. Due to the location, it has more of a local feel to it instead of tourist feel, which was nice. Still, it was easy to get to other places with public transport."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,No complaints! Walkable location but secluded and quiet at night. The place was clean and check-in/out was super easy. Great price/location for this area of Portland. Would definitely stay again.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you will attend an event at Revolution, it would be foolish not to stay here. We love to visit Portland and this place gives us easy access to downtown while also being a quiet escape. it's also just a few minutes walk to many great dining and brewery options that are worth a visit."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I stayed in Portland for four days. the house has a lived in feel, and gave it a sense of comfortability when it came to settling in. you'll be staying at fourplex, with what i assume are 3 long term residents. Throughout our stay we didn't have any run ins or incidents with the other tenets, which is nice if you want peace and quiet during your stay. The room has a cozy feel to it. it is nice and clean and you can tell the host tries his best to provide you with a great experience. If you have a car or are renting a car like we did, there is street parking, we we're always able to find parking nearby our airbnb."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved it!
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,This had everything we needed for our stay in Portland! Were able to walk to lots of places pretty easily.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great Portland spot for a couple! It’s basically the size of a suite hotel room with the added bonus of a kitchen. Bob was a great communicator and I have no complaints on the place itself. I would stay here again.
2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean room and safe around the house!
But I couldn't sleep because the air conditioner didn't work at all.Maybe it was bad timing because there was a heatwave coming."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Easy Check in. Place was as described and was pretty decent for the asking price per night. wish check-in time & check out times were adjustable.. or maybe just different all together but it was a peaceful place within an okay hood..
2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location in Portland. Lots of great restaurants and bars in walking distance.
The place felt like it could use some updating and the stairs up to the unit had strong smell. Perhaps something to do with the washer and dryer in the foyer. Strong cleaning chemicals smell in the unit that took a few days to air out. Window AC unit also needs a little love.
All around a cool little spot that could be way better with some love and care."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It's in a quiet neighborhood with most coffee shops, restaurants and great walking all within close proximity.

The parking was very convenient and Bob was very quick to respond and recommend places to eat or things to do!"

The apartment was very quiet; overall it was a great value."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a perfect spot for my friend and I to crash overnight while visiting from Seattle for a show. It was walking distance from the venue and a super quick Uber to some amazing restaurants and good eats. Will definitely keep this spot in my back pocket for future visits!
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We had a mostly great stay at this Airbnb, although when we arrived during the normal check-in time the cleaning company was still there and the room was not even close to being done. We weren’t able to settle in when we arrived which was pretty frustrating. Also there is a very strong urine smell in the hallway leading up to the apartment and I noticed a lingering urine smell in the apartment as well. When I messaged the host about these concerns his response seemed automated and not personalized to my concerns. Other than that it was a great location, very clean space and perfect for a one night stay for us. Definitely wasn’t the best Airbnb experience I’ve had."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"There wasn’t wifi, seemed like maybe there was an issue with it. Everything else was great! Thanks again"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at this Airbnb! The location was perfect - walking distance from lots of food, coffee and vintage shopping, yet nestled on a quiet and peaceful street. The host was incredibly welcoming and maintained great communication throughout our stay to make sure we had everything we needed. We had an issue the first night with the AC and Bob took care of it ASAP. The room was clean and cozy with a kitchen for basic meals and coffee. Overall, I would highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a comfortable, welcoming, and centrally located place to stay. Thank you to the host for making our trip so memorable! :)"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Bob’s place was a perfect place to crash for a quick work related trip. Bed was insanely comfortable. Would definitely stay again.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice location with lots to do. Easily accessible from PDX by public transport. Bob was extremely helpful and responsive. Looking forward to staying at one of Bob’s locations again.
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Cozy bed, place was just as pictured, quiet, nice hot shower were the pluses! We were a little upset about the parking situation as it was stated there was free parking; it is timed 90 min parking right outside the house until midnight (rest of the area timed also), so we had to move the car several times and hope we could find a spot for overnight somewhere unzoned (we did but a few blocks away). The Keurig didn't work in the morning, and there was only one coffee cup (after try 3 it worked for one cup then stopped again), no manuals for the tv or heater so we had troubles figuring that stuff out - it was a pretty frustrating experience tbh. We messaged the host once about parking and although he was quick to respond, we felt like he didn't know what listing we were at (stated there was parking out front, never answered about coffee, so we didn't ask more help), and that also bothered us because we thought we were staying on property he also lived on (that's our pref for BnB's)."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Bob’s place was great! It was very clean and Bob was communicative and responsive. Would recommend!
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"this was a great spot for a quick over night in Portland! It put us next to great food and beverage options, all within easy walking distance! The only downside is that parking was difficult to find, as we arrived after 5pm, and most of the street parking available in the area was for residents only or 90min max. I would suggest getting there either prior to end of day for most workers to avoid having to park further down!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean room and a communicative host! I nice basic place to stay.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely experience at Bob’s stay. It was perfect in a peaceful and safe area. I definitely would return the next time I visit Portland. Thanks Bob for the ease of checking in, communication and hospitality!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved this stay, fresh bedding and clean towels. Would book again!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Bobs place was very clean and in a great area! His space was exactly what we needed for our visit i portland! He was a great communicator and answered all of our questions in a timely manner! Would stay here again!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything was perfect. The studio is nicely decorated and clean. It’s perfect for a quick place to stay for a night. Only thing that was annoying was parking. The first time I got there I was lucky to see parking right in front of the studio entrance,perfect. The second time, not so much. I had to park 2 blocks away and out of fear of it being to far and possibly towed, later in the night, found one in front of the studio as well.
Overall, everything was perfect. Just wish there was a designated parking for the individual.
Would recommend 100%"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was great and exactly as described. Clean with all the needed amenities. The host was super responsive and helpful! We are also super picky on beds and this bed was amazing!! We slept great! Overall great stay. Only downfall is parking is hard to find but that is typical in Portland!
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"There were many great things about this place. It was clean, reasonably priced, and Bob was quick to respond to questions. There are a few things that should be noted. Finding parking was difficult, the streets were full and signs show a residential permit was needed to street park. The neighborhood at night was questionable (for solo female travelers). I understand Bob can’t change these things but I thought it would be worth mentioning to others."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I had tickets to the comedy club and were wanting to go to the local putt putt place and restaurants so we’re looking for a place to stay locally. This was a great place, close to everything, clean, comfy bed, easy to get in and out. Host was very responsive and friendly 😊"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tons to within a stones throw of the rental. I wish I had more time to check out more music and explore the neighborhood more. Look for Old Town Music Store for tons of Keyboards, Guitars, more. I found some great live music spots at Revolution Hall (actually got to play at a jam session with other outstanding musicians) and Goodfoot Lounge (which had a dirty dance floor that people weren’t afraid to use). Nice food choices as well. I went twice to Danwei Canting (Asian Fusion). I really enjoyed my stay.
My only small concern is the place was a little dusty and the carpet could use a good shampoo. I went to do some stretches and didn’t want to lay on the carpet too much.
Great host that ask if everything was good through my visit. Can’t wait to come back.
Sincerely-
A Foodie Musician."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay at Bob’s. It was very comfortable for 2 people and I was really impressed by how well the heater worked. Perfect location for walking to a bunch of different restaurants.

I felt safe, the bed was comfy, and the shower, amenities, and kitchen were just perfect for a solo business traveler's needs. Thanks, Bob!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Bob was very attentive and able to help with any questions; the room is very nice and in a great location.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I’ll definitely be staying here again next time I’m back in Portland!
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location was great! Very walkable area and close to a bike station. The mentioned smell in the hallway did seep into the apartment making it difficult to get comfortable. The apartment is large for a studio and very tidy. There are stains in the carpet, remotes and shared surfaces seem like they haven’t been sanitized/cleaned. Awesome recommendation book but also stained and needs a wipe. Shower had strands of hair from previous guests. I would recommend for a short stay but probably won’t be back myself."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a nice, clean, reasonably priced Airbnb. Close to the Amtrak train station, and not far from Portland International Airport. I really appreciate the full kitchen! You might want to take extra care after dark in this neighborhood."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stayed at Bob’s studio for a quick stop in Portland. The place was clean and comfortable. Simple amenities but great value overall. Loved the area and would def encourage other travelers to stay here (especially rather than somewhere downtown). Parking was no trouble.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Adorable studio apartment in a great neighborhood. You can walk to a variety of independent restaurants and interesting shops. Everything was as described. The apartment was clean and what we needed for our stay. Bob was great about communicating promptly. He also gave us an extensive list of places to dine out.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Quiet neighbourhood but close to great restaurants and breweries. Parking could be an issue if you get there after people come home from work/the weekend, but otherwise shouldn’t be an issue! Timely communication from the owner."
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Bob's place is studio apartment upstairs in downtown Portland. It was clean and well equipped. Check in was super easy. There aren't enough outlets and Netflix wasn't accessible. Bring your own coffee creamer unless you like coffeemate.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a lovely stay at Bob’s place. The bed was comfortable, the location was great, and checking in was painless."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Bob's place was the perfect launch point for our evening out. Just a block away from Revolution Hall and tons of restaurants. The place itself was clean and comfortable. We had no problem finding a parking spot on the street. Bob's communication was great too!
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Bob’s place was immaculately clean, super comfy mattress, coffee provided. It’s an uncluttered little studio with good use of space. Don’t know Portland very well and was only there overnight but the location seemed good. I would recommend checking out Revolution Hall, just a block away for the roof top bar, restaurant at street level, and music venue in between - amazing conversion of a historic high school building."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Bob's place was so conveniently located! The self-check was seamless and written instructions were quite clear. We'd definitely love to stay again.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The property looked exactly like the photos, was easy to find and convenient to access with the information given.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Bob's studio was exactly what we needed for a one night stay. He was communicative and accommodating.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The check-in was super easy, and perfect for a simple stay for me and my girlfriend. The apartment was spacious, the bed was super comfy, the A/C was great to have for hot days, and the small kitchen had basic supplies to reheat our leftover."
2022-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bob's place is in a highly walk-able location and has free street parking available. The building itself shows some age, however Bob seems to do his best at keeping the apartment in a welcoming state. There were two issues out of Bob's control that meant that we ended up reducing our stay. One issue with the utilities that Bob let us know about, and nearby smokers that disrupted our sleep. Again, not Bob's fault, and some smoke smell may not bother everyone.
Overall, if you're someone who values good walk-ability, close proximity to some of the best PDX offers, and easy check-in, Bob's place may be a good choice for you."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was a great stay! Would book again. Thanks Bob!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bob’s place was great! Exactly as listed, perfect for solo or couple travelers with just the essentials, comfortable bed and great location!

Check in was super simple and straightforward and Bob was so communicative! Would absolutely book his place again. Thanks Bob!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bob's place is in a great spot, close to everything. Similar to other reviewers, there was a bit of a smell in the building when you first enter, but it's not present in the actual apartment. Bob was super communicative leading up to and through my stay. I'll certainly look to book again if I'm in the area."
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was great! Location and apartment were perfect. Nearby lots of cafes and bars and a cute dog park. Only negative thing is a smell in the hallway that came into the room little.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay overall. Near the Hawthore Asylum food carts and Doe Donuts which were both delicious places to go to. The apartment was comfortable and overall decently clean. Bob provided coffee, creamer, and hot chocolate which was nice. Parking on the street was okay. There was less parking than expected based on other reviews, but we were able to get a spot within a block of the house each time."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and a quiet retreat.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Bob’s place is perfect for a couple or someone traveling on their own. It’s with a 10-15 minute drive of nearly any place you’d want to explore in Portland. Street parking is easy to find and there’s coin laundry available on site!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Easy to find, access to a lot of nearby bars and restaurants. Bed was very comfortable. A bit of a smell as you enter the building, but the unit itself is clean and cozy. Bob made the check in process a breeze, and was very responsive during our stay. Good price point for what we got."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Bob was very communicative and was quick to respond to any questions or concerns that we had during our stay. Cute little studio that was exactly what we needed.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,very cute little spot!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a last minute change of plans and stayed at the cottage for two nights. It was so cute and peaceful. It was in a neighborhood away from many businesses it was easy get there by bus or bike share (just a few blocks). I would highly recommend!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Very responsive host! Thank you!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This cottage was perfect. As described and so cute. Exactly what I needed. Would definitely stay here again. Highly recommended.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a little gem that feels like a country hideaway, yet near a great coffee shop and a pine state biscuits food truck. I didn't see the dog Friday, or the chickens, but I'm sure they would add to the charm.
J Brooke was very accommodating for an unexpected late check-in. I arrived after the auto lights turned off, I guess because I had a lot of trouble finding the house, figuring out where to enter the gate, which door, etc. Not because of poor instructions. They were great, including photos, but it was pitch black. Dim (or no) street lights nearby, and no lights in the yard. It was raining and I was tired. The perfect storm. That is not the fault of the host, but a simple solar motion sensor light or something of the kind would have prevented a minor mental breakdown : )
Once I got it heated, it was nice and cozy. The bedding was very comfortable. On a sunny day, I would have enjoyed sitting in the backyard drinking coffee. Recommended!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Worked perfectly for my
Needs"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent space. Excellent host. Beautiful yard and the weather was sun shiny. The dog was very shy and warmed up to me on my last day. Excellent experience!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little cottage is an oasis in the largest city in Oregon. It’s only a few minutes from the airport in a terrific neighborhood. Brooke is an excellent host, very responsive and professional. Her tiny house is perfect for a safe and comfortable base for exploring the city. Don’t think twice about reserving her place - you will love it!"
2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was too cold in the unit because the heater didn’t working the whole time. Both heaters were plugged into an inexpensive extension cord that was hot to the touch, which I told her in a note when I left, (I got no response back).
Because she asked for it to be quiet after
9 pm, I didn’t want to bother her the 2nd night, to tell her the heater wasn’t working.
It was very uncomfortable that night; and I moved the larger heater several times to
try and get it working; which it never did, for more a very short time."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was a very nice stay for the price! It was homey and cozy. The guidebook the host put together was very helpful, even for us who lived near Portland before. The place is pretty quiet overall. Friday the dog is a sweetie.
My tips for folks booking this cottage for the first time:
- We were careful to observe the instructions for using the composting(?) toilet, but you can't avoid the smell getting stronger in a space where waste matter collects in a bag. I'd suggest this place for shorter stays.
- My bad, but I didn't notice in the photos that the curtains are semi-transparent and there aren't blinds. How you feel about that depends on how public or private a person you are. I'm more private so I just want to call it out for others who miss this detail.
- There were ant visitors. Previous guests probably left out food, and colonies never forget! Some seemed to get in above the shower.
Again, still a good place for the price, comfortable and quiet!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cute and comfortable place, and Brooke was very friendly and helpful."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A+
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a wonderful and quaint cottage. J Brooke was kind and clear and responsive. We were not at the property very much throughout the day and they let us come and go easily. Would absolutely stay here again.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great cute place! Would definitely stay again!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great experience
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Airbnb fees are too high. By the time they are added on, the price is sky high. The owners are not getting enough of the money."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Brooke’s little cottage was as cozy as it could get with the birds chirping in the morning and stars shining through the tiny window at night. I love the calm neighborhood and the rural setting that it provides brings relaxation to your days which might be challenging to choose to leave the cottage.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"J Brooke's lil shed turned Airbnb was great! We really enjoyed the space and had everything a couple needed for a little vacation into the city. Privacy was great, we liked being on their property with Friday the dog, J Brooke was super nice and tried to be very accommodating. Bedding was comfortable, the space was cute and cozy and had the amenities we needed. My only recommendations to the host would be:
1. Include a bit of sawdust and lye for the composting toilet (I could see how guests could mess this up, but it would definitely help keep the smell down for those who know how to use a composting toilet).
&
2. A few more racks/hooks screwed into the walls for hand/dish towels to dry would be great.
&
3. The mirror in the kitchen is super tall, it was unusable for my partner who is 5'2"" and there was no step or anything of the like for it. Considering this is the mirror in front of the one sink you'll be using for everything, it'd be great to have it lower or angled down."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Easy last minute booking, and clear communication!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Brooke's place was very well-maintained and private. I loved the emphasis on cleanliness! She's also very ecologically minded, so the composting toilet was an awesome surprise."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Nice cottage with a rustic feel
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place with great location
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time staying here. This was the perfect hub for all we had planned in Portland and the surrounding areas. It was a beautiful and peaceful area.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A lovely stay! We enjoyed sitting out on the patio in the morning, with Friday’s wonderful company."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved the place, the host was great at staying in communication the entire time and answering any questions in a short period of time."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Super cute place.
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"A really cute little cottage in a sunny yard and the host is a good communicator. We enjoyed sitting on the porch and in the yard. The decor and the lighting inside are very nice, but sun comes through an upper window in the morning, so those who are sensitive sleepers might want an eye cover.
There were some challenges: the bed was too soft for my partner and me to sleep on without rolling into each other. The toilet did smell, and as much as we love the idea of a composting one, it affected our experience. The host sent someone to clean it but it didn't help much, with the smell wafting into the sleeping area at times.
Also, my partner's car had the gas siphoned and cap stolen our last night there. The host says this hasn't ever happened, so just be as careful as is reasonable. It wasn't quite as we'd hoped, but nonetheless, we have a good memory of the quaintness and the sunny yard, and would still recommend, especially if any of these issues can be improved."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super cozy spot that’s in a good location but still feels private. Convenient parking, and an easy drive to anywhere."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Thoroughly enjoyed the serenity and comfort inside this wonderfully quaint cottage as I explored Portland! Brooke was especially responsive and made me feel right at home.
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Sweet little house. Helpful host. Precious dog. We weren’t comfortable on the thick foam mattress, but we’re fine with the composting toilet etc."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great place in an awesome location! had everything we needed
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We needed a place to stay in town before going to the airport in the morning. Brooke was proactive, prompt in responding, and friendly. Her place is homey and private at the end of a long back yard. My 3-year-old, who's normally skeptical of dogs, immediately got hooked playing fetch with Brooke's well-trained border collie while I went for our bags. The neighborhood is attractive and familiar. We walked three blocks to a great new playground before settling in for the night. The place was holding heat in early September, and I ran a fan with the windows open. The composting toilet is 100% fine for adults, but took a little extra poop-scooping for a toddler with a micro-a**. My only ""complaint"" is that I wish there were options like this for just a little less dough. The base rate seems right, but the cleaning fee is a huge percentage for just one night. Totally the host's prerogative, though. Glad we stayed there."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved Brooke's Chicken Little Cottage! It felt like a peaceful rural retreat in a residential area of Portland. I respected her strong commitment to protecting the earth--the instructions on the app sounded a bit intimidating, but turned out to be easy to execute. I would come back any time I needed a place to stay in Portland!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super cute place. Easy check in and easy to get around Portland from. Great recommendations too!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for having my daughter over. She enjoyed her stay very much!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a lovely time! The place was easy to find and very cozy. We would love to stay again next time we're in Portland.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is AMAZING!!! so private and very quiet, which was exactly what I needed. Loved the garden and fruit trees."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful place to stay! The whole neighbourhood had so much authentic personality and I loved it. Will definitely check to see if it’s available when we come back to Portland next.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cute cabin and gracious host! Location was close to lots of Portland spots and easy to find. Gorgeous backyard as well and she offered us fresh figs! Nice spot to crash after exploring the city each day we were there.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing cute little sanctuary. Slept like a baby. Felt better than home.
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The backyard cottage was so cute, quiet, and the perfect size an amenities for what we needed. There were some ants on the counter, that was the only cleanliness issue. As well, the compost toilet is absolutely fine if that’s what you’re expecting, but it does have a small odor - there is a diffuser in the bathroom to combat this and we just kept the door closed. Super soft bed, microwave, and toaster oven were all great. Walking distance to a large grocery store. Many thanks to the host!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was an awesome little cottage in a neighborhood close to the airport! The bed was comfy and the space was clean, peaceful, and charming! Brooke was a wonderful and responsive host and I got the feeling that if we’d had more time to connect we would have made a new friend! Highly recommend!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I took a girls trip down to Portland Oregon and found this chicken cottage suggestion on the AirBnB site. We thought it was PERFECT for us, and we were right! The set up is cute and cozy, very nicely decorated and eco-friendly with the composting toilet! The bed was soooooo comfortable! The dog on the property, Friday is so adorable and friendly! There are binders and notebooks inside with a lot of suggestions to do around the area that my friend and I used daily during our trip! Our stay in Portland was so lovely and staying at this chicken cottage made it magnificent. My friend and I definitely plan on coming back and booking here again! Communication about the booking was clear, organized and stress-free! 10/10! Check out was super easy and the hosts were beyond friendly! Thank you Brooke!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed my stay! Cute place, nice location, and Brooke is an excellent communicator!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at the cottage. It was a great spot to come back to after a day out and about. We enjoyed being able to make several of our meals. The kitchen was tiny but mighty so we had everything we needed and more! Sitting on the front porch was a lovely treat as well. We also enjoyed the guest book - learning about where other guests had come from and what they enjoyed. The location was lovely too. Quiet yet easy access to everything!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely quiet spot, super clean, comfortable and peaceful! Communication and check in was clear and easy. Would happily stay here again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely place.
The listing matches its description as a Little Cottage: Rustic Cabin. The greywater system was intriguing, and I am glad I was able to experience it. The host was also very responsive to my numerous questions about how to use it properly. The place itself was very clean and neat. The dog, Friday, was adorable if not a little odd with the way she played Fetch.
I would highly recommend it to travelers who just need a place to crash and/or disconnect from daily life."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cottage is cozy and comfortable! Listening to the rain through the windows while being cozy in the big bed was wonderful. The host is very friendly and responsive as well!
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ms. Brooke was a friendly host as well as her dog, Friday. The little house sits at the back of her property next to a garden shed. The inside was very clean & as described. The bed was super comfy. We didn't realize that it would just have a dorm fridge, no freezer. We got a bag of ice & made do. We really wish there had been some sort of light at the gate into the yard; you open the gate to steps down into the yard. We came in after sunset and there was NO light. We had to walk in the dark past her house and through another gate to get to coop. String lights from her house to ours with a broken bulb in one socket, when we asked Ms. Brooke for some light she explained that they came on a dusk & went off at 10pm, so about half an HR in June. she did turn them on for us. Next night, no light. We did notice on our 2nd morn that the string lights came on at 9:30am. Walk thru weeds & tall grass to coop; mow or trim for paying guests would be nice, dog poo by porch. (Not for senior guests)"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable and cute!
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little place to stay….
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Brooke is warm and friendly. Her place was positioned amidst the peaceful presence of nature. I appreciated her flexibility and willing to accommodate my intricate needs. It was nice being at a little oasis.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely little cottage within quick distance to the airport! Thank you for the clear instructions; I loved my stay! The toilet took some getting used to but it’s easy enough to use. My only recommendation is turning up the shower temperature just a little warmer. It’s tolerable but having some warmer water would be the cherry on top. Thank you again and highly recommend staying here!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing host
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I loved this little tiny home at the far back of the backyard. Friday the pup was super friendly, and the backyard was very quiet.
There are a lot of little windows along one wall, so you can choose how much airflow you'd like. Cute little curtains on all the windows for privacy or open them to have lots of natural light. The bed was super comfortable and the sheets soft.
I'm pretty sensitive to glaring lights, which happens so often in many Airbnbs, but this place got the lighting just right. Light enough to see but also soft and golden. I didn't really use the kitchenette but it seemed like everything was there that you would need. The compostable toilet was easy enough to use for those who might be wary of something like that.
Even though this is a tiny space with the high ceiling, it felt pretty spacious.
The location is outstanding near the Alberta Arts District, and Brooke provides many suggestions on places to check out in the area. Thanks again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay here. The place is cozy, well-furnished, and the bed was so comfortable. Brooke was a fantastic host and her local recommendations were great too!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Brooke's space is a lovely and peaceful stay close to restaurants and walkable neighborhoods. The cottage is very private and tucked away on the property and their dog Friday is so sweet and greeted us as we arrived. Brooke was easy to communicate with and responsive and we really appreciated the heads up that the roofers would be making a bit of noise as they finished their work the day off our arrival. Quiet, peaceful, cozy and comfortable, you won't be disappointed with your stay! We would gladly book here again. Thank you, Brooke 🙂🏡👏❤️."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A well-maintained, clean and comfortable cottage with the essentials! Brooke was very responsive and communicative, and I really appreciated the flexible check-in. The place was easy to find and is in a very quiet neighborhood. A lot of light comes in in the morning, which I personally am partial to though a night owl may not feel the same! We stayed for one night and this cottage was just what we needed. Thank you!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cottage was super cute and cozy. It was mentioned in the listing, but the toilet is a composting toilet, so definitely expect a bit of an outhouse smell in the actual bathroom. Overall a really nice stay!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved staying in the little red cabin. The first day it rained, and it felt cozy and nice to stay indoors working online, with everything I needed close at hand. On the second day the sun came out a bit, and I was able to sit out on the porch working on my laptop and enjoying the surroundings. There were so many kinds of trees in view--cedars and junipers, pines and firs and arborvitae. It was beautiful to be in such a quiet, green place, yet still so close to the city. Finally... the bed was one of the most comfortable beds I've experienced, so I slept really well, too."

2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,It is located in a quiet residential neighborhood. The tiny house is very beautiful and I am very satisfied with the facilities.I didn't have an iron.I didn't have a host.There are many abandoned cars parked in the house next door.I was worried because I was coming from abroad.I decided to stay in a different place on the way.

Definitely would recommend if you’re visiting! Brooke was also a really kind and communicative host, so truly a 10/10 all around."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Brooke's place is a very quiet spot in a residential neighborhood that is a lot of fun to walk in. The house is small, but has everything you need to cook a good meal and relax. We found the bed, pillows and comforter to be extremely comfortable! The compostable is very easy to use, but there is a smell after a few days, which you can help by using their mist device (clove and orange essential oils are the best cover ups) and by airing out. The smell isn't present when the bathroom door is closed. We also appreciated the toiletries that smelled really good! Checking in was easy, even if we arrived late and we were happy to be greeted by Friday, the dog, every morning!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A peaceful place with feeling of community - unusual for the big city. So quiet at night - great for a good sleep.

Would definitely stay again."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very quaint and rustic! If you are looking for a cabin-in-the-woods type place, can't beat this for value! No A/C but there is a fan. Heads up on the composting toilet...might not be for everyone but if you go camping you'll be fine. I just needed a place to sleep at night and this fit!"

The host Brooke was wonderful, working to accommodate everything we asked. 5 Stars all around!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space was easy to find with directions from the host.

No-flush toilet was a little weird and did leave a slight smell despite proper usage...Still a great spot for a short stay!"

2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,The cottage is very nice and very cozy. The host did an excellent job of describing where to park and how to navigate the property. The cabin is well stocked in case you’re driving straight into Portland without stopping at a grocery store or anything. The toilet is a compost toilet and not necessarily the most intuitive design but that was the only major negative aspect of the stay.

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a lovely little gem. Great location walking distance from one of the only decent Mexican food joints I’ve been to in Portland (Pinches Burros).

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"this cottage is very cute and comfy but I'd suggest definitely not staying if you're not comfortable with a composting toilet
The shower also requires use of certain types of soap and shampoo so be prepared for that as well. there's no TV and no mirrors for getting ready. But the host was very accommodating and mostly kept to themselves. Friday the dog was also a lovely host :) The tiny cabin was clean and comfy and in a convenient location. Street parking is included. PS we did see quite a few large spiders so be prepared for those and the walk to the cabin can get a tad muddy so bring your boots for the walk to and from the car!"

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Overnight trip down to Portland to find this little gem of a tiny home. Our host was great to communicate where the key would be and if we needed anything. Tiny home had all the comforts to make our stay welcoming. Definitely will keep this place in mind for another visit.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Brooke was such an amazing host. Her communication and attention to detail was incredible. I needed a place to stay for a few hours before hopping on a cross country flight and her air bnb was the perfect, quiet, cutest place to relax for a bit and wind down. I’ve visited Portland multiple times and this is truly one of the cutest places I’ve ever stayed at."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Brooke’s place was lovely and so quaint, for such a great price! Near the city and coffee shops, etc, but definitely a country feel to the cottage and area. Loved sipping wine on the front porch in the evening, and then coffee in the AM! Highly recommend."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Mariann is an awesome host. The cottage was very private and extremely cozy. The hot tub was amazing. We had a great mini vacation and will book again in the future.
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was a beautiful , secluded spot.
Five of us comfortably shared the space and the kitchen was big enough for full meals to be cooked in :)
The host provided lots of games, water acesssoriez, towels, and even snacks and wine.
The only thing we were missing was a washer and dryer.
I will definitely come back!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This home was the perfect getaway! We loved being so close that the river. there’s no better sound!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect for what we wanted, fell in love with the place instantly. It impresses even more than the pictures so it's easy to see why it's fully booked for the next 5 months."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Loved this place. It was a perfect spot to relax and recharge. The river and cabin were beautiful.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We have to go back. Gorgeous surroundings, very nicely set up, so accommodating. Could not ask for anything more."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful stay in the woods right next to the river! Everything as described and furnished and more. And yes, the description of ""ladder-like"" stairs to bedroom is very accurate. We had to coax our dog down each morning😍 Short trips to nearby Sunset, Moulton and Lucia Falls. Loved our time there."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I had such a relaxing and beautiful stay here! The views were immaculate and there were endless thoughtful touches and amenities.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great right on the river and the views were absolutely stunning. It had everything we could need.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The stay at the cottage was wonderful. The cottage is very cozy. Being next to the river makes it great!

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely gorgeous location! We loved being right next to the river, and the hot tub was awesome. The space was cozy, loved the extra doggo considerations, and Mariann had great communication. One word of caution, the stairs leading to the bedrooms are very steep, so could be difficult if older, pregnant, or otherwise. Overall a wonderful experience for our getaway."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Is this place available and you’re debating whether to book? My advice is book this ASAP! Not only is this space absolutely breath taking it is so serene and peaceful and throughly intentional. There is so much thought put into every aspect of this rental and you will feel so at home. The amenities are amenidying, 10/10 would recommend to anyone I know. Absolutely best airbnb experience I’ve come across!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Really relaxing space!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Incredible hospitality and communication. The home was exactly what we expected and more. Could not recommend this more.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is a great little getaway for the weekend. Beautiful and peaceful scenery and the place was exactly like the photos. The hot tub with the view was a relaxing experience. The owner is very open about the stairs being steep and our dog was unable to go up and down them (but they had a pullout we were able to stay downstairs with him on)
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Highly recommend. The place was private in the woods along a river and the definition of peaceful. The place had so many amenities from coffee to wine to games to very well stocked kitchen. Our dogs loved walking around the property and getting their paws wet in the river. We took the dogs for a hike to Moulton Falls that was less than a 10 minute drive. Place was clean and easy to locate. Enjoyed the hot tub in the afternoon and views were perfect. Great weekend away to recharge! We will be back.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful home, and the surroundings are amazing. My boyfriend and I felt very comfortable right from the start. The treehouse was already warmed and lit inside for us. We loved the bedding and the awesome porches off the bedrooms. The big deck was so nice and the hot tub was the perfect touch! I still can't believe how close the water is and how perfect and clear. We'll definitely remember this home and this trip, highly recommend"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Awesome space. Great hosts. Very very beautiful. Mariann was awesome to book with!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is GORGEOUS!! So serene and peaceful. The inside had every little detail and was so cozy. We got there at night so waking up to the view of the river was INCREDIBLE. Take a beautiful drive and hike to Lucia, Yacolt, and Moulton waterfalls, then come back for a relaxing time in the hot tub. A perfect weekend getaway…soooo worth it! This place is a little piece of Heaven."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was amazing, It’s perfect for a peaceful getaway and the surrounding area is just so serene and I loved the sound of the river the whole time. I would totally recommend this place and I definitely plan on coming back. Mariann was a great host, super friendly and overall this was a great experience"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wow-
This place really felt like home! It was super cozy and the views were just amazing. There’s everything you could need for your stay, the hosts are very thoughtful.
Not to mention the hosts went above and beyond to make sure we could get to the airbnb safely during ice/snow storm & they were extremely communicative and helpful. Highly recommend this cute cabin, we had such a perfect weekend!!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Marianne was a very accommodating host. she was thoughtful, good at communicating, and reached out asking if we needed anything. I would definitely air bnb any home from her."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This river front cottage is a hidden gem! Not only were the hosts super accommodating but the actual cottage location is a dream. We went during a winter storm advisory so the power did go out for a few hours but there were plenty of candles, flash lights, blankets, and a gas fireplace. We played some of the available board games and enjoyed the time away from technology. The power outage was not the fault of the host as they had plenty of things to accommodate the down time, the only reason I bring it up is because i had no cell service or internet due to the power. All this being said, 10/10 would recommend, maybe avoid if there is a winter storm and you have to work via the internet or use the down time as an excuse to relax, I know I did! I will 100% book this stay again, thank you for the perfect getaway!"
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Awesome place! No complaints at all except the stairs were insanely steep so it was hard to get up and down for my wife that has knee issues. Due to the stairs I would look elsewhere if you are elderly, disabled or would have issues climbing ladders. The house and everything else was perfect. Thank you for everything and would totally stay here again."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Really enjoyed this vacation home and already rebooked for a summer stay! Lots of thoughtful touches and a well appointed kitchen. Mariann was very responsive and easy to communicate with. Friendly and accommodating!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a perfect time and will absolutely come back again
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,it went so well! we really enjoyed exploring the river and the cabin was so nice with the amenities! We definitely would love to stay there again during the summer!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The spot is magical right on the river, and feels private. The WiFi was almost non-existent but forced us to be present which was actually nice. Was a tight fit for 4 adults, but perfect for a couple or family you don’t mind listening to snoring and sharing a bathroom."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,loved this super cute and cozy cabin. The view was so pretty and loved the hot tub. My dog loved the private area to roam and explore. Definitely would stay again.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The home was beautiful! This is definitely a perfect place for a getaway. We enjoyed the hot tub, walked along the river during the day, went on scenic drives, etc. The house was spotless and had many useful amenities. The internet was a bit slow but it encouraged us to enjoy the moment lol. The hosts were super accommodating and were very proactive in making sure we were enjoying our stay. Definitely want to come again!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cute and private cabin. Loved the location and the hot tub was amazing I would definitely recommend this place and would love to come back one day!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is the perfect getaway for a small family. Our little dogs felt right at home. The hot tub is also really nice.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Mariann was ver attentive and the river was gorgeous!
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"This rental was a dream. It was stocked with such thoughtful ammenties . The pictures on the listing don't do rental justice.
I came for a girls trip of four and we all slept very comfortable. If you are looking for the perfect getaway, book this place."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our weekend here, and the house/location exceeded our expectations. Private, cozy, and so many thoughtful amenities. We spent our time hot tubbing, enjoying fires on the patio, and cooking in the well equipped kitchen. The nearby town is also so ideal, close to some beautiful trails and local wineries. Already planning a trip back in the summer!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Location and home were very special. All of the little details were considered. Great host and great experience.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was easily one of my favorite place I’ve stayed in. It was so beautiful and was so much more secluded than I thought. It is definitely a place I can see myself coming back to.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Amazing place!! Before we even walked inside my husband said this was the best Airbnb we’ve ever booked. Very private yet easily accessible, the views and hot tub are amazing, and being pet friendly was a huge bonus! We will be back."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Had a wonderful stay at this Air BnB! It’s cozy, private and beautiful. Would highly recommend to others looking for a peaceful getaway."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a great stay! This A-frame was the perfect place to unplug as a family and relax together! Plenty of good books for reading. Great seating for family games both inside and out. Hot tub and river views were icing on the cake. House was comfortable and had great amenities.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A cozy, welcoming cabin with an amazing setting. The hot tub overlooking the creek was 10/10, a perfect place for a romantic getaway. We spent most of our time on the deck listening to the water and birds. The kitchen was well-appointed for us to cook every night. Would highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Such a peaceful getaway by the water. We will definitely be coming back to this gem.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"what a special gem of a place! tucked away in the woods enough and feels very private. everything was incredibly clean, felt welcoming and cozy. the little details of the place make it so special.. (the wine, the coffee bar, candles, games, all the dog welcoming/goodies, all of it!)
the hot tub was amazingly hot and has a great view of the trees and the private little beach/swimming hole. yes, the stairs can be tricky but it worked okay for us.
we are booking another stay for next summer and cant wait!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"River front, woodland osasis! Very accommodating, lots of amenities, our dog loved it, we did not want to leave!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful everything! Winding drive along wooded river and waterfalls -- stopped at a couple, with well maintained trails, parking and facilities. Steep driveway, which we had to articulate to access. Ample parking with easy turnaround to exit. Cottage very inviting, as pictured, tucked into the woods with river right there! COMFORTABLE bed/bedding and couch. Fast hot water. Well stocked (groceries in Battle Ground 30 mins. out) -- plenty of coffee, seasoning + many extras -- thanks! CLEAN!! Dog friendly w/out any unpleasant odors. Gracious host. Definitely on our short-list to return to this secluded gem 💛"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The location of this cabin couldn’t be more perfect. The soothing sounds from the river can be heard from everywhere on the property (including when you’re inside) and it is incredibly peaceful. We would love to come back.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We have already shared this listing with three different couples who want to stay here after seeing our pictures. The location was beautiful and convenient. Everything perfectly matched the description and the host was very responsive. The stairs are no joke in the middle of the night and the path down to the river is a little steep; I would recommend wearing grippy shoes for both. But overall it was a wonderful stay. We hope to do it again someday. Thanks!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,What an incredible gem! We loved our stay here and can’t wait to come back.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved your cabin. Thanks for being to responsive. Cabin has beautiful and the location was perfect and private. We felt connected with nature while enjoying great amenities. Don’t hesitate to book, this is a great spot."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place in a beautiful location.
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Love Love and Love the vibes of the house and surrounding. It’s perfect for getaway trips. The house by itself was so cozy and comfortable. A lot of chill hangout spots. Have the nice clear river right next to you and the hot tub with the nice view. We would save this location and save it in favorite just in case we would love some time off from busy day again. There is a waterfall and lake that we enjoy nearby too. I can tell that the host was very caring and loving for people to enjoy the time here.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mariann decorated the entire place with attention to the smallest details!
It was very homey and comfortable. She had coffee, creamer and sugar, lots of different items, if you want to cook your own meals, and even provided a bottle of wine! There was plenty of seating, cushions, tables, etc, inside and outside too. There were even floatation devices for the water. The shower was so cute!
The home was beautiful, quiet and peaceful and the scenery was stunning. If you haven't been here, do yourself a favor and book it! I can't wait to go back."
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Very peaceful cabin. A little hard to find from the street. If you have GPS then it's not a problem. No cell signal whatsoever, but they had wifi available. We enjoyed playing in the river especially since it was extra hot during our stay, and the hot tub was a nice bonus. As the description says, very steep stairs to the rooms but we managed. Kitchen was well stocked and had everything we needed. Plenty of games to keep the kids occupied as well. It's a cabin nestled in the woods, so lots of bugs but we expected that. Just wanted others to be aware."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"If we could give this place 10 stars we would! We absolutely loved it and will be back. We relaxed in the hot tub, swam in the river with our two dogs, and read peacefully on the wrap around deck. Multon Falls Regional Park is within 10 minutes from the house and is a breathtaking place to hike. All around we had a wonderful stay."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very satisfied with this property.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a great time! Beautiful place with a lot to do and a great host! I would definitely recommend this cabin by the river to anyone looking for a peaceful/cozy getaway!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Easy to find, check in was a breeze. Immaculately cleaned, well stocked kitchen and bathroom. Location was everything we were looking for, felt remote and private but town was an easy drive away. Based on reviews I was a little worried about the stairs leading up to the bedrooms, but they were exactly as described and pictured in the listing.. if you have mobility issues or small children, this isn’t the property for you.
We had a wonderful time as a family and definitely plan on coming back next summer!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had such a relaxing and wonderful weekend. What a gem! We’d love to come see it in the winter or fall as well.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"If we could give a 6 star, we would. What a fantastic cabin with walk around decks. The lower deck with the hot tub a real gem. Down by the river, the lounge chairs were terrific. It is the kind of cabin you wished your family had. It was so cozy on the inside, the kitchen was loaded. The decorations were really fun. The upstairs bedrooms were charming. The ladder to get to them was a climb, but worth it. Our dog loved swimming in the river. We would do it again in a heartbeat."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A beautiful A frame cottage surrounded by natural and peaceful river is exactly what a relaxing weekend needed.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Gorgeous location. The beach area is absolutely perfect for hot summer days. The view is amazing. A bald eagle flew past the house following the river. We had an amazing time.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Just perfect. Peaceful, gorgeous setting, private."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"I enjoyed our stay at the river cottage.
It was a beautiful and peaceful scenery. 5 stars all around."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was the best! So beautiful and peaceful. The home is so perfectly curated, there wasn’t nothing we needed that wasn’t easily available! We wish we could have stayed longer!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If you enjoy a beautiful peaceful getaway, look no further!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved our stay at The River Cottage. The home was beautiful, peaceful, very well appointed and we enjoyed every minute we were there. Yes, the stairs are steep, but that’s part of the charm of this adorable A frame home. Just go. You’ll love it!"
2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our time outside here. Inside, not as much.
Pros: The location is gorgeous. We loved the private beach and the amenities like the canoe, grill, and fire pit. Our kids enjoyed the games provided both indoors and out. The kitchen was well equipped and included quality coffee. Beds were comfortable. Linens were quality and clean.
Cons: It felt really cluttered to us and in need of a deep cleaning. Lots of dust, mildew in the shower, and the fridge had clearly not been wiped out since the last guest. The hot tub was pretty dirty too. The countertops had lots of stuff on them which made it difficult to do much food prep in the kitchen. If you are allergic to dogs or bothered by dog hair, this is not the place for you. The dog hair was everywhere. The stairs were fine for our bigger kids but scary with our two year old. Not only are they steep, there is not much of a landing at the top of the stairs when you step out of either bedroom."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot right on the river with a hot tub! Very relaxing.
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Had things like coffee and candies, offered yo reach out if we needed anything. The wifi crapped out on us once and we unplugged it for a minute or two and it cane back. She was friendly and quick to respond. Let us check in an hour early which was greatly appreciated. Neat little area and i would own this place if i could afford it as a getaway. Many little things were thought of and provided. Was a lot of fun."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Third time staying here, planning for another next year. Such a peaceful place"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at Mariann’s River Cottage was everything I wanted!! It was so peaceful and the scenery was picturesque. The cottage itself was comfy, well equipped and stayed nice and cool. A morning coffee in the hanging chair off the back deck is a must!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderfully relaxing stay, everything was perfect! River cottage has everything you need and more for a comfortable stay. Host is very friendly and responsive. The cottage is just as pictured. Hot tub was very clean and nice after hiking all day! There is so much outdoor space to enjoy the surroundings. We can’t wait to come back again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic location. The stairs are a little treacherous but would absolutely stay again.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,My husband and I had a relaxing weekend with our 2 dogs. This cabin is a gem! The pictures don’t do it justice. Looking forward to rebooking again
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very easy check-in, perfect location with no visible neighbors, and a really comfortable atmosphere."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Best air bnb I have ever stayed in. We had such a great time. The hospitality Mariann displayed is unmatched. I’d recommend to anyone at anytime.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Really homey place that is well laid out. Loved all the games and the hot tub. Would be fun to do a campfire but it was too wet out while there. River is beautiful. Dogs were very comfy too.
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place matched the photos and more. Beautiful location directly on the river. The house is cute and tiny. And the hosts have made it so homey, with games and things everywhere to help entertain. The hosts gave us a bottle of wine and hid Easter eggs, as we were staying over Easter weekend. Overall, the hosts went above and beyond and the location and home are truly amazing. Worth it."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely riverfront property! Private, quiet & relaxing."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had an amazingly relaxing weekend here. The house is close to the road but you barely notice it. It rained all weekend but that only made the whole experience cozier. Sitting in the hot tub and looking at the river was incredible. Didn’t want to leave!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mariann’s river cabin is the the quintessential get away experience. Private and peaceful. So many thoughtful additions and details organized to enhance and luxuriate your stay. One of the most stocked and generously supplied kitchens I’ve ever experienced. The cabin is full of charm and comfort nestled just far enough from ‘civilization’ to offer a remote experience without complete isolation.
Mariann was a responsive and helpful host and gave wonderful recommendations and insight to local attractions and food options.
The whole experience was an absolute dream. Thank you, we will be back!!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is an absolute dream. My boyfriend and I wanted to be surrounded by trees and beautiful nature for our anniversary and this place exceeded our expectations!
The pictures do not do it justice!
This cottage is the perfect place to disconnect from the outside world (quite literally because there is no service) and really just enjoy your time with loved ones and relax.
We got a little rain, snow, and sunshine. We had everything we needed.
Oh! And another huge plus….the beds were SO COMFORTABLE! You won’t regret staying at the river cottage, so if you’re on the fence…this is me telling you to do it! :)
Mariann was always quick to respond and was very accommodating! We can’t wait to come back ! :)"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such an awesome place to stay. Will be coming back!!

2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,This is a wonderful cabin. We have a family of five and we had a terrific visit to this beautiful spot on the river. We would love to come back!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at the River Cottage, and it was just as nice, if not better, than the first! It's very welcoming, cozy, and quiet. Mariann is very quick with responses, and is always pleasant to chat with. We love the River Cottage and plan to keep coming back each year! If you're looking for a quiet, peaceful, beautiful place to kick back and relax, Mariann's is the place for you!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful and peaceful. Enjoyed the hot tub. Perfect for a relaxing weekend girls retreat.
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"This cottage is more than you can ask for! The location is so private and cozy. The drive there is relaxing. The water flowing is so peaceful and the outdoor patio is well equipped with seating and heaters for the winter time. Heaters all over! Spent the weekend here with my mom and sisters and we all enjoyed it. The room’s upstairs have amazing views and the queen bed is SO comfy. Stairs are a little steep but it’s manageable. The entire house has everything you’ll need. Felt at home.
The owner went above and beyond to welcome us into her home and had great communication throughout. Very friendly! I would love to see this place again in the summer. Highly recommend!!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and I absolutely loved this place and look forward to coming back in the future!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The pictures don’t do this place justice! Marianne was very courteous and helpful. Plenty of hiking around before and past the place. Load up with all you might need in a bigger town so you can spend more time enjoying. Will come back to see other seasons!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This beautiful gem is well loved, and we were happy to enjoy it for four nights! It’s definitely for folks who know each other as this sweet place is small in stature. But being right on the river and having a fantastic outdoors area and hot tub means that the inside is really just a means to the outside. Note that the bedrooms have 3/4 walls so you are able to easily hear over the wall! Not for people who need privacy. Also it is a dog friendly place so for those with allergies it’s not your place"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is more spacious and comfortable than we imagined. There is plenty of sitting and lounging space. Indoor and outdoor heaters, hot tub, great water pressure, delicious fresh water (I think filtered from the river?) and it's right on the river! The cabin's beach is a great launch point if you want to meet a friend down river. Great local pizza joint and plenty of trails nearby. If you're wanting a break from the city with plenty of conveniences within a 15 minute drive, this is the perfect place for you!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful hidden gem. Clean, quiet and a relaxing place. Internet was slow but there are a lot of things that will keep the family busy and entertained. We will definitely book again. Mariann is very friendly and on top of everything, she checks on us and make sure that we are ok."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really special and wonderful place. Right next to the river. Mariann was very helpful and understanding throughout the stay. Will definitely come back when the weather is nicer
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"10 out of 5 stars. First off the cabin itself is adorable and the hot tub is a cherry on top. The location of the cabin is perfect. Right next to the river and secluded away all by yourself. It feels like it’s only you out there. But the real reason this place is so great is because of the owners. They went above and beyond what most hosts would do. Long story short, Mother Nature decided to have an ice storm the day before and the morning before we got there, knocked out the electricity to the surrounding area, froze the water and broke their water pump line. They put us up in a hotel, paid for our dinner and refunded us a night. Bob stayed out all night fixing things and we were able to check in the next morning. So these hosts went way above and beyond to take care of us when something out of their control happened. So between an amazing location and even more amazing hosts we will definitely be back again. I highly recommend this spot to anyone and everyone."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Exactly like the photos plus some. We will definitely be coming again! You couldn't ask for a more simple getaway with such an incredible view out every window.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful place. I highly recommend booking here. Mariann is extremely helpful and very responsive. The cottage is even more beautiful than the pictures and the scenery is peaceful. This is a great place to unplug for a while and enjoy nature.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bayou d our expectations! The pictures honestly doesn’t do the beauty of this place justice! Every day we felt like we woke up in a fairytale, and the host Mariann is so responsive, and extremely accommodating. Probably THE BEST Airbnb experience I’ve had yet! We definitely plan on coming back in the summer!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place easy communication !!
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Second time back at this place ❤️ It’s incredibly serene and peaceful.
The internet is unreliable at best out here so both times we’ve planned for phone free and screen free weekends - this time was no exception! It’s very easy to do since there are board games galore!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is awesome. We really enjoyed the beautiful views, which were visible from everywhere in the house! It was very clean and had everything we needed and more, which we really appreciated and made us feel right at home. The host is super friendly and quick to respond!
It was so awesome to have a beach to a beautiful river right in our back yard! This house is very secluded and peaceful.. you really can’t help but just relax.
We drove to the two nearest restaurants which was a beautiful 10-15minute drive. Both restaurants had great food, drinks and vibe.
There are a ton of hiking trails just a short drive away and they have stunning views of rivers, waterfalls, trees and cliffs..
We hope to stay here in the future! Our kids would have a blast swimming and exploring here in the summer!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Such a cute, idyllic spot near the river. Mariann adds the cutest touches, too!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place is extraordinary. I had a blast there in the middle of a storm. I can only imagine how great it would be on summer. Cannot wait to go back. The complimentary bottle of wine waiting for you at check in was an awesome touch.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a beautiful location. We enjoyed our stay!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely cabin by the river. We enjoyed feeling cozy and secluded during the stay. Cabin is stocked with everything you might need and the owner was communicative and easy to work with.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second trip to the River Cottage and let me just say, this place is magical. We have stayed in a lot of Air BNBs over the years and there is something about this one that just keeps us coming back! I think what sets it apart from other Air BNBs is that as soon as you walk it, you can tell this place is loved. The owners truly care about this space. The beds are super, super comfy, the kitchen is stocked with coffee, spices and pancake mix, there are games to play, a cozy couch to snuggle on and watch a movie... there is even a cabinet that has water shoes to make walking into the river more comfortable! It really feels like a home away from home! Thank you for sharing this special place with all of us Mariann!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was an amazing little oasis. Beautiful cabin, with all the necessities and then some. Comfortable beds, awesome fire pit....truly so much to rave about! We will definitely be back."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the 3rd time I've stayed here this year, and it is perfect in every season. Lucky to have caught the last of the warm weather so we could get good use of the river floaties, decks, yard games, and fire pit! I get better sleep here than at home, honestly."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I had a great time celebrating our anniversary at this beautifully private and serene cottage. We will definitely be coming back for another romantic getaway - might even bring the kid next time to play in the river!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin is beautiful and the creak is breathtaking!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow!!! This place is amazing!!! I am an outdoor lover. And if you are too, you will LOVE this place as well. It’s so cozy. And the river is sooo relaxing and beautiful! We were able to go for a beautiful hike just minutes away and then went to a local winery But truly just staying at the cottage all day was my husband’s favorite thing to do. We grilled out. Roasted s’mores on the fire. Drank wine on the deck. And just took in all the natural beauty all around. Mariann did an amazing job of having everything there that you could possibly need. I only wish the place were my own because my husband and I absolutely adored it there!!! You will too!!!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful spot on the river. Quiet and relaxing. We took full advantage of all the outdoor spaces — decks with outdoor furniture, lounge chairs on the rocky shore — to unwind and enjoy the beauty and birds.
Mariann made things easy. Great communication. A terrific escape for us."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was a great little escape. I'm sure in the heat of summer it'll be even better! My friend and I had a lovely time relaxing by the water and hanging out on the deck listening to the water. The stairs/ladder to the bedrooms is a bit daunting when tipsy so be very careful. I initially had brought two of my 5 dogs but they're prissy girls and since there's no grass for their business they were determined to hold it. I wasn't Ok with that so I ended up taking the two hour drive home to switch puppers to my two corgis who are no so picky. Even in the dark the place was easy to find again and I was able to make a necessary stop at Safeway on my way back to get breakfast foods. Overall it was a great experience and I want to come back when the weather is more river temp complimentary.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cabin was very cozy and the private river area was perfect with our own little swimming hole. The kitchen was very equipped which was a bonus!
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our stay here was so wonderful!
The river was fresh and the house is cozy :)
This spot is definitely a place you could revisit and never get bored of. Mariann was so communicative and answered any questions we had and even threw in a bunch of complimentary gifts. We had a wonderful time <3 10/10"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place with great views, we had to be extra cautious with our toddler since it is not toddler friendly but overall a great stay! Mariann did provide all the amenities and communication was on point. Would definitely revisit."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A gem!
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful place on the banks of a river with no one around to disturb your peace. Everything was well thought it and all you would need for a lovely time tucked away in nature. Highly recommended.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Amazing little cottage! Had pretty much all the amenities that we needed, and was private. We had a great time on the river. We will definitely book again."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay just as much or even more than last time! This is just a special, serene place and is quickly becoming our favorite place to relax, unplug and unwind! The cabin is adorable and has everything you could possibly need! The setting is breathtaking and we can’t wait to come back! Thanks again Mariann, you are the most amazing host we’ve ever dealt with!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This river cabin is serene, clean and so cute and comfortable! Mariann offers so many great extras that enhance the experience, like games, firewood, pantry items, extra blankets etc.
It feels like home when you visit!
The views are phenomenal and although there are many activities in the area you won’t want to leave the cabin because there’s so much to enjoy!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is awesome. Small. Quaint. But everything you need and more. Host had vinyl boats and inner tubes all ready for guest. Several spots to sit and enjoy the river going by. Highly recommend this place to anyone wanting a little get away or a family with kids,, grandkids, etc. to vacation. Great swimming. Very relaxing location and very very private."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Such a lovely river front cabin and a great host. Mariann provides everything you need for a fun and restful stay. Check in was smooth and easy and Mariann checked in regularly to make sure we had everything we needed. The multiple decks and river front furniture ensure you can stretch out and relax in multiple spots. Everything was clean and tidy upon arrival. The stairs leading upstairs are indeed steep as the description points out so folks with small ones and/or mobility issues should definitely take note.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I can’t even put into words how much Mariann went out of her way to make my daughters and now son-in-laws wedding night so special. Forever grateful and will most definitely be back. The kids didn’t even want to leave for their honeymoon and just wanted to stay here for the week ❤️
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The River Cottage is one of those fantastic places that you even have a hard time believing exists and that you're there. The cottage is very cozy, comfortable, and well prepared, you'll find everything. The river is beautiful. The private beach is perfect. We went in the summer and it was great, but the cottage must be amazing in winter also, just to sit but the fire and soak it all in. I couldn't recommend more."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stunning property on a serene and private part of the Lewis River! My fiancée and I spent two nights here and it far exceeded our expectations. Pretty much everything you could ever need is provided. Comfortable beds, comfortable couch, great shower. We loved being able to sit outside with coffee and tea and play some games while listening to the sounds of the river. The ladder to get up to the upstairs is not for everyone, but it wasn't an issue for us. Convenient to much of Mt. St. Helens with Moulton and Yacult Falls right down the road. We would stay here again for sure!!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely worth the money. The house is great with all of its decks and Balconys, but the property is top notch and elevates the whole place."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is an one of kind Airbnb experience! Everything is perfect! We will definitely be back.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It’s perfect. Peaceful and cozy - we will be back!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great base from which to explore the nearby waterfalls or venture further afield around the Mt. St Helen's area. It's unique/rare to find a private ""river beach"", which makes this place very special - the light plays and sounds of the rushing water are wonderful, and my dog loved splashing about! The house is well stocked with pretty much every piece of gear in every room that you'd want (e.g., even a pre-seasoned cast iron pan). The multiple decks/corners allow for plenty of opportunity to hang out outside. Communications with Mariann were rapid and clear. The stairs were not for my dog, however there's a pullout sofa in the living room for those situations. I would definitely stay again."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mariann’s little slice of heaven is one of the best Airbnb stays I’ve ever experienced aside from “Rose’s Point Roberts” Heaven on earth experience. Mariann has created a fantastic private tranquility retreat with everything you could possibly need or want. I would give the river cottage a 10-star if I could. We are looking forward for our next visit! I more than recommend her river cottage! I say make it a MUST-Bucket-list experience! We are still in awe. 🥹
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Mariann’s amenity list was off the chart. It was so great to visit an exclusive cottage on the river that had lots of things at the site to do. We played chess, watched movies and played other games. The access to the river was great, right there. We enjoyed the very private feeling this cottage offers. We couldn’t see our hear anyone else. We stayed at the cottage for our entire visit. This was a great place for us and our kids to visit. We have a son who’s almost 16 and other kids in the single digits and they all had fun, sun bathing or splashing in the river. I would recommend this to others, but I don’t want to lose my spot. Thank you Mariann for providing a great place for us to unplug and unwind. We’re booking again!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow. What a great spot on the river. So many options for enjoying the space. Yes, it would be amazing on a warm, sunny day (which we did not have), to be able to enjoy all the outdoor spaces and decks and playing in the river itself right out your backdoor! But even in rainy, chilly weather, the space was so cozy and welcoming. A gas fireplace in the living room and an electric 'wood stove' for warmth and ambiance in the kitchen and in one upstairs bedroom. Both bedrooms with lovely views of the river from bed! And the hanging chair swing on one bedroom deck overlooking the passing river was such luxury! Communication and cleanliness both excellent. The one thing we would have changed if we could was to have more views of the river while seated in the living room and dining area. The furniture positioning didn't take full advantage of all the windows and views available. But that's really only an issue if you can't spend a lot of your time outdoors, like we couldn't. Regardless, the space feels very private and surrounded by forest and river and nature sounds and lots of cozy nooks and options for views upstairs and outside. Lovely visit! Thanks, Mariann!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is in a beautiful area and cozy and comfortable inside. Mariann is great—responsive and detailed. Easy recommendation to make for your next getaway!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little spot! The river was so pretty and the house was super relaxing in the rain. Very cozy and perfect for a quick two person, two night stay."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A perfectly secluded, wonderfully spacious, and simply the best for a little getaway outside the city. The river access is absolutely amazing! I loved being able to just enjoy the sound of the rushing water from the patio in the morning. The perfect view with my morning coffee. I cannot suggest this place enough. I already bragged to all my friends and family about this place, most are already looking to book their next trip here."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is an amazing place on an incredible piece of property! We had a fantastic time enjoying the place, the river, exploring the surrounding area (lots of hiking, waterfalls, and wineries) and did a day trip to Mt St Helen’s. Great adventuring and will definitely visit again!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This spot is breathtaking. Stairs are steep--my dog managed to go down them, not up though... maybe next time! Two very slight possible issues: (1) VERY STEEP driveway that is easy to miss even in the daylight, (2) the entire cabin is more or less one room (loft like), so light sleepers with noisy family members might find the lack of full walls to be an issue. All the good: Kitchen was very well stocked. Grill on the deck was awesome. Decks galore!!! Great fire pit options. Extremely dog friendly. Gorgeous river. Green! loved our stay. If you want charm + nature + river + amazing outdoor lounge space... 100, A+, book it!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Love this place! This is our second year staying there, and planning for it again next year."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, clean, and cozy! My second stay here. I’ll be back!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a return visit and just as perfect as the last time. Mariann got a new couch and coffee tables and hanging chair since we were last there which are lovely. As always, very well stocked kitchen for cooking!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"great place to stay if you are into getting away from it all, the steep stairs which you find in most small cabins of this type are easy if you remember to just use them as a ladder going up and down."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful spot on the river - clean, quiet, and *so* comfortable. The place was just as the pictures show and is the perfect spot for a weekend getaway - I will definitely be visiting again!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,An incredible get away. Mariann is a great host and communicator. The views are beautiful and the home is cozy. We had everything we needed and the complimentary bottle of wine was a cherry on top. Do not hesitate to stay here
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location with amazing views and surroundings. It rained while we were there and there sound of the rain on the roof was magical.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful secluded location. Pictures really don’t do it justice. As many reviews have said the stairs are a beast but we managed just fine. Well worth it for the cute spot and fun location.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mariann was a wonderful host and was very speedy with response. The cabin is as lovely as the pictures show. Waking up to the sound of river is truly magical.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t believe how beautiful and secluded this place is :). Perfect for an isolated/couple/family/friends getaway into the outdoors. Hiking park and local winery within the neighborhood a 5-10min drive. Or, the house is perfect for buying groceries and not leaving the property (which is what I did). You can’t beat the seclusion, the scenery, and how close it is to the River. I came in late March so it was perfect for bundled up coffee in the morning, sun bathing in the afternoon, and wine by the fire at night. I would like to come back when it’s warmer to cook more outside and enjoy the water a little :)
Host very responsive and helpful!
Dog Owner Note: She has pointed out in the description that the stairs are very ladder-like. Due to last minute family stuff, my furry friend wasn’t able to come with me because we love going hiking together (the house is very dog-friendly). However, I was a little relieved that he wasn’t there with me because he’s 50lbs, and there was no way he’d get up and down the stairs, and he has a need to sleep on the floor next to my bed in a new place, so I wouldn’t have been able to enjoy the comfortable bed and balconies upstairs with him. He would’ve cried and whined that we were somewhere new and separated. The recliner downstairs is super comfortable tho and I would’ve just slept there had he come with me and it would’ve been fine :)"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mariann and Bob are amazing! We loved staying near the river and exploring the local area. It was cold but beautiful. Highly recommend!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Gorgeous! We will be coming back!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"the cabin is a magical place even in winter, the little house is very warm, cozy and clean, the owner has gone to great lengths to make every detail perfect. the river is very beautiful even when it rains and it is cold.
I will definitely have to go back in the summer."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The best Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in! Perfect for a romantic getaway. Mariann thought of everything we could ever need. The spot is GORGEOUS and the house is so beautiful.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was truly the perfect getaway from my busy life. Mariann’s place is definitely way better than the pictures let on. The kitchen was well stocked, it was clean, warm, and the view of the river is breathtaking. Can’t wait to stay again."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely amazing!! Mariann was very quick to respond to any questions I had, and made the entire experience more amazing. She had the heaters on and Firewood for us when we arrived, and it made the cottage feel like a dream come true. It was better than I could have hoped for, and made me not want to leave! We will definitely be back!!!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything you could have asked for an Airbnb. Spent our ten year anniversary here and it was a dream. Great location close to great places to explore. House was cozy, beautiful and had anything you needed. Can’t wait to share this place with our kids this summer."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place, away form it all, but also close enough to whatever you may need - hiking, exploring, or just sitting and watching the river go by.
Great space, with all the amenities."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is probably my favorite place that I've stayed within 2 hours of Portland. The site is gorgeous, the house is very cute and comfy and well-stocked, and there are lovely easy to access hikes all around."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This spot is a gem. Right on the river, cozy beds, beautiful forest. The hosts were great communicators. We look forward to returning in the summer."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This property is hands down the best Airbnb property I’ve ever stayed in! The location is stunning - we can’t wait to come back again in the summer and go swimming in the river. Additionally, Mariann has gone 200% above and beyond to make sure everything you can possibly need is available! Our dog LOVED being able to play around the property.
Thank you for sharing this retreat and experience with us!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home right on the river. Very clean and cozy! I highly recommend it!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We absolutely enjoyed our time at this magical cabin. Everything was fantastic, quiet, clean, and cozy. We will keep your place in our memories and hopefully return when the weather is warmer! Thank you for everything and for allowing our family to make wonderful memories."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This cottage is excellent for small groups. I brought 2 guests and my dog. Plenty of space, yet cozy. The Kitchen was well stocked with spices & utensils. No lack of entertainment with Wifi, TV with Streaming, and board games. Easy to unplug at this cabin. The river views were great from the multiple decks. We went for a cozy Winter stay, but the swimming during the Summer is probably excellent. Yacolt & Amboy are nice little towns, we highly recommend Nick's for breakfast."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I am absolutely in love with this location and home! I have stayed at a few locations and this one is by far the best. The kitchen was fantastic. It had EVERYTHING we needed and then some. The beds were very comfy, better than most hotels I've been in. We only slept in the bigger room. Each room had its own deck and when you open the door, you can hear the river. The stairs are a little steep, but there is a very sturdy handle to hold onto. There are plenty of heaters in the home so we were more than comfortable. The deck was gorgeous and I loved hearing the rushing water over the rocks when we opened the window. It's perfectly secluded, but not so far away from everything. There are trails and waterfalls in the area for exploring too. We will be booking here again in the future!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location. Has everything you need.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The perfect get away cabin in the woods! A must stay in our opinion.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin exceeded my expectations! Mariann was very helpful and there are so many thoughtful details included in the space! It was so comfortable and warm, we didn’t want to leave! We hope to be back"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I were surprised at just how nice this cabin and location are! You can tell that this host has put a lot of time and thought into this place - down to every last detail! We walked in to see dog treats by the door for our pup, so sweet! Everything was there that we needed, the heat had even been turned on and it was super cozy! The beds were comfortable too!! That is everything when you are staying somewhere new. Overall I cant say enough good things about this cabin! They went above and beyond and we will definitely book again! Thank you so much 🙂"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,As advertised! We loved our time there
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, comfy little cottage on the river. We had an awesome stay. Hosts are really helpful and responsive."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The beauty of the River this cabin is on is hard to describe! Such a lovely area and relaxing experience! The cabin was very homey and there were so many small touches that the hosts have added to make it feel like a home away from home. From the extra cozy blankets, to board games and candles, these hosts go above and beyond to ensure a relaxing stay for their guests! Would absolutely recommend and would love to come back in the spring/summer!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mariann and Bob's place is a lovely and thoughtful getaway. All the amenities you need, a secluded location in nature, I only wish I had more time at the cabin!
Responsive, easy to access, and unparalleled relaxing space. Thank you! I hope to come again!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A perfectly lovely, relaxing weekend. We didn’t want to leave!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The river cottage is a romantic relaxing getaway! And the setting is some thing that pictures don’t do justice you have to go there to experience it the nature the water sounds the private beach . This A-frame cottage has a view out of every window!. We will definitely book again soon!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was a DREAM! Peaceful, beautiful, calming, and relaxing. The house is cozy and has the best views and river access.
We felt comfortable letting our dogs swim and walk around the property.
There are lots of mushrooms for foregoing- edible and toxic.
We will be going back, our favorite stay we’ve had."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Cottage is absolutely beautiful. Tucked away in a private spot right on the river. The morning view from the bedroom window is such a great way to start the day. Or to have lunch overlooking the running river. The pictures really don't do it justice. The water is crystal clear, the trees old growth.
The place is completely stocked and Mariann has thought of anything and everything you could need. All the kitchen appliances you'd want to cook, the outdoor grill was in great shape. As soon as you walk in it feels very comfortable and you feel at home. Very peaceful, easy to maintain temperature and pleasant heated floors. Comfortable furniture, tons of seating, the multiple decks are great.
As Mariann mentions the river cottage likely isn't a great fit for someone with mobility issues as the stairs are very steep / almost a ladder, but otherwise you get used to them during your stay.
Mariann was very prompt and responsive to questions, and overall we can't say enough great things about the place. A true gem. Thanks for allowing us to stay at your River Cottage Mariann!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The river cottage was beautiful and comfortable. The kitchen was well stocked with everything we needed. The little touches made it very welcoming for us. The bedrooms were very cozy and the beds were so comfortable. We loved the multiple decks at different levels. We came here to relax and we did. One of the best airbnb’s we’ve stayed at.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home right on the river. So many nice places to relax! Everything surpassed expectations. The host was so helpful and communicative. I definitely will be back!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was perfect! Quiet and private. Got to step away from life and enjoy the family uninterrupted. You can expect beautiful cottage, private river access and making lots of fun memories!!!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely, picturesque cabin on the river! Photos don’t do this place justice - all the essentials are included, and being so close to the water was a treat. Wonderful stay."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is GORGEOUS! It’s very well taken care of and we absolutely enjoyed our stay here. We spent hours playing Scrabble (they have the official dictionary!), wading in the water, and relaxing in the house. 10/10 would come again!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful location and cabin. We stayed at the cabin the whole time, playing games, swimming, and tubing. My kids (9 and 12) had adventures around the property. My husband ended up having to work because of a crisis in his office, and the wifi was excellent for that purpose. Our dog had a blast as well. The stairs were fine for us. The under-5 set or people with mobility issues would probably find them challenging. Mariann was a pleasure to work with."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a wonderful spot! Beautiful decks overlooking a slow spot on the river - a great swimming hole! The house is cozy and perfectly appointed.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a true gem. View/water access is amazing, inside is super cozy and well appointed, decks are well laid out and very usable (complete with heaters for chilly weekends like ours). Mariann responded quickly and was very helpful. Can't recommend this place highly enough... go!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Want to give a 1 star review simply to keep this place to myself!! felt good to feel ""home"" in the PNW. the river was low with the time of year but a nice space to spend a weekend. REALLY rough parking situation if you have anything other than a small car or suv. we had to back up the hill to leave as it was impossible to turn around in a Silverado with the angles and rain."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is such a special place….the pictures don’t do it justice! We wanted a peaceful and relaxing little getaway and this place ended up being way more than we were expecting. Every detail is so well thought out and the setting just can’t be beat! Pure serenity….we are already thinking of when we will come back!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Just WOW! We felt like we hit the AirBnb jackpot with this one. The home and the location are completely dreamy. Swam (once you get in, you get used to the cold!), fished, skipped rocks, floated. So perfect. All of the details are beautifully thought through in the house and (many) decks. Already looking at dates for our return trip!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wow! What a gem! The location on the river, the cottage itself (tastefully decorated with all the amenities anyone would need or want), and proximity to hiking and other local fun are all the things this sweet little place offers! We were very pleased with our stay and and all the other little touches Mariann provides.
We will be back!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place truly is the DREAM! We have used Air BNB for a while now and have had some pretty poor experiences over the past few months. The River Cottage has blown us out of the water with joy and met each of our expectations and then some!!! Cozy bed, river sounds at night, wine!, tv, games, Alexa! It all felt so luxurious!
If you book this place, you will be so happy and in awe of what a little gem it is. <3 We look forward to returning asap!!!"
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location is absolutely spectacular. We opted to stay where we were at the house because it was so beautiful and relaxing. Marianne’s use of outdoor space is fabulous. We spent most of our time outside enjoying the extensive deck space and the river. The only thing that kept it from a five star rating was the bed situation. Both bedrooms are located up steep stairs (almost a ladder). We thought long and hard any time we needed to go up or down the stairs. The house and property, however, were so beautiful that we would brave the stairs again for another stay there. Marianne’s hospitality was wonderful and she checked in on us during our visit to make sure we had everything we needed. It was a very memorable trip."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place truly is even more beautiful than the pictures suggest! Playing in the river and/or relaxing by it is lovely, and the house is very well-stocked with anything you could need. We did some yummy grilling (the grill works great) and made a fire in the pit (there's plenty of firewood and collecting kindling is easy). Mariann was wonderful at responding and keeping in touch. Two things to consider:
- The staircase is a bit harrowing. Over time we got better at using it/it got easier, but I would not recommend for anyone with mobility issues and/or an intense fear of heights. It seems like if it had a railing on both sides it would be easier, but anyhow!
- The Queen bed was a bit too soft for us (both in our early 30s) - with two people, we felt sort of like we were falling into the middle. The Full bed is very firm and comfortable! So we ended up sleeping on that even though it's smaller.
Thank you Mariann!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This river cottage is the perfect relaxing getaway! Well-stocked kitchen, comfy beds, each bedroom with its own balcony, plenty of outdoor seating, the sounds of the river 24/7. Swimming and floating in the river was everything we needed. Just lovely!!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was a perfect get away cabin in the woods.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful location! Great amenities and thoughtful touches around the cabin.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jenni’s place was phenomenal. It was in the SAFE part of town with a lot of things to eat and explore around.
Parking was hassle free and I had plenty of parking spaces. Public transit was walkable and accessible.
It is a single room but you have access to Jenni’s entire place except her room and office room. Laundry too!! Her place was clean and I meant CLEAN. The bed was divine and I had a good night’s rest. Her bathroom was awesome and had everything you needed.
I had the pleasure meeting the host and her dog and both were super sweet and I felt right at home. There was a lock in my room aka privacy. Like what others said, the room door does leave a gap but you’re able to cover it up with the robes she gave. Also, bathroom… you CAN throw your used tissue in the toilet. She gave free coffee/water!
She’s a wonderful host and gave great recommendations. She felt more like my mom than a stranger. In a good way. Will definitely come here again if I solo travel to Portland!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A memorable one-day stay with Jenni and Camila. I will definitely come back and stay here again. Must love dogs!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I truly felt at home. Jenni is a great resource and I couldn't have asked for a better host for my first time in Portland l.

I’d highly recommend this air bnb"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jenni was fantastic. She has a cute house in a good location. Very affordable in the Portland area.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I had the best conversation I have ever had with an Airbnb host. I truly enjoyed hanging out with Jenni and her lovely pet, Camilla. The place was close to a super cool neighborhood high street on Mississippi Ave. I loved it!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Fantastic host and location! Coffee in the room! Very comfy bed. Highly recommend!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful stay at Jenni's home. The location was perfect, close to downtown and in a peaceful, residential neighborhood near restaurants and markets. The house was beautiful and the room was comfortable. Jenni was very friendly and accommodating, and her dog Camilla was a sweetie. I hope to return!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jenni was a great host, her place was just what I was looking for. She was communicative, helpful with local recommendations, and incredibly sweet. The room itself was perfect and had all the basic amenities. Highly recommend to others."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jenni was a great host and roomie! Grateful she is trusting to open her home to folks. Loved my stay, it was like a retreat."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I had a great time during my stay at Jenni’s, she was very friendly and had great recommendations for places to visit. We shared many stories as well as a coffee on the day of departure.
I also loved meeting Cam, she was adorable and very well behaved."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jenni’s place was super convenient and comfortable. Great restaurants, all around, plenty of parking and Jenni was very accommodating. She let me keep my bicycle in her living room, only about 2 miles from downtown also."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jenni's place was perfect for a one-person stay. The neighborhood was great and Jenni was a wonderful host.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a great stay. Jenni made things really easy. I never felt awkward or uncomfortable sharing a bath or kitchen, etc. Jenni seems to get a lot of joy from hosting, and seems comfortable with whatever level of interaction (or not) you may want. Location is great. The dog (Camilla) is lovely; does not bark, jump, etc. I will definitely stay again.
Jenni's fee is reasonable. The Airbnb and cleaning fees reduce the cost effectiveness for a single night stay, but for multiple nights it wouldn't be an issue. The only other thing maybe worth noting is that the bedroom door is a barn-style door, so there is a gap of an inch or so when it's closed. This is because the door panel cannot by definition be flush with the wall along which it slides. It's not a complete seal. That's nature of barn-style doors. It wasn't an issue for me, and the room is in a different part of the house from Jenni's, so privacy level was perfectly fine for me."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I had the most amazing stay with Jenni. My only problem was that I didn’t book a longer stay! Her home is beautiful and she was so kind and welcoming. Her dog Camilla was an added bonus. Definitely recommend staying here :)
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay with Jenni and Camilla. The house was clean, and the decor will make you feel right at home. Jenni was entertaining to talk with and responds to texts pretty quick. If and when I am back in Portland, I am definitely staying with her."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jenni's home is immaculate. Her entire home is clean and spotless. A+. Jenni is a great host, so kind, warm, and friendly. Room is as described. Easy street parking and walkable neighborhood. Highly recommend for a quick visit to Portland."

much appreciated and highly recommended,thank you Jenni!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, vintage turn-of-the-century home with newly remodeled bathroom that has amazing fixtures. The bed is very comfortable and the house is full of natural light. Walking distance from Planned Parenthood and bus stop. Easy and quick access to the rest of the city; this is a great listing for a car-free solo traveler. The hostess is great and the current resident dog is the ultimate comforting therapy dog. Highly recommend this listing."

Jenni made the whole stay feel very safe and homey! The area is great and the house is beautiful."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jenni and Camilla were the sweetest hosts. I had such a lovely conversation with Jenni when I arrived and she made me feel right at home. It was a short stay and unfortunately didn’t get the chance to try out that gorgeous bathroom, but I will definitely be back. Comfortable sleep, good hood, didn’t want for a thing. Thank you Jenni and Camilla 💗"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I thoroughly enjoyed all aspects of my stay at Jenni’s home from the beautiful / comfortable accommodations to the close proximity to great shopping, restaurants and public transportation (bus and rail) into PDX. Jenni thought of everything in preparing the accommodations. She is an excellent hostess - thoughtful, helpful and friendly. I look forward to future stays. Thank you, Jenni!"

Jenni couldn't be more hospitable and has the sweetest dog in the world. The area is very walkable and there are quite a few wonderful restaurants shops, cafes etc nearby that are less than a 10 min walk. I did feel safe walking alone in the area both day and night. Don't hesitate to stay with Jenni as your home base while exploring Portland."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great stay! thank you!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay; Jenni is friendly, helpful, and knowledgable!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at Jenni's place and I must say, it exceeded all expectations.
The location couldn't have been more perfect, nestled between the bustling streets of Mississippi Avenue and William Avenue, offering an abundance of restaurants and vintage shops.
Additionally, the convenience of public transportation via Trimet was a game-changer, with a stop just a stone's throw away. In just 20 minutes, you can find yourself in the heart of downtown.
Despite the room's compact size, it was thoughtfully designed to maximize functionality. From the comfortable bed and convenient table to the spacious wardrobe and fridge, every essential was meticulously provided. Not to mention, the modern design of the bathroom was a breath of fresh air—bright, spacious, and impeccably clean.
A highlight of my stay was the warm hospitality extended by Jenni.
Her hospitality makes me feel like home."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jenni’s place was great for a Portland weekend. I would happily stay there again.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jenni is a very gracious, communicative host, and her place is clean, charming, comfortable. Camilla the dog is a love muffin, but as a ""retired"" service dog, she's mostly content to snooze on her dog bed and let guests be. The guest room was perfectly adequate space for one person; the house was quiet for sleeping; the Portland bungalow vibe was appealing. For a solo traveler, this is a great place to stay and Jenni is friendly and responsive."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My stay with Jenni was great! The Boise-Eliot area is a nice place to stay and is walking distance from good food and shops. The public transportation took me from the airport to a few blocks away from her house. Jenni has a nice dog and welcoming home!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location right by plenty of fantastic places to grab food and coffee. Jenni could not have been more accommodating as a host and is more than happy to help with recommendations or figuring out the public transit in the city. Wished I was there during better weather, but overall I had an amazing stay and would highly recommend this place if you're looking to visit Portland."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"She is so warm host ever. Despite of some of situations, she communicates so fast and trying to make it right. I would definitely stay again at her house in next time visit in Portland."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great stay here for a few days during the snowy weather. Jenni is very welcoming. Her home is clean and comfy, and she is generous with her impressive tea collection! She is a great anticipator as a host, and a fount of knowledge about Portland. Camilla is a sweet old dog who minds her business. The neighborhood is very walkable and well-connected to other parts of the city via public transit."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jenni was incredibly accommodating and an amazing host. Camilla the dog was so well behaved, and the neighborhood is walkable, peaceful and fun."

If you are having trouble, I highly recommend it."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jenni was a wonderful host. Very responsive, helpful, kind and fun! Definitely talk to her if you need suggestions regarding what to do or for no reason at all. Her dog, Camilla, is also a very friendly girl. Pat her for me, please."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I so appreciated Jenni's responsiveness, communication, and flexibility. She let me drop off my luggage as my flight got in early and sent me updates via text.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jenni creates a warm and welcoming feel to her home. Very easy to get along with and easy going. Goes to good measure to make you feel as comfortable as you would be at your own home. Loved giving pats to Camilla the dog. Would book again if in Portland.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jenni's home is a beautifully curated, well appointed space that isn't too fussy but has a luxe vibe. Very convenient location, easy to find street parking and very walkable for food options. I appreciated Jenni's flexibility in accommodating a late checkout when I had an extended virtual meeting for work. Internet was fast and there was plenty of space to spread out in the shared areas.
Camille was a big sweetheart and her (very quiet) contented little snores were soothing. Lots of thoughtful touches including: usb charging, power strip, extra blankets, robe, room fridge and coffee/tea options. Comfy bed. Perfect for a solo female traveler. Wish I had more time to explore the neighborhood, and the outdoor spaces have a lot of promise for lounging in nicer weather."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the house and location. Easy to walk to restaurants, brewery, coffee, groceries, and tea shops. The neighborhood was quiet and safe. Jenni was a fabulous host and very sensitive to guest needs. As a solo traveler I really appreciated that she was happy to chat but also gave plenty of privacy and space. Id love to stay here again when in the area."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jenni was incredibly welcoming and accommodating. She was always just a message away, ready to assist with any questions or concerns.
The kitchen was well-equipped with everything I needed to prepare meals, and the living area was a perfect place to relax after a day of exploring the city. The Wi-Fi was fast and reliable, which was important for my work needs. The bedroom was cozy and provided a great night's sleep.

I was able to explore Portland with great ease, and Jenni provided some excellent local recommendations that made my trip even more enjoyable."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jenni, Cam the dog, & their place were just what I needed. I am a former hostel-er & Disney Deluxe Resort user, and I enjoyed the feel of both at Jenni's. She is a true Concierge, gifted at what she is doing. The small details are important, and she realizes this. I used her kitchen, & rested from a cold, at times, and I felt so welcome & at home. Please, follow her simple rules; she lives there, too. The bed & bath are awesome! The nearby businesses are great, as well, and walk-able. Thank you, Jenni & Camilla!!!"

The location is perfect because you have rows of restaurants only a walking distance away to the left and right of the place. A super market is in walking distance.

Recently renovated bathroom is lovely and it's great that you're able to use the communal rooms at your leisure and also use the kitchen to cook. The neighbourhood is great, with lots of restaurants and cafes within walking distance and then the convention centre and downtown only a short bus ride away.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jenni and her dog Camilla were the best of hosts. I’d give them six stars if I could and would emphatically recommend them to Portland-bound visitors. Their house is a short walk from many restaurants, stores, bars; it is also right by several bus lines, which give you cheap and reliable access to the greater metro region. The room is nicely sized, with a comfortable bed and pillows, a small personal fridge, and a desk. The shared bathroom is large and spotless, and it looks right out of a nice hotel. Jenni is a great conversationalist who really knows her way around the neighborhood. She’s as happy to offer recommendations as she is to share her private stock of local tea, beer, and alcohol-free drinks. Camilla is the most well-mannered and adorably lazy dog. Would I stay here again? In a Portland minute!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved Jenni’s place! She gave me great advice on where to adventure, everything was within walking distance. I wish I could have stayed longer!

I could give her dog, Camilla, head rubs all day. This is a great Airbnb experience and would love to stay here again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Jenni is an awesome host. She accommodated my late arrival with excellent detailed instructions for self check-in.

The room was great, with a comfy bed, a desk for working or eating, and a large closet with a hanging rack and shelves. The house as a whole is pretty and clean. Jenni is an exceptional host, so helpful, and so generous with sharing her home. I cooked my breakfasts each am in her well-appointed kitchen. Sharing the bathroom (newly renovated) with her worked out fine. No issues there at all. And her pooch, Camilla is a sweetie, very calm and friendly. The walk to New Seasons Market and the neighborhood shops is only a few minutes from her home. Do not hesitate to stay here!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great experience!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"So much good here. Jenni is a gem in the art of hospitality. She was happy to let me arrive early, before check-in, to drop off my bags. Unbeknownst to either of us, I would also need half an hour to ice and bandage a wounded knee as I had slipped in the rain on my way from the airport (welcome to Portland). She was kind and helpful and didn’t rush me at all.
The house was clean and cozy, the prettiest one the block, and I felt right at home. Jenni was friendly and up for a chat but unintrusive with very few house rules.
I didn’t do much research but her home is in a very walkable spot, in a fun neighborhood with good food. I didn’t bother to rent a car and was able to hop on the bus a block away to anywhere I wanted to go.
If you’re reading this, just book it!"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it was awesome! Jenni was always helpful, kind, and flexible. The house was like a safe haven from the stresses of travel. I much appreciated its close proximity to public transport. It was extremely easy to get around the city. The whole experience was easy, not just setting everything up and communicating, but being in/using the house, the room, the closet, the kitchen, the bathroom, the wireless ... nothing was ever surprising or frustrating. Also - importantly - the mattress on the bed was very comfortable. I also must put in a good word for Cam, who is the sweetest, calmest, kindest dog. I can't imagine a nicer first experience with Airbnb than Jenni's house."

I actually spend a lot of time in the house and Jenni went out of her way to make me feel comfortable and relaxed. The neighbourhood is safe and a bus around the corner takes you downtown in about 10 Minutes. I would choose her house if I were to visit Portland again. And the dog is just so lovable."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jenni's AirB&B is quite delightful for a single traveler. While it isn't a large lace, everything you might need is available; sleeping, cooking, tub and shower, sitting around and hanging out, etc. Jenni is truly concerned that you have a comfortable and enjoyable stay. And I, for one, couldn't resist playing with her dog when I got up in the morning and came back home in evening. The only thing I would mention as a caution is that the side of the tub is pretty high so a bit of flexibility is needed when you get in. Personally, I didn't find it a problem, though. If I could've given Jenni more than 5 stars, I would've!"

2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jenni and Cam (her sweet baby angel of a canine companion) were absolutely fantastic hosts. Jenni has great local suggestions for everything from bars and cafés, to places to pick up quirky gifts. She is a ""Superhost"" for a reason and definitely deserves to be recognized as such.
The place is easy to find and in an excellent location. I love to walk, so downtown and the Alberta Arts District where well within my comfortable walking distance. This may be too far for some, but bus routes are easily accessible and are easy to navigate. I suggest the hopper app for bus fare (just tap your phone to pay!) and the app called, ""transit,"" for bus schedules and routes that are updated live.
There's a cute mini fridge in the room, which Jenni had stocked with an apple and some sparkling water. She also left some other nice surprises for me throughout the week.
Jenni truly wants you to be her housemate during your stay. What I mean is that she wants you to feel safe, accepted, and comfortable. I'm sure she'd also be happy to give you your space if that's more your vibe.
Thanks for a lovely stay!"

2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jenni’s place was as comfy as they come! I had such a wonderful experience at her place. She gave me the run down of everything there was to do in the area & how to best do it.
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jenni was the most wonderful host! Everything about my stay was amazing.
Jenni is so thoughtful about every detail - from the easy to follow directions to her place, to the home cooked meals (which are very, very good), to the personal mini fridge in the guest room filled with refreshments and snacks.
The home is absolutely gorgeous and makes you feel like you’re staying with an old friend. The area is super cute also! It has the best of both worlds in terms of being really quiet and residential, but also full of great restaurants and cute little places to shop.
Upon my arrival Jenni made it clear that her home was my home. And I felt that immediately. If I’m quite honest, her beautiful home, genuine hospitality and delightful company really made my trip. It was my first time in Portland and when (emphasis on when) I return, I know exactly where I will be staying.
Enjoy!"
