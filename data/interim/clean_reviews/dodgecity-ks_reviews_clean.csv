2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,the converted silo is adorable and super clean!! they left farm fresh eggs which i cooked in the morning. bed was super comfy and shower was great. the area is quite secluded and peaceful. the little tortoiseshell cat outside is an absolute angel and a total lap cat too which was personally my favorite part!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I went out of my way to stay at this place because it was so unique. It is the perfect place to stay if you want to get away from it all and just relax for a few days in the country.
The two cats came by and greeted me as soon as I pulled in. There is also a road that has almost no traffic that my dog loved going for walks on. The host also left us fresh eggs to use while I was there.
I have a senior dog who travels with me and I was concerned about the stairs to the upper level bedroom and he had no issues with them."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a fun and unique spot to stay in! The space was clean and super affordable.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful place! Highly Recommend! We hope to come back!
The Grain Bin Inn was wonderful. We only stayed one night on our way home —but could see staying longer. The place was lovely and the kitties were a great welcoming committee. The bed was more comfortable than ours at home. Really appreciated the standing fan in the bedroom at night and the heated floors in the morning. The Keurig coffee maker was very welcome and Brent left us excellent coffee capsules. The kitchen is well appointed with a good sized fridge, microwave, and 2-burner electric range.
I was concerned when I saw how close the cows were to the Bin, but the smell outside was minimal (if at all).
Brent was very responsive and gave us recommendations for where to eat during our drive, as well as in town. We got there about sunset and had a pleasant walk down the center of the empty road, with the sound of cows lowing and calves scampering, and the flowering trees were so pretty. Loved sitting on the front porch swing!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The location is incredibly quite, night sky viewing is spectacular!
Brent and his family have done amazing work on crafting a memorable place to stay.
Loved the cats, cattle and song birds in the morning.

Highly recommend the Grain Bin Inn.
Thank you Brent and family."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was a highlight of my road trip. They did such an amazing job creating a luxury stay in a grain silo in the middle of Kansas. I was floored. If I’m driving through again I would definitely stay here and I told all ot my friends. It’s pretty special
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely wonderful place. You can tell the owners put a lot of love Into making it perfect. They have added all of the perfect touches. Our only regret is that we could not stay longer.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was great! The bed was really comfortable. For a couple or small family it was really nice! My 2 year old grandson loves farm animals and when he and his mom were outside watching the cows, one of the owners, Jean, and 2 of their kids came out with “cakes” for the cows. We all came out to feed the cows! Our grandson had a blast! Jean also brought out a duck, took him to see a horse and chicks, and the farm equipment! On top of a peaceful place to stay, they were the most hospitable Airbnb owners I’ve ever encountered! Thanks so much for an experience we’ll never forget"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cute farm with a private grain bin to stay in. The theme of the bin is quaint and appropriate. My wife loved playing with the farm cats who took a shine to her, the cows were slightly timid at first but flocked to us once they grew comfortable.
Everything in listing is accurate with a very gracious host. If you’re anywhere near this place in Kansas this is a must-stay place as long as you’re able to climb stairs!"

The space was very cute and very clean. No weird loud noises to complain about. Even when it rained or was windy, you weren’t bothered. Looks just like the pictures!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very cute, clean, and comfortable Grain Bin. We loved the Grain Bin! Listing details were very accurate. Brent was helpful with timely communications. It was a very nice and relaxing stay. Highly recommend and we hope to return when in the area."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We love the creative and unique and the Grain Bin Inn fit that perfectly! This was a fun destination, but also a comfortable, homey, nice place to discover. It was worth the dirt road path to the door! We enjoyed a beautiful sunset with a few lowing cows and several sociable kitties. Make sure you can handle the steps between upstairs and down, but that wasn’t a problem for us and added to the charm! Not sure if they’ll always be available, but we were pleasantly surprised by the farm fresh eggs awaiting us which added to a nice country breakfast in the morning!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Unique stay on a working farm. Friendly hosts, cute cats, curious cows. Great views at sunset. Super woodwork construction. Clean and cozy accommodations.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We highly recommend you stay! The place is very welcoming and a peaceful location. Besides it being so cool to stay in a grain bin, it's very clean and beautiful design with a country rustic feel. They provide everything you need in a kitchen to make meals. The bed is very comfy and the room has added touches as LED lights around the ceiling to enjoy the bin's round structured ceiling! And seeing the cows come up to us and say hello and the barn kitties welcome us made us feel right at home!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Grain Bin lodging was one of the most memorable places I have stayed. We visited in January, and it was freezing outside, but the Grain Bin was nice and cozy! It even had heated flooring on the main level. The setting was picture-perfect with a little taste of farm life all around. We loved the solitude and peace and quiet. We would definitely stay again."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a beautiful transformation of a grain bin! This place is a hidden gem. It was rainy for my overnight, I loved hearing the rain on the tin roof."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Highly recommend, would stay here again!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was one of our favorite places to stay, especially traveling with a dog that would normally react to all the noises of other guests coming and going. The remodeling of the grain bin was beautifully done. Brent was very quick to respond to our messages. We ended up arriving really late and it was no problem with the keyless entry. Out golden/lab was super excited to stay here, and we all slept really well. Then we woke up to beautiful surroundings and had fun talking to the cows, too. We definitely plan to return."

I arrived at night. The sky was clear and the view of the stars is amazing.
The location is the perfect get away spot from the hustle and bustle of the city.
From the heated floor downstairs to the beautiful wood work, one can tell thought and loved went into the construction of this location. I will be using them again every time I head west."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing!!!
A beautiful and unique place.
I hope to return"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Grain Bin is one of the coolest accommodations I’ve stayed in. So unique! They’ve done such a nice job with it. The decor is perfect, fits the space well, and they have everything you’d need. It’s warm and cozy and fully equipped. I love the little red vintage table in the kitchen, and the sleeping area upstairs is so neat with the circular lights and the skylight. Bed is comfy and there’s two couches (one upstairs and one downstairs) so plenty of places to lounge. The photos and descriptions are accurate. It’s on a ranch, so waking up to the cows munching in the field outside was an extra treat! At night, it’s peaceful and silent, and the sky is filled with stars. The dirt roads are great for walking the dogs. The nearby town is cute and there’s a nice little coffee shop that serves food too. Classic Americana vibes. I would definitely drive out of my way to stay here again. Wonderful experience!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Secluded rural area, which was perfect for me and my crew. The craftsmanship in building the place was impeccable. I will definitely stay there again if I’m ever in the the area again!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It’s a very cool and unique place! Love the design of it. Brent also was very helpful as we had truck trouble and was able to get us in touch with a mechanic! Everything was very clean and organized! We will be staying there again!

I’ll definitely come back next time :)

Convenient location to stop when traveling through Kansas, great food in town and the locals are welcoming!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place and very unique! Everything was listed correctly, I had wondered about bringing our infant there because of the hazards of heights and no railings, I probably wouldnt say its infant friendly but I was expecting that so no complaint, just a note! Stay was perfect otherwise, very friendly host. Woodwork was also very amazing, a lot of hardwork went into this place and you can tell, I love it ❤ Definitely would recommend for a couple, small group or a family with older kids!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were quite excited to experience staying in such a unique property, and the corn bin did not disappoint! It is so quirky and fun, yet practical and elegant. The inside was not rustic at all! The outside was nice peaceful, relaxing space. We thoroughly enjoyed getting off the beaten track to stay there!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super fun place to stay. We pulled up and a horse was running around in a gated pasture right next to us! We only got to stay for a night, but it was a very unique and fun place to stay. This is great for a remote stay. There is next to nothing in the town close to it, though, just so you know! We brought our own food, the host supplied coffee, and so we were just fine :)"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay in the silo. It had everything you need. Such a unique idea and it was definitely worth checking out and trying.
Only con would be for people who can’t do steep stairs going up to the bedroom. It might be a little tough for some, but very doable if you’re up for the beautiful ceiling that you sleep under.
Loved all the pictures which I think were taken on the farm. We got to see two day old calves that were just born and a beautiful sunset.
Give it a try!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Holy (literal) Cow! What a beautiful place! Clean, unique, private, and decorated with lots of love. This airbnb had everything we needed and more.

If I ever need to stay in this area again, I will definitely book Bren'ts place again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Incredibly peaceful! It was truly a unique experience staying the the grain bin house. It had an amazing layout and design that offered a quaint cabin type experience. The bedroom has a skylight at the top peak of the roof. We had a thunderstorm roll through and we were able to see the lighting flashed above. I would highly recommend for a couple's getaway!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is so cute!! They've thought of all sorts of little extras and it was so well kept that it made us wish we could have stayed longer. We arrived after dark which made things a bit more uncertain finding it, but once there, everything was super easy! The craftsmanship of the space is quite impressive, great use of space (4 of us all slept upstairs) and we would 100% come here again. Note to be prepared for muddy surroundings and roads if storms come through."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Interesting place to stay! It’s always fun to do something unique. Stairs were cool but steep. I wish the weather could’ve been cooler to sit outside but was still neat to look out over the horizon from the front door.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Serenity…peaceful, and quant. What else could you ask for when you need some space away from the city! Great location with the added bonus to feed some Chickens in the morning!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Quirky fun place! Very clean and comfortable. We cooked breakfast and found all the pans, utensils, silverware, etc with no problem. Air conditioning worked well and it is very quiet. We had a great time and would stay there again.
One note, if you have an issue with stairs, the stairs up to bedroom are quite steep but doable, just something to be aware of.
We very much enjoyed it and recommend it."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We were traveling from NC to Utah with two of our grandsons ages 5 & 7. I wanted to stay at unique places along the way and this fit the bill. It was so clean and comfortable. We grilled our dinner while stargazing and drank our morning coffee to peaceful sounds of birds and wildlife. The bed was so comfortable and the lighting in the ceiling was a nice touch. It was our 1st time staying in a Silo and the boys loved it! It will definitely be a lasting memory for all of us.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great little place with an amazing sunset. Kids really enjoyed the unique layout and feeding the chickens. Place had all the amenities we needed as a family to enjoy the night.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a cute, relaxing place to stay. It had all the charms of a farm, including chickens that you could feed with grain from a coin operated dispenser. The silo was tasfully converted into a small living space that accommodated our family well."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was a very good, albeit idiosyncratic, AirBnB. It is remarkably comfortable, especially the bed and the entire upstairs area. The kitchen is more than serviceable, though it may feel a bit cramped if you're trying to make a more elaborate meal. My dog and I were just passing through, but we were able to explore the area on foot. There's definitely plenty of dirt roads to walk all around as far as the horizon. This is a farm setting, so the outside does feel like a farm, but inside the place was clean, comfortable, and decently well-appointed. Definitely great for a quick stop-over and a restful and relaxing night (but beware of the patter of the rain on the roof!)."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very neat place to stay.. not too far from town to grab a bite to eat. Loved the chickens greeting us! Bring quarters so you can feed them! Will definitely recommend and be back
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,So thankful that our cross country road trip gave us the opportunity to experience Ness City and also Brent's unique accommodation. It was a major highlight for our family. Beautiful spot and we loved the chance to get up close to the two horses on the property and cows too. Peaceful spot but also just a short drive from town where I would also highly recommend checking out the Mexican spot which served authentic dishes and tasty margaritas too. The grain bin was immaculately kept and we only wish we could've stayed longer.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay at the silo. Will highly recommend to anyone!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful experience!
We loved it, everything was clean & as described, they thought of everything in designing the silo to make the stay comfortable! It was amazing!
It was also peaceful & quiet. The free range chickens were so fun, being able to feed them was great :)
We would definitely stay again.
Thank you very much!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you have the chance to stay here you MUST! It is beautiful, quiet and the bin is stunning. The chickens made our whole trip and the hosts are amazing!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was our 2nd stay at Brent's place. We have to escape fireworks around July 4th for the sake of our dog. It serves this purpose and gives us a peaceful stay away from city life.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We loved our stay here! Very well made and plenty of space. The bin had everything we needed. We also got to see a beautiful sunset right outside the door. Would definitely stay again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"When comparing to other 5 ⭐️ I have given, Brent and Jean’s very cozy and cool Grain Bin Inn, should have a way higher amount of stars! Very tastefully done and decorated with a very comfortable bed. Fun with the chickens. We went on a short stroll and they followed us 😄 We got to enjoy a beautiful sunset too. Thanks a lot! Would love to come back and highly recommend this unique place."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"So unique to stay in a grain bin. They really used every inch to max capacity. Family of 4 (2 adults and 2 teenage boys) had enough room, but would be perfect for couple. It was a really cool idea!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The grain bin was such a fantastic and fun stay! I took two young kids and the stairs were a little daunting but we were careful. We got in late at night and couldn’t really see the setting so when we woke up the morning view was breathtaking! The kids loved the chickens who came to visit.
The bin was very clean—shockingly so for a grain bin! At first there were a few flies but bug-repellent oil was provided in the bathroom and it worked like a charm. If you are traveling through Ness City and like unconventional adventures, try and check out the grain bin. Join the small number of people in the world who have slept in a grain bin!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Really cool place. Private, clean, comfortable, and unique. The space was very interesting and modern, which was a nice juxtaposition to being out on a farm in Kansas. Very peaceful out there and beautiful sunsets! Would definitely stay again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful home to stay in!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Brent’s place was a totally unique experience. Very impressed with the renovation of the space. Nice and clean and very quiet. We would definitely stay again if in area. Also very technically up to date with scan barcode wifi and scan barcode checkout.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous and cozy. Great place to stay!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a unique home, loved it. The free range chickens visit was so funny. Peaceful surroundings but close to town too."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was meticulously done! Attention to detail -woodworking is flawless! My boyfriend, a contractor, couldn’t find a thing at all he would fix and he always does. I loved everything about the inside including the vaulted lighted ceiling in the loft. LED colors made it look so cool at night. It was also fun feeding the horses !!! Cows kept their distance but probably was because of my young large breed pup was barking at them! Host went above &beyond-We bought steaks at the local grocery but had failed to look if the propane tank empty so host sent a full tank so we could keep our dinner as planned. Only problem I came across was the horse flies that kept fat the door & coming inside! ohhh they loved to bite me in particular and it hurts! (I always attract mosquitoes too) host did bring essential oils to deter. If it wasn’t for the pesky insects it would have been perfect! But it was still one of our best Airbnb spots ever 5⭐️ one tip- if you like to sleep in bring a sleep mask- skylight"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It was so cool to stay in the Grain Bin Inn. We didn’t get to be there for very long, but it was cozy and had everything we needed!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I love tiny houses and always try to stay in them when we travel. I enjoyed this stay! It was off the beaten path and very peaceful.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the most relaxing and peaceful vacation we have ever had. It was clean, the farm was great. Beautiful sunrises and sunsets. If you want the country and peace, we highly recommend staying here. If you are just looking for an overnight stay, we recommend. Little hole in the wall bar in town with good food and friendly people. We will be going back."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Staying at the Grain Bin Inn may be one of the highlights of my life. I am in awe of the thought and work that went into the design and completion of this little cottage/tiny place! I loved that the interior looked exactly as it had in the photographs, and although it is clear that it had had visits for the previous six nights by different guests, it was immaculate and pristine when we stepped in. We arrived at the grain bin during an intense rainstorm and had a fairly challenging drive for several miles before arriving - it's easy to imagine it might have been a little noisy and bedraggled by the mud and wet, but we felt so cozy inside and the sound of rain on the roof was actually a wonderful 'white noise' for our sleep! Locals at the town bar knew of Brent's family's work on it, but seemed stunned that we would drive so far out of our way to stay there. We loved the sound echos under the loft roof and under the awning. The hens ran to say hi first thing, ending a perfect stay!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One of the best bnb’s we’ve stayed in - for value, cleanliness, charm, conversion/construction. The farm fresh eggs were an awesome touch! We also liked having the QR codes for wifi pw and checking out. We had all the supplies needed. Host has done an outstanding job with this property. I stepped outside this am and the only sound I heard were bobwhite quail. Relaxing!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Fabulous experience. We arrived much later than expected yet had all aspects of a quiet country evening. We could clearly see all the stars and constellations right off the front porch and experience the farm and horses in the morning. A small taste of clean country living in a unique well crafted grain bin.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Unique property nestled in the heartland of western Kansas. We were welcomed by a small flock of free range chickens who seemed to enjoy feed from a converted gum ball machine. The grain bin is comfortable well kept and just the right place to get away from the craziness in the world that surrounds us. We will be back again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The Grain Bin Inn was a fantastic stay. It really enhanced our experience on our road trip. There is a super fun chicken feed machine that takes quarters. The inside was homey and well decorated. This was a last minute booking and Brent was quickly responsive and flexible. I loved this stay and you need to book here!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"There were so many little extras, from farm fresh eggs and a skylight to a feed dispenser for the chickens and Fire TV. It's a lovely little property and a fun experience!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Needed a place to stay on our roadtrip through Kansas, this was perfect!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The silo was much more spacious than we had anticipated. They had a great variety of pots & pans sizes and spices. Farm fresh eggs were left for breakfast - which was a lovely surprise! The checkout process was extremely easy with a QR code to scan. Overall, a fun and unique find!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Grainbin Inn was easy to locate and easy to access. The interior feels spacious, all things considered. My children enjoyed the close proximity to the horses and cows and interactions with the chickens (bring plenty of quarters). We found the citizens of Ness City to be friendly as well. We can't wait for our next trip to the bin."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved our stay at the grain bin! It was a perfect peaceful overnight stay. So affordable too. Highly recommend this place!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Brent was amazing to work with! We asked if we could check in before 5:00 and he was very accommodating.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a great little place! So much charm. The bed was comfortable! The kitchen was very clean and had everything we needed to cook dinner and breakfast (they even supplied some fresh eggs from their free range chickens). The bathroom was squeaky clean and had everything one might need. We loved this unique pace to stay and highly recommend you give it a go!
Thank you , Brent, for a great stay!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We only had a short time at this airbnb, but we really enjoyed it. The outside and inside were super cute and felt safe. Nice and clean and practical."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is one of the best AirBnBs I've ever stayed at! Peaceful, clean, innovative. What an amazing up cycle! Everything was thought of. I had absolutely everything I could ask for, including cornfields for my traveling companion to zoom through."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing stay! Our family of 4 were traveling from Illinois to Colorado and I found Brent’s place while searching for a halfway stop to stay overnight. It was perfect! My kiddos (13 and 5) loved seeing the horses when we arrived, and chickens outside the front door when we woke up. Everything was clean and comfortable and we will definitely stay again on our travels next time!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you for hosting! This is a great tiny home (grain bin) away from everything. A great value and alternative to any hotel in the area. I definitely recommend this one for a quick overnight if you are traveling through the area.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was such a unique place to stay and I loved it. I was super impressed with how they utilized the space to make it feel so cozy.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Was a great experience, well worth the price of stay."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The grain bin is essentially its own apartment. Such a great idea!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Adorable place! I really loved the uniqueness of the home! Clean and lovely! Hosts were great and we were greeted with enthusiasm by the hens! We also had good conversations with the locals at Cuppa Joe in town. Very charming!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay and our family of four really enjoyed our time at the Grain Bin! it had everything we needed and more. Thanks for sharing your place with us.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great stay!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay - highly recommend. Very nicely up-cycled grain bin - beautiful craftmanship in every detail. Hosts thought of everything I needed. Was fun watching the cattle and chickens and hearing the farm noises. Beautiful place to spend some time. Very peaceful.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Grain Bin was perfect! It's a little oasis in Western Kansas. Only a few miles from town, it's easy access to Ness City, but it still affords a totally private and peaceful place to stay. It was super clean, and we marveled at how cleverly they had fit everything into the grain bin. There wasn't a thing missing: It had great WiFi, basic kitchen needs, and a super comfortable bed."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Grain Bin Inn was our first overnight stop on our road trip from MN to AZ. We are so glad we stayed at this gem! Brent was very friendly via messages and the instructions on where to park and how to get in were helpful/accurate. When we pulled in we were greeted by the chickens and cows! It was so cute. We loved having them outside the front door and were super surprised there wasn’t any bad odor. The place itself is even better than the photos! The bathroom, kitchen, and bedroom were nice and clean and there was plenty of hot water for showering. The location was peaceful and felt private. We enjoyed our dinner on the bench provided, relaxed on the front porch swing, and went for a little nighttime walk on the dirt road. Definitely recommend staying here! It’s worth the stop."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Really unique place to stay. The Grain Bin is modern and comfortable and super close to cows and chickens!... I loved being right in the middle of so much farm land.. excellent place to relax and watch the sun set.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a unique place to stay, nestled in the quiet countryside. The host was very good with communication and did everything he could to make us comfortable. We would definitely stay there again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The craftsmanship of this Air BnB is over the top. The bedroom was quite spacious and the bed very comfy. If you'd like to experience a unique lodging experience, this would be the place."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Brent was extremely responsive and helpful! We drove 15 hours all the way from Ohio and arrived pretty late and the fresh eggs that they so kindly gave us saved us after that long trip! Beautiful and unique place to stay!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I was caravaning with my 85-year-old parents and our 90-pound dog. (They aged out of their retirement community in AZ. They are a bit frail.) We drove out of our way to stay at Brent's place. My wife and I have a farm in the Red River Valley of North Dakota and are considering turning 3 of our granaries into Airbnb rentals, and we wanted to see Brent's place. All I can say is WOW! He is a craftsman. The grain bin is 1) beautiful, 2) comfortable, and 3) well-designed and appointed. Because welcomed rain was falling, we mostly stayed inside, and there was plenty of living space. The heaters worked very well, and the beds were comfortable. My mother could not negotiate the staircase, so she slept on the futon bed on the main floor, my father slept in the master bed upstairs, and me in the hide-a-bed upstairs. We were all comfortable, slept well, and TRULY ENJOYED the artistry of Brent's construction work. AMAZING. He sets a HIGH BAR for us, should we proceed with our plans."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Brent’s place was very easy to find and located in a beautiful area in western Kansas. I loved being able to drink my coffee on the front porch of the grain bin inn and listen to the pheasants cackling from the CRP in the distance.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We came here for the unique accommodations, and it did not disappoint. Great, peaceful, very unique place to stay. Great place to unwind. Brent was very helpful though we did have an issue with the BBQ grill. Would definitely recommend staying here to anyone though it may not be everyone's cup of tea."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I frequent Airbnbs all over the country and this is one of my absolute favorites thus far. There were many little extras that made it just perfect for our stay on our road trip. Book this one! You will be glad you did.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Can not say enough good things about Brent and Jean They are amazing Hosts. Peaceful place. We will be back again.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,If you have never slept in a grain bin you have to sleep here. Worth the drive to visit. Waiting for an excuse to go back. The place was so iconic for peaceful plains experience.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Only stayed for a night, but the Grain Bin Inn had everything we needed and then some. Such a fun experience to stay in a converted grain bin in general, but this grain bin in particular was amazing. All of the thoughtful touches and decor were great. Brent was a great communicator and it was fun to wake up and see all those awesome cows! Absolutely would recommend the stay here."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Grain Bin Inn is one of the absolutely best Airbnb stays that I have ever encountered! What a clean, cozy space that felt like home right away and was an oasis for this weary traveler. Brent was very accommodating in allowing a late check out even though they had another booking scheduled for that night and was very kind to answer all of my questions promptly. I was thrilled to enjoy this space while I watched the sunset from the front porch swing and definitely plan to come back in the future as well as recommend it to family and friends!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great getaway from crazy busy life. Sunrise and sunset beautiful

Local accommodations were only a 10 minute drive away."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay! The place was amazing, peaceful and so original. Brent was a great host! He went above and beyond to make our stay wonderful. Brent gave us an early check in and he even supplied us with fresh eggs. Brent and his wife are great host and genuine people. Would recommend to anyone."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a fun, unique stay. We were welcomed by cows and chickens upon arrival. The sunset was beautiful and the star gazing was amazing. Staying in a grainery was such a cool experience. The interior design was well planned. The woodworking made it warm and inviting. Even in such a small space the kids were able to find their own little space to read or play cards. Two TVs prevented a sibling brawl. Brent and Jean allowed us a lot of privacy, and were great, responsive hosts."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"beautiful place, welcome by the cows and chicken and neat little place in Kansas. it is a beautiful place and the hosts are wonderful."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The moment we pulled into the property, we were in love. The cows were eager to great us and the air was clean and refreshing. We booked the stay at the Grain Bin so we could divide our travels up and we are SO GLAD WE DID! We were expecting something unique, but this was far beyond our expectations. The Grain Bin was exceptionally clean and comfortable, and the views of the countryside were breathtaking. The kitchen is was well-stocked as well as the bathroom. The bed was exceptionally comfortable. We felt so lucky to be able to experience this little slice of heaven. Thank you so much to Brent and Jean for the break from the road. We will definitely be back as we travel through this area a few times a year."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had an excellent time at the Grain Bin Inn. It was very unique and just what we were looking for on our trip.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Peaceful and relaxing!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay at the Grain Bin. Our family enjoyed the thoughtful design and attention detail they put into the space. We woke up and fed the chickens and said good morning to their cows. Our kids loved every minute of it. It was a true Kansas experience and we’d love to come back some day.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place that I will be returning to.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Having been on a whirlwind road trip for 10 days, we wanted to have a fun destination to look forward to on our last night of traveling…and Brent’s place did not disappoint! That family deserves some kind of international award for the creativity, ingenuity, attentiveness to detail, care, and pure GRIT they must’ve poured into this endeavor. We had a blast."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,we had a great time thank you again
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My second time staying here. I love it. Can’t recommend it enough!

2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,This house was extremely comfortable and had everything we needed for our stay. Taylor was always very responsive whenever we reached out with questions. We would definitely return and stay here again!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a beautiful house! Interior is just like the pictures! Exterior is more beautiful in reality than the pictures show! Having two young children the kid’s room was amazing for them—they didn’t want to leave and to top it off there’s a gorgeous little park and playground right across the street—soo incredible! The kids were soo happy, I just wish we had a longer stay! Neighborhood seemed super peaceful and quiet! Highly recommend for couples or families!"
2023-10-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"While she sounded courteous, she lacked the availability that a host should have. We locked ourselves out of the house twice; the second time, we had to call a locksmith ourselves. Taylor said her husband would be available to help, but he never answered his phone. Also, there weren't instructions on how to use the appliances. Even asking the host about them provided no genuine help."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great stay! Nice neighborhood, beautiful home, had everything we needed. Would love to return sometime :)"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house was in a quiet neighborhood. The living room and dining area was welcoming and nicely laid out. Our family was very comfortable staying there.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home and wonderful place to stay!
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"We ABSOLUTELY LOVED this place!!!!
When we first pulled into the neighborhood....we all OOOH'd. Then when we pulled up to the house we all AHHHHH'd!!!! We were so Pleasantly surprised by what a Cute Neighborhood!!!
When we got into the house, we all Gasped again and squealed like school girls when we saw the Kitchen and the cabinets!!! The house is just as beautiful in person as it is in the pictures.
We were in town for a workshop at the Depot Theatre, and found that not only was this location perfect (as it is literally straight up the road), but it was so comfy to come ""home"" and relax. There were 3 of us staying, and we all had our own bedroom....but it felt like we all had our own SPACE as well!!!
We sat on the super comfy furniture late into the evening and giggled because we mostly talked about how cute the decorations were.
I have already suggested this place to two of my friends that love to make ""staycations"". Book It....It's worth it! :)"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was Great!!! Will use again in the future. Thank you for opening up your home.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a beautiful home. Very spacious for my family and I (total of 6; 5 adults and 1 teen). We had enough room for everyone to have their own space. The hosts were very easy to get a hold of if we had any questions. The home is in a very nice neighborhood. I would recommend this home to others.

We greatly appreciated all of the special touches that made it feel like home. Beautiful decor, non cluttered space, family games, cozy blankets and seating and just as described! My husband and I enjoyed dancing to songs playing on the record player. We look forward to staying again!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Taylor’s place is about 1 mile from Boot Hill and all the action. Her house is very beautiful, immaculate, pristine, filled with very nice unique touches. We absolutely loved it, especially the kids park across the street. There is plenty of things to do inside and outside! Get the Marshall plan at the museum, you get the gun battle show, dinner and a variety show. I highly recommend Taylor place and we would stay again if we come back….."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Taylor's place is so amazing! She has everything you could need for your stay and her place made you immediately feel like home. This place was squeaky clean and very spacious. The backyard was awesome for our dogs and it made us feel safe they had a great place to run around. We would absolutely recommend this place to anyone who wants to visit Dodge City and thank you so much for allowing us to stay at your beautiful home!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Communication before arriving was easy and I felt comfortable before even getting there. The house itself felt like home.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had an absolutely perfect stay. I highly recommend Taylor's beautiful house to anyone!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Taylor’s place was wonderful and exactly what we needed as we passed through Dodge City on our way to California. The home was in quiet, beautiful neighborhood with a golf club a block away. My wife and I walked around the neighborhood admiring the homes and the extraordinary trees everywhere. The lawns were all so green and beautifully kept.
The home itself was perfect. The living room is definitely the center of the home and was very comfortable and “homey”. Being there only one night, we didn’t really use the kitchen or dining room, but both were clean and lovely. Bathrooms were clean with ever we needed.
Taylor was very communicative and friendly. I would highly recommend this airbnb if you are traveling to Dodge City."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Lovely place. Felt right at home. We will be happy to stay here again when we are in the area.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I wish I was staying in Dodge City for more than one day just so I could stay in this beautiful home longer. This home feels like a peaceful retreat. The location is quiet, the house is well appointed and stylish, and the the bed was very comfortable (and I am picky about pillows!). Not sure if/when I will be back through Dodge City, but if I ever do, this will absolutely be my home away from home."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Such a great place! Everything was spotless and cozy. Taylor was great to work with and provided a fully stocked home. We had everything we needed and more. Highly recommend!

2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Really enjoyed this home. The host was extremely friendly, responsive, and included lots of amenities to make you feel at home. The kitchen remodel is beautiful and very tastefully done. I look forward to the magic she'll create with her others rooms. I liked the age of the house and would have welcomed history of it! Boy, if those walls could talk!
We did have a couple of older people with us that had trouble navigating the stairs. I don't know that it was the best choice for us given the lack of a handrail and their mobility issues."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing time! The house was great!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,This is a family friendly home in a great neighborhood. Cozy furniture and comfortable beds and Netflix. Lots of room. The updated kitchen is beautiful and open to living room. Great book collection. It wasn’t warm enough to enjoy the nice outdoor area. Host responsive to all my requests especially gracious with complicated arrival! Would stay again for sure.
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is a wonderful place, in a wonderful neighborhood, with a wonderful host. My family and I really enjoyed our time here it had everything we needed and more. I have never been in an Airbnb that was so overstocked with amenities. We visit dodge regularly to see family and this is by far my favorite place I have stayed. Hopefully next time I come out this place will be available because I would be sad to not stay here again. Thank you for hosting us."

2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Perfect cozy house!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Charming house in a beautiful peaceful neighborhood. Lots of comfy places to sit, a huge tv, and a personalized recommendation list for the area. The bed was comfy and though we got takeout, the kitchen setup was lovely and looked like a nice place to cook a meal. The fenced in yard was greatly enjoyed by our dogs after they were cooped up in the car for travel."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Excellent stay. Clean well kept home in a very nice and quiet neighborhood. Would be perfect for a family with the park across the street. There is shopping very close by. Taylor was great, making sure check in and the stay went well."

We liked being so close to the park and even the grocery store! We liked the large sectional and giant tv! Our family of 5 felt comfortable and had plenty of space. We were disappointed that some of the amenities were not conveniently available I.e. board games, ps4, bikes. Check in/out was easy, and we liked the info book waiting for us. We loved Taylors style and can’t wait to see what she does with the bathrooms! Fantastic home."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was was great, clean, neat and ready for us. Because we had two in our party with walking problems the stairs were a little of a problem. They were able to handle them ok. For myself I would stay again if in the area."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a cute, comfortable home and perfectly located. There is a park across the street, beautiful neighborhood to walk through, 2 minute walk to the grocery store and not far from the heart of Dodge City. Taylor's home was clean and welcoming. So many books to choose from her bookshelf to sit on the front porch and read while you drink coffee in the morning."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I booked Taylors beautiful home for a crew we had working in the area. Four people in all. The house was clean, roomy, and well stocked. All the amenities you would need are included. I have already booked another 2 week stay. Taylor was great with communication before, during, and after the crew initial stay."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Accommodated our family of 8 very well. Convenient location in Dodge City when attending a wedding, and visiting Boot Hill Museum."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loretti was an amazing host. very accommodating to our special needs throughout our stay. Definitely recommend a stay in her home.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loretti's place was immaculate. The beds were extremely comfortable, as were the linens. I love the charm of an older home with modern updates. It's an adorable bungalow with plenty of space. It was the perfect space for a family traveling with older kids (you know how they love their privacy.) We weren't on top of each other and it was really nice to have a place to relax. The location is really convenient to access and close to main streets. It is within minutes to grocery stores and under 10 minutes to the arena/casino. We would definitely stay here again. Loretti was great at communicating and very friendly."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loretti was great and responded quickly to any questions I had. The house was perfect for our stay :)
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The host was nothing less than wonderful. When we needed an extra night she jumped on it to help us with out having to rebook with all the added on fees. The house was clean and clutter free. Only issue we ran into was the water was either to hot or to cold, we could never figure out how to get it right, which is our fault, not the host. The yard was perfcet size for my dog to feel right at home, and we loved how everyone was spread out with there own space to enjoy. We will book again if we travel to the area."
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Good place to stay if you need multiple bedrooms. Older house that was redone so the layout is interesting but it worked well for our needs and everything worked well. It’s really close to the Dodge City field which was key for us.
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Loretti was very responsive. The house was cute and was able to accommodate 7 adults. Thank you for everything.
2024-02-01,4.0,Group trip,"Nice and spacious area upstairs, we had a group of six. Easy check in and check out process. Anyone tall would probably want to stay upstairs. The ceilings are lower in the basement ☺️"
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Excellent stay, everything clean, very pleasant my stay! Thank you very much!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cozy home! Loretti was quick to respond to any questions and very helpful! We enjoyed our stay!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,nice cozy place very comfortable.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This small place was just the right size for me and close to the event I came to attend. Shar was great to work with and responded promptly to all my questions. I would recommend.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great place to stay! Stayed almost 3 weeks for work. House is in a perfect location close to all the amenities and Shar was excellent at communicating back promptly to our questions. Definitely recommend this place to anyone!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Nice well kept place on the inside.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Stayed here for a week. Cozy spot. Great Mexican spot maybe a mile away you gotta try called Tacos Jalisco
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great place to stay!!
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you're aware of Dani Sandoval,this is a place worth checking out. However if you are ""portly and a bit geriatric"" (Big and old) this might be a questionable place to spend much time in since it is tight to pass in the hall and with a front approach approaching safety issues. The town from this side of the tracts has a lot to see. The address is quite proximal to finding and touring Dodge City.
Nice wrap around couch with lounge seats."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lea Ann provided us with a great stay! We arrived to find breakfast (several choices including delicious cinnamon rolls), snacks and coffee choices. The decor is in neutral colors and relaxing - exactly what we needed after a long drive - with just enough personal touches to make it homey. It was wonderful to walk in to the living room with a ""fire"" putting off pretty glow. Lots of hot water, towels and other items in the bathroom that covered all of our needs. There is also a laundry set up in the back of the house that we took advantage of. The neighborhood is quiet, and there is a large yard available. I was especially appreciative that Lea Ann removed several scented items for our visit, as I have occasionally had issues with air fresheners, etc. Husband Gary stopped by for a quick hello and made sure we were set.
Lea Ann's home is a bargain. Having stayed in a LOT of airbnb's over the years, I know that she is very low compared to what is offered in other homes."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The level of love and dedication the owners put into this ""Little Trolley"" (across street from another of Lea Ann's properties) is felt when you walk through the door. Every piece of furniture is efficiently placed and the decorations are very special. You will just have to see them yourself! Martha Stewart would be envious. The hosts are super friendly and exceedingly helpful. I can't wait to stay here again!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"There were so many little touchs that made our stay so cozy and welcoming. They had everything we could need, like kids & adult games, toys, coffee bars, snacks, magazines, plenty of shower products, lotion, etc. Highly recommend staying here!!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Lea Ann’s place was wonderful, and Lea Ann as a host was amazing!
So many thoughtful touches everywhere you looked, without being cluttered. It’s obvious that she loves hosting and cares very much about her guest’s experience.
She gave several recommendations for restaurants, but we only had a chance to try one, Judy’s World Famous Cafe, a tiny place in the next town which was well worth the drive.
We only stayed one night, but could have easily stayed longer and would have been comfortable!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Lea Ann was incredibly helpful and communicative. Great instructions in advance to ensure our GPS didn’t lead us astray, with simple entrance access."
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Nice place I’d recommend!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay and nice people
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Guest House is picture perfect inside and out. The interior takes you back in time to a tranquil more peaceful era. The warm fireplace is a beautiful backdrop on top of the deep stain traditional wooden flooring. Gary and Lea Ann are very hospitable and offer local advice. They will even come over and light up a bonfire for you.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,So comfortable. Smores and fire pit were a wonderful touch!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lea Ann thought of everything. Her place was very inviting and cozy. Much better than staying in a motel.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place was charming and comfortable. Lea Ann went out of her way to accommodate my lavender allergy, and the place is stocked with everything you could need. As a woman traveling alone, I felt safe. And it's nice to know someone is just a text away! I highly recommend this spot."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Lea Ann’s place was better than expected. She and her family were very caring and accommodating.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was perfect during our stay. The house is very cutely decorated and very clean. The hosts thought of everything that could make our stay excellent. From leaving warm cider for us upon our arrival to lighting the firepit and providing everything to make s'mores, we couldn't have asked for a better experience. I highly recommend staying with Lea Ann and Gary... 5 stars - I'd give them 6 stars if I could!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We felt a sense of Americana and History in this area. The vastness was beautiful and peaceful! The home was very comfortable and a great home base for further adventures!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Where do I even begin in describing the best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in? I’m a touring musician and I stay in hotels and airbnbs weekly. I had a gig near hanston and this place was closer and more affordable than a rural Kansas hotel. The hospitality was through the roof. While we were gone, snacks and breakfast items were brought in and Lea Ann even made sure to bring us extra goodies: necessities that we didn’t even consider asking for. Everything we could possibly need was in this adorable little house. It was my moms birthday and Lea Ann brought over a s’mores kit and birthday card. So sweet. The term “hostest with the mostest” was invented for Lea Ann. Look it up, her picture is next to the definition! If you are even CONSIDERING this space, book it now. You’ll be thrilled."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a short last minute stay, and Lea Ann was so accommodating and friendly! We got in super late, but when we got there we felt so at home. The beds and furniture were so comfy, and the surrounding area (yard) and gazebo was pretty. We even got a special treat of seeing some baby birds that had made a nest in the yard! Our three dogs were welcomed, and they enjoyed the yard. Will definitely stay again if/when we are in the area!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fantastic!
Lea Ann is the ultimate” Super Host”!!
Her home is spotless, adorable, and just like Home! She supplies folks with enough food and coffee for breakfast and snacks.
Congratulations, Lea Ann. You have a sweet place for folks traveling through the great state of Kansas."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a great place to stay on our trip. Very clean with all the needed amenities. Located in a small, quaint little town. The perfect place just to decompress and relax. LeeAnn was very responsive and willing to help with anything we might need. Would definitely recommend and would love to come back."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great stay in Hanston! Lovely comfortable home in small town USA. Decorated so cute and stocked with everything you may need plus more! Very comfortable bed. Took the hosts suggestion for the only restaurant in town and was able to meet the owner Evie and hear about life in Hanston. Things we really appreciated from the host were coffee to-go cups and an ample supply of chocolate! Throughly enjoyed our stay!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"An exceptional stay. Lea Ann was a very thoughtful host, and we could easily have stayed longer."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Adorable place to stay, the host has a special talent to make guests super happy and welcome. Place is cozy and comfortable. I loved the outside gazebo to enjoy the night under stars, great touch. I wish have more days to enjoy it."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our short stay! The little house was just perfect with so much charm and character. Our host was so sweet to accommodate an early check-in due to our schedule and traveling with my elderly parents. There were farm fresh eggs that were delicious plus all the fixings to make pancakes! We got ourselves a good breakfast before our long trip home. Really felt like “Home” and we look forward to coming back

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lea Ann’s cottage was one of the coziest airbnb’s I have stayed in. All of the cute decor around the home made it SO homey, they provided milk, juice, lemonade and eggs in the fridge just for us, and when I thought I accidentally left something at the Airbnb, Lea Ann all but flipped the house upside down to look for it for me. Her kindness and hospitality is unmatched. 20/10 recommend! <3"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I love the little place. I felt very safe there. The weather was too cold to be outside to enjoy the scenery, however I had been there about 3 years ago and got to enjoy it then!♡♡ The house was clean, and beautifully decorated. There was extra games for kids to play, and my grands enjoyed that!!!
Thank you for your hospitality!!"

It's in a quiet neighborhood, I thought at first, great it's near a train track and I'm going to have to hear that all night... totally didn't happen, Super quiet. The pictures provided don't do justice to how detail oriented this quaint house has been arranged. It literally has everything a traveler could need. Kitchen.. has fridge, microwave, stove, pots pans dishes silverware coffeepot coffee tea you name it, it's there, plus snacks and stuff for breakfast. Bathroom.. I liked the adjustable showerhead to accommodate a taller person, plus the usual bathroom amenities. Bedrooms were amazing as well, decorated to really accentuate just how cozy this place is.. Wow. The house was well air conditioned, had a washer and dryer. The amount of detail and decor was proof that this place is loved and the hosts put a lot of thought into all they did and had fun doing it. I would 100% stay here again if going through Kansas, or make a point in detouring through here just to have a fun comfortable place to stay. Huge Thank You to Lea Ann and Gary, it was a much needed oasis to relax from traveling. Honestly, if I just wanted a place to get away to recharge... this would be near the top of the list. A+++++"

She takes the BNB part very seriously and left little personal touches for us—bedtime books, toys, kid-friendly plates and bowls, coffee creamer, multiple kinds of coffee, and snacks that really make it feel like home. We would absolutely stay again and have already recommended that friends find a way to visit."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My first trip with Airbnb. Lea Ann made it one to remember! She went out of her way to help our family get some medicine in a rural town.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If I could give Lea Ann’s guesthouse 6 stars I would. Excellent country stay with so many added touches that show the thought and care that went into providing an experience for guests. Snacks, welcome message, scented (gently) wax plugged in at arrival, breakfast beginnings, eggs… and even a decently seasoned cast iron pan! There is a lot to do if you look around here in Kansas- I used it as a stop between art stops (Wilson’s Czech eggs, Lucas’s whole art scene, etc). Wish I could have stayed longer!"

The house was fully stocked with food items and she even went as far to bring bagels and cream cheese by for breakfast (which was in addition to fresh milk, oj, cereals). She offered to have her husband, Gary light the camp fire for s'mores. The home was perfectly laid out, cozy and incredibly clean. Certainly one of the top Airbnb experiences I've had."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Truly a home away from home! We had a short stay, but totally worth it. Lea Ann and her husband were absolutely wonderful and helpful!

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lea Ann's oasis away from home was so cozy and comforable. She was the best host one could request. She didn't impose, but made sure if I needed her she was there. She checked in to make sure I didn't ned anything, but if I did she would get it for me. She supplied anything I would ever think to need. The ""cottage"" was clean and refreshing. It was EXACTLY what I was looking for in a place to getaway and rejuvenate."

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you can find a reason to make Hanston one of your overnight stops, do it. This home will exceed your expectations—at least it did ours. We opened the door and felt like we had come home. That’s not to mention the amazing amenities. If there’s something you like, you’ll probably find it somewhere in the house. Anyway, this was a great overnight stop on our Kansas bicycle vacation."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This little cottage is a bit off the beaten path - but because of that it was very restful place to stay on a rather long road trip we just made. It had absolutely EVERYTHING you might need - and then some. Sweet decor, food in the fridge and cabinets, very comfortable furnishings. We weren't there long enough to enjoy some of the pleasant outdoor features but will if we're back that way again. Definitely a good deal!"

Excellent communication, very clean, very kind hosts."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Super cute little house, and the gazebo was a nice spot to enjoy morning coffee. LeAnn has the house VERY well stocked, we were quite impressed. It was especially nice as there are not food/convenience spots nearby. LeAnn gives great instructions on how to find the house, but we had some difficulty locating the property in the dark with no cell service as we were not able to pull up the emails or listing. As long as you have that info handy without needing to pull it up you will be good!"

This was my second stay with them and they were kind enough to provide a bonfire & s’mores.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a cute and cozy cottage. Nice and cool in the summer, I was invited to adjust the air conditioner to my comfort level. Lea Ann came over with some bagels for breakfast the evening before, which was so nice. The little neighborhood is quaint and quiet. Full use of kitchen, with a REAL coffee pot, ( not one of those cup ones that hotels have), along with a kerick in the bedroom. Just a delightful little farm house in the middle of Kanas wheat country. I took a walk and talked to a neighbor older gentleman, who was passing the time on his porch swing. Truly a wonderful stay💝"

2021-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Lea Ann and her family were probably the most thoughtful and hospitable hosts we’ve ever stayed with on Airbnb. You can tell they really take pride in this home. I would probably stay here again driving through but not for a long stay. The wifi didn’t work during our stay, we found the beds to be uncomfortable, and there was some noise in and around the home (AC and silos down the street). There were some other little snags here and there that were less than ideal. But we loved the bonfire at night, friendly hosts, and they had pretty much anything and everything you may need and more!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,A welcomed oasis in the middle of farm and ranch country. Lea Ann is an exceptional host and her little cottage is adorable. The pictures are true to the real thing. Feel confident making the choice to stay at Lea Ann's country cottage.

This was our first air bnb experience and it definitely won’t be our last! If you find yourself seeking accommodations in the middle of Kansas, you won’t be upset in choosing this home away from home!"

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the best vacation we have ever had, no matter how exotic the past locations have been. The countryside was beautiful and Lea Ann was the best hostess we could’ve ever imagined. The pictures on Airbnb can only show a fraction of how wonderful the cottage is in person. It is stocked beyond the imagination with all kinds of creature comforts and Lea Ann makes sure to check in during your stay to see if you need anything else. We were able to unwind and relax and enjoy our thanks for the wonderful things in our lives because of the quiet reflection of this vacation. I cannot say enough good things about Lea Ann or her cozy cottage in the countryside."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just book it! If you are just stopping for the night or spending a few nights you will be glad you booked with Lea Ann (we will be returning next year). We arrived to the home being stocked with milk, juice, eggs, cinnamon raisin bread, apples, oranges, popcorn, hot apple cider, chocolates, coffees & biscotti plus the cabinet was stocked with food as well.

She left cookies, crackers, and fantastic apple cider out for us when we got there. The whole place was clean and cute. She even had some fresh milk and “farm fresh butt nuggets” for us for breakfast for breakfast! Absolutely amazing! I’d rate 10 stars if I could!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had such a wonderful time at Lea Ann’s place. The festive fall decor was so fun and made us feel right at home. All of her extra touches (warm apple cider waiting for us, cookies, popcorn bags, phone chargers to name a few) were so thoughtful and really made for a great stay as we were passing through town. Definitely come here if you’re in the area, we had a fantastic time!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"LeaAnn's home is an amazing space to spend some time. So comfortable and spacious. And the little touches; it was in the 40's when we arrived and she had a crock pot of hot cider waiting for us. She had a packet of s'mores ingredients for us to use.

It was clean, romantically decorated, everything was top-notch and the hosts were more like family than strangers.

The place is as described in the post and then some! It’s clear Lea Ann has had years of experience in hospitality. She was responsive to our queries before check in, and then we didn’t need to ask her for anything.

The house was tidy and exactly what I was looking for."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A fantastic stay. It isn't that there weren't any issues, as much as it was so well thought out that everything was easy. I never had to search for anything. If I needed a spoon, for example, the first drawer I reached for had the spoons, because that's what made sense
for the space. It is perfectly though out. It's on a quiet street, that happens to be right in the middle of everything you'd want. It's ideal."

The house is as described, very comfortable and plenty of space for our family of three.

We only had one night there but enjoyed our stay and really appreciated how well stocked both the kitchen and the bathroom were. She thought of everything! And how nice to arrive there and find refreshments and snacks! I have to mention that we went to a fabulous place for dinner - Dodge City Brewing. It was dog friendly so we sat out on the patio with our pup and everyone, including other patrons and the wait staff, was so kind. The beer was great and the pizza was amazing! A great visit to Dodge City. Thank you Missy!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a gem! Such a treat feeling like you are back at your grandma’s house. By far the best and most professional upgrades to an older property that we have experienced, while maintaining the charm, coziness and, I suspect, some of grandma’s original beautiful furnishings. Missy is a fabulous host and was helpful with our questions about local dining. The additional small (but huge) attention to details and fall decorations were the cherries on top. Beer in the fridge, tissue and soft Charmin toilet paper are much appreciated luxuries not found most stops. Our dogs were comfortable, too!! Cannot say enough positives about this place. Convenient location and we recommend Thai Garden within walking distance. Only thing that could make it better would be a small privacy fenced area for us dog people. If a house could hug, this is what it would feel like. Definitely felt the love here!!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Missy's place was even cuter in person! And while it is small we didn't find it to be too small. I appreciated the extra touches like cold beverages and cream for coffee at our disposal. This house definitely has everything you need for a short stay.

2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This space was well appointed, easy to navigate and had good amenities. It was really nice to have a dishwasher and a large fridge. The eat in kitchen felt easy to move around in even though it was not huge. The house felt more spacious than one would expect for a small bungalow. The owner clearly took some time to decorate nicely and left out treats for travelers who might like such things as Oreos. There was a lot of scent in the space such as scented candles and the smell of laundry detergent/fabric softener from washing sheets. This would feel great for people who enjoy such things. Appliances in the kitchen felt new and well-maintained, there were plenty of cooking supplies and utensils that felt appropriate. The bathroom was well stocked with any amenity a traveler might need and there was Kleenex in every room. While there were no added pet fees, the taxes and cleaning fee added substantially to the price for a one night stay. This would be a good place for a traveler who wants space with some extra amenities and willing to pay for it. Also seemed like it would be good for a family or a group since there were three beds. It is well appointed for a long-term stay and probably had more than we needed for a one night stop over."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cute house, great hospitality!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved this cute little place! Unfortunately, we were only there for a one night work trip, but we will definitely remember and reserve it for future adventures!"

2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was so clean & tidy, convenient to downtown & Boot Hill (about a half mile if your up for a short walk) and has a large yard if your traveling with furry friends! As an added touch of hospitality Missy also had snacks and coffee available in the kitchen. I would absolutely recommend to anyone visiting Dodge City!"
2020-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Missy's house is small but so much more than a hotel room! The house is newly remodeled and nicely decorated. We needed a kitchen to prepare the rehearsal dinner for our son's wedding and the Holt House had a nice deep sink and provided enough counter/ table space ( with the addition of a folding table from Debbie next door) to get it done! it was also nice to have a yard and living area with which to visit with out of town relatives. Like I said, it's not big, but if you need more space than a motel room, it's a good alternative. We enjoyed the view down the hill out of the kitchen window and the sitting in the chairs on the front porch. Also, having a few extra folding chairs was a plus! We needed them! The only issue I had was with one of the single beds which was ""squeaky"". I am not sure if it was just the headboard or the whole frame, but every time my friend who slept in the bed moved, I could hear it in the next room. Plus the floorboards to the bathroom were squeaky so I didn't get much sleep the first night. However, there was a fan in the bedroom closet and I should have used that to drown out the noise! We did have a few communication issues, but that was because of my phone problems. All in all, I would certainly recommend Missy's place if you are traveling to Dodge. Missy is a sweetheart, and her neighbor Debbie is helpful and easy to work with! I recommend going to the Boot Hill museum while you are there, and eating at Taco Jalisco! We were happy to stay at the Holt House!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,MIssy place was very clean and comfortable. It is very close to town and on a nice street. The beds were very comfortable and we enjoyed the treats that were left for us. Missy responded promptly to our questions and we felt right at home. We had a great stay!

2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,The host Jose was great at communicating and also mentioned to call him if we needed anything. It was a great surprise when we opened the front door because it was so spacious and very welcoming. The kitchen was equipped with what we needed and we were able to park our car in the garage.

The place was close to everything, even though we chose to enjoy the place rather than go out. One of my favorite stays, will definitely not have to look anywhere else when going back to dodge city. Thanks for the stay y’all, my crew and I really enjoyed it."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Heather is a great host. She has a very comfortable space and is very welcoming. We got in late after a long drive and she had snacks and water available. She even had treats for our dog.
The location was a short drive to Downtown Dodge. If it had been warmer we could have walked.
The bed was comfortable and the basement very homey.
There is a small fenced in backyard which was perfect for letting the dog out for a bit in the evening.
I’m not sure if we will have occasion to pass through Dodge City again, but if we do we’d stay again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Highly recommend this place.
Host even has some of her own artwork displayed. If I'm ever in the area again, I'd pick this place over a hotel. Much more room.
One downside is the shower. I'm not a skinny person. If you are claustrophobic it could be an issue. I hit my head getting out. No blood, no worries! 😆
Host communication was fantastic!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I spent two nights in Dodge City and opted to stay at Heather's. This turned out to be great decision. Given the prices of the hotel options in town this is a really good deal. You get so much more for significantly less. The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful but still within walking distance of downtown. You have a supermarket right around the corner if you need anything. Heather was a great communicator and very responsive. I loved how chill and private the basement set up was. I would highly recommend staying here if you're in the area.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Dodge City was the midpoint of my 4000+ mile road trip from my home through the midwest and back. Only staying 1 night at each stop. Alternating between hotels and airbnb.
Heather's place was one of the nicest and roomiest of my whole trip.
Heather came home from work shortly after I checked in and was very friendly. She offered me all kinds of recommendations. She let me spray down my car with her hose to remove some of New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas's insects.

The place was very clean. It seemed like a very safe neighborhood and the neighbors were friendly to me and my wife.

Heather was responsive and quick to please."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Heather was extremely accommodating.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is my second time staying here (this time due to a passing) but Heather went above and beyond to assure we had a pleasant stay. She was flexible with checkin and checkout times due to weather conditions. Upon arrival she made sure the pathway was lit and even made sure the gates were open, it was nice to be able to run in with my baby especially with the cold. I definitely recommend her place and will definitely book again in the future. Thank you Heather for a making our unpleasant trip a wonderful stay."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We were passing through on a trip from visiting family in Oklahoma back home to Denver. We were too tired to drive all the way through so decided we needed somewhere quick to check in and get some rest. My Nana also took me to Boot Hill as a young girl and I wanted to check it out again. Heather’s place was easy to find and on the way. The moment we walked in it was so homey and we could just relax. She reached out and let us know there was stuff for our dogs and snacks for us to enjoy so that was sweet. Highly recommend Heathers place for anyone thinking about staying in Dodge City.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great accommodation for our one night stay on our journey west. Very homey and roomy and the personal touches Heather adds showed her dedication to making our stay comfortable and unique. She even left treats to make our pup feel welcome! Most importantly, both beds were very comfortable and the space was quiet, making for a great night’s sleep. Highest recommendation! One more thing- wish more proprietors would follow Heather’s lead and post an honest price not followed by ridiculously high add-on fees. Thanks Heather!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The photos dont do the place justice. It was super spacious! The patio area was perfect for my dog! Very nice of Heather to have things for my dog, treats toys, etc. She was very friendly and communicative. the place had a home vibe and much appreciated the coffee in the morning before we hit the road.

2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Heather was great to deal with. She was so accommodating when the weather changed and we were forced to delay our trip, and communication was excellent. Nice touches were snacks for us and the dog. The rental is, as she states, a basement, so be prepared for a full flight of outside steps. Overall, it was a good stay."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely great place to stay when in Dodge! Plenty of space especially for the price. Everything was immaculate and comfy. Felt right at home away from home. Stay here, not a hotel, especially for a family-great for even one person. Mini fridge, microwave, comfy bed, WiFi, plenty of room-won’t be on top of each other at all, plus games or just room to breathe and relax. Cute little backyard area to hang out in too."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great place to stay! Just far enough away that you don’t feel crowded by the downtown busyness but close enough to be there in a few minutes.
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Everything was really great. The only thing was it was pretty noisy in the area. We were right by the entrance gate and it beeps loud when it opens. Someone was leaving at 5 am. The dog next door could get excited about things and start to bark pretty loud as well.
Otherwise, really great to have the option in Dodge City near the United Wireless arena."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great hospitality and everything you need was available. I would recommend this place.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Due to the setting it was a bit confusing where the office was (says Marshall’s office above guest area) and someone randomly walked into our rental looking for the office. It was a bit frightening. Modified signage would help. Otherwise we had a nice stay, using this basically for overnight and base for our daily excursions. There isn’t really any onsite activity other than the pool which wasn’t yet open for the season. I would stay again."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,I only say it was noisey with the train passing by. Every train would toot 4 to 5 times at the crossing.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great Air bnb. Was very well supplied with all amenities including laundry detergent etc. quiet, comfortable place that offers far more than a hotel for a lot less money."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had everything needed for a quiet and comfortable stay. The apartment was clean and was as advertised on the website.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Staying together with extended family while we were in town for my mother's funeral made it so much easier than multiple hotel rooms. Jesus was quick to answer any questions and made sure things were hassle-free. Would definitely stay here again!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful space and cool host. When we arrived something had happened to the power and we had very little. The host came pretty quickly after I messaged him. They tried to fix the issue then realized it was something with the electric meter. They called the electric company and got everything fixed pretty quickly. The space has some cool arcade games we had fun playing, it was quiet and perfect for what some friends 2 couples or even a family might need."

2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Overall our experience was okay. The rooms and amenities were as described, and our host was very responsive and flexible with allowing us to check in early. Our major disappointment was in the cleanliness. The floors were sticky and there was food spills on the floor with pieces of food under the couches. When we asked if anything could be done, we were directed to cleaning supplies located in the kitchen, none of which were actual mopping supplies. We had crawling babies so the floor being dirty and not really being able to clean it well was a pretty big deal for us.
If you’re looking for a place to lay your head, it’ll do the job! It might not be right for you if cleanliness is important to you."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Jesus was very responsive and was able to quickly accommodate our spur of the moment need for a place to stay!

2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"We loved staying here during Dodge City Days! The location is great and the amenities are top notch—the place has everything you need to cook, make a cup of coffee, and do laundry. It feels like a home away from home. The RV park was busy, but very peaceful and we had the pool to ourselves whenever we went swimming. Communication with the host was quick and easy. Jesus was very accommodating and responded immediately!"

Thank you!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a perfect location for anyone visiting Dodge City. Great fenced and gated RV Park. I felt safe every morning I went for a walk or run around the park. Pool is conveniently located steps from where you stay. The town is minutes down the road. The park was pretty quiet. But those we did talk to were very friendly. Highly recommend for adults or a family stay. The place is clean and a nice space! Jesus was a great host. Was always quick to respond. Recommended some great places to eat too. We will definitely stay again, next time in town visiting family."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"It was an interesting stay since it was an apartment within an RV Park. A good family friendly adventure! My kids and husband thought it was awesome due to the 4 vintage upright arcade games in the living and dining rooms and the park pool that was just steps away from the front door. Mom didn’t think quite as highly of it but it had everything we needed, including beautiful, comfy beds and a good bathroom. It slept 6 but the house was really only set up for 4 people. 4 dining room chairs, 4 place settings of dishes, 5 places to sit in living area. The couch pulls out for the third bed. Jesus was great."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Jesus was wonderful to work with! He was always very friendly, accommodating, and responded quickly. We would stay at his place again!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"If you like the feel of an RV park with a pool, friendly people and a rustic western theme then there’s no better place in Dodge. We stayed in the Marshals Office and the accommodations were better than expected. A nice firm sofa, comfy bed, safe shower and excellent coffee bar. Wish we could have stayed longer to learn more history and museums."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely stay in the RV park. We enjoyed the “Gunsmoke” setting as well as the vintage arcade games. The takeaway coffee cups at the coffee bar was appreciated. Located close to grocery store and main road.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was the absolute perfect place for us to stay to wrap up my son’s birthday trip! It has everything we needed and more. The pool access was key for us for him and his friends to swim and have a blast. The added fun of the vintage arcade games was the icing on the cake. We also were able to save money by having everything we needed to cook a couple meals. I stay in a lot of Airbnb’s and this one was at the tip top of the list for exceeding my expectations! The coffee bar alone is worth 5 stars!!!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Place was perfect for my family. I have 3 boys ages 5-16. Video games were a nice touch. Pool really close. Comfortable beds and furniture. Close to everything Dodge City has to offer: while you’re in town you must try the Eclectic Cafe (no affiliation to the hosts).
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice inside. Loved the coffee bar and the beds were great. Nice TV and places to sit.
The best part was the video game machines for free."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super clean, comfy beds, and conveniently located. We didn’t realize it was in an RV park, but it wasn’t a problem. Quiet and comfy!"
2023-06-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"NO WIFI, needs some finish work, HVAC is very loud, non-working lamps in bedrooms, half bathroom is a joke, front door latch, taped up windows, he doesn't have an accurate picture of the front or outside of building"

Very genuine person!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The hotel 2nd floor was amazing; we were suddenly in a past era, surrounded by early Victorian charm that must have astounded travelers even back then! The grounds around the hotel were a welcoming, cool shady oasis of ancient lilacs, big cottonwood and pine. Best of all was the conversations with the hostess Kathleen; informative, loving insights from the past bringing depth to understanding today. Deeply grateful."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A very period spacious environment. Kathleen took me on a tour of the unit to make sure I could find everything I needed.

A Must stop if you are nearby!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Suite included personal living room, bedroom, bathroom, and all amenities you will want. Host responds fast and is qualitative.

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kathleen’s place was welcoming and very homey. I really enjoyed staying here and got a really good nights rest.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful! Quaint and quiet.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I would return to this lodging “in a heartbeat” if we travel back to western Kansas/Dodge City. We indeed felt that we were briefly time traveling when we entered the front door of the hotel. The suite itself is a comfortable and spacious three rooms (including bath) with bookcases and soft oriental style carpets on old wood floor. At every reading area there is a lamp, both in the living room and bedroom. The sofa is long and looks new and welcoming for falling asleep reading on a rainy day. The climate control equipment worked well on a very hot summer day. There is great lighting in the bathroom also.
I appreciate good lighting and as these ceilings are exceptionally (such as 19th century) high this is important. Morning sun lights up the front room through lace curtains. There are privacy curtains for night. Quiet ceiling fan in the living room. The table in the eating area is perfect for computer work as well. Coffee for the Mr. Coffee, creamer, water in the fridge, and a small breakfast cake were much appreciated.
Owner Kathleen has been a steward of this remarkable property for decades and will share her knowledge of the 1886 hotel and all things Kansas. She is, as others have written, lovely and personable."

Also don't miss the bakery/coffee shop!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,5 satrs
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,What a fun and relaxing time we had at Kathy's place! The history of the Cimarron Hotel is so rich and one really feels a part of that history staying there. I needed a place to work out of for about 10 days and I travel with dogs for work. The hotel was everything I needed and more. It really felt magical staying in such a beautiful and historical inn. The apartment was spacious and cool even with weeks of over 100-degree heat. The bed is super comfortable and the couch is too. I was able to get a lot of work done in the space while I was there. My dogs felt like queens of the Cimarron Castle. Kathy is a serious dog-lover too. And the yards and grounds of the hotel are gorgeous. So much shade and green grass. I am hoping to return in the fall!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cozy! Loved it
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The room was quaint and as advertised. Fresh cinnamon raisin and blackberry bread, a coffee maker, a basket of snacks and cold drinks awaited us. Our hostess was kind and quite knowledgable. We simply loved our stay!!"

We didn’t plan to sleep in, however we did because the bed was so comfy. We went to the local bar and grill for carry out, and my partner had the chicken fried steak which is a must. We then got a nice Cabernet Sauvignon and enjoyed a glass while reading about the history of the place and browsing the books. I added some Chopin Nocturne for some ambient music while we unwound from the long drive behind us and the long drive ahead. Our dog loved Kathleen’s place and immediately took to napping after his supper and walk. He enjoys some Chopin as well. Kathleen has a very nice dog who greets the guests as they arrive. I would totally stay here again, as the place is cozy for the book lover, quiet, historical, and the hostess is inviting, and very lovely to talk to."

2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The space is incredible!! It’s like you are sleeping back in time. The room is much cozier than I expected, with some nice modern touches that don’t take away from the experience of living in the old west for a night.

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Cimarron Hotel was a unique and interesting stop on our trip across the country. A true historic landmark that Kathleen has preserved. We were comfortable and our dog enjoyed the fenced yard. We are happy we stopped at Kathleen’s Parlor Suite.

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kathleen is the perfect host, excellent communication, so accommodating and a kindred spirit. From offering to set up a tour or a spa day to tips on the best places to find antiques, definitely check out “Remember When” down the street, she was always willing to go above and beyond to make my stay heaven. Thank you!!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a nice stay at Kathleen’s in Cimarron, Kansas.
It's right off the main drag in downtown Cimarron and next door to the post office, but it’s very quiet. It’s an old inn built in the 1800s. You can pull right up front to park, which is nice.
You enter the inn through a traditional lobby and the suite is easily accessed on the ground floor. It was a warm day and cool night but the temperature in the room was very comfortable.
The apartment is very spacious and the sofa and bed were comfortable. The space is clean and there were plenty of towels in the bathroom.
We were traveling cross country with two small dogs. We found a great fenced dog park in Dodge City, where we stopped on the way to Cimarron. We brought salads with us from Trader Joe’s in Omaha so I can’t comment on local restaurants.
Great communication from Kathleen.
A nice, hassle-free stay. Thank you."

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A lovely spot......sweet garden and trees, a green spot in the midst of the Kansas barren landscape with so many feed yards and silos and grain elevartors and not much else. The parlor suite (indeed the hotel) are old, but it is alrge and comfy, good bed, plenty of light to read, a lovely stop off all round. Kathleen is kind and engaging."

Our only regret was that we could not have stayed longer."

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were here for a night on my husband’s birthday. We have always wanted to stay at an old historic hotel and now we have. This place is so charming.

2017-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"My little dog & I stayed in the Parlor Suite, on the ground floor. It's a large sitting room with big windows facing east, a bedroom with a window that opens to the side yard, and a bathroom with a shower. Everything is from years ago, still in working order. Kathleen was pleasant and friendly, and it's a quiet area for a nice walk before getting on the road again."
2017-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kathleen's house was a nice relaxing rest spot on a road trip to Arizona. We stopped in at Dodge first. Would recommend dinner/lunch in Dodge (30 minutes away) as the options near her house are limited to burgers or items with ground beef. We had zero issues checking in, and had a wonderful simple breakfast. Great place to relax after several hours of driving !!!"
2017-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I wouldn't normally start a property review by talking about customer service, but ... wow. Kathleen went above and beyond. In the midst of a hectic tornado of a trip, her timely communications allowed me to relax, knowing that our lodging was handled. She was warm and welcoming, and made us feel completely at home, down to providing personalized cupcakes and banners in honor of my husband's birthday. The space was also very warm, homey and inviting. To quote my husband, ""This is the most ""in my living room"" that I have felt while being away from home."" We enjoyed the feel and decor of the historic hotel and appreciated the readings and photos provided that helped us learn about the building's storied past. We highly recommend the Parlor Suite."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My sister and I stayed here as we were passing through Kansas. Definitely gave little house on prairie vibes. One thing is the address took us down a random dirt road and we had to turn around and re route. Mike did answer our late night call and dropped us a pin which took us right to the cabin. Very clean property

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cute little place! The art is great too! Loved how private it was! Felt safe. Favorite part was the night sky. Great place for star gazing!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We arrived at night and got a little lost. Mike responded to my text with a dropped pin and got us right to the cabin. First impressions inside were great, clean and tidy small space. Very unique in its decor, lots of bespoke touches which we really enjoyed. Next morning, as my husband slept peacefully, I went out to watch the sunrise. Filming the eastern sky, I began to turn in a circle to discover several horses contentedly munching whatever green grass they could find. One lovely lad came right up to the fence to greet me and was very patient with my terrified puppy barking at him for several minutes until she realized he was no threat to her. A magical beginning to our time on the prairie.
So private and beautiful, the loudest noise we heard was either the neigh of a horse or the whinny of a horse. It was a restorative visit to the prairie which more than met my expectations."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Truely remote cabin with great amenities. The weather was a little colder than we hoped for, otherwise would have enjoyed the scenic prairie landscape and friendly horses more. Would definitely stay again."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very peaceful, and beautiful view. Had to give Mike a call due to my cell phone signal going down and he directed me straight to the cabin and was very friendly.

,,,Host never sent the entry code. We arrived and texted the host as directed. No response. We unloaded the car to the porch and waited. Still no response. Finally we gave up and reloaded the car and fortunately found a comfort inn to stay in. About 3 hours later we got an apologetic response from the host. IMHO this host should be remove from the AirBnB platform.
