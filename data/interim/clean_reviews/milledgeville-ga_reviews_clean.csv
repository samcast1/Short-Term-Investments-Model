There were crumbs on the floor in kitchen, the oven was filthy, counters not clean, smelled musty, paper goods not restocked. We would stay again because the location was perfect, golf cart came in handy. We will just buy paper goods and clean like we did this time. Overall, nice place! We loved the back deck and the dock. Also, the two living rooms with TVs were especially nice. Washer and dryer worked great! Thank you for your hospitality!"

We definitely will consider staying here again!!
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"We enjoyed our short weekend In Milledgeville for GCSU Homecoming. The house is very close to the school and restaurants/grocery. We had plenty of room for 8 adults and feel like we would rent again, especially when it’s warm

2022-07-01,5,Group trip,Great Lake house right off of Lake Sinclair. Has a beautiful backyard with a boat dock right on the lake. Great to dock your boat while staying there. The house was very clean and has two family rooms and a beautiful deck overlooking the lake. Bryan was kind enough to even have breakfast items for us. There is also a golf cart that is great for bringing your items back and forth from the dock. Enjoyed our stay!
2022-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"There was dog hair in the corners and behind the furniture. There was little to no communication by the owners, but things were all in working order and there was no need to be in contact with them. The shade at the dock and the golf cart make this stay."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our third summer at this home. The house is close to the marina, centrally located on the lake, and close to restaurants and the grocery store. Easy access to the marina. Golf cart is great to run coolers, towels, back and forth from dock/boat to the house. Layout of the house works well for a large family - kids can be downstairs with their own TV."

2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"WE LOVED IT. I can’t say enough. Due to a real estate issue, our family found ourselves between homes and needed a place to stay for 3 weeks. We made a spur of the moment decision to book the lake house because it wasn’t much more expensive than similarly sized homes in our area of Atlanta. When I tell you that was the best spur of the moment decision I have ever made!! We thoroughly loved our time at the lake house, which truly felt like our home during the time we stayed there. It is very nicely decorated, and I even looked up and purchased a few items from the home for our new house. Looking out on the lake every day was a dream and exactly what our family needed. Also highly recommend renting a boat for a day!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Incredible experience by the lake! This place has it ALL including great views! The owners had thought of everything & we had a great experience. The house was super clean & had so much space for us to spread out. The outside space was awesome too!

2021-11-01,5,Group trip,"This is a great location in Milledgeville, very nice lake front house with a large grass area and dock access. The house is nice and kitchen had everything we needed. Beds are comfortable but sofa bed may be best for kids only. We even had some breakfast foods provided which was a nice touch. Overall a great place to stay!"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Good location on the lake. Had a boat dock to keep my boat under. Very peaceful had seating on dock and next to water to enjoy lunch at or just to enjoy the views. Left breakfast for us to cook which was very thoughtful and nice. Had a golf cart to drive to the dock so I didn’t have to carry everything. If your thinking about staying just do it great place to stay to unwind and relax.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Hidden gem is an accurate description

2021-09-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This really is a gem. We were visiting family nearby and stayed here with our two small children, and it was perfect. The deck on the back of the house is a great spot to hang out with family. The house had everything we needed for our stay, and Bryan was a great host with excellent communication. We rented a boat for a few days to make the most of the sandy beaches on some islands in the lake, and that was the highlight of our stay. We will be back!"
2021-07-01,4,Group trip,bryan is an excellent host. the property has a great view of the lake with a great dock house which had ample room to dock our two boats. the provided golf cart made getting items from the house to the dock extremely easy and fun. the back deck was covered and spacious with a ceiling fan and lighting. the inside was comfortable and the large dining table was great for our family dinners. plenty of parking in front for our boat trailers and vehicles with a circle driveway. be sure to keep your eyes open for all the deer on lakeview drive. we caught catfish just a short distance from the dock. two of which were about 8 lbs. the kids enjoyed catching the little bream at the dock also and there were fishing poles and a tackle box provided if you didn't have any.. we had such an amazing time.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was outstanding
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time at this hidden gem! My husband really enjoyed his time fishing at the lake. We really like the fact that a golf cart was provided for transportation for the land because those were step hills. I would recommend this place to all my friends.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful home. This is our second year staying here. Location is perfect, close to the marina and to the grocery store, restaurants. Beautiful waterfront. Easy docking for our rental boat, in a cove but right off of big water access. Kitchen is well stocked with essentials. Nice covered deck for outdoor dining. Very clean. Easy check in."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This lake house is great! This was actually our second time staying here and it was even better than before, we will be back and I highly recommend it. Bryan’s place is clean and has everything you need. We loved eating our meals on the covered back porch overlooking the water and taking the golf cart to the dock and covered pavilion. The steps into the lake make it a perfect spot for kids to swim. My niece had a blast! We cooked several meals and found everything we needed in the updated kitchen. It’s a great space And the location is excellent!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay here was just great! Plenty of indoor space, lovely outdoor seating + dock and great amenities! Bryan provided breakfast materials which is the nicest touch I’ve ever had at an Airbnb stay...one less thing we have to worry about + spend money on while traveling! He was very quick to respond to any of my messages as well. Would recommend staying here to anyone and we can hopefully visit again one day!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a great spot for our family! It was good weather and we ate on the deck for nearly every meal- and snacks on the dock were so fun!
Games and kid friendly rooms meant parents could relax, and the property made it easy to enjoy the weather.
Kitchen is well- equipped (really, the entire house!) and the hosts really think through all the things you could need for a relaxing lake trip! We had answers to our one question within a few minutes of asking it- wonderful home and wonderful hosts!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Well worth the money. This place is a gem. The neighborhood was gorgeous. It met every need for our group to visit and be comfortable. It is clean with spacious well appointed rooms. The deck offered a wonderful eating area with option to grill along with great views. The dock was easily accessible for me with bad knees as they provided a golf cart, ""Sinclair "".
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Krogers and antique shops were minutes away. If you want a quiet, safe place right on the lake this is for you."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was awesome! Bryan was very responsive to our questions before and during our stay. He was so thoughtful to leave us breakfast items, kitchen items (spices, coffee maker, oil), golf cart to use on the property, extra fish rods. The entire family enjoyed the whole week-fishing (we came home with 100 lbs of catfish and caught a few blue gill off the dock), boating, and relaxing by the lake. Thanks Bryan!"

2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,House was spotless and nicely set up. We spent most of our time out on the back porch enjoying the calm and the view.

2020-12-01,4,Group trip,The house is in a good place but just would like for the host to have better communication
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was beautiful, we loved just sitting in the back near the lake in the mornings to start the day. If we get to come back we’ll be sure to try and find this place again. So worth it for a place that just lets you disconnect from everything else if you wanted to."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful property with all needed amenities. Did not get to go by the lake as it was unseasonably cold. But the view was spectacular. I was able to enjoy the peace and quiet, and see cardinals and blue jays playing by the patio, as well as ducks milling about. Accessible to many food options and grocery store, while remaining secluded. I would love to go back in the spring/summer and use the lake and sit outside."
2020-12-01,5,Group trip,Truly enjoyed our stay. The location was great and the cleanliness was outstanding! It was very beautiful.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable home, in a lovely neighborhood, with beautiful views... need I say more. Thank you for sharing your lake house."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My two daughters and I took a “weekend getaway trip” and booked this hidden gem. My daughter is a student at GCSU and we wanted a place that would be convenient for all of us to stay. This house had everything that we needed for a relaxing weekend away: board games, a fireplace, deer to watch, fishing from the dock , and of course the gorgeous lake. We especially enjoyed being so close to grocery stores and downtown Milledgeville without feeling like we were smack dab in the middle of town with all of the students. Bryan was so helpful and provided us with all of the information and things that we needed for our stay as well as some helpful tips about the property.
We enjoyed the location so much that we are currently looking for our own hidden gem nearby! I would highly recommend this property to anyone looking for a relaxing weekend away or even a staycation!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We love, love, love this home and the property is gorgeous! The house was immaculate and very comfortable. After driving for three days from California, the breakfast food and coffee left for us was heavenly! Driving our 4 yr. old granddaughter around in Sinclair was a blast! We will have precious memories with her playing frisbee and skipping oysters on the water and watching the deer. We truly did not want to leave! This was a great find and we will be back."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great, safe neighborhood. House was clean, well kept, and had an amazing view out back! We had a great stay."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,This house is well put together and space is maximized for comfort. We booked for 3 days but we were so comfortable and relaxed we added an additional day. This is a perfect house for a quick weekend getaway... We will definitely be back!
2020-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The homeowner seems like a good guy. No huge issues and the house is nice. The best part to me was the deck on the back of the house, where we could sit and whatch the deer come out in the evenings. Would be great for a small family or group with 2 kids ( one bedroom has 2 twin beds in it)."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Booked this house for a proposal on the dock. Book a boat at Lake Sinclair marina and it’s a short ride over. Dock is nice and pavilion area. Easy check in. Clean. Very good deal.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time we have stayed. New owners are wonderful, and respond quickly! Love love the new patio, the steps added to the dock, and the golf cart was a huge help. These were all new things added since we’ve stayed in February!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoy this location and the access to the lake. We would use Bryan's place again in the future.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I really enjoyed our time during our stay here. Check in was easy. We loved the dock - we relaxed, fished with the provided poles, and swam in the lake. The golf cart was a game changer to get down to the lake. We spent almost all of our time on the deck playing board games and eating our meals. We will definitely be back!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Fabulous place! Covered deck attached to the house and covered dock with seating area by the lake made for an enjoyable outdoor evening even though it was raining. Would definitely stay again!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a terrific stay here; I can highly recommend it. The home has an amazing view of the Lake with lots of beautiful frontage. We spent hours near and in the water, and our dog had the best time of his life. Bryan is incredibly easy to communicate with, providing everything we needed at just the right time. And the nice touches in the house were over and above expectations. Everything was so clean and tidy, it was easy to feel at hoe. With easy access to the quaint downtown and area attractions, we could easily split our day between lake activities, hiking, and sightseeing. This property truly is a gem--one we found hard to leave and one we would definitely rent again whenever we return to the area."
2020-08-01,5,Group trip,"I loved staying here! Great space, beautiful view, quiet & secluded!"
2020-08-01,5,Group trip,"When I first arrived at the house, I could not stop saying “wow”. This house was amazing, and coupled with our excellent hosts, me and my friends had an incredible stay in Milledgeville. The house itself was charming and had everything you could possibly want - and the dock was the perfect spot where you could spend hours every day and have so much fun. It was great!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"My girls and I truly enjoyed Bryan’s Lakehouse, I wish we could have stayed longer. The house was clean, check-in was smooth, and be even put some breakfast items in the refrigerator for us :)
I had a issue trying to hook the living room tv up to the WiFi, it wouldn’t connect but the tv in the den worked just fine. We really enjoyed the deck and the dock, wish we could have stayed longer. This was really a nice and relaxing weekend away from home."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location and wonderful stay with the family. Bryan was a great host and even had stocked the refrigerator with breakfast items to kick start our vacation.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,The owners are great to work with and were quick to respond to any of my questions. The house and property are well cared for and the house was very clean. It was a great place to get away and relax!
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location on the lake. Close to Sinclair Marina for boat rental. House is well laid out for a family, spacious with two living/tv areas and full full baths. Kitchen is equipped with essentials, including fridge with ice maker and water in the door. Golf cart is a nice added touch for shuttling floats back and forth to the dock. Laundry room was handy for drying wet towels. If I came back I would bring a ramp for my pups. They could get in the water but not out at the sea wall, so we had to lift them out. Lake Sinclair is a beautiful lake, water is clean. Plenty of eating out options nearby."
2020-06-01,5,Group trip,Great hidden spot to spend some quality time enjoying the lake.
2020-05-01,5,Group trip,Had a great experience renting Bryan’s Airbnb!

2020-05-01,5,Group trip,"We traveled to the Lake-house to celebrate Mothers Day weekend while sheltering in place with family. We wasn’t sure how it was gong to work out with the short planning but to our surprise it was such an awesome experience.
The Lake House embodied the name a “Gem”. The location was perfect, with the grocery store close by. Sinclair Lake was most enjoyed by the family.
We found a new hobby of fishing. Bryan made the trip even more pleasant with quick responses."
2020-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful house with amazing views!

2020-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at this hidden gem!
2020-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic time at the Hidden Gem lake house. We appreciated all the quick responses from Bryan and for him being willing to let us stay an additional night! The house had everything we needed and more. It is decorated well and we felt super comfortable. We loved cooking on the charcoal grill and eating on the back porch every night. They had all the pots and pans we needed, olive oil, coffee, and things like that we may have needed. At the dock there were 2 Adirondack chairs and 2 additional ones on the covered picnic area that can be used for sitting at the dock. We brought our own beach towels. There is a rocky area by the sea wall that the dogs used to get in and out of the water. Walmart and Kroger are very close by and we were able to get extra things that we may have needed. One day we went to Jere-Shai off of Milledgeville road and rented a jet ski for 2 hours, which was a great experience. We had a fantastic time and will definitely stay here again!"

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We visited for Georgia College's graduation weekend. The place was easy to find, clean, and well-located for our plans. Parker was an excellent host. I was surprised that the house was attached to another property, but this did not present any problems. I was nervous about parking, but overflow parking was very close to the house. Check-in instructions were clear and easy! Check-out instructions were easy and fast. I would certainly stay here again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Wonderful home and location as well as a great host, Parker! Would want to stay here again should we find ourselves in this area again!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a lovely time with my partner at Tracy’s studio cabin! The cabin was clean and spacious, and we loved the gas fireplace. It kept us nice and cozy in the freezing temperatures. The shower had hot water, the kitchen was clean, and there were plenty of towels-pillows-blankets. Great little amenities as well around the cabin like a Keurig with pods for coffee and hot chocolate, and a well equipped kitchen. Shampoos and such.
The area is quiet, woodsy, and a very short drive from downtown Milledgeville which is just lovely with its historic architecture and numerous little restaurants.
Most of all, we enjoyed listening to all the songbirds in the mornings!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I was looking for a last minute getaway and Tracy’s place was perfect! So peaceful and calm. I was having trouble starting a fire outside and her husband and son were quick to come help. Excellent communication and cozy space. I didn’t want to leave! I will definitely be back!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was my birthday getaway weekend with my hubby - we had such a peaceful time - we burned out the outdoor fire pit - I cooked and enjoyed the silence of nature.

The indoor and outdoor gas fireplaces were so cozy and we enjoyed the kitchen ammenities that made everything so convenient. Tracy and her husband were so kind for the brief time we spoke. Also, downtown Millidgeville is a great place for food options and to get a drink. I HIGHLY recommend the breakfast burrito from Bollywood Tacos! 🌮"

A quiet neighborhood with lots of wildlife to hear and see from the back deck and a responsive, friendly host that went out of the way to provide useful information for the guests no matter what the purpose of the visit.
We will be visiting this town again and praying The Tree House will be available."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful little Airbnb. I was in town spur of the moment and could not find hotel vacancy. Found this gem on BNB at 11 at night. Host responded right away and bam. I had a place to sleep that was so so clean and comfortable. A tad pricey but I get it. I would have rather spent the money and had this place versus staying at a bedbug-infested roach motel. Will definitely book this place again.

We would -and have- recommended this stay to everyone we talk to."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect little spot in the woods! It was really cold when I visited but I was toasty with the little gas fireplace and a super comfy robe.

the only thing we would consider changing about the treehouse is the living space furniture. we think replacing the chairs with a couch would be a little more couple friendly for watching movies in the living space. other than that, we wouldn’t change a thing. we would recommend this place in a heartbeat."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tracy, & Jeff are awesome host. The treehouse was awesome. It was very clean, well stocked, and comfortable. Very unique place to stay!

Host is quick to communicate and accurate in their description of the tree house.
If you stay during colder temperatures, set the gas heater to 2 or 3. It's not to far off of the main strip but isolated enough that you don't hear traffic in the mornings."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This one scores 5 Stars across the board! It was exactly as described and reviews were spot on. It works perfect for two, any more would make it tight.

The care and love they put into restoring this old tenant house and then sharing it with others was a real treat for me as a Guest. I love going to see historic places and having the opportunity to have one to myself was a dream. It was so cozy and well decorated that I spent time just in the cabin to fully enjoy it. Great bathroom remodel with a huge shower, perfect tiny kitchen and thoughtful touches like fresh zucchini bread and snacks made me want to just move in and live there. Highly recommend."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fish Cottage is a wonderful, peaceful place to stay. The location could not be better for touring the Milledgeville area. David was the perfect host."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time I’ve stayed at David’s cottage. I know there are probably other nice places to stay in Milledgeville but this is where I will stay every time I come back. Thank you, David!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We got into town late and just about every decent hotel room was booked. David responded to my inquiry within 15 minutes. After another 15 minutes, we were safe inside David’s wonderful cabin. It was absolutely perfect for what we needed. His wife even gave us a loaf of her delicious banana bread which was gone in 10 minutes. Being from a larger city than Milledgeville, I was blown away by the stars in the sky. Such a peaceful environment to clear your mind. David was very helpful and I am planning on booking again soon!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,David's place was a much-needed sanctuary . . . I can't wait to return. What a gift.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was the second time my wife and I stayed here. It was lovely as always!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It is a wonderful place to stay. My wife and I absolutely loved the place. The hosts communicate well, and are very hospitable."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little cottage was the perfect place for us to stay while working out of town. If you’re looking for peace and quiet and a beautiful setting for a relaxing time, this is it. The cottage was very clean and beds were very comfortable and the place has a very laid back coziness to it. I highly recommend this place. If I’m in the area again I will do my best to stay here."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was great. Very peaceful, clean and central to Milledgeville! I would stay again."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just perfect! Thanks for providing this beautiful experience.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A Great country cottage to stay at while you're visiting the area. Clean, private, quiet and relaxing. Thank you for sharing this with us, we'll return soon."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"David’s cottage is a wonderful, quiet, peaceful place to stay. We could not have had a better experience."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is a hidden gem on Airbnb. David’s communication was superb. The cottage itself is very cozy. It was like taking a step back in time but with modern upgrades. If you’re looking for a peaceful quiet place without any distractions this is it. The cottage will be my first choice anytime I spend weekend at RiverRock in the future.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I was in town for work and wanted some place different than a hotel and this little cabin was perfect. I felt like I was a little girl back at my grandparents for the summer. This previous 2 bedroom cabin is just a tad smaller than my grandparents home and every morning I woke up feeling like I was back in there home. The location is perfect to everywhere in town. The bed was so comfy and although there is not a full kitchen it was perfect for making coffee and bringing in take out. The shower was huge and all the little touches in the bathroom and through out the cabin made it so homey. The fresh bread from Ms Autumn was just another touch that made this cabin so nostalgic for me. Mr David was great with communication and I loved how he checked on me when I arrived and then when I checked out. I just cannot say enough about this little cabin that for a week allowed me to remember amazing memories from childhood.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fish Cottage is a charming, cozy cottage in a beautiful, peaceful setting. It has a very interesting history and was very comfortable with all the amenities I could wish for. It was the perfect place to relax after a few busy days exploring Milledgeville with my friends. The personal touches made me feel so welcomed, and I will absolutely return again when I travel to this area."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place was very nice and clean. Host was very gracious. He responded very quickly to an issue I had with the coffee maker and all was well. Recommend.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fish Cottage is the perfect escape. We came to visit our son who attends college in the area and spent the weekend. We had such a relaxing time here and made memories we will cherish.
Thank you so much, David and Autumn!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can not say enough good things about this cottage. We went to Milledgeville to shoot people. Yes, you read that correctly. We were taking part in a large airsoft event at the abandoned hospital for the criminally insane, where 288 people showed up to shoot plastic BB's at each other. Don't knock it until you try it. It really is a lot of fun and gives me some great father/son time.
Anyway, the cottage was a perfect place to get a couple of great nights sleep and be well rested for the full days that followed. It was quiet, comfortable, and had all the amenities we needed and them some (my wife loved the zucchini bread). It was also in a area that we felt totally safe leaving a couple of thousand dollars worth of airsoft equipment in the vehicle instead of carrying it inside each night. We would never do that at a hotel.
For you city folks, you really need to stay there so you can enjoy some amazing stars. I definitely hope to be able to book this location again next year when we return for the next event. Thanks for a great stay."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our third stay in David and Autumn's cottage and always our first choice when in the area. The cottage is quiet, charming and comfortable and the hosts are responsive and kind."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Extremely beautiful and lovely little cottage. Has lots of beautiful wildlife waiting to be observed. In a wonderful location too.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Charming place to stay if you find yourself in Milledgeville, provided that you’re comfortable without wifi. This was not an issue for me, but you should make sure you don’t require internet access beyond your cellular data. If that’s not an issue, then you’ll enjoy the comfy, rural aesthetic."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A delightful cottage in a beautiful serene setting! Exceeded our expectations!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow, this is a wonderful place to retreat. Close to everything but secluded from the outside world. This history of the area and even a lake area that we didn’t get to check out. Definitely a place to return to."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A Nice peacefull place to take it easy in the country. What a great Fish Cottage with great hosts, my wife loved the detail of the decor, everything was so nice. Thanks again David and Autumn,"

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,David was a great host. The property was perfect for us and David's welcoming and communicative approach made the trip that much better!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing. Peaceful. Quiet. And the host is very communicative Not too far from everything in milledgeville but far enough for a nice getaway. Will definitely come back
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"David was awesome from the day I requested our reservation. We visited Milly to attend my nephews college graduation, celebrate his birthday, my daughter’s birthday and Mother’s Day! It was a jam packed weekend and we couldn’t have picked a better place to stay. The Fish Cottage was so quaint and the property is beautiful and serene. Very clean & welcoming and just perfect. Absolutely loved the note outside welcoming us :) We would absolutely stay again and we highly recommend the Fish Cottage! Thanks so much for everything!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place with great hospitality! Very quiet and relaxing. David and Autumn were very nice and it was a pleasure to be able to meet them both. Only a 12-15 minute drive to Lake Sinclair. If you need to just get away and relax for a few days I definitely recommend The Fish Cottage!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great hospitality and communication with David. I really enjoyed my stay at the Fish Cottage.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at the Fish Cottage...the area was peaceful and beautiful. We enjoyed walking on the trails in the woods, and also exploring Milledgeville and other areas. We would definitely recommend the Fish Cottage to others. We also enjoyed meeting and talking with David. We couldn't have asked for a better experience!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"David and Autumn's place is beautiful. Very spacious, charming and quiet. A great place to relax and unwind. Loved the personal touches to the cottage. Can't wait to come back!,"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rustic cabin with 2 large bedrooms and remodeled bathroom. Bed very comfortable!! Very quiet area, close enough to town, but a country feel. I was working in the area, so a much better alternative to a noisy hotel with no personality. If I'm traveling to the area again, I won't even look around - will stay at David's place. They are wonderful and responsive to any questions and gave me a fan when I forgot to bring mine for sleeping noise!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"David and Autumn have created the sweetest atmosphere in this charming and quiet getaway. Homemade zucchini bread and snacks, thoughtful instructions, and decorative touches that surely each represent a story- these are just some of the surprises. The towels and linens are soft and fluffy, the cottage is close enough to their home to feel safe and far enough away to feel solace, and they are easy to work with and communicate with."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fish Cottage is comfortably rustic & authentic, while still being modernized for comfort. Location is convenient to shopping, town & events yet located rural enough to offer peace & quiet. We absolutely enjoyed our stay & definitely recommend Fish Cottage."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have no doubt that I was led to the Fish Cottage at Fox Hill for the personal retreat for which my soul was so thirsty. The quaint old cottage has been renovated with an updated bath, kitchenette, insulation, and central heat/air while maintaining its historical charm. I slept soundly, felt cozy, and woke to chirping birds and a beautiful sunrise across the field. I was given all the privacy I needed, yet questions and support were quickly answered. David and Autumn are the perfect hosts. I was blessed far beyond my expectations in so many ways. I can see this cottage being used individually, as I did for time with the Lord, or as an individual or couple, or small family getting away to a quiet place to rest and reconnect. It is also close to many historical sites of interest, lakes, hunting, among other attractions. It is a hidden jewel."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Quiet quiet quiet! Could not ask for a more perfect relaxing stay the home has so much character it was a joy to stay here!
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is a very special place to be in a beautiful location. Couldnt have been happier. Felt very lucky to find this gem
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute and cozy cottage! Absolutely adorable! We will definitely stay again if back in town! ♥️
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I decided to go on a last minute trip. David was so accommodating and quick to respond. I was able to book the same day and his directions to getting to the cottage were clear and exact. The cottage is even more lovely in person. It is so cozy and there are so many personal touches. I will definitely be back for a longer stay! It's close to hiking and restaurants, which I look forward to exploring when I come back."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Expect to feel like you are at home!!!!!!!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"David is an excellent host. Maintaining your privacy yet reaponsive and quick to help if need be. Location is perfect. In country setting yet close to anything you need. Cottage was clean and quiant with right amount of love shown in the details. Cozy warm. Even offers guest book to sign and view others stay. Loved that idea! Interesting to see and cottage has wonderful hostory. This is a 2 bedroom. We thought was side by side type cottage but it is actually 2 huge bedrooms (both accessible from outside) with shared kitchen dining and awesome shower! My favorite part, oh and the rocker in living room!! You must try it! Thank you for lovely stay we will be returning next year!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"BEAUTIFUL, serene, peaceful, quiet! Lovely, lovely place with thoughtful touches. I loved my stay here and look forward to returning! Wonderful hosts! Just the perfect getaway and exactly what I needed!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Privacy and serenity
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This sweet little farm cottage was the perfect combo of authenticity & modern conveniences! You will love the authenticity of the high ceilings & old reclaimed wood that are sure to take you back in time- While still enjoying the conveniences you expect such as the updated bathroom with the rain shower head and central heat & air. The serenity of the location is by far the best asset - morning coffee on the front porch is a must.
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was very peaceful, cozy, and such a great weekend with our family. David was very attentive and went out of his way to make us feel welcome and make sure we had everything we needed. We will be staying again when we visit."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I don’t even know where to start. This stay was absolutely amazing. David responded extremely quick and welcomed my family to an amazing stay. Coming from NJ to this farm style home was a experience for myself as for my wife and family. David was extremely helpful with the property and responded to every question i had. Learning about how the cottage came about was amazing and learning why there were so many fish and named the fish cottage was fun. Upon leaving david let my family and i meet there horse Titan and take pictures. Whenever i go visit family i will definitely be requesting to stay here again. Thank you so much for everything

2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful little home in a beautiful setting. Ask David the story of how it got named the Fish Cottage. :)
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was very quaint and the location was accurate to the description. It was really cold during our stay but the cottage was super cozy! The walk in shower was a plus and there were a lot of personal touches decorated through out the home.
The location was away from the hustle and bustle of the city and we enjoyed hearing the birds sing and seeing the horse in the pasture every morning!"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rustic charm. Feels like you have escaped. Not only the cottage but the grounds bring you a peaceful get away. The place is darling. Make sure to take time for the sunset and the stars in the sky. The front porch was such a lovely place to sit a spell.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved the stay. Very nice cabin with plenty of great places to eat nearby.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice clean place. Thanks!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was a bit worried that it wouldn't look like the pictures. Boy was I wrong. The place looked exactly like the pictures. Check in was easy, driving instructions easy, and Tracy constantly let me know she was available if I needed help with anything. It was a great stay I hope to stay again one day."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just a wonderful cabin loved the outdoor shower and soaking tub. Bed was comfortable as was the loft beds ( hubby was banished to the loft area for snoring) Kitchen was well stocked and every space was utilized during our stay. The steep decline scared this flat road midwesterner. 😂.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,it was a very nice small cabin and they were very nice and helpful during the whole stay.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful stay. Very beautiful!

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tracy’s tiny house was perfect! We were only there for one night to check out the area for an upcoming wedding. Tracy communicated check-in instructions clearly, ands was very welcoming. It is obvious when you walk in to the home, that care and attention to detail was taken. We enjoyed a fire in the fire pit, while listening to the night sounds. We hope to return and stay a little longer next time. Thank you Tracy for your wonderful hospitality!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had a great stay here in the little tinny home. It was cozy and spacious and had the perfect set up outside to relax by the fire pit and stargaze at night. I
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My birthday experience was PERFECT here in this cabin oasis. Surrounded by breathless tranquility and zen you literally forget that you’re in little Milledgeville. Tracy and Her Husband were exceptionally welcoming from beginning to end. Tracy even welcomed me with cupcakes for my birthday which was extremely thoughtful and brought me so much joy! I decided on this cabin because of the outdoor shower and soaking tub. Both were top tier experiences that were very hard to say goodbye to. I personally love super hot showers & baths. Each treasure had unlimited hot water creating the perfect spa-like experience for my getaway. Saying goodbye was extremely hard. Next time I’m booking a WEEK instead of 2 nights. Special shout-out to Tracy & Her Husband for a superior experience! THANK YOU THANK YOU I am recommending this stay for all of my family and friends that come to town to visit.
BOOK NOW it has everything you need💚"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,WAY exceeded our expectations! My wife and I decided to try something new and stumbled upon Tracy’s listing — and we’re so glad we did! Super clean and welcoming home with a very private feel at the same time. Everything was exactly as described and the hospitality was through the roof. Our favorite part was be outdoor shower. We will definitely be back!!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved the place and are already discussing coming back for a future visit. The home was beautiful and very homey. The outside shower was fantastic. We wish we had more time to enjoy the outdoor setup to include the swing and firepit. The host really thought of everything from games, to the sound machine, privacy dividers for the outside space, and welcome treats. We booked last minute, the host was quick to reply and the communication and instructions were superb. Thank you for the lovely accommodations!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to stay at. The outdoor show was very different. Tracy is very proactive and keeps you informed of what is going on the property. Would stay again.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Outstanding combination..... great host, great place, great stay!!"

2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We were grateful Tracy allowed us the opportunity to stay in her tiny house. It was a super unique experience and Tracy was very friendly.
We arrived late at night (don’t recommend) and left early in the morning, so in fairness, we didn’t want to disturb Tracy for what ended up being a short stay.
We did encounter some hiccups - again - not deal breaking, but noticeable and unexpected."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The tiny cabin, which was very spacious to be ""tiny"", was the perfect place to stay as we moved our son into GCSU. The outdoor shower is different, but a fun experience, and the soaker tub with the handheld is great if you're not sure about the outdoor shower. Tracy and her husband were great host, very responsive, and available if needed. My husband and I would definitely stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,I really didn’t want to write a review! Because I don’t want anyone else to know about it and book it up! Lol! Perfect place to stay for our family!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fantastic place to

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay at the tiny home. The space was clean, well kept, and very well thought out. As we had a late night arrival we were unable to take full advantage of the hammock and fire pit area but the space was lovely and we enjoyed breakfast beside them prior to departure. The outdoor shower and soaker tub are stellar. After a long day on the road the welcome tray full of goodies was a very nice touch to weary travelers. One night at this adorable place was not enough and we will have to return. Thank You Tracy for your kindness and hospitality. Top notch host."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our time at The Hideaway. Our hosts' directions to the cabin and instructions for check-in made the process quick and simple. The house had everything we needed, and we felt very at-home. The outdoor shower and soaking tub made for a relaxing change of pace, AND having two bathing options made it possible for my wife and I to both get cleaned up after a long, busy day. I can't say enough good things. This is a wonderful, cozy home in a quiet area and we hope to return in the future. "
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is gorgeous and so well built and charming. The hosts are amazingly attentive. Our stay was smooth and the outdoor shower and soaking tub were a true blessing. If I was able to afford a tiny house this would be the prototype. Absolutely stay at this joint if you have the chance!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We booked at the last minute , due to unforeseen circumstances, and Tracy was very accommodating without hesitation. The place was clean, very inviting for families, easily accessible, and comfortable. They left snacks and clear instructions, as well as local recommendations."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at this Airbnb was nothing short of perfect. We enjoyed a boat rental from the nearby Sinclair Marina and came back to the tiny house to unwind with an invigorating outdoor shower. After a delicious meal at the Brick, we had a cozy night in, roasting marshmallows and playing board games. This was the perfect little getaway for us! We would highly recommend this fantastic Airbnb to anyone, especially parents visiting GCSU. The accommodations were so much cleaner and better than any hotel we've stayed in!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect pit stop for us. We loved the outdoor shower and the peaceful surroundings. It was worth the drive from the interstate
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at The Hideaway was just what I needed. It was a perfect, relaxing weekend. If you are searching for a cozy, clean place to stay in town stop looking and book Tracy’s Tiny house. It has everything you need and Tracy is a wonderful host. They even offered to light a fire for me in stealth mode so I could still feel alone 😅 you will not regret staying here!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Jeff and Tracy were excellent hosts and very accommodating. Their tiny cabin wasn't so tiny and the location and foliage was beautiful.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Tracy and her husband are always fabulous hosts. This is our third trip with them. They provide everything you need and more. Both their locations are beautiful and spotless. If only every AIRBNB experience were like this 💗
2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Very quiet and peaceful, just what I wanted"
2023-03-01,3,Stayed one night,"This tiny cabin was perfect for my BFF and I girl’s night! We just had a few things that we wish could’ve been better. I was excited to use the outside showers however the mosquitoes made it impossible. Maybe having a net around it would be better be because the repellent that was provided didn’t work. Also I wish they would of had a mat on the ground in the shower as well. The hot water didn’t work in the shower either. So, I decided to use the soaker tub. Well after trying to run a hot bath, the hot water eventually stopped working there too. Super bummer having to take a lukewarm/cold shower 😣"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was Awesome!!! Perfect place, perfect surroundings. Enjoyed the fire pit outside and the fireplace inside. Got to hike in the woods and seen a couple deer!! That was really cool. She's Very responsive. She went above and beyond. We will Definitely be going back when we can stay longer."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at the tiny house and the outdoor shower was amazing! I was afraid it would be too cold, but the large rain head shower made the water warm all over and an amazing experience. We did not have any cooking oils or charcoal, and also had to pay extra for firewood, but it was worth it spending time by the fire pit and winding down. Overall, we had a great time relaxing at the home and visiting downtown! It was great for an unwinding vacation to relax and reconnect as a couple."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our visit to the Tiny House. The convenience to Milledgeville was perfect for us. The location and the touches like the fire pit, hammock, bridge, and swing made us feel like we were camping but with all the luxuries and amenities we enjoy. The outdoor shower was awesome. Tracy’s was very communicative and her recommendations for activities and restaurants was helpful. We would love to visit again."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Truly felt like we were at a Hideaway! The space was absolutely perfect. Clean, comfortably furnished, and private, yet short ride to stores and restaurants. Excellent communication. The outside space was so peaceful and relaxing. We each took turns in the soaker tub and loved it. Great value for the price. We are looking forward to returning again!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Needed a last minute place to stay, Tracy was a great host and I loved the space. If I am ever spending a night in Milledgeville this is definitely where I will stay."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great host and outstanding property
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Tiny House in Milledgeville is great. It is tiny but big enough for a family of four, with enough space for everyone. My boys loved the loft area for their ""base"" and we had plenty of room downstairs. The soaker tub was big hit, especially for the kids, they got to watch YouTube while taking a bath. The outdoor shower was a nice, something different but good. The house was spotless and organized. We met the hosts who were super friendly and accommodating. The fire pit was great in the evening. Milledgeville is a small but charming town, a nice surprise. The Tiny House is a great place for a quiet getaway. Close to downtown school area and not far away from the main town. Charming and peaceful, a nice surprise for a last minute trip with no real agenda."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,Absolutely amazing place to stay
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very accommodating and a great place to stay
2022-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,Another absolutely amazing stay. Tracy and Jeff are the best! Will definitely be staying again!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and cozy. Would definitely stay again. We stayed for parents weekend at GCSU and it was great. So much better than a hotel.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Staying at Tracy’s place was wonderful as always!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very perfect for home for either a short or long stay for work and so much better than a hotel. The hosts are amazing and extremely responsive and literally nothing went wrong during the stay. I will definitely return whenever I’m in town again!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cabin was very spacious and clean with tons of amenities. 10/10
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was perfect and exactly like what I hoped or even better honestly. We barely left the tiny house at all because it was too nice and comfortable! She even let us use the Netflix, Amazon prime, and Hulu accounts that were provided on the smart TVs so you didn’t even need to use your own accounts if you don’t own either of them. All the appliances are very new like the washers and dishwasher. The beds are extremely comfortable and not like the usually uncomfortable or hard pillows that hotels can usually have. Definitely worth every penny!!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tracy’s cottage was BEAUTIFUL and so peaceful. So quaint and fully equipped for even a short stay for a traveling nomad like myself. All the amenities and luxuries one could ask for with just enough rustic feel you’d hope for. Tracy was the perfect host, too. Immediately responsive and catered to my extremely last minute stay so hospitably. I’m hoping to go back soon!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This tiny house was amazing!! It was just perfect for me and my daughter. It was super clean and we had zero problems with bugs (in the past, that has been a problem for us with rentals in the woods). Often in rentals, they provide the cheapest aluminum cookware they could find (and often, I take my own or go buy something in the town) but this had cookware you could ACTUALLY cook with. The outdoor grill, swing and fire pit were really enjoyable too. Tracy goes the extra mile...we felt right at home and she responded immediately if I had any questions. The couch is new and comfy, the master bed was perfectly between soft and hard...and though I didn't try the bunk beds, my teenager didn't complain at all.
The town is full of very sweet people and has quite a few things to do while you're there, indoors and out! While the rental is nestled quietly in the woods (and you feel like you're far away from it all), the city is only about 4-5 miles away and has all the shopping/eating you could want. Great location, Great rental! Highly recommended. Thanks, Tracy & Jeff, for a wonderful week!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely magical. The perfect name for this adorable little hideaway in the woods. Tracy and her team were more than accommodating. Love that they are support our military too. We will be back!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Better than a hotel. Very comfortable and convenient for where we needed to be. Excellent communication.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was absolutely amazing, Tracy was an amazing host! Easy check in and check out instructions. In constant communication. The cabin was beautiful and a much needed place of rest! Outdoor shower and a great giant tub to soak in! We will be renting again!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Enjoyed our stay so much! This tiny home was plenty roomy for just the two of us! Very clean and so comfy! The home is in sight of the owner’s home but faces away from them and felt private. We felt right at home and so welcomed by the personal card and snacks left!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I had a wonderful time staying at this lovely cabin. The cabin was perfect for a weekend away. The cabin was very clean and a perfect size for us two. Tracy was very responsive and always looking for a way to make our stay better. We loved staying at the cabin and hopefully will be back soon!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wow! What a great experience! The place was easy to find and beautiful. Loved how comfortable it made me feel. The owners were amazing. They kept open communication throughout my stay. I will definitely be staying again!!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a delightful surprise!! We loved our stay and plan to return.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely place! Would definitely stay here again.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,I absolutely enjoyed my stay. This place was so nice and comfortable. Doesn’t seem tiny at all. My kids and I enjoyed the outdoor shower. We will definitely be booking again.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Thank you so much for having us! We loved your cabin! The outside shower and bath tub was amazing! Super relaxing! We will definitely be back!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great little house, hidden in the forest. If you are looking for peace and relaxation, this is the place to be. Everything was super clean and there was even a washer and dryer!
Our son loved the top area. He had his own little empire here, over the minds of the adults. The shower is also great, it has a sense of showering in the rainforest. Nevertheless, there were no weird crawling beetles, pure idyll!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is cozy, comfortable, quiet, and very clean. It's about a 10 minute drive to Georgia College and Main St., so it was very convenient for me. The outdoor shower and soaking tub are wonderful perks. I enjoyed my stay and highly recommend."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is beautiful, pictures don’t even do it justice 😍 the cabin is extremely clean & smelled soo good as soon as you walked in through the door. Tracy is so kind and so welcoming and made sure that the cabin was well equipped with all sorts of kitchen gadgets, towels, and even had some welcoming snacks for us which we enjoyed 😊 the bed and pillows were extremely comfortable, we slept like a baby!! 100% recommend if you’re looking for a peaceful getaway 😊 looking forward to another stay in the future!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The tiny cottage was perfect for our family of 4. The kids enjoyed the quaintness and most certainly the outdoor shower!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fabulous place to stay in middle Ga. Unique and quirky in a good way! The hosts thought of everything and it felt like I was the first person to use it- so clean.
The only thing missing was a hot tub!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Impeccable is an understatement. Tracy was readily available for any questions that I MIGHT have had. I didn't have any questions though because her welcome message was very thorough and there is a binder in the home with any thing you may need an answer to. I did message her several times about how amazed I was with the property and her response was always quick and very polite. I live 30 minutes from this property and you couldn't tell me I wasn't on a sabbatical across the country. Everything was as described OR better! The pictures does this hidden gem zero ounces of justice. The outdoor enclosed shower with the Rain shower head was a great addition. I felt like I was on a private island. The kitchen is well stocked with kitchen utensils and cookware. The property was extremely EXTREMELY clean. I did the barefoot test and was able to go without my house slippers the entire stay. The bed is super comfortable. I travel with my pillows because I'm a pillow snob and I never had to unpack mine, Tracy has you covered. There is a ceiling fan in the bedroom. I think that's what did it for me. I sleep with my ceiling fan on at home every night and not having to compromise on that was a huge deal. Their is a Keurig with coffee supplies provided and a ice tray in the freezer. The hammock-fire pit area is very well kept and waiting for you to relax. Don't forget your marshmallows and roasting stick......you're welcome👌🏾. There is a small charcoal grill with easy access from the kitchen. Grilled pineapple and Filet would be a great quick dinner!
Bonus tip: Bring your bath salts, candles and bubble bath and indulge in the luxury of the soaker tub. It did my entire soul a world of good.
I'm looking my calendar over for a free day to come back and stay just because. The best secluded break I've had from the outside world in a very long time and I travel at lot!
Thank you again Tracy for being such an amazing host! I wish you had properties in every city I visit."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Definitely my #1 place on places to stay for my next visit! Awesome people beautiful place!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Tiny Home was extremely spacious with very high ceilings which I can appreciate being over 6ft tall. The outdoor shower was clean and a great experience and surprisingly private. The space was also extremely clean and kitchen includes every utensil you can need. We were about 10mins from downtown Midgeville. We enjoyed our breakfast in downtown at Blackbird Cafe and the Local Yokal. They only note I have to add is that the tiny home is a hideaway, tucked away, and surrounded by trees so there were a few little insects/spiders which we were fine with since we were in their environment! We would stay again, 10x over."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place with awesome hosts. My partner and I came for a weekend away and had a very relaxing stay. We are both over six feet tall and this tiny house is not tiny in ceilings. We were very comfy here.
The only thing to be aware of here is that the driveway is very steep when you initially come down it, so just be prepared. But would absolutely recommend this property or their treehouse."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Hideaway is always a magical experience! From the beautiful outdoor oasis to the outside shower… it is truly the respite that is needed in our society today! Tracy and Jeff are amazing hosts! 10 stars!!!!

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved the area, perfect space for our kids and we loved the fire pit, rain shower and having that close family time there! It felt like we were camping and we loved it! Place was easy to find, clean and Tracy made sure we had all the information we needed and a great time! We plan to come back!!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location. Easy access to shopping, restaurants and downtown. The outside shower was great, with plenty of room and hot water. Tracy was great and easy to communicate with, and was very attentive making sure all was well before and during my stay. This cottage was a relaxing way to end a busy day and had all the comforts of home to start a busy day. When I’m this area again I will for sure check on its availability."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cutest little cabin in the woods. Great location close to Milledgeville where you’ll find restaurants, bars, and shops, but still secluded enough where is beautiful and quiet. Highly recommend and will definitely go back."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I stayed at this tiny home for a couple of days with my young daughter in between our move to our new home. We had such an amazing stay, the home is in such a great location/safe neighborhood. It’s in short distance to the main roads/downtown Milledgeville. The tiny home is clean, very spacious, and the host is very responsive. The environment and ambience is truly unique and we would absolutely book this tiny home again, we are obsessed!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This little cabin was just what we needed for a two night trip to school ❤️
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Fabulous house!! It was perfect! The house had everything we needed and a great outdoor area. It was quiet and relaxing. One of the best stays on our 10 day road trip. We will be back for a longer stay.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was Perfect! The hostess Tracy was especially attentive when a bad storm came through and knocked out our wifi. We were without TV or internet for two nights so she adjusted the rate without us even asking.
The cabin was extremely clean and comfortable and super cute!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,So thankful for Tracy’s place for my friend’s quick mini-moon! They loved it and said it was a perfect stay
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved this place! It was very clean, comfy beds, the outdoor shower was my favorite part. We stayed here on our way to florida and had a boat with us. They were great enough to accommodate parking for our boat and suggested a great place for dinner in town. I would definitely stay here again :)"

2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"It is rare for us to enjoy an Air B&B enough to want to return; we wish we had several days to spend here. The attention to detail was astounding: everything we could need and more. What a cozy and welcoming spot after a long day on the road! If you don’t already have plans to come by Milledgeville, make some, and stay at the Hideaway-you will be so glad you did."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved this place ! Very cute and quaint. Comfortable bed. The place smelled amazing
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a perfect experience that has the mix of modern and simple life. From the outside shower, to the comfortable bedding, and the clean spaces- this is more than an experience, it’s a beautiful escape. We were able to order food and order groceries. It’s off the grid, but close enough to civilization. We will be returning again to experience this escape from reality!!! 10 stars!!!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect tiny house! Actually roomy and felt very cozy! Soaker tub and outdoor shower very nice touch! Queen bed was very comfortable!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great find! We were looking to visit for more than just an overnighter and wanted something unique. Love supporting local! This was perfect. The location is quiet, the space of the cabin is perfect, and all of the appliances are top notch. It did not feel tiny or campy at all.
Tracy and hubby were very attentive with any questions and just really nice people. Can't wait to come back."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything about the cabin was great! We hope to visit again and get to do some exploring around Milledgeville next time!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great property in the woods. Stayed here passing through with my family. Property was clean and exactly as described on the website. Outdoor shower was awesome. Highly recommended if heading to Milledgeville!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"No regrets staying here. It was exactly what was posted and more peaceful than I imagined! It was a beautiful, yet simple space. The property makes you feel like you are far away, but there was plenty of eating and entertainment places near by."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,100% would recommend.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very quaint and beautiful little cabin! It is well built with very nice finishes. Fire pit was great! Would definitely come back. Communication was great with the host as well.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Hideaway was the perfect place for our family of 3! They provided us with the means to travel with our infant, welcomed us with snacks and a clean place, and most importantly, made sure we were taken care of! They also ensured we had all of the materials needed to rest comfortably and warm with their heaters that were provided! We loved this cute cabin and cannot wait till we can come and enjoy the outside seating area!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved EVERYTHING about this cabin!! The response from these great hosts were in a timely manner, and they were so polite. The outside scenery is just as Beautiful as the inside of the home! The stay was beyond our expectations! That is all!! ❤️"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,LOVE this CABIN!!! And the owners are so nice! Recommend this cabin 100 times over!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely loved it! So cozy and cute it was a perfect little getaway!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a unique space. The soaker tub is as divine as you imagine it is! The hosts are attentive to any issues or questions you may have. The space is well equipped, and I truly enjoyed the outdoor shower :) Love this property!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This cabin, only 1.5 hours outside Atlanta, is so cute. I was looking to get away for the start of the year and this place was perfect. There is a designated spot to park, a cute wooden swing, a fire pit, and some chairs, as well as a hammock for some outdoor hangs. Tracy even provided the firewood and fire starter! Before you even walk in you can see the outdoor shower, which is covered really well. It was 40 degrees out when I stayed but it still felt great under the hot water. When you enter, you are in the living space which has decent couches and a TV. There is a full kitchen and it's equipped with the essentials, a Kuerig included :) There is a small desk to work and the Queen size mattress is comfortable. A small gas fireplace is in the living space for when it's chilly and there are two AC units. The soak-in tub was wonderful! I watched a documentary on the small TV in the restroom. There is also a washer and dryer, walk-in closet if you're staying long term and Tracy provided me with a plush robe, which came in handy with the drop in temperature. The second night it rained soooo much but it sounded nice on the Tin rooftop. A window in each room. There is also an upstairs room that I did not use. It has two twin size mattresses that looked and felt pretty comfy. Overall, I'd stay again. Perfect space for a little getaway."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tracey was super responsive before and during stay.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and convenient. Would stay again.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely perfect! Very clean and well maintained. Outside shower was wonderful- even in December! Yes- the hosts home is close by, but you can’t hear them or see their house unless you are on the driveway or by the fire pit!
Bed was amazingly comfortable! I slept so well I thought I slept through the following day.
Everything you need is right there! Just bing clothes and food!
Town was easy to walk around with tons of local, great food.
Absolutely coming back and soon!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for your hospitality. We enjoyed our stay. We loved the full kitchen and the soaker tub. Everything we needed was accessible and clean.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is very nice and beautiful. The host is very professional and thoughtful. You will not be disappointed. It feels like a relaxing retreat.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Me and my boyfriend had a great time! Tracy and her husband was very receptive and helpful and ensured an amazing experience for the both of us :)
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing time at Tracy’s Airbnb! She was more than helpful towards everything we needed and on top of it, we loved the town of Milledgeville. She was the greatest host I’ve had so far on Airbnb :) The Airbnb is only minutes away from downtown and we found a couple of good places to eat. Great for a couple weekend getaway. Hope to stay again soon!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice place! We Loved it. We will definitely come back soon.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved this tiny house! Felt very spacious! Great location! Great communication! Would definitely stay here again…or the treehouse once it gets done! I’m sure it will be fantastic as well!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This home was spotless upon arrival and my boyfriend and I enjoyed the modern amenities while still experiencing the cabin-feel. This home is great for a small group get-away or a weekend “glamping” trip. I would absolutely stay here again!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This home is a true hidden treasure and a rare find for the Milledgeville area.
Our hosts have gone out of their way to make everything perfect for us!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This Airbnb home is beautiful and our hosts made our accommodations immaculate. There is no other place in this area that can compare to this home.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a great weekend stay here. The cabin was very clean and organized. We really enjoyed the outdoor shower, it is very unique and a great added feature. Tracy did a fantastic job communicating with us and checking in the make sure we had everything we needed for our stay. Definitely will stay again when we are in the area visiting family."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice and clean place, the only thing I would say, is that if you don’t like nature, the outdoor shower won’t be your favorite due to the bugs that might join you during your shower."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,I would definitely recommend this beautiful home. So clean! I will be staying again soon!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice people, wonderful place to stay!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and extremely clean. I travel for work often and was looking for something other than a hotel close to Milledgeville. Lots of cable TV channels and wifi worked well. Kitchen is fully stocked with everything you need. Kuerig coffee also provided. Bed is very comfortable. Host is extremely nice. Yes - the shower is outside - next to the entry door - I enjoyed it. Highly recommended!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place ,very clean have everything you need ."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"After a string of expensive terrible places in Florida we were so pleasantly surprised by Tracy's place on our way home back to NC. This place was so well appointed, clean and just relaxing. It's a quiet spot, and Tracy was great at communicating with us. The home is so comfortable and the outside shower was seriously so relaxing. This place restored my faith in AirBnb. If you need a great place to stay thats clean and so cozy be sure to stay here."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pros:
* built very recently.
* clean and tidy.
* allow for cooking.
* friendly and responsive host
* good for a group of four
Cons:
* no indoor shower
* no really a hideaway - the host’s family lives right next door
* unstable Wifi & cable
Summary:
If you’re here for a short stay and will be out doing stuff, this is an awesome place."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,The home was beautiful & cozy! Perfect for an overnight stay for a wedding/visit in a college town! Macey & Matt were super kind & responsive!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house is spacious, close to the downtown (highly recommend Bollywood Tacos and Blackbird Coffee), and was very clean. The one level was very convenient for our family traveling with a 4 year old and grandma. The beds were comfortable, linens clean, and decor tasteful. The kitchen had almost everything we needed (a few more designated dish towels or paper towels would be great). We had to buy some sponges to wipe the counters clean after we cooked, but that wasn't a big deal. The remodeling of this older house is nice because it gives an open feeling to the spaces. We couldn't believe how much space was inside the house. I though there would be more room outside for my kiddo to run around, but there is not. The house is situated on a corner lot also, which surprised me, though I am not sure why it surprised me. We had a great stay and would recommend it to anyone."
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,This place was amazing and the location was super convenient!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the location. Exactly what we needed.
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Great job
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stayed here for a reunion in Milledgeville - the house was easy to find and within walking distance to downtown and the university. I’d definitely stay here again.
2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"Matt and Macie were great hosts and cooperative with my crazy early check in and delayed check out.
The house is at the corner of a busy street but the noise was minimal at night.
Very clean and minimalist decor, which I can appreciate.
I’d def rent from them again! Thanks for all of your flexibility."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Thank you
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Charming place with interesting architectural features, located on a corner lot with a sidewalk and easy access. The home is very roomy with a freshly updated & well equipped kitchen.
We're first-time AirBnB customers, and were on a multi-stop trip which included 4 different AirBnB homes...with this being our last stop. Fifteen minutes after arrival, our 14 year-old son announced this was his favorite of all 4.
We arrived later than expected due to having to make an unscheduled stop that afternoon, and Macy was very helpful and accommodating. The lights were on when we arrived after dark, making the home warm and inviting after a long day's drive."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"One of the best Airbnb’s in milledgeville! Very spacious and great location on the edge of town. 10 minute walk from downtown, restaurants, shops, campus, etc. If you are trying to decide between a few options around town. Look no further! Thanks Macey!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect house for my daughter and I to visit GCSU. Close to the college and downtown so it was just minutes to the restaurants. House was bigger than we thought with great tall ceilings. Clear instructions with a helpful notebook. Uncluttered and clean so we could relax.
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Host was responsive. A couple of things that stand out, the $150 cleaning fee to me was a little excessive due to all that is required at checkout, and taking a shower was difficult due to the extremely low water pressure."
2024-03-01,4,Stayed one night,Nicely renovated house in an excellent location
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The hosts were great with great communication

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Convenient location, just half a mile from restaurants and GCSU. The house was very clean and well furnished.

2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Had a great stay! Traveled with older family members and they truly enjoyed the home with its old school charm. Macey was super easy to work with and we will definitely be back! Easy access to downtown and colleges!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I scheduled this vacation rental for guests of ours from Savannah. Although the weather was not agreeable, the home was very cozy for their stay. Macey decorated the home with multiple Christmas trees and other holiday decor which was such a great touch. There were cozy lamps in each room that provided a warm and inviting ambiance. Our guests enjoyed watching football games on the large TV in the living room. The hosts also provided local recommendations which were helpful to our guests as well. This is a great home for anyone looking to stay in downtown Milledgeville!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We will be staying here again! Great location, close to a grocery store, close to great restaurants, spacious, clean, comfortable beds. A total win"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"It’s a lovely, historic little home in a nice quiet, safe, section of town. The property was clean, had everything we needed and was worth the price. Would definitely stay with Macey again."

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful, clean house that had the space and everything we needed! Would definitely recommend!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We came for GSCU family day. This home was a few blocks from downtown which allowed us to walk everywhere. The home was perfect to share with another couple and much better than staying at a hotel. Thank you for hosting us Macey!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The home was so beautiful and cozy. Will definitely be back!!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location - close to GCSU and downtown. Space was really neat - restored cottage much prettier and larger than we thought!
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay in Milledgeville. Will definitely stay again when in town!

2023-09-01,5,Group trip,I really enjoyed this beautiful home. Walking distance to downtown. I would highly recommend this place to anyone.
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"This is a cute and charming bungalow! Macey was super friendly and responsive to my inquiries and questions. House was very clean and nicely equipped. Plenty of towels and kitchen well stocked. There are pros and cons regarding the location. Pros: it’s only a short 5 -7 min walk into downtown and GCSU campus - a straight shot down the street. Great for campus tours and being close to downtown shops and restaurants. Cons: the road noise from the highway is very loud. Consider this if you are a light sleeper - traffic goes into the evening hours and starts early in the AM. While the listing does state it’s on the corner of a main road and to expect some noise, it was more than I had imagined."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Clean & comfortable. Walking distance to GMC and downtown.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Macey was friendly and accommodating! The house is beautiful and spacious. It is older and has so much charm. It was very clean. My family would happily stay again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful home! Loved the modern updates and true to 1930s design.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our family was in town for a funeral and this stay was perfect for us. Macey was very responsive and ensured we had all we needed to check in and check out. The front porch was a great spot for morning coffee! The pictures capture the space well, but it was much larger than we had anticipated. Great space! We look forward to staying here next time we are in milledgeville."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"We had a great time! The house was very cute, spacious, and clean!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was actually larger than we anticipated, which was a plus. Only 3 nlocks from the downtown area made it convenient to walk to restaurants. We appreciated the charm of this nearly 100 year old house and that much of the hardware was still original."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Great to see there is finally something in downtown milledgeville. We will definitely be back!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. We came in town for work and this place suited all of our needs. It was such a beautiful place with the best bedding I have found in any air b&b. I highly recommend staying here if you find yourself in Milledgeville.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house is as described and very clean. It has all the basics to make a stay simple. Will stay again.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,A gem in Milledgeville! Stay here!!! This house is amazing! Right in the heart of downtown Milledgeville! Walkable to everything downtown has to offer as well as the college campus! We stayed for a girl’s weekend away and had a blast! Enjoyed cocktails Al fresco on the sprawling covered front porch. The kitchen is well-stocked and the host has thought of the best little touches to make this feel like a true oasis. You can also easily come visit your friends on Lake Sinclair and make this your home base. Would absolutely rent again!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were there to tour the historic town and this location put us in walking distance to everything.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,What a beautiful old home! We had plenty of room and everything we needed for our stay. Just a couple of blocks from downtown and GCSU.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,The house is beautiful and cozy but spacious. I really enjoyed the front porch. Our host was super helpful
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Very spacious and clean. Within walking distance to downtown Milledgeville. Kitchen was well stocked and host left a nice little snack basket. Would stay here again.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is just as pictured! A cute quaint spot in downtown Milly. It was beautifully decorated. The porch was a great place to hang out and chat. Macey was such a great host that helped answer any and all questions! You can easily walk to the adorable downtown to grab food and drink and you can also walk the oconee greenway! Best of both worlds. We will definitely stay here again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was so cute. The dock was wonderful. It was so peaceful and tranquil there. Totally enjoyed our stay.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Stephanie and David's lake home was the perfect spot for our weekend getaway! The home was very clean and kitchen had everything we needed to prep for dinner. Our kids loved the stand up paddle boards and we really enjoyed the beautiful views from the pier. Thanks for hosting us!
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,This was the perfect location for our family! Loved being able to grill out and enjoy the beautiful lake scenery from their dock. Perfect location and close to Milledgeville. Used the paddle boards too - so fun!
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,This place is exactly what they say it and it is a very nice place to bring your family for vacation. I really like that there is a boat ramp the next bend up and you do not have to get on the main lake to get your boat from the boat ramp to the house dock. Will definitely be staying here again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My family and I really enjoyed our stay at Stephanie and David’s lake house. We had a couple of issues connecting with the Wi-Fi but when I reached out the hosts were very responsive and offered suggestions to get all of our devices working properly. We spent the majority of our time outside on their fabulous deck. We love to fish and I must say that out of all the Air BnB rentals we have had at lake houses (this was the third), this was the absolute best fishing spot. We caught crappie, and catfish and the catches were plentiful. We kept 21 of the 25+ that we caught. The largest two catfish were 14+ and 16+ pounds. We definitely would love to come back in the future. Thank you so much for opening your home for guests to experience your lovely place."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,Unbelievably nice place. Everything down to the neighbors is a five star. I wish i would have had my family with me.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was great. Easy access to lake wonderful boathouse. Fishing was spectacular. Take a dip net. Close to town no hill to brave to waters edge. Highly recommend. 1en stars if I could.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay! The home is more spacious than the pictures, and very comfortably furnished. We had plenty of room for two adults and four teens. The kitchen is very well supplied with ample pots and pans, silverware, cooking utensils and appliances. The home is close to other homes but because of the shoreline it feels so secluded and private. The dock, where you will want to spend most of your time, does not disappoint! Plenty of toys, deep water to swim, life jackets for everyone including small kids and large adults like me. You feel like you’re in the middle of nowhere, but it’s an easy drive to grocery stores and restaurants. We will be back!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time in two month staying at this home so obviously we like the place. Our son is a student and nearby Georgia Military College and it's a perfect place for us to stay when we visit. Dave and Stephanie are great host and very responsive to any questions we had. The home is exactly as advertised, spotlessly clean, and easy to check in an check out.
If you're looking for a place to relax and get away from everything with a beautiful view this is a perfect place for you. We especially love the covered dock/boat house on the lake. The location on the lake is tucked away so you don't get a lot of the motor noise from boats or jet Ski's that you'd hear on the main part of the lake.
Overall its a great place to stay with nice and very responsive hosts"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"This is one of my favorite lake houses that I’ve rented on Lake Sinclair. It’s in a quiet area on the lake with a gorgeous new deck and all the amenities you need for a lake weekend. We loved the outdoor tv, and all the comfy chairs out there. The view from the back porch and the dock are perfect for watching the sunset."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at David and Stephanie’s lake home. We loved having paddle boards to cruise around the lake. Just 10 minutes from good restaurants in Milledgeville. The home is very peaceful and promotes relaxation.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a awesome time. Fishing was good. Very peaceful. Dock was amazing. Definetly will consider it next vacation.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I kid you not : this is one of the most scenic and tranquil experience i have had in my life. Lake is beyond beautiful . House is clean& well stocked with a pin to an anchor (pun intended). Good vibrations in every aspect. Hosts paid attention to details and are just wonderful humans .Hope to visit again soon.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My family and I had a great long weekend at Stephanie and David's lakefront cottage. It was exactly as advertised and looks exactly like the pictures. We struggled a little to get in which was mostly our fault, and Dave was very responsive and was quick to reply and got us right in.
The cottage was spotless and exactly as advertised. The best part of our stay was the beautiful brand new covered dock and the kayaks and paddle boards. The covered dock and fan were perfect in the summer heat and made for a couple of quiet, relaxing days on the water. Our two teenage boys loved the kayaks and paddle boards and the deep water dock was great for them to dive off of and swim. We also really liked the layout of the cottage - it had a nice open living area/kitchen and a huge table to eat/play games, and the bedrooms were separated and made it easy for people to sleep/get away from the group if they wanted to.
David and Stephanie were great hosts and we'll definitely be back"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay the grand daughters loved the paddle boards and we loved the kayaks. the view from dining to the lake I really enjoyed. You could sit and have something to eat or just enjoy the view of the lake. Everything was very easy to use and put away. would love to visit again
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Excellent place to stay!!!! We enjoyed it so much everything you need is there the view is amazing the dock is so nice and the swimming is perfect for your family . Hopefully Stephanie and David will continue to share their home so my family can visit again
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"The dock and swim area was great. It was very hot so the covered area and ceiling fan were wonderful. We enjoyed the kayaks and paddle boards also. The ladder on the dock was the best I’ve seen, very sturdy! We had our wake boat with us and really appreciated the cleats to tie it up. The house was very clean and stayed very cool."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place. Fabulous dock and view
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"despite the few hiccups we had during our stay, david and stephanie were amazing hosts. they were always more than willing to help us and make sure our stay was the very best. we really enjoyed being able to sit out on the dock in the evening and watch the sunset. truly cannot say enough wonderful things about the two of them as hosts!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great view!
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,My family and I really enjoyed this beautiful place. Coffee on the dock was amazing. Made new memories fishing with my son and teaching my grandson how to cook a steak on the grill. Was allowed a late check out which gave us time to enjoy breakfast together and have a few more laughs. The host were available at all times and great to work with. Will definitely be back. You will love this place. Plenty of room but cozy and inviting.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What an awesome experience! We loved the house and the location. It was really peaceful and we would love to stay there again and bring our boat!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We came to visit our daughter at school for the weekend and staying here was a great decision. I’m not sure why anyone would stay at a hotel when this is available 10 minutes from downtown Milledgeville. It was great having a cup of coffee on the dock to start the day. Very peaceful. Communication was quick and check-in was a breeze. We will definitely be back!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lake house is perfect for someone who enjoys the great outdoors. The property is very well maintained and easy to access from land or water. The covered dock is a great place to drink a hot cup of coffee in the morning and a nice cocktail in the evening watching the sunset.

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is an excellent choice for a peaceful stay at the lake. Our family stayed here for 4 days to celebrate a birthday. Quiet lake area. We had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. Great place to unplug!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Revel and her husband were very good hosts. Beautiful home was very impressed with the whole property. Also had complimentary snacks and drinks provided that wasn't listed in the amenities. Will definitely stay again if ever in the area.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Prices comparable with local hotels without all the other people and noise. Room was gorgeous and hosts were great. Shower is a little tight for larger people but overall wonderful stay.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is the second time I've stayed at Revel's place, and it was just as peaceful and beautiful as the last time. Great value for the price, she and her husband are super friendly. The apartment is lovely, full of historic charm. The location is quiet and feels private, despite being only a short drive away from downtown. I would gladly stay again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"An architecturally original house! Loved staying in what felt like a separate house, but still connected. However, the best part of the stay was Revel, herself. She is a generous soul and a wonderful hostess. I'll be back!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a lovely visit at Revell’s historic home. She is the perfect host. The place was clean with a lot of charm and had everything we needed, including snacks and drinks. We highly recommend it."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved our stay at Revel's place. It's in a beautiful spot, and the room itself was so inviting and cozy. Revel shared with us the history of the home and her enthusiasm and hard work in restoring it shone through. We will most definitely stay here again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Charming historic home in a private setting. Revel was a wonderful host and we look forward to our next visit
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,The stay was even better than anticipated! Every aspect of the stay was exceeded our expectations.

I definitely recommend this adorable location to any Be looking for a place to stay while visiting Milledgeville.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Superb historic stay. Great location and proximity to Milledgeville but also feels incredibly rural. First class.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay in a historic home.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome stay! The room was very unique and just beautiful. Lots of history! I would definitely recommend the stay.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Revel and her husband were a delight. I could go on and on but I’m grateful that AirBnB brought me to them. I would love to stay there again on a future trip to Milledgeville.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Revel was a fantastic hostess! Very warm, personable and responsive. Staying in her beautiful antebellum home was like stepping back in time- very cool! Clean, well stocked small kitchen niche, lovely antique furnishings. The setting was quiet and private without being remote to nearby restaurants and other amenities. Beautiful gardening beds with blooming flowers show Revel's attention to beautiful details that made this a special setting for a quick ""get away"". We could not have found a better setting to relax and unwind."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying in this beautiful home was a real treat. The porch was relaxing and the bed was super, super comfy. Matt and Revel were kind and gracious hosts and we appreciated their hospitality. We loved their dogs too! The room was clean and wonderfully decorated."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Revel and Matt were such great hosts. They immediately welcomed us. We very much enjoyed getting to know them and the time they took showing us the yard, their garden, and giving us some local recommendations. The home and the room were absolutely lovely. We love history and historic homes, so this was perfect. Our stay, our accommodations, and our hosts more than exceeded our expectations. Next time we visit Milledgeville, we would love to stay here again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful historic home on a private wooded piece of property. The owner was helpful at check in and gave us great recommendations for dinner. Will return if we are in Milledgeville again.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I've enjoyed staying in some wonderful historic manor houses, castles, villas and homes, but Revel's historic farm house ranks at the top of the list. This beautiful home does not fit the ""farm house"" perception... it's far more elegant in it's own casual way; the rooms are tastefully decorated and appointed; the grounds are beautiful and serene... and George, Bella and Flynn (the 3 resident Labs) are sweet and entertaining. If the house and setting aren't enough, Revel and Matt are gracious, accomodating hosts that make the stay worthwhile just to meet them. This is a wonderful place to stay while you visit the beautiful old homes in Milledgeville."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Thank you for dealing with me and helping me with all the preparation I had to do for a fishing tournament. Y’all are great hosts with beautiful property!

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely gorgeous setting and such a comfortable room! Five stars is not enough- this was an absolutely perfect get away!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful place. The care taken to make it feel historically accurate is noticeable. Since it was an anniversary surprise for my wife, the fact that she had tears when we pulled into the driveway confirmed I had made a good choice! The room has everything needed for a very nice stay. The hosts are very friendly and the grounds offer wonderful opportunities for strolls, sitting and meditating, birdwatching and star gazing. We did not watch much television but they do have internet TV available. The coffee maker is a nice start to the day. Milledgeville has so much history, so many neat things to see and do, and a large grocery store nearby offers everything you might want for a carefree stay. Restaurants are conveniently nearby. We saw deer nearby and kept hoping they would show up in the yard! Landscaping was very nice and we felt so comfortable we would not change a thing!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place to stay and so close to Andalusia

2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful experience. Revel was such a gracious host and her home was beautiful.
My sister and I were driving the Antebellum Trail and Milledgeville was 1 stop in our journey and it was a wonderful stop. Revel's restored home was the perfect setup. We had a room (bedroom, bathroom and closet) that was separate from the rest of the house. Revel and her husband...and puppies made us feel so welcome. I got to get my furbaby fix by playing catch with their labs. The bed was super comfortable, the room temp was perfect, and she even had snacks and drinks for us....most importantly coffee. I got to sit on the porch and drink coffee in a rocking chair, can't ask for a better setting.
Revel recommended a restaurant at the country club and it was delicious.
If you're in the area, don't hesitate to stay with Revel. It was the perfect place and they were perfect hosts."
2022-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"The ceiling is palatially high, yet the room is thoroughly warmed on a cold night because the wing has its own heat pump. The spacious room is unusually well decorated with antiques, appropriate, handsome and sturdy."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Revel was great - there was bad weather in the area and the power went out before we arrived. She let us know and kept us updated.

2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing on its own. It’s quiet and peaceful and so beautiful. It’s obviously a historic house, and Revel has done an amazing job keeping it up. The bed was comfy and the room was perfect. Although the shower was really small, but that’s to be expected with a historic house. Revel was so sweet and responded instantly. She did our check in so quickly and showed us around the room, Like where all the snacks were, coffee maker, and all that and then she excused herself. She was available if we needed her. And probably the sweetest thing she did, she made us blueberry muffins the morning we checked out! I mean, if waking up to birds chirping isn’t enough, we got to munch muffins! This entire experience was AMAZING! Thank you Revel!!"

I could write numerous paragraphs about our wonderful, extensive visit here in Milledgeville, Georgia, but I will delimit to a couple. We could not have picked a better place to stay while we evacuated from Savannah and Hurricane Dorian. Our hosts completely took care of us in so many ways. They gave us day travel tips, restaurant suggestions and special attractions to see in a fifty mile radius.
We appreciated our private wing which was complete with a superb bathroom, coffee maker, microwave and a much appreciated “snack basket.” Our room was filled with antiques and had a dreamy, comfortable king sized bed. All the comforts of home.
Most importantly, our host were loving, charming, humorous and respectful of our privacy. We will be back."

2018-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The rooms are located well off the road, in a peaceful wooded setting. If you like antebellum architecture and style, you will love this home.

2018-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Revel's place is a walk through history, yet the accommodations are modern and comfortable.

2017-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Revel's place is a magnificently restored mid-19th century ""Folk Victorian"" house located in a lovely wooded area. Staying at Revel's place is like taking a trip back in time, given the efforts made to restore the house in an authentic manner. We were warmly greeted and welcomed upon our arrival, and found wonderful snacks as well as interesting reading materials about the house and the charming college town of nearby Milledgeville."
2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"They have a beautiful historic property that makes you want to come back. You have your own privacy as well. I am bringing my wife back with me next time I'm in the area. The host couple is so friendly, thoughtful and caring. You can't beat this!!!"

2017-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is one of those Airbnb spaces that completely exceeds your expectations.

Would definitely stay again!"
2017-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Going to nearby Andalusia Farm, Home of Flannery O'Connor, visiting GCSU or Historic Milledgeville, or simply desiring a getaway, staying here will guarantee that you leave relaxed and smiling. Revel is a thoughtful and sweet hostess, and incredibly understanding -- when it turned out that I was going to be a good many hours later than my 6 pm check-in, she kept the lights on and stayed up to get me settled in -- even though she had to work the next day! The room has its own private entrance and is simply beautiful, as is the house itself. The surroundings are relaxing: I sat on the porch and watched fireflies. One of the best parts is that the mini fridge is near extra cola cans and water bottles -- I could keep the fridge stocked as needed. The generous snack basket was my best friend on more than one late evening! Finally, while the location is secluded, it is NOT inconvenient. It a minute from the highway that takes you anywhere you need to go. In short: this place is perfection itself."
2017-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing home full of history and beauty !! We loved staying at this home for our anniversary weekend !!
A perfect choice for getting away from the city noise.
The delicious fresh muffins for for breakfast were a special touch !!

2017-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I can't stress enough how beautiful our room was and how gracious and accommodating Revel was.

2016-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic place to stay. It is a huge house on a large lot (just walking around the lot is an awesome experience). I believe it's designated a historical site. Revel, Matt and their dog are very pleasant and accommodating, they communicate by phone/text and are very easy to get in touch with. The room is separate from the house, connected by the porch and is absolutely gorgeous. It has it's own personal bathroom as well, so it's a fantastic private room. It is amazingly decorated and has a stocked mini fridge and keurig. It is so romantic as well, the location is so beautiful, arrival at night under the clear beautiful starry night sky with so little light pollution (next time I gotta take my telescope!). I highly recommend it to anyone."
2016-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Staying in Revel's fabulous antebellum home is a treat not to be missed. I arrived to the smells of scuppernong jelly being made in the kitchen, and indeed, I came home with some of her delicious bounty! Everything in the guest wing of this lovingly restored ""grand dame"" was perfect: luscious linens and towels, bottled water, coffee and tea, fresh fruit, homemade muffins, and assorted snacks. When I woke up this morning, the tranquil woods outside called to me and I took an early morning walk. Deer and fox scampered by. This is truly a magical place and Revel's picture is in the dictionary when you look up the term ""southern hospitality."" I made a new friend for life. You should experience this special place."
2016-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had an amazing stay with Revel and Matt in Milledgeville, GA. They were such gracious hosts, and what an amazing house! Snacks in the room and fresh muffins in the morning put it over the top. More than we expected, for sure.

The house is close to Georgia College, Georgia Military College, and Lake Sinclair. It's also close to shopping and dining, but it feels like you're in the country.

We'd recommend it to anyone."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay, the location was perfect for a weekend to visit our daughter at college. The house was absolutely amazing with the perfect view!! John and Lisa was amazing at communicating and accommodating for what we needed. We will definitely go back there and rent for future events and visits."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Charming home with the most amazing view!! Quiet and peaceful - exactly what we were looking for. Newly renovated, super clean, warm and welcoming. All amenities were at our fingertips and every little detail was done thoughtfully. It is the perfect location to get away, rewind and breath. Professionally managed and the check-in/out process was seamless and pleasant.
If I could give this house and most definitely the host more than 5 stars I would.
Yes, I would go back.. hopefully soon :)"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I know some feel that this “side of town” can be considered unsafe, but with the security that patrols the asylum grounds, we felt 100% fine. The house was lovely, we loved the historic character. This was our son’s graduation from GCSU, but if he was still there, I’m sure we would be back!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Had a wonderful stay at the Old Asylum. The house was exceptionally clean and cozy. Beautiful scenery all around and BONUS, it's on the grounds of what is said to be one of America's most haunted places. Our nights have passed peacefully and quietly here, but during the day there is the occasional voice saying hello from the female dorm or a banging door coming from the male dorm. Only seems to happen if you're alone sitting on the benches of the nearby center field. Believe me or not, your choice. Either way, this is one of the greatest Airbnb's we have stayed in and it was an exceptional value for the money. Tom is very responsive and will get back to you in just a few minutes if you have a question or a problem. We will definitely be back. Tom, thank you so much for sharing your home."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow!! This place is a very special find! It was convenient to so many places for kayaking, hiking, and so so many things to do. The Central State Campus is an amazing historical gem to walk around for all ages and I found myself having such memorable conversations with all my kids about what we were seeing and the history around us. The house is so so cool with an amazing porch that we used so so much! The layout was great and had tons of room for my family and we all loved staying in a house that was so unique. It was also spotlessly clean and had all the supplies that we could need! We loved this place and will definitely return."
2024-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This place did what we needed while in the area. We found multiple lady bugs throughout the house, notified Tom, and they came out and removed them. Apparently it is a local issue."
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"Absolutely perfect house right in the middle of the central state campus. A lot of history, and only a couple minutes from downtown with great restaurants. Perfect place to stay"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at Tom’s place. The house is amazing. Especially love the photos inside the house! Quiet area, right on the campus of CSH. Large yard with fenced area in back. Just a short drive into town where there are many good restaurants.
We went on a Miledgeville trolley history tour through town and learned a lot about the history of the Old Capital. Spent all day driving and walking around the CHS campus.
Can’t imagine a better place to stay!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The only negative thing was the small beetle like bugs upstairs in bathroom and bedroom
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,We had a great New Year weekend stay! The house was comfy with plenty of space for everyone. Thank you!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I enjoyed staying here over Christmas. A unique, charming, and historic place to stay! Especially if you're in town to visit CSH campus. Great if you love the beauty and character of an old house with its imperfections, yet crave modern conveniences like Wi-Fi and dishwashers. :) The house was very clean and uncluttered with all the cozy comforts of home. The living room, dining room, and kitchen are very spacious, plenty of room for a group to cook and enjoy a sit down meal.Nice fenced backyard area for dogs or children to play. Very quiet neighborhood, with the feel you are secluded, but close to everything like CSH and downtown. The only thing missing was an alarm clock. Bring your own if you don't respond to phone alarms like me. Highly recommend and appreciate Tom's flexibility with my check-in/check-out schedule."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Tom’s cottage! He was quick to respond to questions and very welcoming.
We recommend bringing or buying a couple of gallons of water to drink; the water from the faucets has a bit of a taste. Other than that, it was the perfect stay! What a great place to stay in Milledgeville!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Quiet, peaceful, I wanted close to asylum but it was also very convenient to downtown and everywhere else we visited. Clean and homey"
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great weekend getaway, we enjoyed every moment. The house had lovely character to it. We especially loved that it was close to everything, everything we did was 10 mins or less away."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying here! It was so clean and peaceful and fun!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My family came to visit during spooky season in October due to the location next to the state asylum. We had a fantastic time and the house was super clean.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful time at Tom's bungalow...the building is absolutely beautiful with original period details you just don't find in a modern home (I want that back bedroom!) The surroundings, while a touch eerie, are serene and while you don't have immediate neighbors you never feel too isolated. Thank you, Tom, and I'll be sure to recommend the 1928 bungalow to anyone who might be ""going to Milledgeville""!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is my second stay at Tom’s and it’s just as cozy and comfy as I remembered! I’m a photographer and photos you can get of the asylum are unique and beautifully spooky. ☺️ Perfect October getaway!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Having an advanced degree in psychology, working in mental health for 25 years, and writing a novel involving family history related to Central State Hospital, I had wanted to visit the facility for quite awhile. Staying in the bungalow made it such an authentic experience. An older home, yes, but still VERY comfortable. Everything needed was in the kitchen. The beds and sofas were quite comfortable. It was very, very clean. Loved the black-&-white photos of the area, which inspired my husband to look for places where they were taken so he could shoot his own. Very convenient to downtown. Tom responded immediately when we had a question. It is clear he is very attentive to his guests’ needs. He is a most hospitable host. I highly recommend staying at this home if you visit this area."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Amazing house! Located behind the Pecan Grove. Able to walk CSH grounds. We loved our stay here and very happy to have had an experience like this. Such an incredible piece of history. The house had everything you would need. Really glad to see the preservation of the house. So much character. Large yard and fenced in area for our dog. This was one of the best stays we have had!
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place easy access, the insane asylum made for a very different experience. I must say it was usual. The grounds were well worth exploring in a vehicle. Lots of history and buildings to see.
Tom did respond to all of our needs promptly and resolved any issues we had. It was a good experience."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Thank youTom! Great time had by all. I was familiar with the house because of a childhood friendship with a former resident so it was like stepping back in time. Good job on the renovation and glad you didn’t do too much to alter the character of the house. We will be back I’m sure. Kind regards! Mike, Linda, Elizabeth, and Melanie Crittenden"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had a thoroughly enjoyable visit at Tom's place. Everything was wonderful and relaxing. I will definately return.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Took a girl's trip to relax, sightsee at CSH, and just spend time together. The house was as described and clean. It was far enough away but close enough to downtown. We spent a lot of time on the porch in the mornings and even enjoyed watching 2 little deer play jn the yard across the street. We would definitely stay here again! Thank you, Tom!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautifully restored home on the grounds of the former Asylum. The house was perfect, and all of the artwork was pictures of the Hospital. It's huge, beautifully decorated, and our dog absolutely loved the spacious lawn! We would 100% stay here again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tom’s cottage is a fabulous place to stay when visiting Milledgeville. The cottage is in a lovely, historic setting. I highly recommend it."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Checked out this morning and we gotta say, this Airbnb was worth every penny. It had everything. All you need to bring is your clothes and toothbrush. Tom was extremely responsive and friendly via our email exchange, but more than that, as old home enthusiasts, we gained an enormous amount of respect for him as a human for the care in which this house was restored. It’s a beautiful home and well worth the fee. Beds were comfortable, the kitchen was well stocked with utensils and coffee (thanks, Tom!!). There was plenty of information on the house, the nearby asylum as well as town and neighboring areas.
We would highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking to explore historic Milledgeville and the Asylum."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely love this place.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay in this historic cottage on the campus of Central State Hospital - we loved the history. The cottage was very comfortable and clean. We loved the privacy and location - so peaceful. Really enjoyed sitting on the screened porch listening to the birds. It was the perfect place for our girls weekend exploring the history of Milledgeville.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved the bungalow! So homey! Felt like my grandma was gonna come out of the kitchen at any minute!
Thanks for a great weekend! Rest assured we will be recommending your place to everyone!!
Dave & Angie, Don & Penny"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,The property was exceptionally maintained. The history is amazing….scary but amazing!
2023-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Appreciated history of area
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed this historic home and the surroundings. We loved staying in the home and it was very comfortable. We will stay again when we return.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay at Tom's place! The location was perfect for what we wanted to do and Tom was very friendly! Highly recommend!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We LOVED staying here! It was the perfect staging area for photography and exploring the grounds of the state hospital. All the pictures in the home of the old state hospital and asylum were a very nice touch.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,These home is nice and well spacious.
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay in a truly unique local. Home has lots of character, is well furnished, clearly well taken care of.
Seems to be an insect issue as there were generally 20+ ladybugs in each room, but nothing else out of order.
If we return to the area again I would gladly rent from them again."
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"Tom is great! Patient, responsive, and super helpful. weddings crazy and changing, Tom just always through made my job easier!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Tom's cottage is charming; I am delighted with my choice to stay there. I am looking forward to returning in the future. There is a lot to explore around the old asylum. Don't miss the helpful brochure Tom has left in the notebook ~ it is a walking tour of the asylum (exterior only). Thank you for your hospitality and flexibility with my schedule! Highly recommend!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My two 14-year-old grandchildren were excited to be able to walk around the abandoned Mental Hospital and Cemetary. They love discovering places like this. We actually pranked them our last night at the home and had their parents from Portal, GA drive over while we were at dinner and be inside hiding upstairs making scary noises and displayed knives on the kitchen table like they had upset the spirits when exploring earlier in the day. The kids were so scared, my grandson packed his suitcase and said he was ready to go home that night. He is 14 and was crying and saying let's leave. My granddaughter was braver than he was but still scared. She is a diabetic and said in the beginning either her sugar was low, or she was scared because her legs were shaking. Hearing them both talk about what they encountered that night on the way home and saying it must have been spirits was hilarious. To make it more believable their parents snook out the back door and went back home unnoticed."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Good place to stay
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Exactly as described. Close to everything. Definitely would stay again.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great Spot, and beautiful location!"
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"We stayed at Tom’s while in milledgeville for family weekend at Ga College. We absolutely loved it and it was perfect and charming. The house was very clean and we had everything we needed! My son is a freshman and staying at Tom’s place will be a new tradition we will start while Sully is a student. Looking forward to many more visits to come. Tom also, was very accommodating and responsive to all our requests!! Thank you Tom. Carla Wootton"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tom was very accommodating. We loved the historic charm of the home and the close location to CSH. The home was clean and had everything we needed. Our pup loved the fenced in backyard too!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this house. It was secluded and quiet. Plenty of space for us, everything you could need provided."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a fantastic place to stay!!! I love all things spooky so this was a terrific place to kick off “Spooky Season”. The house itself is clean, well-laid out, historically beautiful, and huge! All furniture and beds were comfy. Tom was great at communicating and super responsive."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was absolutely amazing. Communication was top notch and check in was a breeze. The home is clean, well stocked, and updated for comfort while maintaining the historic charm that makes it one of a kind. The balance between originality and modern upgrades was spot on. Location is fabulous. We came for the history, and this house delivered!"
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"We were in town for a wedding and being a photographer I have always wanted to explore the abandoned Central State Hospital campus. Would have loved to be able to spend even more time exploring and documenting with photos. The whole experience was amazing and exciting, thank you so much for the opportunity!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great visit. The house was very clean. Tom was easy to contact. It is awesome that the house is on the property, but you do have to walk up a small hill to get to the buildings. The first night we tried to walk, but worried about fast cars and no sidewalk. The second night we drove to the middle of campus. That made us feel safer and it was easier to walk around the buildings."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a dark tourist or ghost hunter’s dream come true! The interesting history of the asylum, and the beautiful grounds of the complex are enchanting. This home is so spacious, and being able to bring your dog along to take in the experience of the campus, is wonderful! We all had plenty of space to relax in the evening, and loved the local imagery art throughout the house. After living in Georgia for 25 years, I had no idea we had such an educational and interesting area to visit. I highly recommend Tom’s house."
2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"When entering this 1928 bungalow style house, you feel you have stepped back in time, with much the same as it must have been then. The yellow bedroom with the twin bed is so charming and flooded with light; my adult daughter loved sleeping and waking in this peaceful room. Each bedroom is spacious with comfortable bed. The dining room is also full of light and a wonderful gathering space. We were there when it was very hot, but the house was cool and comfortable. In the evenings we loved sitting under the ceiling fan on the screen porch, listening to the serenade of insects; took me right back to my childhood Southern summer nights."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is an awesome house to stay in if you are visiting Milledgeville. It’s a quaint older home with lots of character and charm. We appreciated being so close to downtown as well as to the state hospital. It was fun to walk around there with our dogs. We stayed during vey hot days of summer and the cool AC was a relief. Clean house with ample room for our kids and dogs. Highly recommend!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a great experience! The house is well appointed and sits on a beautiful location. I especially loved the artwork which features historical pictures of the asylum. Our dogs loved the fenced yard! Since our daughter will cont8nue her education at GCSU, we’ll be back!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay in this beautiful home. Convenient to everything that Milledgeville has to offer. We will be back!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautifully renovated! Yet the original charm remains.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Tom, thank you for a wonderful experience at your beautiful home! I didn't want to leave and appreciate your generosity and hospitality during our daughter's graduation weekend.
The cleaning supplies that you provide are perfect and well appreciated. Normally, everyone is concerned about running out of TP or Paper towels but it was so nice not to have to worry and easier to clean up after ourselves bc of what you provided. I also think that your fenced in backyard is WONDERFUL for pets and for so many things - my nephew said he wished he'd have had a football bc your yard was perfect to throw a few catches. Your yard is HUGE! As a parent of a child at GCSU, I wish I'd have known about your place sooner - we've always stayed at Hampton Inn and Holiday Inn Express for a comparable price, and your place beats those hands down - especially bc of being pet friendly and the history of the home. Your porch was amazing, the home was GORGEOUS, and we had such a wonderful time! THANK YOU!"
2022-05-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Very quiet and spacious.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect spot for a relaxing weekend in the Miledgeville area. The entire Centeal State Hosptial Campus is at your fingertips. The house is spacious, clean and has everything you could need for a nice relaxing getaway."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We had an extended stay and it was really nice. First off, it's an old house, so there were a few maintenance things that came up, but nothing major and the host was timely in his response to address any issue. We have two pets and I think both didn't want to leave. Also privacy was important and there were times when we felt like the only ones on the campus grounds. Sitting on the screened in porch was one of our favorite things. Lots of space in the living areas and kitchen too. I can tell there is lots of history and energy there. Overall it was a good stay and an experience we won't forget."
2022-02-01,4,Group trip,"Great place to stay near the historic medical district of Milledgeville. Tom was quick to respond with questions we had. Overall, great place to stay."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay at the ""Pecan House"". Spacious old home with lots of character. Fenced yard was thoroughly enjoyed by our dog, Lizzy. Breakfast each morning in the bright, airy kitchen was lovely. Tom, our host, was great. Super communication and quick to respond to any question we might have. A water main broke just outside the house and Tom was on it and the problem fixed before we got back from the days activities. The Asylum campus self driving tour was super interesting and the close proximity to downtown, parks and the lake were definitely appreciated. Thanks for everything Tom!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great old house with oodles of character! We definitely enjoyed our stay!!
2022-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I had a very nice stay at Tom's place. It was a quaint little older home, and had a lot of history in regards to the Asylum. Its a little rough on the edges, but it has so much character, and we had a very enjoyable stay. Would highly recommend if you are into older homes, and would like to see a little bit of Spookiness because of the abandoned Asylum across the street."
2021-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,Spacious house close to downtown Milledgeville. The house is quiet and set apart. We had lots of room as a family of four.
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,"What a unique home! My family so enjoyed our stay. We were in town for a mountain bike race, and we decided to stay a little longer to enjoy the history of Milledgeville. This house’s location was convenient for us to travel to Bartram Forest for the races, and unique in being on the asylum grounds. We did the driving tour of the hospital campus, which was fun. If you’re into history with a touch of creepy this is the place for you! We’ll definitely be back next year!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is an awesome house, with an awesome host. Tom was very responsive, and the house has amazing charm. All the little touches of comfort items made it so cozy and welcoming. Will definitely stay again!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an incredible location and interesting, beautiful house! Huge rooms and plenty of bathrooms for two couples to each have their space. Beautiful hardwood floors, huge dining room table, very large kitchen, and a cozy living room. We loved being able to tell people that we were staying on the asylum property and seeing their reactions! A quick, five minute drive away from the downtown area (which is full of lots of shops and restaurants) as well as GMC and GC. DoorDash was available and offered many options that could deliver dinner. Pet friendly and a fenced in yard which meant that our dog could not only travel with us, but also didn’t have to be walked on a leash and could go out in the backyard with us and explore the space. We are already talking about staying here again on future visits to Milledgeville."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,Tom was very helpful in accommodating our complicated schedule and need for extra room! A very pleasant stay and interesting house!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This is a very relaxing, convenient house!"
2021-08-01,4,Group trip,the place was clean.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful opportunity to stay on the campus of an institution like this. The house was really atmospheric and comfortable, and there are great places to eat close by. We also visited Flannery OConnors farm and everything was easy to get to."
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,We had an amazing time. We spent hours looking at abandoned buildings and didn't even see them all. Tom our host has outstanding customer service. The AC quit working and he had someone there and it was fixed in about an hour. I recommend anyone stay at any of his properties.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely, spacious place, and VERY quiet. Quite close to things to see, and a pleasant retreat after walking or visiting historic houses."
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,This Airbnb was amazing very beautiful 1928 home. We had a great time staying there a great time touring the town. We pretty much had the whole area to ourselves other than a few other people touring And the security guards that ride by once in a while. But everyone that we met was extremely nice. The history of the buildings are amazing in that town. I would suggest anyone go check it out if you like history. Marie
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place! Fantastic host!! Thanks Tom!!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Fun stay - interesting history in that area.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Tom's place is very cute and very roomy. We were in town for a family bridal shower and it was perfect for us. The only negative I can say is that the water does smell of sulfur and there were ladybugs in the upstairs rooms.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. Comfortable living space with a nice kitchen and a few large tables for meals and working on our laptops. My son had a medical issue and Tom graciously allowed us a later check out without hesitation. Quick to respond and really easy to work with. Highly recommend if you’re in this area!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful house that met our needs. We had a great time. The driving tour was awesome. Would stay again
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We truly enjoyed Christmas in this home. Long walks on the grounds made for great days and the layout of the house was wonderful for our adult family. The large kitchen and dining table allowed us to have a wonderful holiday dinner.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great, Great, Great!"
2020-10-01,4,Group trip,"This old home is quite charming! Being that it is old; please keep this in mind if you are used to more modern accommodations.
Complementary snacks, coffee and historical tidbits were absolutely awesome!
Beds were comfy. Washer & dryer worked great. Plenty of parking if you are sharing the space."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This lovely old home is charmingly decorated. It is peaceful and also very close to attractions in Milledgeville. Tom is a gracious and attentive host. Will book again.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great find!
2020-08-01,5,Group trip,If you are looking for a nice and quiet place this is it. Close enough for a quick drive for food and stores. Yet kinda of isolated and quiet. Also quite roomy.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,a beautiful house very clean and comfortable close to everything
2020-08-01,5,Group trip,Tom was quick with all responses. The house was in a good location in a great little town. We enjoyed our stay there to move our daughter in for an AmeriCorps position. We would stay there again...great value for the price!
