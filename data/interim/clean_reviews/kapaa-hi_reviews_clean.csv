2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay! Stacey was a great host and even included a welcome note and snacks! The property also has a lot of amenities that we had free access to (pool, mini golf, ping pong, etc). Unit is on the first floor and there was lots of parking near to the unit. You could hear people walking in the above unit, but it didn't bother us. Other than that, it was very quiet. There were also useful extra items in the unit such as small cooler, beach chairs, beach towels, two standing fans, pack and play for baby, etc. Very central location and close to Kapa'a town, which has a lot of restaurants. We had a small issue during our stay and Stacey was quick to respond and provide a resolution. We appreciated her attentiveness to make our stay an enjoyable one. We hope to return again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This rental exceeded our expectations and Stacey seemed to have thought of everything to make our stay comfortable.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very very nice! I’ll come back someday!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is our third time staying here. We keep coming back because it’s the perfect location. Central to both south and north shores + walkable to get coffee, lunch, shopping, etc. You can walk to watch the sunrise at the beach and it’s just steps from the pool. Stacey keeps it nice and clean and stocked with all the supplies you need!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Central location in Kauai, ideal starting point for excursions in all directions. The location directly on the beach was also great for walks along the coast.
The condo is on the first floor and was super well decorated.
It's a little clairvoyant: if you shower upstairs, then the rushing from the water is clearly audible. But I didn't have a problem with that.
I'd love to go back here anytime."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the apartment. Very clean on arrival and everything is in new to great condition. I have never stayed in any rented house that had as much as this place did. You didn’t need to go the store for the annoying 1oz of cooking oil, salt and pepper for example. It had all the basics and then some, including a welcome basket of snacks. It’s also the first rental that has sharp knives that don’t bend, it might seem trivial but was a nice surprise for people who like to cook.
It’s so easy to walk or bike anywhere and there’s an abundance of restaurants very close. Would gladly stay again.
You can hear the people walking above but it did not affect our stay. Loved it"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stacey’s condo felt like home and was easily walkable to town! Stacey made it super easy to check in, I had all the information I needed before arriving and had the resort receptionist, Stacey and an on island point of contact if I needed anything during the stay. The island is absolutely stunning and the condo’s location made it so easy to explore all the trails, restaurants and beaches Kauai has to offer without wasting too much time driving there."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Stacey’s condo was well stocked with all the necessities and more. The place was very clean and the location was prime. Very short walk to old town Kapa’a, with great food options, coffee shops and shopping.
We were welcomed to the condo with a personal note from Stacey and treats for us to enjoy. The complex amenities were great and the staff very friendly.
Perfect place for young families!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was great, the kitchen very well equiped, the bathroom was big, and the living room has a nice view to the yard with palm trees. The apartment is also equiped with beach umbrella and towels for for the beach that we used a lot. The location was also very good, lot of nice places to eat around! Would definetely recommend!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Everything was as advertised, no complaints. Stacy is very accommodating."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stacey's place was one of our best-ever vacation rentals. She was extremely responsive prior to our trip and let us know that she was available to answer any questions we might have during our stay. Her rental was stocked with all advertised amenities plus a number of welcome surprises. The condo was the perfect location to get to the beach, the 7+ mile bike path, and lots of restaurants. We would not hesitate to stay with her again the next time we might find ourselves in Kapa'a."
2024-02-01,3.0,Stayed about a week,"Overall, we liked the place. The coffee maker was off the hook. I may think about buying one. The beds were awful. The bed and the fold out couch squeaked to the point that you could hear someone rolling over in bed. We cooked a pizza only to find out there were no pizza pan or pizza cutter. The number of dinner plates could have been better. Would like to have had two umbrellas. Being on the first floor was a mistake for us. The first floor is quite noisy. The people above us were getting up a 5 in the morning. The cleaning people, which they came several times made a lot of noise moving furniture around. Our sleep was effected by the things and the chickens, and I know several of these things the owner cannot do anything about, but in the end they did affect the overall feeling."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I cannot begin to list all the positive reasons to stay here. Great suite with everything you would ever need, great area central to everything. Pool area was wonderful and the Sandy beaches just a short walk away we’re incredible. You would not be disappointed renting this property."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This condo has it all. The location is perfect, walking distance to shops and restaurants, and the bike path and ocean are just a few steps away. The resort amenities are fun and add a nice element to the experience. Even though it's a condo, it's a resort so the best of the both! The condo is well stocked with helpful items like beach towels/chairs, ample quality linens, kitchen items, and useful items like spices and shampoo/soap. etc. The space is well laid out with dining table, sofa and large TV in living area, and a nice sized one-bedroom down the hall. My family of three was very comfortable and enjoyed our time. Check-in and check-out couldn't have been any easier and communication with Stacey was super fast and comprehensive. We will absolutely book again for our next trip."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stacey was a great host and the condo was very nice. Convenient to many attractions, stores, and restaurants."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stacey is an awesome host. This place is great but if you are bothered by people making a noise upstairs then this isn’t for you. Apart from that this is a 10 star place.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay and host! very well stocked for all living needs and fun activities. Clean, convenient, exceptional communication, and very nice touches like welcome snacks and drinks. Can't wait to come back!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Location was in the middle of everything with a beach, restaurants, and shops walking distance away, then much more to see with drives to the north or south of the island. It was very clean with a comfortable bed plus easy parking directly outside the unit. The unit is located in Pono Kai Resort so there are many added amenities from that as well such as a pool and fitness center."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"My wife and I stayed at Stacey’s place for three weeks and it was everything we had hoped for and more. The unit has nice upgrades (cookware, cutlery, TV size) and had a lot of good amenities (boogie boards, beach chairs, plenty of extra beach and shower towels, fans, first aid kit.) She also left a nice welcoming basket with snacks. The location of her place is the best we have found and this is our 14th year coming to Kauai. You are 45 minutes from the north shore or 45 minutes from the south shore so you can explore all of Kauai. There is a bike/walking path right behind the property on the beach and it is perfect for walks morning, day and night. Also there are plenty of restaurants and shops within a 5-10 minute walk in Kapaa. Stacey was very quick to respond and was very friendly. We would definitely stay at her place again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,A perfect stay at Stacey's. No neighbors' sound sounds have gone up to us. Everything was as described in the listing on an enchanting site. I would go back without hesitation!
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The location is a close walk to the beach which was beautiful. The host is great as she left snacks and a fun treat in the fridge. She provided all the necessities you need for a trip to the beach. The only downfall was the walls are pretty thin and you can hear your neighbors and people outside. This didn’t factor in to our stay much as we stayed active and out on the beach often during the day enough to pass right out at night.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Amazing place! Perfect location to the beach and to town/restaurants!! The place was super clean and right across from the pool so it was very convenient. It was a very short walk to town which has a ton of restaurants and shopping! We will definitely stay here again
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Me and my wife visited Stacey’s condo as part of our late honeymoon/ 1 year wedding anniversary. We had a great time! The condo is very nice and clean, and we loved the location. The town of Kapa’a it’s self is great, lots of good restaurants and convenient to getting to the other parts of the island as well. Beach access is also easily walkable from the condo. The beach gear like towels and chairs, boogie boards and even a couple pieces of snorkeling gear were super nice to have as well!
The only downside to the condo is if you are noise sensitive you may have trouble. You can easily hear your neighbors above and beside you, and while it didn’t bother us much if you’re a light sleeper or would be bothered by that it could be an issue. If you plan on using the washer/dryer make sure you have change or small bills (there is a coin machine on the resort.) All in all we really enjoyed our stay and recommend it!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome stay!
Stacey was super responsive and helpful, even after checkout.
Location was perfect in the middle of the island, close to airport, walking distance to beach, stores, restaurants.
Could not have asked for a better stay, other than a longer vacation to enjoy."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay in Kauai was absolutely amazing. Stacey made sure the place was stocked with everything you could need for an adventurous stay including great beach gear and accessories. Overall, this was an amazing place to stay but out of transparency, the main bedroom will get hot since the A/C doesn’t reach the room and depending on the guests on the second floor it could be very noisy, even at time. The resort itself had great amenities and we enjoyed how walkable the location was to the nearby town."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The host is amazing at communicating. She was responsive. The inside of the condo was really clean and spacious for the price. My only hesitation of giving this flawless ratings is something out of the host control: the noise. If you’re looking for a peaceful stay, this won’t feel like it. It’s on the 1st floor and you hear everything above you. The people staying above me stomped ALL day long - regardless of time. Woke me up at 615am walking around the bedroom 2 of my 3 nights. Other than that, convenient location too."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Kauai is amazing and this place is the best. It is an AirBNB in a resort right on the beach and walking/biking path. The location is mid-island so easy access to all areas. The accomodations were very clean and comfortable. Host solved a minor issue very quickly. Can't say enough about this place, it's the best!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Probably one of the best Airbnb experiences we’ve had in a very long time. Check in was easy and comfortable!
The apartment is so cozy, super clean and has everything you may need plus so many small, thoughtful touches we did not even expect and we truly appreciate.
The area worked perfect for us, and this was such a great experience! Would highly recommend!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This place is absolute wonderful. The condo was super clean and just so perfect for my husband and I on our honeymoon. Stacey has the place stocked!!! The beach chairs and little cooler was such a bonus!! The Pono Kai was awesome as well - the BBQs came in handy for cooking. We loved how close to the beach and town it was. Close enough to walk to grab a drink or dinner in town. I recommend the pono market for good Hawaiian plates and jimmys for a good drink/view! The only small downside was the noise from our neighbors above the bedroom. You could hear every step they took even when they woke up at 6 am. So just be aware for super light sleepers like myself!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Centrally located, clean, and perfect for a Kauai visit. Walking distance to old downtown Kapaa and any bars, restaurants, coffee shops, and shopping. You can walk along the bike path or road into town. If you don’t feel like driving far to a beach, you can walk right over to a beach just outside of the condo. Well stocked with kitchen items, and beach chairs, towels, and umbrella. Being on the bottom level is lovely to have the grounds just outside your lanai door."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying in Stacey’s beautiful condo. Really made me feel at home and had special touches to the room to help us feel welcomed. Would highly recommend staying here.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Stacey is very kind and understanding.
She responds quickly, and resolve any issues if we had any.
She is a great host❣️😊"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay in Kapa'a. The resort is right on the beach, with a bunch of cool amenities like a pool, hot tub, giant chessboard, croquet, hammocks, BBQ grills, and others. The condo itself has everything you need for a home away from home. The appliances are all new. The atmosphere is terrific, highly recommend it."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We spent 8 nights at Stacey’s and loved our stay. First, a nice note and complimentary snacks & beverages welcomed us. The kitchen and bathroom were beautifully updated and modernized. We loved having a full size kitchen, living room, and dining area. After dropping over $100 just on breakfast (for 2) the first two days, we cooked our own breakfasts after that which saved a lot of money and was far more relaxing. New ceiling fans helped circulate the AC so we could sleep comfortably (Tip: sleep with the fans on and the BR door open.) I was pleasantly surprised to find beach chairs, beach umbrella, and beach towels provided. We definitely needed those (especially the umbrella!). The grounds are gorgeous, and we loved walking the adjacent bike path along the ocean. Parking was easy and free, the location was convenient to both north and south shore, and we loved walking into town almost every day. We also used the onsite laundry. Can’t wait to go back!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This is our second time returning to this Airbnb. It has been updated by Stacy since our last stay in 2021. We always find a very convenient location. very close and walkable to a lot of restaurants and stores. The beaches only steps away. We love the amenities and thanks Stacey for stocking it with coffee and snacks.
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stacey was always quick to respond to all of our questions and an excellent host. The unit was well stocked and clean.
We had not previously rented an AirBNB unit in a resort before, only single family homes, so were unaware of what amazing amenities could be in store for us. This resort offers a long list of amenities, you could spend your entire vacation walking to shops and restaurants closeby and also engaged in amentieis right here on the property! Bocche ball, mini golf, croquet, games to check out, pool, hot tub, pickle ball, outdoor chess game, picnic tables hammacs and grills placed throughout the property not to forget the paved coastal trail that goes by the resort. And an herb garden to add to your home prepared meals!
Enjoyable location for a beautiful vacation!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We loved staying here! Great location next to the beach and tons of activities at the resort. Lots of good food within walking distance and optimally located on the island to get wherever you want to explore. Stacey was very responsive for communication and was a fantastic host! Would absolutely stay here again.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved it here! Beautiful location right next to the beach and Stacey made our stay very welcoming. We had a beautiful welcoming gift with snacks and drinks.
We were located close to different shops and restaurants.
One thing that can make the place better is having an air conditioner in the bedroom. The bedroom does get hot at night, so we just slept in the pull down bed in the living room.
Overall great spot and would definitely be back."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"right next to the beach, close to Lihue"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay a lot! Great instructions from the host and lots of small amenities that made our stay wonderful.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great location, communication.
Comfortable, clean.
Highly recommended."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This condo was perfect! It faces the pool and has a great lawn area with a hammock right outside. The beach is a short five minute walk away. It's also walking distance to all the shops and restaurants in Kapa'a. Be sure to try Kountry Kitchen for the best Loco Moco on the island and Java Kai has great coffee. The condo was just right for the two of us to have a nice relaxing trip. We loved that we could come back after a day of adventures and lounge in the pool or hot tub.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Stacey's is a great find, close to many attractions, and the grounds are beautifully landscaped."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Torrey’s place was perfect! Clean and comfortable with a beautiful view and lots of towels to take to the beach. Great shower pressure and temperature, peaceful and relaxing — would definitely stay again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place with great ocean views! It was also in the perfect location for us to be able to easily explore both the North and South Shore.
Check in was seamless and easy, and the place was spacious and very clean. There was also a handy book full of lots of local recommendations.
We would definitely stay here again if we were to ever come back!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a lovely stay for a few nights. The location was convenient access to all parts of the island we wanted to drive to and the views were beautiful to wake up to every morning. They provided everything we needed and we enjoyed borrowing snorkel gear.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This studio is amazing!! The views are incredible, the multiple windows allow for a great breeze all day and night! The studio is in a nice, quiet/safe neighborhood, in a central location in Kauai. The provided amenities such as washer and dryer, snorkel/beach gear is such an added bonus! We will definitely be back when we are back to Kauai next!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"10/10 would recommend! When I return to Kauai someday, I will definitely look up these girls!! The space was clean, cozy, and peaceful. Great location on the island. The girls are so friendly and made us feel like ohana!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed 4 nights in the apartment! Everything was so nicely arranged and we felt so welcomed with cute little notes with our name on it. Also, there were plenty of products in case we have forgotten anything. The view to the ocean is simply amazing. In the last night, there was a heavy thunderstorm which was really scary but we were happy that the apartment was on a mountain so flooding did not really affect us.
Thank you for letting us stay in your apartment! Highly recommend it to anyone going to Kauai!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had an amazing stay at the Torrey’s place!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Torrey and Sarah definitely go above and beyond for their guests! They were super accommodating when we needed to reschedule our trip. We received clear and prompt instructions before arrival and felt very welcomed when we got there and during our stay. What a great view! We enjoyed starting our day watching the sunrise from bed and having coffee on the deck overlooking the ocean. We appreciated their personalized recommendations for dining and activities on the island. They made it even better by providing all of the things you would want to enjoy a day at the beach. Highly recommend staying here!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"If you ever have a chance to stay here, you should! Beautiful view, comfortable and has everything you need for a long or short stay. They provided all of the things you need. Friendly and respectful of your space. Easy to get ahold of when needed! Will always stay here whenever we can."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and comfortable! Great place to stay because it’s a very central location to activities both north and south. Super clean with beautiful views! Responsive host w great instructions. Great value! Would stay here again!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved it! It’s clear Torrey and Sarah put a lot of thought and effort into hosting - great local recommendations, fully stocked with beach towels, toiletries, and snorkel gear available to use. The space itself was clean and cozy, and the balcony had great views of the ocean and mountains more inland - perfect place to have a coffee as the sun rises. We’ll definitely try to book here again in the future!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of our favorite b and b airs of the living room with exceptional sea and mountain views! We even had trouble leaving in the morning. Otherwise, the accommodation is very clean. A lovely decor. It has everything you need to be at home."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We will definitely be back, the town of Kapa’a is beautiful. So many local cafes and restaurants. Perfect location in regards to exploring the rest of the island. The studio has the most amazing views of the ocean then moves to the mountains. And has everything you need for a comfortable stay. Thank you"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay! Beautiful view, quiet neighborhood, all the amenities you need are provided and more! Great location, close to beaches, shopping, restaurants."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space was cozy and well-stocked with everything we needed! The view was amazing, and the breeze of the tradewinds with the windows open was quite comfortable. Kapa'a was just a few minutes down the hill, or a pleasant 25-minute walk. Lots of restaurants nearby, as well as the beach and bike path. The house was very central to the calmer beaches of the north side and the beautiful hikes of the south side. Having a washer and dryer available was great! The neighborhood was quiet....except for those darn roosters, lol! Great host and very responsive! Thanks Torrey!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures of the place were beautiful but when we arrived it was a WOW!! The place made you feel like it was a taste of home. Everything you needed they had….
I definitely would recommend this place to anyone, it was total serenity.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Terry and Sara was amazing, dreamy and lovely. It was a fabulous start for our honeymoon. Thank you so much for your availability and your kindness. We recommend this little paradise to everyone."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"everything absolutely top. We enjoyed the stay very much. The kitchen equipment was great. Also a grill was on site and some ingredients such as oil. Also the bathroom was super equipped. Very friendly and always eager. absolute plus point are the beach stuff that you can easily borrow, such as cooler, towels, umbrella, chairs, water shoes and even boogy boards.
Would come back anytime without thinking. Thanks!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location! So lovely and beautiful. We would defenetly book again!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay! The view and space is even better than pictures. Lovely hosts and fantastic coffee.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The location and the stay was amazing and beautiful!
The views in the morning sunrises were fabulous. I went on walks everyday and the neighborhood was always with children playing outside and adults talking to the neighbors. Plants everywhere I saw, flowers, Lulu (breadfruit) and much more.
I will be coming back and staying here all my Kauai adventures.
Thank you what an amazing experience.
Joni"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Beautiful little house! Perfect spot to stay easy to get across the island. Great location, the place is more magical than the pictures. Definitely coming back again! Thank you"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful location. Beautiful view. Great necessities. Fantastic holiday!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Torrey and Sarah's place is a terrific find. It is conveniently located and just off the beaten path to provide a real local experience. They've given attention to every convenience and detail to make you feel at home during your stay. They are friendly and willing to share tips and recommendations. We would love to return to Kauai and would not hesitate to stay here again! Mahalo for a great experience.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had an absolutely amazing stay! The views were incredible and in such a quiet neighborhood. The town was perfect and the commute around the island was easy from the condo.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I work 6 days a week and really needed to get away. My expectations were exceeded, and I could not recommend this place more."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We loved the authentic feel of the property and neighborhood. Good central location to launch from for exploring all sides of this amazing island. Kauai has been our favorite and definite planning on returning. Will definitely book with Torrey and Sarah if it is available! A bonus was the panoramic ocean/city view at a distance! Thanks for sharing this piece of paradise.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We loved our sweet nest. Beautiful views, quiet and had a lovely and consistent breeze. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a gem of a find. Book it if you can! Torrey's place has many of the amenities you would want for a stay on Kauai. We cooked breakfast daily and enjoyed our coffee on the deck with the beautiful light and gorgeous views. The communication, attention to details, and ease of arrival were all excellent. They provide many tips and ideas for places to visit, eat, and drink around the island. I would def stay again if I was lucky enough to find availability!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Torry & Sarah’s place was one of our favorite AirBnB’s ever. The view was spectacular. So many windows - you are always surrounded by a beautiful view. The location was great for exploring the east and north shores. This will be our first choice for a return trip to Kauai.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We couldn’t have asked for a better place to celebrate my wife’s 40th birthday in paradise! The view of the ocean from the huge windows was so peaceful. It was a perfect place to relax and reset before going off on our next adventure.
The studio was super clean, nicely decorated and included some really nice touches that surprised us (in a good way) upon our arrival. There’s a great balcony with chairs to sit and enjoy the amazing view. Torrey and Sarah are great hosts and were friendly and responsive.
The location in Kapa’a was a nice middle ground between the north shore, with Hanalei and Haena State Park, and the south side with Poipu and Waimea. Kapa’a itself has plentiful amenities and a great vibe.
Bottom line — we loved our stay and highly recommend Torrey and Sarah’s place!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"What a fabulous place to stay. It had everything we needed!! The view is out of this world.!! Torrey and Sarah were wonderful hosts.All the amenities you could ask for! Great location. Lovely, comfortable bed. Beautiful deck for watching sunrises and sunsets!! Wish I was there right now!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super awesome stay. We’d come back and recommend to friends and family.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We spent 4 nights in the beautiful apartment of Torrey and Sarah. It is well located; only a 5-minute drive to the old town of Kapa'a. There you will find great restaurants and small shops. The location is basically a good starting point for all activities south and east of Kauai. If you don't book another accommodation in the north, you can also get to Hanalei relatively quickly from here, etc.
The apartment was very clean, superbly equipped and seeing the sunrises out of bed was fantastic!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely unique! Hosts have taken care of the smallest detail. They make you feel fully cared for. Delicious coffee with vanilla and nuts macadamia complete the experience :) beautiful view from the window/terrace, very clean, lots of beautiful dishes in the kitchen, delicate linens. just paradise !"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home is awesome!
Amazing views. Cannot recommend enough. Torrey manages it very well. We had ample instructions available in good time. They also have a mini book with more guidelines and todos.
She is great to talk too and we loved all their recommendations around the island. 10/10 would come back again."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"More than pleasant studio with a breathtaking view of the shore in the distance. Good location, super clean with many attentions from the owners that make the stay easier. We'll be back for our next stay. Mahalo for everything."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Torrey and Sarah are great hosts! The communication and response time was noted to be exceptional right from the start. The studio is very cozy with a great view and has all the necessary essentials, plus more! I’m not sure when I’ll be back in Kauai, but I would definitely stay with them again!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The ocean view you see in the morning is really so cool,
I feel like I'm getting a gift from my trip to Kauai:)
The condition of the accommodation is good and I like everything in general, so I want to visit again next time ~!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for hospitality! It was wonderful!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I already cant wait to book another trip and stay here. I last minute changed my mind from doing a trip to Washington to kauai based off this airbnb listing and I’m so glad! I spent my 30th birthday here with my partner for his first time in Hawaii and it was nothing but awesome! Great communication from before we got there (Even with our late night flight delays and requests for later check out) to the very end. The little details (filled ice trays, complimentary laundry/boogie boards/beach umbrellas, etc) really make the difference! The location can’t be beat! Just a quick 20 minute walk to food, drinks, and beach! I can’t speak of this place highly enough."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a wonderful stay. The studio is located in a quiet neighborhood and is just a short drive from the beach and restaurants. It’s central location on the island also made it easy to go to both the North and South shore.
The amenities were top notch and we really appreciated all the beach gear. We highly recommend this Airbnb and hope to stay again in the future."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Torrey and Sarah truly thought about all of the details! We loved our stay and look forward to hopefully coming back! Definitely book your stay here!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,perfect location and stay during my first time in the garden island! great hosts- would love to visit again with Torrey and Sarah!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow what a view! This place made our first stay in Kauai incredibly memorable with the view of the town, ocean and mountains. We enjoyed the deck with morning coffee, cocktails and grilling. The studio was open, private and breezy. We had everything we needed for the beach including a cooler because we love to picnic. My husband and I loved our stay and wish we had another night or 2 there. Next time!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We highly recommend Torrey and Sarah's place! It was just perfect and we would definitely come back - if the way from Germany wouldn't be that far. ;-) If you are looking for a place to stay with perfect location, breathtaking views, cleanliness and all the trimmings look no further! :-)
------------
We can absolutely recommend the apartment of Torrey and Sarah! It was simply perfect and we would definitely come again, if it wasn't so far from Germany. ;-)
If you are looking for an apartment in perfect location, fantastic view, super clean... Well you name it, they have it... Stop looking, you just found it! :-)"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Torrey was such an amazing host. She was so easy to communicate with and had such a welcoming place to stay. Everything was so clean and orderly. AC was a nice thing to have and the small welcome gift was so sweet! We will definitely try to stay here again!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Torrey and Sarah were amazing! Perfect spot for a couple, great view. The location is great as well, near restaurants and the beach. Highly recommend for couples looking for a getaway."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was a dream. Cute little studio with all the necessities. It is close to beaches, shops, local food, etc. If you’re debating booking, this is a sign to book now. You won’t regret it one bit :)"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here, we were not ready to leave when it was time to head to our next destination! We are definitely spoiled when it comes to amenities now. The beach gear was so convenient, having a cooler, beach chairs with pockets for storage, an umbrella, sand mat, and of course beach towels available for free was amazing and made our beach time much more enjoyable. The space is open but well divided by furniture, and all very cute. The bathroom cabinet has pretty much anything you should need, and a little extra fun like books, games, and electric candles. We spent what downtime we had on the balcony looking out to sea and at the mountains, it's a great way to begin or end the day. I messaged ahead of our arrival for hiking recommendations and was given several options with helpful descriptions, and the guidebook in the space is extensive! Our trip was definitely made better by all the information provided. Most of our meals were at places from the guidebook and we were never disappointed! We even did a little shopping at a couple recommended spots and found some locally made perfume to take home. The location of this Airbnb is nice as you are a bit out from Lihue airport and docks but the drive back isn't long (and it's beautiful - 20-30m) if you choose to do an adventure from there. There are beaches nearby, and if you want to hit up Hanalei it is a bit more of a drive but still very doable and very beautiful, maybe 45m if traffic cooperates. Kapa'a is a cute little town with plenty to explore and an easy path along the beach if you are looking to meander with a view. If we are fortunate enough to head back to Kauai in the future we would definitely stay with Torrey and Sarah again!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay… the condo is in a great location and very homely. The view is spectacular and host had good recommendations / advice for our stay.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My girlfriend and I stayed here for a week on Kauai and loved every second of it. Kind and responsive hosts, incredible view, guide book with a plethora of great recommendations for food and activity across the island, and all your beach essentials at your fingertips. The studio itself is very cozy - a perfect space for two people. There is a/c if you need it, but we were comfortable the whole time with the fans on and windows open, so it was not needed. We also recommend this location because there are a lot of amenities in Kapa'a and also basically equidistant from the north and south ends of the island, so you really can get anywhere without too long of a drive. We will definitely be looking to stay here again if we come back!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful stay in this beautiful studio. Close to many restaurants and beaches in Kapa’a. Great trail close by for running, walking, biking. All you need and more provided including many extra personal touches. Great central location on the island."
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"We loved our stay at this Airbnb. It was clean, small, but had a beautiful view overlooking the ocean and the jungle, we awoke to the birds every day.
The reason this isn’t a 5 star review is solely because the parking is shared with the neighboring Airbnb and I wish that had been more clear, and the AC was only good for a few hours before it needed drained so overnight use wasn’t great.
Instead we opted to open the many windows and get a cross breeze going which for the most part made up for it.
I would absolutely recommend you stay here regardless of those few things. It was a perfect home base for our trip and I would absolutely stay here again. Much love to Torrey and Sarah for their hospitality. The guide book they put together is really something."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved everything about this place and location. It’s super clean and the view is outstanding. It is a residential neighborhood and very quiet with only the sounds of nature lulling you to sleep. If you’re looking for a place right on the beach, this is not it, but we’ve stayed on the beach before and would choose this location again over the pricy beach locations. Plus you can see the ocean perfectly! Kapa’a is central to getting to the beaches and sights in the north and the south. The only thing we missed was a microwave, but we made the most of the outdoor grill and stove, so really we were provided for perfectly. We will definitely stay here on our next trip to paradise!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, clean and open! Had a great view for sunrise. So refreshing to feel the breeze in the studio. They had everything that we needed - nail polish remover, aloe vera and laundry! Well-stocked bathroom and kitchen. The only downside would be the crickets and roosters at night/early morning but ear plugs are provided!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Cute studio with a great location as a home base for exploring the island. Very close to downtown Kapaa and convenient to East shore beaches. Torrey was quick to respond to any questions/concerns we had, and there were lots of little homey touches. I would highly recommend this place!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing accommodations and extraordinarily kind and responsive hosts. Property essentially located and had exceptional views. Highly recommended.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I spent a few days here in Kauai. We fell in love with the space the second we walked in. The pictures don't do it justice. And the location is incredible! We were able to enjoy the food trucks on the East Coast, visit the wonderful beaches on the South Coast, and go on beautiful hikes/enjoy the fun towns on the North Coast. However, our favorite part was probably cooking dinner with their available grill and waking up to the sunrise pouring through the windows.
We highly recommend!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Talk about paradise! Torrey and Sarah’s space was so lovely. The view is so incredible and even though it poured rain majority of our trip, we had the best time just hanging out on the lanai.
Great food and coffee just a few minutes away. Could not recommend more!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect studio to explore Kaui. You will not find anything better for sure.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This studio has a beautiful view and is located in a quiet neighborhood. I loved going out in the mornings with a cup of coffee to watch the sunrise. It is very conveniently located, close to all restaurants and shops in Kapaa. The hosts went out of their way to make this little spot feel like home including providing toiletries, coffee, books, games, and even art supplies. Thank you!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at the studio! The location was great and provided the perfect home base for exploring the entire island. Kapa’a itself is a very cute beach town and we loved the food options there! The hosts provided us with fresh fruit from the garden which was an added plus. Overall, I’d recommend it to anyone staying on the island."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great space with wonderful view. Located close to airport and in between Waimea canyon and the Na Pali coast hikes if you are on outdoor enthusiast. Nice personal touches and clean space.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The most peaceful and beautiful stay! Torrey and Sarah are very kind and thoughtful in providing the best accommodations. The room views are amazing and love the location to easily explore the whole island. So grateful to stay at Torrey and Sarah’s place. Peace to ALL
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a wonderful stay here! Torrey and Sarah were lovely hosts and their studio was absolutely perfect. The view is amazing and everything is very clean and nicely decorated. I loved how it is in a nice neighborhood but close to the cute town. It was a great launching point for exploring both the north and south parts of the island.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I had an amazing stay here and couldn’t have asked for a better place to have stayed in Kauai. The view was absolutely breathtaking and the location was very convenient from everything on the island. The Airbnb was clean, spacious and so relaxing. We would definitely stay here again!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful studio with amazing views and wonderful hosts!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hebrew below.
Torry is amazing, i had a confusion about the leaving date and needed to take off one day earlier, she accepted to change the dates immidiatly.
In addition, the apartment was very very clean! And comfortable.
The location was close to everything, right in the middle of Kauai. I recommend staying here.
Tori is amazing, I got confused on the flight date and had to change and leave a day earlier she responded immediately to the request and agreed.
In addition, the apartment was very clean and comfortable, an excellent location in the center of the island. Would recommend staying here!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really nice place ,clean good places to eat about 5 minutes drive… highly recommend"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Torrey’s place is bright and cheerful. Very well decorated with everything you would need. Would definitely stay again if I make it back to Kauai!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This place was the best place to stay at and my husband and I had a fantastic time. Torrey was very professional, kind, thoughtful, and provided great hospitality! The studio had such a great view and was at a convenient location on the island. They gave us fresh fruit from their garden mid week and provided so many extra supplies around the house if we needed. Thank you again Torrey!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Be ready not wanting to leave ever :-)
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is definitely one of the very best airbnbs we have ever stayed at! The view is STUNNING!!! The studio is very spacious as well as beautifully designed and decorated. It was so bright, airy and comfortable. We had everything we could possibly need- even including beach chairs and boogie boards. I sure hope to stay here again one day! I can't express enough how beautiful this airbnb is!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely unit with lots of thoughtful touches.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed all the windows in this studio space. The breeze was AMAZING!!! The beach gear and washer/dryer access was very convenient for our stay. The parking spot was great and the neighborhood was safe.
As the listings states, you will definitely be woken up to roosters in the early AM but earplugs solved that issue for me (deep sleepers, like my husband, was not bothered at all). Small amount of visiting bugs, which is expected and not a concern for us. Overall, we wouldn’t hesitate to stay again!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful. The place was a steal for the price, and the host was great. She responded to any needs we had promptly. The location is central to everything on the island and equal distance from both the north and south sides. The view was perfect. Would definitely stay there again."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space was absolutely beautiful, clean, and perfect location for adventures on any side of the island, or to stay close and take a walk through Kapaa town just down the road. One of our favorite things about the studio were all the windows where golden light shone through sunrise and sunset each day.
Torrey was also incredibly kind and helpful through our booking process and throughout our entire stay!
Looking forward to coming back again sometime!🌺"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fabulous studio, views are amazing and we loved just taking it all in on the balcony."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such an incredible spot! Conveniently located to restaurants, coffee shops, grocery stores and a great location if you are planning to traverse the island. It was such a retreat. The space was clean, cutely decorated, and had every accommodation you could think of!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Torrey and Sarah are excellent hosts and we couldn’t have stayed in a better spot!! Quaint and cozy with all the amenities we needed, and the perfect size to enjoy a nice little island getaway for two. Lots of natural light with incredible views! The windows pick up a great breeze so we didn’t even need to use the AC. The location is centrally located, which allowed us to hit most of the island during our stay. Torrey was also extremely helpful in helping us track down a wonderful rental car from a friend when we were coming up short on options, and quick to answer any questions we had. Not to mention, she was kind enough to offer us some fresh homemade banana bread (which was DELICIOUS!!!) We would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to plan a trip to Kauai, and hope to make it back one day because there is so much more for us to see!!!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about this place was perfect. The location is ideal if you’re interested in seeing the whole island while also having a lot very close to you. The studio is spacious and the lanai is the perfect place to enjoy morning coffee with a view. If we could give more than 5 stars for the value, we absolutely would. Extremely low cost for such a great place. Thank you!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If I could put 6 stars I would. This place has amazing views of the beach and mountains and is in a great spot located centrally on the island so you don’t have to drive too far. Had all the amenities you could ask for and the host went above and beyond by having some extra amenities like bananas and coffee. They went out of their way to add little touches like leaving a handwritten note welcoming us for our stay. We could not have picked a better place to stay on island. I would definitely stay here again on my next visit to Kauai.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Torreys place is about a ten minute drive from Lihue airport which was super convenient. As well as easy highway access. A handful of food trucks and food places are also a few minutes from there. Her place was cute and clean with some added thoughtful measures for guests like coffee grinds and beach towels etc. She was extremely quick with responding back as well to any messages. I would recommend her place
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"It’s such a cute, cozy place, with a great view and everything we could need while we were there. We loved all the little details that made our stay even better (like sunscreen, after sun lotion, & a usable kitchen). Would definitely stay here again! :)"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Wow! This is the best and most well-thought out Airbnb I have ever stayed in. The location is perfect as you are right in the middle of the North shore and the south side which make both very easy to explore. You are also not too far away from Koke’e State Park. Many food options are only a 5 minute drive away. The studio itself was mind blowingly beautiful. You have amazing views of Mt. Waialeale and of the ocean. The neighborhood is very quite as well. What set this Airbnb apart from others I have stayed in is the amenities. Fully stocked kitchen, wine glasses, plates, silverware, knives, cooking ware- everything you could need. There was shampoo, sunscreen, lotion, sewing kit, lighter, and more. Everything we needed was there. The hosts are very nice and gifted us with fresh papaya and lychee berries. Everything about our stay helped make our honeymoon unforgettable. Next time we come to Kauai, we will plan our trip around the availability of this Airbnb."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing. Super clean and welcoming. Beautiful views and nearby the water but not so close that there is a lot of traffic. Best air bnb we stayed at during our trip. Highly recommend
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Torrey and Sarahs place was lovely. It's location in Kapa'a was ideal for us to get around to different parts of the island and it has a small town charm. Torrey and Sarah were wonderful as hosts, answering all of our questions and giving us detailed recommendations and advice for our stay, which was invaluable for us while staying on an island with so much to do. Their thoughtfulness before, during, and after our stay was unmatched. They even dropped a ripe papaya off for us on the doorstep from their garden (it was delicious). We felt welcome from the moment we arrived and felt like we were in a home away from home. All in all, an unforgettable trip."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This home is fantastic! Morning coffee with an ocean view was the best part of my days here. The location is perfectly central, great neighborhood, and the studio is clean, bright and super cozy. Torrey and Sarah really added personal touches that made me feel welcomed into their home from the moment I walked in. Everything you need is here, and they are super attentive and responsive if any questions come up. I honestly was sad to leave and cannot wait to come back soon. Kauai is so special to me and staying here this time around really was too!! Mahalo for the wonderful hospitality Torrey and Sarah! Xo"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The location was perfect! Within walking distance of great restaurants and the beach. Heather was very responsive to messages and their guide and suggestions were wonderful.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Super awesome place to stay. Right next to the beach and I’m pretty sure we ate at the lava lava beach club like 10 times. Super responsive and friendly hosts as well. Definitely recommend!!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location by the ocean- really enjoyed sitting on the balcony with the view. Check in and instruction are all clear and easy
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just an absolutely fabulous stay!! Location, apartment, and the hosts were everything we could have asked for to make our vacation incredible.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Khaled and Heather’s place in Kapa’a was absolutely amazing. The view and top floor were exactly what I was looking for. They had plenty of kitchen necessities to make the simple meals I wanted to make when I didn’t want to go out. They were both incredibly responsive and proactive with their instructions, which lended to having everything at my fingertips when I needed it. They also had numerous beach items that made enjoying the area that much more possible. I ended up keeping one of the folding beach chairs in the car during my stay to be able to set up a place wherever I wanted to enjoy my lunch or morning coffee with the sunrise or beautiful day. This island is known as the healing island, and this place creates a beautiful foundation for healing/new beginnings/breathing and rebooting. Highly recommend!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful spot 🌴🌈🐓 ocean views, sunrise from the lanai, and walking paths to great beaches. Great place to spend time on the island."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I really enjoyed Heather and Khaled’s place for our anniversary celebration. They were very welcoming and their place was perfect for our needs.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was great! Extremely clean and had all the extras you could think of (coffee maker, tea kettle, beach gear and towels, etc). The view off the porch was lovely for drinking coffee in the morning. It was close to lots of walkable options and a quick drive to other towns and the airport. Great stay!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved staying at Khaled & Heather’s place in Kauai. Very convenient location and was right on the beach! We loved walking to get coffee and watching the sunrise. Highly recommend this Airbnb!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location. Comfy place. Great little touches such as beach chairs, snorkels, Boogey boards, cooler, etc. The resort needs to reconfigure their parking spaces. They are way toooo small. LOL!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful place for a staycation. A lot of restaurants are close by. You actually don't have to drive. The place is super cute and homely. I would come back!! Thank you Khaled and Heather!!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We LOVED our stay here - it even exceeded our expectations! Such a beautiful property - we especially enjoyed the pool and hot tub. The condo itself was super clean, beautifully decorated, and was super well equipped with everything you could need. It was so nice having everything for the beach and hiking poles. Heather was also super lovely and checked in regularly to see if we needed anything. Highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The view was absolutely beautiful! It's had so many thoughtful touches with their guest comfort in mind. A place to hang swimsuits, sissors!! Toaster oven, coffee maker, chocolate candy, insulated cups, beach chairs, plugs next to bed to charge your cell phones. Extra sheets because I don't like to share! The air-conditioning worked great, and shower pressure was perfect. We walked to Jojos for shaved ice , got souvenirs, and this amazing prepared food in the market and didn't even need to move our car. The owners were very responsive and super friendly. You need to stay here! The grounds, the pool, and the location were perfect!!! 10 min away from the airport, 15 away from helicopter rides, and 15 min from mountain tubing. I highly recommend it!!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It's just amazing, great location, coconut market next to it, easy to eat.The host thoughtfully provided a variety of swimming, snorkeling equipment, etc. It was relaxing to stay here!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at Khaled & Heather’s place! Great location with Coconut Marketplace right next door (we loved Chicken in a Barrel and JoJo’s shave ice) and great central location on the island to drive to either the north or south shores. Having the beach umbrella and chairs was a huge convenience that we missed when we checked into a hotel later in our trip.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My husband and I booked Khaled & Heather’s condo 11 months prior to our stay and immediately Heather responded with a friendly hello. She was so sweet, making sure everything was good when we arrived and wishing us a wonderful stay. The condo was exactly how it was portrayed in the listing. It is a beautiful condo with beautiful views! We will definitely stay at Khaled & Heather’s condo again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Host was amazing! Heather provided outstanding communications and tips. Best condo view, yet felt private on patio. I would definitely enjoy staying there again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I loved Heather and Khaled's place. It's in a great location close to the center of Kapaa and also halfway between Hanalei Bay and Poipu. They made us feel right at home with how clean the apartment was, the beach accessories, and the Hawaiian Host chocolates. They also send a link to a site that includes helpful information such as checkin, checkout, wifi, parking, local spots, etc. This resource was so helpful and valuable! We'd definitely stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Khalid and Heather were great hosts. The space was exactly what we needed and you can’t beat the sunrise at that incredibly close beach. They were great at communicating and had completely reasonable expectations for a guest in their beautiful space. We would definitely stay here again.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful stay for our honeymoon! Conveniently located only about 10-15 minutes from the airport. Heather was very friendly and made sure we had everything we needed! We loved relaxing on the lanai and walking down to Lava Lava Beach Club for yummy drinks and watching the hula show at Coconut Marketplace which was only a short walk away! Would definitely recommend!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was beautiful. Right on the beach and had plenty of food and shopping places around. Heather was also very sweet and responsive. The place was resourceful. It had what we needed to prepare meals and go to the beach. 10/10.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We felt at home from the first second in Khaled & Heather's place. There is everything you need for a few relaxing days.

The location was amazing and love the ocean and pool view from the balcony! You are literally steps away from the beach! Heather and Khaled provide a link with all the details you need for checking in, checking out, and even recommendations of what to do which was so helpful! Our favorite was walking out to the beach and watching the sunrise. The room was very nice and clean and included so many supplies for you to use during your stay such as a beach bag, snorkel gear, hiking sticks, chairs, cooler, boards, and more! Loved everything about this Airbnb and all the amenities! We definitely enjoyed our stay and would stay here again in the future!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We could not have been happier with our stay at the Islander. There was not a single item we needed in our unit that was not available. It immediately felt like home and we’ll always remember our time at this very special place.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Prefect place to stay.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As soon as we stepped foot into Khalid & Heather’s place we knew instantly that we had to come back and immediately looked at the calendar to see when we could come back! Lemme tell you - if you see this is available, book it! There’s a reason there is so little availability! The view alone is stunning but the location is amazing! Restaurants, stores, grocery, coffee, and THE OCEAN are all right next door!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Five days at Heather & Khaled’s place was the perfect escape! With beautiful ocean views and a cozy bed to come back to after a busy day of exploring, it was exactly what we were looking for.

We would recommend this cozy stay to absolutely anyone coming to visit Kaua’i!!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This place was amazing! Centrally located on the island, amazing view, great complex with all the amenities you’d need — we would happily rent this again and again. Heather was excellent at communicating with us about our reservation, and the condo had everything we needed.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The communication with the host was excellent, Heather was highly professional and friendly as our host. She was on top of things we needed to know from start to finish of our stay, and even gave us a whole website of local recommendations of places to eat and things to do after we booked.
Clean condo, great view from the lanai, awesome morning sunrises, beautiful gardens surrounding the property, and a bar with live music every night right on the beach just a few minute stroll down the beach from the condo. If you are looking for a great home base to be able to hit all the big ticket items in Kauai, this is it. Everything is about a 30-45 min drive North or South (minus Waimea Canyon), which gave us tons of freedom to get lots of hiking, kayaking, exploring, and a variety of beaching in during our honeymoon."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great!! 5 stars
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I spent 3 nights at this condo and really enjoyed our stay. Although on the smaller side, it was quite comfortable and had everything we needed. Heather is a wonderful communicator a resulting in an effortless check-in and a great stay. The condo is very conveniently located next to a set of shops and restaurants, which met all of our needs. As well, the condo is very close to the major road on the east side of the island allowing us to get to other areas of Kauai fairly readily. We would not hesitate to go back to this condo."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Heather and Khaled’s place was amazing. It was well equipped with kitchenwares and even equipment for the beach. You really don’t even need to buy snorkel gear.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful condo! It was perfect and Heather was great to work with. We loved the virtual information book, it was so helpful. The condo is surrounded by great food options and a short drive to almost everywhere on the island. I would highly recommend Khaled and Heather’s place."
2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"The hosts were very prompt in their replies and maintained consistent communication. They even sent over their housekeeper who was just as friendly and accommodating as the hosts. I was missing a fitted bed sheet and the housekeeper or hosts assumed I’d sleep in the same bed as my dad, not on the pull out sofa bed, so it had not been prepared for our stay. The sofa bed at the place was outrageously uncomfortable. I got a migraine from the pain in the middle of the night. I still have intense (10/10 pain) muscle soreness in my upper middle back from that one night not yet alleviated. The only reason I stayed here was because I needed to extend my stay by one night due to changing flight plans. Previously I slept in a bed (9/13-9/20) and had no pain, and prior to that I even slept on a regular sofa (9/8-9/13) on the Big Island at a friend’s house and was super comfortable. However, this sofa bed is not acceptable. Overall, the place was visually very nicely decorated and organized, and I appreciated the garden shower head and shower toiletries."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The condo was lovely and clean, the perfect size for two people with an awesome view of the ocean. Heather and Khaled provided beach towels for our use during our stay which was very helpful. Heather was very clear and prompt in all communication and the check-in/check-out process was so easy.

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I were supposed to stay here but due to an unexpected passing away of my mother in law, my daughter and husband stayed instead.

Speaking of which, the pool and hot tub and outdoor bar are charming and have a great vacation vibe. Airbnb is located steps from the beach, great place to watch the sunrise. (note: not necessarily the best swimming beach.) but overall the location was fantastic, a short drive to many restaurants. WiFi and A/C worked great. Although we were rarely in the Airbnb itself, it did have a large mini fridge, microwave, and other kitchenette amenities had we wanted them.

I wish I would've found this place earlier in my searching so we could have stayed a few more days!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The condo was beautiful and filled with Aloha spirit. We were here for only two days of our stay and somehow got our days mixed up. We missed our check out time as we were out on a boat until late afternoon. When we returned to shore and we turned on our phone there were several messages filled with worry about our safety. We contacted the host immediately and made arrangements to remove our things from the room so they could clean.
They were sweet and understanding and mostly happy that we were safe!
I would definitely recommend staying here if you get the opportunity."

The place was immaculate, and little details such as chocolates and a coffee were included. There’s everything you can imagine for having a great time in Kauai. I thought the binoculars and hiking poles were especially thoughtful. We had a Wifi problem that Heather immediately responded to, plus comp’d us for the time it took us to fix. I will be recommending this Airbnb to all my friends and family if they come back to Kauai. (Get the burrito at the Sleeping Giant Grill!)"

When we arrived the condo was perfect and the extra care that Heather and Khaled had given their guests were shocking!

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had such an amazing time staying at Islander on the Beach. It was a central location to all we wanted to see and do. The Coconut Marketplace was a quick, delicious place to eat and shop. The condo was right on the beach, fun for snorkeling and swimming. Communication was super quick and very informative. Highly recommend- thank you for letting us stay!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Staying here was a dream being able to always hear the soothing sounds of the ocean. We loved being able to walk to get coffee or pick up snacks and groceries at the nearby marketplace. You are also only a few steps from a very quiet beach. Khalid and Heather have thought of everything and they provide so many extras to make your stay comfortable. They are great with communication and give you all the details days in advance so you’re well prepared when you arrive.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect paradise. Thank you!

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Definitely surpassed our expectations:)
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing condo! The view was delightful and easy access to the beach for sunrise. Great beach accessories provided, although quite sandy. I appreciated the welcome guide that had tons of useful info & recommendations. The door was easy to use with a coded entry vs having to keep up with a key."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best Airbnb’s I’ve been in. Amazing views and proximity to restaurants, shops, attractions. Fully stocked with everything you need for the beach. Awesome stay!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location to get to many things on the island. Very thorough directions and prompt responses from hosts. The added equipment and supplies allowed us to save money (cook at home, avoid rental fees) and maximize our adventuring (hiking poles, beach chairs, etc.). They put loving thoughtfulness into their suggestions and help ensure guests love the island as much as they appear to. We had a lovely stay!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is the perfect place to stay to explore Kauai! The Coconut Marketplace within walking distance was so convenient and had great food! The view from the lanai was great. The gear provided was much used and we were thankful to have it. Great stay!!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Heather and Khaled's condo was the perfect choice for our Kauai adventure. The grounds and surrounding area quickly felt like home base, and it is true that the location is perfectly central to the rest of the island. We loved the instant access to the beach, pool, and some of the island's best coffee at Imua, 3 mins walk from the condo. If you stay on the south shore, you'll have a harder time getting to beautiful and relaxing Hanalei on the north shore and vice versa; so, this really is the right location to explore all of Kauai.
If you still haven't decided on Kauai and you want to take my word for it, just decide now. In one stress-free week, we swam with turtles (on multiple beaches and serendipitously), saw whales, hundreds of dolphins, a mom and baby goat in the Waimea canyon. The Na Pali coast, Waimea Canyon, and beaches of Kauai will leave you speechless. We were also able to take a helicopter ride, and I could go on and on about it, but it was probably the most amazing and moving hour of my life. (and that's a 10 minute drive from this condo).
The condo itself has everything you need to feel comfortable and equip yourself for the island's many beaches. Heather and Khaled are also super accommodating, and the guide book in the condo was thorough and helpful."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I’ll recommend this condo without hesitation.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Khaled and Heather’s place was perfect for our visit to Kauai. The space had everything we needed to round out our experience since we had a kitchenette, snorkeling supplies, as well as beach equipment. I highly recommend you stay here as it is perfectly located as well as has great views from the balcony. Couldn’t have asked for a better host or place."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Was a fantastic spot for us to explore the entire island. Very centrally located. Also was great when we just wanted to relax at the hot tub in the complex or hang out and check out the local area. Would highly recommend...everything went so smoothly, and we really enjoyed our stay!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Stayed for 8 nights and it went above my expectations. Pretty much centrally located to everything on the island. Many things you can walk to also!.

The owners were kind enough and left us a special gift, a chocolate box and beach towels. The owner’s were prompt to reply to any question or concern. Also, their check in instructions and detailed information and tips for the area were very helpful."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time staying in Heather and Khaled’s place. We found it super central for driving around the island which was nice for driving to different beaches and hikes each day. The hidden gem is the coffee roaster next door!

2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful, relaxing place! The moment you enter the spacious, clean, and comfortable room and make your way to the lanai, you already regret you'll be leaving again. We enjoyed breathtaking sunrises on the beach and our morning coffee on the lanai looking at the ocean, the restaurants close by, and relaxing at the pretty and clean pool area with a happy hour drink from the bar. Once you're back from dinner (get takeaway and enjoy it on the lanai!) you will hear the ocean waves while you fall asleep. We already look forward to going back and can absolutely recommend staying here. Thanks for having us!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great condo with a view of the ocean and overlooking the pool area.. Location is excellent and near restaurants and a local market. Will recommend to family members and friends who plan on going to Kauai

Would definitely stay here again."

2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent place to stay in an overpriced vacation housing market. Very communicative hosts who provide helpful and detailed info about check-in, logistics, and local recommendations. The location is convenient to places for restaurants etc. (next to Coconut Marketplace), so we didn't end up using the kitchen, but it seemed like the basic equipment was there. Loved that they had netflix/etc., guidebooks, and amenities such as beach umbrellas, snorkel gear, beach chairs, beach bags, towels, etc. and there was a box of chocolates upon welcome. Parking was very easy, and this was a central location from which to explore. Overall, highly recommended!!"

2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The studio is located in the hotel ""Islander on the Beach,"" but you have nothing to do with the hotel except that you have to get a parking permit card.

It was clean, Deb was responsive and accommodating, and the location was perfect in terms of ocean view and getting around the island. Plenty of restaurants nearby."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Debs place was absolutely perfect. Super clean. It seems she had thought of everything we could ever need - beach chairs, cooler, chip clips - little things you don't think of until you need it. Central location on the island was great. Being able to walk to great restaurants was really nice - our favorites were Sam's Oceanfront and Pono Market. We rented bikes close by to take on the bike path right outside of the room which was super fun. More affordable than other comparable units on Kauai. Deb was kind and super responsive. Would stay here again 100%."

Massive beach towels, great lounge chairs for the beach and a great view from the patio. Deb was very proactive and very responsive to messaging. The front desk was easy at check in. The pool and hot top came in use often after our 8-12 mile daily hikes and our ocean kayak adventure. Felt very cozy, all the furniture was comfortable and made us feel at home. On-site laundry was very helpful and saved us from going to the laundry mat as we have in the past when staying elsewhere. Overall this was perfect in every and we had a great 5th visit to the island to celebrate our 32 wedding anniversary."

Barry & Gloria"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was exactly as advertised while we stayed on this beautiful island. We loved staying in Kapa’a since it was central to all the activities we were doing. The Pono Kai resort was a great low-key spot to enjoy between our adventures. Thanks Deb!

Deb was attentive and her binder with local recommendations was super helpful. The resort itself has lots of amenities, and it was convenient to rent snorkel gear there, do laundry, use the barbecue, and have a concierge to help plan activities and make reservations. Thanks, Deb!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Deb’s place is beautifully located next to a walking and biking path that is right next to the ocean. It’s peaceful and very relaxing. Lots of local food options nearby and smoothies at Lana’s cafe is a must! Deb was quick to respond and offered recommendations when asked. Will definitely stay here again!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We enjoyed the breathtaking view from the balcony and the wonderful birds. The oceanside walking path was divine.
The traffic was was heavy at times; we were glad that stores and restaurants were walkable.
Deb provided a great library of books about Hawaii and Kauai..... plus novels. The DVD player was a great addition.
I wish we had had more days to enjoy the complex's facilities."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My daughter and I had an absolutely wonderful time on our first trip to Kauai, and Deb made our trip extra special with a beautiful condo that offered a spectacular view of the ocean and great amenities that made us feel better than at home! It was very easy to find with detailed instructions Deb provided, and the Kapa'a location was perfect. We couldn't have asked for a better stay, and want to go back as soon as possible! Deb is an excellent host, and we are so thankful that she provided us with a beautiful place to stay in the most beautiful place in the world."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"We enjoyed the ocean view most of all! The condo was very clean and tastefully furnished. There is a wonderful walking path along the ocean - small, not crowded beaches everywhere. Our only issue was the noise level from the upstairs condo - kids running up and down the hallway, pounding, stomping, crying. The walls may be a little “thin”.
Overall, however, it was a very nice place and Deb was VERY helpful."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This is the perfect location for staying in Kauai. Fabulous ocean views, swimmable beach, right on the bike and walking trail, near the little town area of Kapaa (which we love!). We would definitely stay here again. The pool was very nice and this place has a bunch of extra amenities like tennis courts, ping pong tables, an 18-hole putting course, croquet, and more. We used the oat washers and dryers and they worked great. Clean, gentle on clothes, always available when we needed them. The complex is a bit older which I think makes it easier to get a reasonably priced fantastic spot right on the ocean. Deb was super responsive when we needed help with the tv controls. Overall great."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"They very first thing we noticed when we walked is WOW, the view! The slider has an open view directly into the Ocean and it is amazing!
The condo is very clean and Deb has an excellent selection of products available such as mosquito repellent, after sun aloe, and other bathroom amenities. There are plenty of bath towels and beach towels. The kitchen has all the necessities and you get a starter pack of coffee for that first morning. There is a good assortment of dishes and pots and pans if you choose to do some of your own cooking.
The condo was perfect for our stay. The resort and grounds were lovely. We had a rough trip off of the island with a delayed and then canceled flight. Deb was great to work with and helped out immensely when all of these last minute changes were happening with our flights. Without her help we would have been stranded at the airport for more than 12 hours!
We would highly recommend for your stay."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Deb is a great host. She leaves clear instructions and is responsive and reasonable. She left a fan for us in the room that made sleeping comfortable. The condo is older but cared for. The grounds are lovely and clean. The best part of this condo is the unobstructed ocean view. Very relaxing. It is located in busy Kapa'a, so shops and restaurants are walkable--and there is also the accompanying traffic. It was helpful to have some staples like oil and a few spices in the cupboard. The beach chairs and cooler are nice to have."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing stay! Already booked to return. Deb was great and we can’t wait to come back!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Deb was a fantastic host from the moment we booked. She provided helpful information about the island and was very responsive. Her place was sparkling clean, and even better than the photos. We loved the ocean view and proximity to walking path and town. Her stay was a great value."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful View!
Loads of extra's provided within the Condo and for Your Use!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely everything was exactly as promised, and there was even more than expected! Gorgeous view of the ocean, everything was very clean and comfortable, and it was roomier than expected too. There were so many added nice touches!! Two sturdy backpack-style low beach chairs, four huge thick beach towels, plenty of towels, etc. plus older clean-up towels for the Kaua’i red dirt, absolutely everything you’d need in the kitchen for cooking, an insulated bag we used as a beach cooler with the frozen water bottles already in the freezer, toaster, coffeemaker plus electric hot water kettle for our hot tea, plenty of paper products, (even zip-lock baggies for a picnic lunch), all the bathroom necessities plus some sunscreen and aloe for sunburns. The welcome notebook on the desk provided all the necessary info plus tips and suggestions relative to the island and the area. The resort itself was beautiful, and there were so many amenities- we could have done so much more there! Wow!"
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"We enjoyed staying at Deb’s condo. The location facing the ocean & being on a busy walking, biking path we really enjoyed. The resort is older but the grounds & building are still well cared for. Kapaa has gotten a lot busier than what we remember but the resort itself is quiet & relaxing. Over all we enjoyed ourselves."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Deb's condo did not disappoint! Stunning views, enjoyed sitting out in the morning and watching the sunrise and it’s within walking distance to Kapaa Main Street shops and the bike path too. Everything we needed and much more was there for us, including snorkel gear, beachchairs, and some toiletries and laundry stuff. Her binder of information was very helpful. She replied quickly when I asked questions. It’s a perfect location to explore the island whether you want to go north or south. Would love to stay here again, when we come back to Kauai!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Debs place fit us very well. The view out the expansive sliding doors of the ocean was stunning. Especially the sunset on our first night.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay at so much! The main road is a little busy but the resort is quiet and so peaceful to watch the ocean from Deb’s condo! The location in Kapa’a is convenient for accessing all areas of the island.
Deb made the stay so easy and was great with responding, as needed! Highly recommended and we will look to stay again in the future!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful and peaceful stay at Deb's place. The viewwas stunning. We are looking forward to staying here againin the future.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved just opening the door and walking out to the beach
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Everything we wanted. Comfortably furnished and well-equipped. Questions/concerns got immediate responses. Great location with walking/biking trail along the ocean right out in front.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Deb is truly a superhost. We loved the condo. The condo was perfect: clean, comfortable, and we had everything that we needed, as Deb provides wonderful ""extras"". Additionally, the view was excellent!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The condo was very nice and clean. Had chairs and a few staples in the kitchen. All you need to cook and serve a meal, except for the food of course! Bath necessities as well. Books to borrow if you wanted. We were taking the red eye and had kayaking planned for our last day, Deb was very accommodating! Thank you for being such a great host, Deb!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place is very comfortable. It is located right by the beach so we can see the wave from the balcony. It is also located near a lot of stores and restaurant where we can walk to get coffee and food. the furniture are comfortable as well. Deb provided detail instruction on how to check in and make sure we are aware before arriving so we don't run into problem.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Love staying in Kapaa as it is centrally located and has the small laid back casual beach town vibe. Staying at this place allowed us to walk to many restaurants and shops and was a short drive to many more. The ocean view and sounds provided the peace and serenity we look for in Kauai. The easily accessible boardwalk along the ocean is a definite plus also.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Deb is a phenomenal host and her condo has virtually everything you need for a great stay. The AC units in both the living area and bedroom is a big plus. Although it cooled down it was nice to have. Her condo is cute, comfy and has great amenities.- lots of towels, dishes, pans, stuff for cooking like spices, oils, etc, beach chairs and more! You can't go wrong with Deb's place! We'll be back for sure! :)"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Elderly couple from Germany: After the island hopping we were looking for accommodation for a quiet holiday for 7 nights. After everything we saw from the other islands and accommodations (hotels, AirBnBs), the choice to stay with Deb was perfect, as the surrounding area and island are also very nice.
As an urban area, you have Kapaa with the restaurants and shopping facilities. The resort is well maintained, and you have a Hospitallity Room if you want to freshen up before an evening flight to lax or SEA. This will give you a day.
In our opinion, the most important thing about the apartment is the sea view. Instead of rushing the air conditioning (October) we had the sound of the ocean and (priceless) every morning the sunrise. The important thing because you don't really need to talk about the apartment. Perfect for 2 people. Nothing is lacking. Everything is very tidy, flowers on the table, even snorkeling equipment in the closet. In the evening then Netflix, etc. In the apartment there is a small library where the guidebook about Kauai is the best thing to find in the genus.
Communication with Deb was already at an almost personal level before the visit.
The apartments in the resort but also for all other accommodations, just American, are very noisy, but this is only a disadvantage if you have ruthless neighbors – we did not have.
We think we'll be looking for a long time in the future to find something like this."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"5 stars BUT.. if you’re a really light sleeper not sure this place is for you. The walls are paper thin. I kid you not I legit heard someone snoring. So that made it hard to go to sleep for me during that night. But besides that the view is gorgeous! Everything was so clean and well organized and such. She is an amazing host!!
A few things I highly recommend:
Moloa’a beach! What a beautiful and fun beach. It was so different on how to get to it. Loved it.
Zip lining. Although we didn’t get to do the whole thing due to weather, it was so fun!!
Breakfast go to kountry kitchen: avocado Benedict w/iced tea w/some of their mango juice. YUM.. and anuenue cafe! Lilikoi tea [now my fav new fruit] and the French toast!
Dinner go to the plantation house by the Gaylord’s for a classy nice dinner. And if you really want to get fancy go to the beach house!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Deb's condo was amazing! Very clean, tidy and had everything we needed. The view from the balcony offered amazing sun rises and the location was a perfect hub to explore the island. The resort was kept clean and the pool area was better than expected.
We were fortunate enough to meet Deb and she is absolutely lovely. She was incredibly helpful with rebooking our trip about 3 or 4 times during the Covid turbulance and made a very stressful time that bit easier.
Amazing condo, amazing host and an amazing honeymoon. Thanks Deb!!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I can’t say enough positive things about Deb’s. The condo is in a fabulous resort with pool, tennis, lawn chess and so many more amenities. The condo is clean, air conditioned ( so important on hot humid days!) The kitchen has everything you need for coffee and cooking. Thank you Deb for a wonderful vacation!!!!!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Deb’s place exceeded our expectations! Beautiful ocean view. Lots of activities and bbq for communal use. Definitely would stay there again.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Loved the view from this room. It was better than expected. it was cean and close to stores and places to eat. Also has beach chairs and towels. Thank you Deb, you thought of everything. ❤"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great condo, was very clean and had a great view of the ocean. There are plenty of small businesses and restaurants within walking distance and the location of condo makes it easy to get to either north or south side of the island. The host was very easy to contact and would always get back super quick! I can't recommend this place more, it was a fabulous stay. My only complaint is that we couldn't stay longer :)"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Our stay here completely exceeded our expectations. It is just too good! Location is awesome with stunning view of the ocean which is actually just steps away (really). Deb is a Super hostess! Most highly recommended.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Deb’s condo. The location is great and we found so much to do within walking distance that you can easily spend many days without the need of a car. The views to the beach were great and the property was well maintained. Our only issue was on the first night one of the neighbors seemed to be watching movies and partying a bit loudly and the noise really carries through the walls. Aside from that, we had a great time and really appreciated Deb’s communication - she is the greatest and does so much to make sure your stay at the condo is as good as it can be!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect place to stay - clean, spacious, with a beautiful view! Deb is a great host, she is so helpful and responds very quickly. The apartment has everything you need, we would definitely rexommend it!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Couldn’t have been better. Apartment was beautiful and equipped with everything I needed (and lots of lovely touches / local design). Deb's was very helpful and the location was great.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The location was great! Loved that Deb was easy to contact and ask questions and she responded very quickly. We were able to make breakfast and even dinner a few nights. We had a rental car and went to every side of the island without any problems. The view from the condo was beautiful! Great way to wake up and have coffee!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great place with Ocean view and easy beach access.
Debs place was a perfect location, quiet, comfortable, ocean view, 1-2 minute walk to the beach. Condo was clean and very well stocked. Comfortable breeze with patio and windows open, air is also there but we didn’t need often. Grocery store down the road, shave ice with in walking distance as well as shopping and other places to eat. Would recommend and definitely will stay again. Mahalo!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were happy all around with our stay at Deb:
- The apartment was clean and homey, we felt comfortable. The sea view is insane.
- You can see the sunrise from the balcony
- The sea is reachable in 2min walk
- The surroundings are fantastically landscaped (flowers, trees, palm trees, pond, etc).
- The kitchen equipment is good, there are a few spices and sauces that are regularly replaced.
- The location of the apartment is optimal, on the one hand for excursions to the north and south of the island and on the other hand the airport is very close (still no aircraft noise)
- There is a very helpful ""guestbook"" with house rules and tips for excursions and shopping possibilities
- Deb gave us valuable tips, where we can snorkel well and where we can possibly find turtles. And we were lucky, we saw many colorful fish and even saw turtles grazing!
- The check-in and check-out at the hotel reception worked flawlessly
- Access to the apartment was easy and safe
- Deb was always very quick to respond (via Airbnb app) which we really appreciated
- There is good shopping in the area (e.g. Big Save Market).
- You can do laundry and tumblers
The only thing we didn't like was that the bath towels and swim trunks barely dried. However, this is weather dependent and Deb can't improve on that.
We were very happy and can definitely recommend the accommodation!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location.
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Check-in was easy. Lots of parking. The resort has plenty of amenities (outdoor games/pool/etc) if you're hanging around at the resort during the day; however, most shut down at 7pm. Convenient location within walking distance of the main street in Kapaa. Beach at resort is not lifeguarded and conditions were unfavorable for swimming/snorkeling (June). The condo had a strong musty smell and felt fairly dated. Carpet and some fixtures could use an update. Deb was very kind and her binder could be super helpful for anyone looking for suggestions during their stay."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great location, comfortable condo, right on the beach."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The condo is perfectly located in the east central part of the island and provides equal driving time to the north and south coasts, and on the edge of Kapa’a allowing us to walk to shops and restaurants.
The condo was extremely clean and very comfortable. Deb is very pleasant and easy to communicate with. I highly recommend this one."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great location! Had everything we needed.
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,This apartment was comfortable and in a great location. Good shopping within walking distance and some good restaurants close by. We were very close to the beach and the view from the balcony was very enjoyable. Deb was always very responsive and very sweet. We had some bad flight issues and she left both a bottle of wine and coffee for our arrival.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Love this condo! The whole booking experience was so easy and Deb is a wonderful host being so accommodating and communicative. Perfect location right by Old Town Kapaa and the view simply made it for us! Impeccable grounds and staff. Can’t wait to come back!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Everything you’ll need (groceries & restaurants etc) are all centrally located in Kapaa. Walk if you can, as traffic can be bad at times. Big save was the place to shop for groceries and there are farmer markets all over the island. The Lemon Grass restaurant was our favorite along with the Oasis."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"very friendly, great driver with knowledge of different routes during heavy traffic; also great communication and reliability!...........thanks, Deb"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Imagine staying in the middle of the most beautiful spot on the island….a place where from your lanai you can watch the sun rise with all its glory! A place with beautiful artwork and little island touches everywhere sprinkled around the condo. There IS such a place, and it’s this very lovely spot, owned by Deb! She was a joy to work with from the moment we booked with her last July. She immediately made us feel so welcomed as tenants in her home throughout our conversations on Airbnb. Her condo was very well furnished and has (seriously) the most spectacular views. She was easy to communicate with, had swift replies, and was extremely helpful. If we get the chance to come back to Kauai, I’ll definitely try to grab this same condo / both for the the place and the owner!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Perfect place to stay while seeing all Kauai has to offer. The condo is spacious, comfortable and has amazing sunrise view. Your won’t be disappointed!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Clean. Efficient air conditioning. Very short walk into Kapaa town. Beautiful sunrises. We recommend.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Deb’s condo was perfect in all ways. Great ocean view and loved the walking path just outside. Great host with all amenities, super suggestions, local knowledge, and responsive for all questions. Would love to stay there again"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Excellent host. The unit is not super fancy but the location is great. The resort only has one small pool and hot tub. Not really enough for so many units.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome location; even better than expected. Ocean breezes and a view that is hard to beat. So many great food choices within walking distance. Deb was quick to respond and super friendly. Would love to stay here again.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This condo has the location! Right on the beach! Well stocked and supplied. It is within very short walking distance of shopping, restaurants and grocery."
2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,Great location. Lots of BBQs. If the one in front of your condo is busy simply find another close by. The kitchen was great. Everything we needed was provided. The view was suburb. Loved it. 👍🏻😀
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved Deb's place! Perfect location!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Deb’s place was perfect for us. Beautiful ocean view. Only a few steps to the beach. The town of Kapaa is conveniently located for traveling up and down the island for excursions. We like to prepare our own meals, so having a spacious, full kitchen and dining table were us what we needed. We enjoyed coffee and watching the sunrise each morning. Deb was a wonderful, responsive host. She even gave us newly picked avocados and was kind enough to ship us our binoculars after we forgot them after our stay. I highly recommend her place."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Unit has great view of ocean to East including fantastic sunrises. Beach is about 75 yards straight out. Plenty of amenities around condos to keep one busy if you are not at beach most of time. Numerous restaurants and shops within walking distance. Walking/bike path along beach about 1/2 mile in either direction.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Debs place is great!! Perfect location. Easily accessible to everywhere on the island. The view, walking trail, restaurants and shopping are all close and convenient. A great municipal golf course right down the road.
The condo was well furnished, the bed and recliners are the best!! So comfortable to relax after a day of adventure. Loved that there were hammocks throughout the property to lay around, read a book and sway in the ocean breeze.
This is our go to place from now on!!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place to enjoy all of Kauaii!!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"this place was perfect. Located on the second floor,, it provides a beautiful view the ocean. We spent every morning drinking coffee on the balcony. The kitchen was fully stocked with coffee and some condiments in the fridge. The condo itself was fully stocked with beach towels, shampoo, soap, beach chairs, books, a helpful guide, etc. The condo was so clean and comfortable. It is also very centrally located to tons of shops and restaurants. We really had a beautiful time."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Deb’s place is amazing. I saw the sunrise every day. The location was perfect for us. A lot of good restaurants and stores at a walking distance. Deb checked on us and made sure everything was fine. Will definitely stay here again when coming to Kauai.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Husband and I had a wonderful babymoon at Pono Kai, Deb is a great host!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,0utstanding airbnb
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location. The on site were amenities were nice, and the proximity to beaches and restaurants were amazing"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Deb’s place is in a great location in relation to the shops of Kapa’a. The view from the lanai is beautiful and a great place for breakfast. As others have mentioned the recliners in the living room we’re so cozy and the bed as well. We’ve stayed in other Airbnb’s where the bed was not comfy at all so we appreciated it. Deb was also a total sweetheart and brought us some additional towels during our stay. Check in was flawless. Overall a great airbnb!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location. While this unit sits in the second row of buildings back from the ocean - no worry. It has a great view of the water with fantastic sunrises. Complex is not far north of the airport - about 15 min north. Located at the south end of the bike/walking trail - although bike rentals are scarce for some reason.
Deb is a great hostess. Very helpful with communication, etc. Check-in process is a breeze and while this is technically a condo it is operated kinda like a hotel complete with front desk and concierge. Enjoy your stay!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The view, location and accomodations were exceptional! Deb was a fantastic host. We had everything we could possibly need or want and the Pono Kai Resort was fantastic for us and our family that came to visit."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was the most comfortable Airbnb experience my wife and I have had so far. Not only was the bed comfortable but the recliners in the living room were beyond comfortable. I may have fallen asleep on them once or twice. The location was absolutely perfect as well, my parents have a timeshare at the same resort so it was really nice to be near them. Now we did have a problem with the AC units but Deb was more than accommodating, and honestly as long as we kept the sliding glass door and windows open, the ocean breeze was more than enough to keep the place cool. When we return to Kauai, we hope to stay here again."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was perfect! It was super clean and the furniture was so comfortable. Also the sheets and towels were hotel quality! The condo is in the perfect location to walk to restaurants and shops and there is a bus stop right out front which is super convenient! We spent hours on the patio relaxing and basking in the sun. Hopefully in the future we can make it to Kapaa again and we will definitely be looking for Deb’s place. She was easy to communicate with and made sure we had everything we needed. I can’t say enough good things I’m just sad we eventually had to leave!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This condo is the PERFECT spot on Kauai. It is steps from a public beach that is rarely busy, located within a very well kept complex with many amenities and a great location on the East shore in Kappa. Great restaurants and shops are within walking distance and the resort is within easy driving distance to everywhere we needed to go on the island. Deb is a fantastic host providing great detailed instructions and suggestions. The condo was in great shape and as described. Can’t wait to go back and stay at this same place. Did I mention, the sunrise can either be seen on the lanai or a few steps down to the beach. It’s breathless and wonderful to be so close."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Elaine and I have been going to Kauai for 40 plus years and Deb’s condo is now at the top of our list of places to stay. The unit has an incredible ocean view. Deb had obviously put a lot of thought and effort into selection of the artwork that graced the walls and in the selection of furniture. I don’t think we have ever stayed in a place in which the owner not only promptly responded but did so with a finely developed sense of humor. So, bottom line: If you are going to Kauai you cannot go wrong by staying at her Pono Kai condo."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is beautiful and Deb is amazing. When she can she will work with you and when she can’t she is very upfront and honest. She communicates wonderfully. I recommend this place and her highly.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Amazing view from this comfortable condo. A short walk into town. Excellent host and all the amenities you could want.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Deb was a great host. She went out of her way to help us. Gave us great recommendation on what to do, what to see and what restaurants to eat at. Views of the ocean from her balcony were amazing, especially the sunrise. We will be back. 6/2/21"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay!!! Pono Kai’s location is excellent; walking distance to the town (make sure to brunch at Java Kai) and is right next to the beach. Ample parking, safe area. The apartment is very clean, well equipped (incl beach gear!!) and oh my the view is so amazing. Check in was a piece of cake, Deb is an experienced host. Can’t wait to be back!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Deb provided great information on the area and an excellent price for a beachside condo. Will stay here again!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a great Condo in a great location. The Olympic is 2 blocks away, various shops and the best part, the ocean, beach and walking path is just steps away. And even better, it's centrally located on the island. Wanna go north? OK! Wanna head south? No problems."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Highly recommend staying at Deb’s place! Located near the heart of old historic Kapaa with proximity to shops, restaurants (we frequented Sam’s Oceanview, Olympic Café and Java Kai). The unit is well equipped for all your needs and provided us with awesome morning sunrises while enjoying breakfast and coffee on the lanai. Steps from oceans sandy beach where we relaxed in owner provided beach chairs, spent time in the water and saw a few monk seals. We ended our last night in Kauai with a sunset cruise to the Napili coast where we got to see spinner dolphins and the gorgeous coastline. Communication with Deb was awesome, and she provided a few extra amenities. Great host and great place to stay!"
2021-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Deb's place is the absolute best location if you're looking to explore the east side. There are tons of restaurants, bars & local beaches. Must stay if you're wanting the local experience!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect weather, great view, all included facilities , what else would one need for a great vacation, forget your worries and take this place for relaxation and enjoy your time"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,An amazing apartment with a direct view to the ocean.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a wonderful stay! There was everything that one could need - also beach chairs, umbrella etc. The location was great with shops, cafes and grocery stores nearby. Deb was very kind and always available when we had any questions. Would totally recommend staying at Deb‘s condo! :)"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Deb is a great communicator. She helped us navigate the quarantine process, and always responded quickly to any questions we had. Great location right on the bike/walking path, and two blocks from the center of downtown Kapaa. A very comfortable place for a long term stay."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Deb's space is really lovely and comfortable. Deb herself was very kind and generous, and we really appreciated the treats from her garden."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Deb's place is in the middle of the island so it is easy to either head north or south. It is located right in the thick of Kapaa town so you can easily walk to shops and restaurants. We really liked Java Kai for a quick bite in the morning and Taps and Hops had a great happy hour. We didn't see any whales from the balcony like the review previously mentioned which we were bummed about but that didn't stop us from enjoying beautiful sunrises on the lanai every morning. The entire resort was pretty empty due to minimal travel with Covid restrictions. Check in and communication with deb was super easy and we can't recommend her place enough. It's more spacious than it looks in the photos and has anything you could possibly need for your stay.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Deb’s place was awesome! The location is perfect for walking to lots of shops and restaurants and along the path along the ocean. There are lots of activities in the complex itself, (including a great pool and hot tub!) and the unit was clean and comfortable. Deb was also super friendly and responsive when I am a couple of questions.
The best part was that I am saw humpback whales scouting and breaching just offshore while drinking my morning coffee on the balcony. Magical! I would definitely recommend stay at Deb’s condo!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is at the perfect location! Just a walk to some of our favorite coffee shops, shops, right on the ocean!
We loved the fresh orchids in the condo and even the soap and shampoo were so good, we ended up buying some for ourselves. She took care of the small details and that makes the stay that much more special.
Deb is such a wonderful host too! She guided us and kept us informed through the covid requirements and was available throughout our journey! She truly made sure we had a good time in Kauai, beyond just our stay.
To me, a place is defined by the food, the people and the experiences. And staying here will make sure all three will be on point!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place to stay while visiting Kauai. Great central location for driving to all the sites in the island. Within walking distance to town- we loved getting up early to grab coffee and watch the sunrise on the beach. The condo has everything you could need. Thank you Deb!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Deb is very friendly and easy to communicate person. Smooth check-in, quick response to any question, lot of local tips. Also we got a pleasant surprise - fresh avocado and organic eggs! Her apartment is just perfect. You will have everything you need, including full-loaded kitchen, beach&snorkeling gear. Very quiet, comfortable place. Convinient location near the airport allows to reach any part of the island within an hour. And we didn't use AC at all due to fresh breeze from the ocean."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was great and so was Deb. Amazing sunrise views over the ocean from the kitchen. Ice cold AC. Centrally located and within walking distance to Kapaa.
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you so much! We loved relaxing in the recliners and looking out at the beautiful view! Beach access was lovely and it was such a convenient location to anywhere we wanted to explore! We’ll be back!
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time! The condo is centrally located in town and most everything is walkable. The kauai walking/bike path that runs parallel with the ocean in front of the condo goes for miles. It is a great way to walk the coastline.
Deb was super accommodating and was always reachable.
The beach is spectacular, and the view from the balcony is beautiful.
We traveled to the north and south shores of the island and can’t wait to return!"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent place near beach and activity trail.
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay at Deb’s condo. The photos don’t do her place justice. The lanai was like an extra outdoor room with an incredible ocean view and we never need to turn on the a/c, instead keeping the sliding door open with a couple of bedroom windows to get a lovely breeze coming through. The kitchen is well stocked with essentials and the beach gear came in handy. Pono Kai resort is centrally located in Kapaa, within walking distance to several stores and restaurants. The traffic can get so bad in the afternoons that it’s often faster to walk! One pro tip: we should have paid more attention to her guest guide, because we got ourselves lost on the way to the Wed Kapaa farmer’s market. Don’t rely on google maps! ;) Our favorite walk was to head North on the beach path out of town and look for migrating whales. It’s such a magical spot in the world. We’d love to have an opportunity to return."
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great view and good people watching. Lots of extra touches that make a beach stay great!
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, just a very short walk to a great beach and awesome location to explore the whole island. Deb had all the essentials for the beach. Very clean and comfortable condo!"
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great space! Great view! Great location!
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Deb was fantastic! The place with the ocean view was wonderful. Deb was quick to respond to any questions and was very helpful in tips to better enjoy the island.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect condo for a relaxed and oceanfront experience. It had everything necessary to make your stay cozy and comfortable. Really loved the location as it was accessible to all the places around the Island. Would definitely recommend this place 👍🏼
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is one of the nicest places to stay in Kapaa, with beautiful views of the ocean from the Lanai. Deb is a great host and the location is centrally located for checking out all the other places one will want to visit while on the island of Kauai. The pictures speak for themselves."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cozy beachside condo is the perfect place to stay when you find yourself in Kauai! There’s really nothing like waking up to watch the beautiful Hawaiian sunrise on the lanai. The location is perfect: the airport is about a 20 minute drive away, there are many stores and restaurants in the area to explore, and you’re a mere stones throw away from the beach. Deb is an absolutely amazing host. Her condo is equipped with cooking necessities (pots, pans, even containers for any leftovers, etc), beach equipment (chairs, towels, snorkeling equipment, etc), ac!!!, TVs, WiFi, books, guidebooks...I really could go on, but you really should just visit and find out for yourself! Deb always responded very quickly to all my messages and even let us stay a little later than checkout time. I highly recommend staying here because honestly, I would love to stay there again!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Deb’s place is in a great location in Kapa’a. It’s nicely appointed with AC both the living room and bedroom. There’s a beautiful beach nearby and also a cute town that’s within walking distance. Mahalo Deb for your hospitality!
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We have just returned from 2 incredibly relaxing weeks at Deb's wonderful condo. This place has it all - a wonderful view of the ocean, plenty of comfortable space, nicely decorated and a short walk to restaurants, shops and bike rental.
There are beach chairs, big beach towels and snorkel equipment, so you're ready to go...Deb even brought us fresh eggs from her chickens and avocados from her tree. Thanks again Deb - we can't wait to come back!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was so happy with this place. My boyfriend and I wanted a place that had an ocean view, kitchen, and good location. Deb’s place was wonderful. We had all the beach necessities and didn’t have to purchase or rent equipment for our trip. She had beach chairs, towels, snorkel gear, a little cooler, etc. we walked to java kai for coffee and Pono market for poke almost every day. We had a wonderful stay and could swim at the beach out front easily if we didn’t feel like going anywhere. Sad to leave!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"So much attention to detail! Virtually everything you’ll need for a full Kauai experience. Extremely comfortable and stylish accommodations with an outstanding view (exquisite sunrises!), and near shopping and great dining, most within walking distance. All other Kauai adventures are easy to navigate from this home base, such as boat rides along the Nā Pali coast, or a helicopter ride over the entire island. Deb provides a comprehensive list of activities and contact numbers if that’s your interest. If all you want is relaxation and gorgeous scenery, look no further. Whatever your whim for the day, this is an outstanding location for you. I do hope we may find ourselves back one day."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent place with everything you need. Deb is great!!
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The condo is clean and well-equipped and furnished. We found the bed to be very comfortable - not too soft or firm. The Pono Kai grounds are very well kept and quite nice. The location is fantastic. It's walking distance to many shops and restaurants. The owner's communication is timely and very responsive. She lives on island so she can handle any issue that may arise. We highly recommend staying there. The price to value is excellent.
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The ocean front condo is a wonderful place to stay. We watched the sun rise and Listened to the ocean waves on the patio. The room is very clean with beautiful decorations. Very Hawaiian living! Our host Deb is very considerate and attentive. This place has everything we needed,we’ll definitely recommend to our friends!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Deb and the spot were awesome! Easy access to the beach, restaurants, and shaved ice!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a wonderful place to stay. The location, the communication, the helpfulness: everything was above what we expected."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a great time at Deb's place. One thing I didn't see much in other reviews is the location. It's in Kapa'a, within walking distance of the main street, so it's easy to go out and get a quick bite -- and, of course, it's right by the ocean. You can drive to anywhere on the island within an hour and a half, and there are great spots within a 15 minute drive for lazier days (Kauai does have some public transit but I would definitely recommend a car)."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Easy check-in and great location
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The room was much better than the photos showed - great open space with an oceanfront view, bathroom was a lot nicer than a lot of the other places I have stayed at in Hawaii, and plenty of kitchen amenities. The resort itself is great, you’re right on the beach and there’s a pool and jacuzzi for winding down after a long day. Location was central, easy to get to and from the sites we wanted to see. There are also a few waterfalls / lookouts that are close by. Also within walking distance of grocery stores and restaurants. Deb was an amazing host, always responded quickly and did not pester us at all. 100% recommend if you are staying in Kauai!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Deb is a superhostage!!! We are very happy because experience was better that we would imagine.
Very nice place with all facilities and more that we expected!!!!
It has a perfect location and a beautiful place to enjoy perfect vacation
We love it
Mahalo!!!!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This condo is located in a picturesque spot with morning sunrises on the beach and access to the beach right out your door!! The facility is well equipped and Deb was EXTREMELY communicative with us on check-in, willingness to assist in any areas, and phenomenally responsive to any problems we encountered. She even went the extra mile and brought us some eggs from her chickens along with some fresh flowers due to a small inconvenience we encountered! When we were getting ready to leave on the last day, she was kind enough to allow us to leave our luggage at the condo as she had no new guests that day! Could not have imagined a more gracious, attentive and kind hostess!!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Both Deb & her condo deserve 5 stars!
Her oceanfront condo is very clean, comfortable, & well-appointed. It is situated oceanfront, about midway along the 9-mile path, and is an excellent place for enjoying a relaxing, romantic getaway.
The Pono Kai resort itself is older, but the grounds are well-maintained & beautiful! Resort staff are friendly & polite, & Check-in/Check-out were quick & easy. There are many outdoor activities to enjoy without even leaving the resort, and the ample parking is free.
Once inside Deb's condo you can relax & unwind in a comfortable home away from home! The oceanfront view is spectacular & the soothing sound of the surf is all yours!
Her kitchen is well-stocked with all needed for whipping up your favorite dishes! The bed is so comfy, we slept well from the very first night! In the morning the amazing sunrises are right there to greet you as you sip your coffee!
The condo has A/C in the living room & bedroom, but we hardly used it because ocean breezes & fans kept us comfortable.
During the day we took full advantage of using Deb's great beach towels & chairs, as well as the cooler, sunscreen, snorkels, & other water gear. When we returned from our excursions to Princeville, Poipu, and Waimea Canyon & other great places we found the recliners to be even more comfortable than we had imagined!
From the condo it is just a short walk to shopping in old town Kapa'a, & several local eateries. We rented bikes nearby and loved taking morning rides along the 9 mile path.
The condo itself is a real gem but I also can't say enough good about Deb! She is a perfect host: extremely cordial & helpful with every piece of information & all the tips you need for a wonderful, memorable stay! She is easy to work with, & goes above & beyond to accommodate & make herself available for questions prior to & throughout the stay. All of the communication back & forth, was all initiated by us, and our privacy was completely respected & honored.
When our 9 nights were up & we could not bear to leave Deb graciously allowed us to extend our stay an additional 2 nights! She and her husband Dan even volunteered to accommodate our need to store all of our luggage & freshen up for a late flight out, hours after we had checked out!
I can confidently recommend!"
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had such a fantastic time at Deb's condo. It was perfectly located right in old Kapaʻa and had everything we needed, from sun block to beach chairs and even a cooler!"
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Deb’s place is amazing. Close to everything. She provides everything you could possibly want. The unit is spacious and tastefully decorated. The ocean breeze kept us comfortable. We didn’t need to use the AC! We will definitely stay with Deb again.
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I loved our stay here! The location is amazing!! The condo is on the second floor and has a lanai that gives you a front row view of the ocean. We happened to catch the sunrise on our last morning and it was the perfect way to end our trip. It is also walking distance from old town Kapaa so there are plenty of shops and places to eat nearby.
The condo comes stocked with basic cooking supplies (spices, olive oil) and plenty of pans and utensils in case you want to cook. Foodland is also a short drive away. Deb had beach supplies available for us to borrow as well as a notebook full of tips on things to do and how to drive around the island! This was the perfect place to stay and relax for our three days on Kauai."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Where to begin - location is perfect! We woke up to watch sunrises right from the balcony every morning, the walking path is right out the back of the condo, so many amenities withing walking distance! Full AC although we only used it in the bedroom, the breeze was plenty for the rest of the space. Kitchen is fully furnished for whatever cooking you have planned. The pool looked great but we opted for the ocean. Deb is super communicative and had useful suggestions for us - she's available when you need her but doesn't hover. Absolutely amazing stay and we'll be returning!"
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,On the beach. Had great dinners walking distance. Hemmingway Cafe is a jewel. They make the best Bloody Mary. Oceanview - Great food great location. Street Burger. Great food
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Deb was very thoughtful as soon as we booked and throughout our stay. Everything was totally as described in the listing, the electros are practically new and very clean."
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Deb's place is centrally located on the east coast of Kauai and enables rapid access to both the north and south shores. Old town Kapaa was right next door and an easy stroll for dining/gift buying. You'll wake up to a direct view of the sunrise (if you're an early riser) with the ocean in the foreground. Maintained grass and palm trees also in the foreground make for fantastic sunrise pics! The condo grounds were very well maintained with lots of activities to enjoy onsite (shuffleboard, pool, bocce ball, cricket, etc.). Deb pays attention to every detail to make the condo warm and cozy. Thanks, Deb!"
2019-04-01,2.0,Stayed about a week,"Noisy!
This condo is in a perfect location. Close to the beach and a beautiful view. The walking path in front is a wonderful way to see the ocean and walk to nearby shops. The condo has been partially updated but still needs a few things changed out. (especially the bathtub)
The walls and ceiling are paper thin so be prepared to hear a lot of noise from next door and especially the upstairs unit. We had families with children and we could hear them crying and running around. We could also hear the guy upstairs snoring.
If noise doesn't bother you then this is the condo for you. You will love sitting on the lanai watching the sun come up."
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When seeking out a place to stay you are always hoping that what they say it is, is exactly what it is. There are times it is not all that they make it out to be. This place was everything they said it would be and a bit more. The best centrally located place on the island when wanting to explore the whole island. Everything was easy access and at our fingertips when wanting to shop, eat or go do activities. The only surprise we had (no idea that they are all over the island) was the chickens. At times they wanted to be up earlier than we wanted to be. We got through it because everything else outweighed the chickens. Kauai is still our favorite island. Our host was warm and welcoming, informative and was quick to respond. I would come back again. Great memories were built here."
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is a great place, if you’re looking for a place with a terrific view, access to the beach and beachside trail, and a short walk to old town (Kapaa) you will be happy here!"
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great location with views of the ocean. Walking/bike path along the beach nearby. Lots of restaurants and shopping within walking distance. Place was super clean and Deb was great with fast communication and recommend local events/activities to check out.
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pono Kai unit G204 was just as advertised with the added bonus of some of Deb's beautiful orchids! The unit is well stocked with everything you need from beach chairs to a knife sharpener. The view from the Lanai is just as pictured, just with more chickens. (Please do NOT feed them, I would throw ice cubes at them to make them shut up!) The condo was clean and comfortable with the A/C unit located in the bedroom to help keep us cool while sleeping. There's a BBQ located just in front of the Lanai and Deb's kitchen is well stocked with some basic spices even! If you don't feel like cooking, there are some great restaurants nearby. I can personally highly recommend Sam's Ocean View, the dinner we had there was excellent and the service was top notch.
My wife and I had a wonderful stay. The only quibble we had was some noise from the upstairs neighbor, but there's not much you can do about that.
Terry Stead."
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Wonderful condo. Great ocean view, comfortable, convenient to shopping & restaurants. Everything we needed was available and great host."
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Deb is a fabulous host. She is very prompt in her responses and her place is lovely. It's a very comfortable, clean and spacious place for two people. The patio and ocean view was amazing. The kitchen and bathroom are new and clean. The facilities at the place seem fantastic but we were too busy adventuring around the island to take advantage of them! Deb gave us lots of great tips on what to do/see. I would definitely try to book with her again when I come back to Kauaii!"
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Breezy Oceanfront at the Pono Kai resort is just as advertised. It is a well cared for, clean and comfortable unit, stocked with all you need to settle in and enjoy Kauai. Deb was most helpful in giving us valuable tips on local markets, dinning spots and other highlights of the local community near Kapaa. The location is ideal, next to a sandy swimming beach and within walking distance to grocery stores, shops, and restaurants in old town Kapaa."
2019-01-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,Nice place and great location. Comfortable bed. Thanks Deb for the beach chairs and snorkeling equipment!
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great view nice location.
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Deb's place is in a fantastic location and has an amazing view of the ocean! We loved our stay in Kapaa. The place has the most comfortable reclining chairs I've ever experienced and all the kitchen tools you'll need to cook up a storm. We definitely recommend staying here!
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Deb’s place was great. The view of waves from the porch of condominium was very cool. Every morning, through out our stay, we would walk yards to watch the sun rising off the horizon. The property itself is at great location. Good food and bars within walking distance. A mile drive gets you to General store and more food options.
We will definitely try to reach iut to Deb if we again plan to visit Kauai."
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall I highly recommend this place and I would come back! Spacious unit with separate bedroom. Great location with local shops in walking distance. The owner was very pleasant and quick to respond. Chairs and bed were comfortable after long of activities. Beach chairs, snorkel gears, extra amenities were available as well."
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This condo was great, the pool and hot tub were excellent and the view is incredible.
The kitchen was well equipped, the layout and size of the place was better than we expected.
Parking is free. There is a great path along the ocean for several miles. I highly recommend this place."
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A perfect place to stay without any worries. Loved Kauai. Really clean and comfortable apartment. We hope to be back sometime
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great spot. Deb was very responsive. We wanted to visit family in Lihue as well as make sure we were in a central place to explore the island. We had hikes up North and West. This was a great location to stage our days. The beach was literally out to the back of Deb's location. I was able to sit on the balcony and enjoy the sound of the waves. Also, this location was a very short walk into the main strip in Kapaa. That was a bonus. We hit up spots like Java Kai, Bubba's and Mariachi's. All within a short walk. You can even take the beach/bike path back to Deb's place. With a short drive, there was a Longs and Safeway close by as well. Her place was clean and the instructions were clear. There were plenty of towels. She even provided extra's like a cooler and other beach toys (which we didn't use.). The location had a small exercise room, pool, and tennis court. The resort staff was very nice and helpful. Parking was plentiful and easy. I would stay here in the future."
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really loved Deb’s condo! It has perfect location, everything you need for privacy and coocing. The resort had very good services and the view was awesome! You can have breakfast at the sunrise on the balcony!
And Deb is so lovely! We are defenately coming back. She really made our honeymoon!"
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. We had a really nice time. Close to the restaurants and shops
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Deb is a great host! We spent lovely days in her beautiful condo. We enjoyed the stunning ocean view. The balcony was big enough to enjoy our meals outside. Great communication, every necessary information was provided upfront. We really loved to stay with Deb."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The quality of the appliances and kitchen items were great. The view was amazing. You can hear the waves at night. I especially loved the lazy boy!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay! Daves place was great!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Convenient location, nice lanai, large kitchen! Having a laundry machine in unit was a nice perk!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,David was very responsive and provided information about the local area. The view from the lanai was as advertised - Amazing.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Thanks you for letting us use your beautiful spot for a few days. The views are second to none and the place is comfy cozy.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay at David’s place. The view was amazing and the suite has everything we needed to have a comfortable stay.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The condo was very comfortable and clean. The view was beautiful. I especially enjoyed listening to the ocean while we were at the condo. Having the availability of beach accessories including a cooler and ice packs was wonderful.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I had a wonderful experience, thank you!!!"
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"David's condo was as described.
The view is beautiful if you look to the left. The main highway to the right, takes away from the beautiful bay view.
The road noise and court yard noise is very noticeable. Bring earplugs if you are a light sleeper.
I noticed other condos had vinyl windows with louvre windows, I bet this would have helped tremendously.
I would recommend picking up your own supply of coffee as you are only provided with 4 Kcups.
There was a kuerig as well as a regular coffee maker.
Host provides beach chairs,Umbrella and cooler.
The condo is walkable to the coconut market and lava lava beach club.
Easy access to the North shore and west shore ."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"David’s place was perfect for us — close to everything we needed, also quiet and private with a beautiful view of the beach and ocean from the balcony, where we ate most of our meals. The a/c was a bit noisy but we hardly needed it with the lovely breezes from the windows and balcony. The place was really well equipped and we appreciated the kitchen equipment, coffee makers, cooler, beach chairs, umbrella, high end dishwasher, washer/dryer, comfortable bed, newer furniture, and bathtub rather than just a shower. We enjoyed the pool and the location close to grocery stores, bakery (across the street), restaurants, and the airport. David was very organized about the confirmation and check-in information and exceptionally accommodating when we had a request; he always answered us promptly. We were even greeted by little treats. Would highly recommend this condo for your Kauai vacation!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A perfect landing pad for our adventures all around Kauai - and David is a very communicative and thoughtful host!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a great spot to relax and end our trip after spending a week camping on the island. We enjoyed the view and being close to restaurants. The bakery across the street was delicious! It was a nice bonus to be able to do our laundry and come home with clean clothes.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place with perfect location and all the amenities we needed during our stay. Highly recommend staying with David
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our first trip & we already can’t wait to go back to explore more! We had an amazing stay at David’s beautiful condo & we are so grateful for his hospitality!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We liked everything about this place. David is a great host, everything was clean. The manager on site is a great guy and does a good job at maintaining the place. The beach just in front is far from being the prettiest in Kauai but it makes for amazing views and we saw lots of turtles swimming. Highly recommend this place!"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! Had everything we needed, from chairs coolers, views, and umbrella."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"We were mostly comfortable overall, but there were some aspects that left us with mixed feelings. On the positive side, the condo boasted an excellent pool, which was a real highlight of our stay. The view of the ocean was truly breathtaking, earning a solid 10/10 in our books. Watching the waves and sunsets was a memorable experience. However, there were quite a few rules in place, and we also had to buy our own toilet paper, paper towels, laundry soap and dryer sheets, which was inconvenient. The towels provided had a tendency to become moldy due to the humidity, and they didn't dry out properly. We had to purchase white vinegar to address this issue, which was somewhat frustrating. Also, the swamp cooler air conditioner didn't work effectively, leaving the condo feeling hot and humid most of the time. This made it less comfortable than we had hoped for. Lastly, the manager's constant presence created a slightly uneasy atmosphere. It was a bit awkward to see him constantly."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Very well appointed ocean front condominium. Nice complex. Beautiful pool. Great bakery across the street.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Very nice pool. Beautiful view from lanai. Highly recommended!!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,fantastic central location
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Staying in this location was amazing! The view was breathtaking and there was things to do all around. The checkin was a little confusing but the manager on site was a delight and very helpful whenever we had a question. This place really made our stay lovely.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Awesome place. Would love to come back when we plan our next trip back to Kauai!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"“David’s condo was great! —tastefully decorated, clean and equipped with everything needed to function as a home
base. check in was easy and laid back.
we made extensive use of the balcony, having our morning coffees and afternoon cocktails there while watching the beautiful views of the beach and ever changing cloud patterns which presented themselves early morning and evening.
The condo is centrally located and
it was easy to explore any portion of the island from there. it was a welcoming place to return to after numerous shopping expeditions and adventures throughout the day and offered a cool and relaxing respite from the hustle and bustle .
We were fortunate enough to have the trade winds blowing while staying there so did not need to use the a/c that was offered. the fans were adequate and quiet.
the pool was a wonderful way to cool off at the end of the day and was seldom crowded . several bbqs were also available for use.
thanks for a great place
Steph and Steve"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, centrally located condo, perfect for our quick trip to Kauai. We appreciated the extra amenities, especially the beach chairs and cooler, which made our traveling a breeze."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Beautiful place. Ate all our meals on the lanai. Great location. Would definitely stay there again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful home to match the beautiful location. Everything as described. Absolutely would recommend!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,David’s place was just as advertised. We loved the location which is central to a lot of places. The deck/balcony was by far the greatest. Loved the view of the water and beach.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, this place is absolutely awesome! Great location, easy parking, super quiet little complex, excellent views, relatively well equipped, amazing pool, walkable to restaurants and beach. Couple things I wish had been there was creamer/sugar for the provided coffee, and a water filter of some sort. Minor things, but would recommend the host consider them to rule out the need for a grocery store run. All in all, it’s a really really awesome spot and highly recommended! Would absolutely stay again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place and great location! The unit is outside of the pool which can be a little noisy if you’re going to bed early.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"David’s place is fantastic! Centrally located, Kapaa is perfect if you want to check out north and south Kauai. There are lots of great restaurants nearby. Make sure you get pastries at Passion Bakery! They make a mean loco moco too! Great coffees as well.
The manager on site at the property was super nice and greeted us to help set up the parking pass. He gave us local info and helped show us to the room. Very friendly!!
The view is amazing and you won’t be disappointed. Great pool too."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at David’s place was spectacular. Location of the unit was perfect, in Kapaa and right across the street a gastarían should you need anything. The unit itself had everything we needed including coolers and beach chairs which we used at Tunnels Beach. David was responsive to our questions. I’m definitely recommending his place to others."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The location and view for the price are unmatched. Very clean and it was great having access to the cooler and beach chairs. David was great about responding to questions. A gem!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay at this condo. It’s the perfect location on Kauai, right in the middle. It’s close to grocery stores, coffee, great restaurants and cute downtown Kapa’a. The condo exceeded our expectations and we enjoyed the view, the warm pool and the comfortable accommodations. The manager at the property was super friendly and helpful as well and we felt welcomed and at home the whole time. Thank you for giving us such a wonderful stay here!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This place is amazing!!!!! Very affordable for the views and location! We were close to the water, grocery stores, and walking distance to shopping and restaurants! Highly recommend! David was a great host! When we did have issues he was very quick to respond and find solutions. We were very grateful for our time here and the memories they helped us make! The pull out couch is very comfortable."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"David’s place was absolutely beautiful. We were there for a 5 year anniversary trip and getting to wake up to that view, was the Cherry on top of our trip. He was always responsive and the home was spotless. We couldn’t have asked for a better location!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place. I wish we could have spent more time there but they were all booked up. Glad I got to squeeze in a weekend there!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"David’s place was great, and perfect for our family. Well-equipped, both in the kitchen and with beach supplies. The view out over the bay was a great thing to wake up to in the mornings or over dinner. David, as well as the on site manager Mark, were responsive and friendly. Great overall stay! There was some noise from the road, but generally not a problem. We were sad to leave, and would absolutely stay here again."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything you need for your vacation is provided at this locations. Fully equipped kitchen came in handy. The bed was very comfortable. Let’s not forget the beautiful view from the balcony. I’m would highly recommend booking this place for your next vacation.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place. So great to be so close to the ocean. Kitchen was great (except we couldn’t find the cutting board!). Nice being able to grill, and also to have such easy access to the beach. Thank you!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was an exceptional one bedroom condo right on the ocean with a beautiful view. The host provided way more than anyone would expect in a condo. You will want for nothing but food. Amazing place. Resident manager was so kind, helpful and friendly. I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again. We loved it here and wish we would have had longer to enjoy this place more."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,David's place was perfect! The pool is right out in the front and the beach is right in the back. The sunrise on the lanai was perfect. Local beach (when waters are calm) is a great sandy beach. Nothing beats the view! The condo was cozy and perfect for our stay. Mahalo David!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a a beautiful place and location was perfect
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome spot for visiting Kapa’a! Great view from the terrace! We traveled in a group of 4 and it was perfect for us. David left us some complimentary biscottis as well!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The lanai opens up to the ocean! Lovely place, great location right by the Wailua river, beautiful sunrise views from lanai. Very clean, and spacious. We enjoyed our stay thoroughly! David is friendly, and very responsive. We called him when we hit a snug during check in and he was right there on the phone to help us out (even on thanksgiving eve). Def will come back!!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome and gorgeous place: great getaway
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"David's place is just about the perfect vacation place! Fantastic view of the ocean , cozy living room with a well equipped kitchen. Bathroom is clean, brightly lit and the bedroom is just he perfect resting spot after a long, weary day. It has the state of the art facilities which we hardly even used as we were outdoors most of the time.
We just wish we had more time to enjoy all the amenities he had to offer.
The sound of the waves was so calming soothing . The sunrise was absolutely breathtaking!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place with amazing views of the ocean. We loved eating breakfast on the lanai and watching the sunrise.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Short but very enjoyable stay. The view from the lanai is gorgeous but especially at sunrise and dusk. Appreciated the Keurig coffee maker and well equipped kitchen. Bathroom is fine; just bring your own shampoo. Bedroom is closest to highway but we closed the windows and ran the A/C to sleep. Otherwise we let the breeze flow through the unit. Nice big LR with plenty of places to sit, work or eat. We didn’t borrow the beach stuff but there is plenty of it. Location is very convenient to airport; just leave extra time for road construction. All in all, happy we chose it."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,David’s place is perfectly located and there are several stores within walking distance. The coconut market place had live music one night we were there and there is a great little Thai food but. The sea was a but rough out front to swim but the waves were wonderful at night and put you right to sleep. We enjoyed watching the kite suffers and the normal surfers. You will need a car to get around but the bus drops you off practically across the street. You have to take a bus from the airport to get to the bus that will take you there but it costs 4$ for both. Getting there was a breeze but flagging the bus man down to get back to the airport was a challenge. They did not stop and we ended up calling a Lyft. David has everything you could need in his apartment and they even have a pool with a couple of grills.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"great place, great view"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice host.
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"David definitely goes above and beyond to provide the things you will need for beach days.
Very prompt responses if issues do occur."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Condo was equipped exceptionally. There were extras everywhere like beach gear and daily necessaries. Location made the entire island easily accessible day to day.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was really beautiful, great decor and the view the best part, drinking our coffee in the morning looking at the ocean was priceless.

We will definitely be back as soon as possible!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Book David’s place if you can- the location is fantastic- we had the beach nearly to ourselves for the entirety of our stay, sunrises were magical from the lanai and the beach, the view from the lanai will spoil you! Night views also were fantastic as we enjoyed the full moon and stars over the bay. The unit is clean and well equipped, within walking distance of a bakery and a short drive from groceries. I wish it had been available longer and if I ever get back to Kauai this is the place I want to be!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"-Wonderful location
-free parking
-walking distance to coconut marketplace

Our 9 night stay here was awesome! We brought our 16month old daughter and she had a blast! Having a full kitchen,washer & dryer,beach equipment was so helpful! We would definitely stay here again!(-;"

I recommend the Coconuts Market 2 minutes from the residence."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A very nice place, with breathtaking views. As a starting point to explore Kauai, super suitable. Amenities very good, bathing utensils also available. Everything very neat and clean.
The bedroom is directly to the pool/walkway and is a bit noisy."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,beautiful location! I wish I knew what brand the mattress is because I loved it. loved the condo
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay in this beautiful condo in Kauai and felt like at home right away. We had everything we needed. We appreciated the communication with David and the location of the condo was perfect!
Couldn't have been better!"
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nicely decorated condo not far from downtown Kapaa. The building is a little dated and the condo gets a bit humid, but the AC helps. Beautiful beach views. Good communication with host and easy check in."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This AirBnb surpassed all of our expectations. Most homes are not as pictured, but this home is even more amazing than the pictures. We highly recommend it to anyone looking to visit Kauai and will definitely be back! PS, we were not at all bothered by the chickens and were never woken up by them which was a pleasant surprise!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An awesome stay, clean place with an excellent view, not to mention a really great doughnut shop across the road!"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location! I loved being a quick drive or walk away nice coffee shops and restaurants. (Aloha Roastery & Passion Bakery) Never got tired of waking up to the beautiful view of the water. Loved having a fully functioning kitchen and the washer & dryer was a very helpful amenity to have. Would definitely stay here again :)
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"The view and the location of this Airbnb are amazing. The apartment is correctly equipped to have an enjoyable stay. We stayed one week and could travel easily around the island. The communication with David was great when we had some issues (ceiling fan, insects)."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,View + size + price = will come back
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Sweet condo! Great location!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place and location. Perfect size for a couple. We could watch the sunrise from the back deck which was great. The owner provides everything you need for the beach like chairs, bags, snorkeling gear. The home was clean and comfortable. It was a little noisy at night being so close to the highway. Other than that we had a great stay and would return."
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place - Clean - Centrally located - Amazing Sunset - Ocean View - Host is always available to answer any questions.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place to stay! Everything we needed, good places to eat close by and everything was very clean and neat! We will be coming back."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed 4 days, overall was perfect for what we needed. Big comfy bed, large fridge, updated bathroom, close to the airport, AC and fan worked great, water pressure is amazing, includes 2 beach chairs, a cooler, an umbrella, and 2 beach towels. I wish there had been extra towels since we took them on hikes for when we swam and they got dirty and there isn’t any laundry (so maybe bring your own extra ones) - there were extra bath towels though which was nice. Sometimes parking was difficult if we came back late. Super short walk to a grocery store that also has hot food and a coffee shop, lava lava beach club (food and drinks), Jojos shave ice, and some stores. 15 min walk (or 2 min drive) to boss frogs snorkel shop to rent snorkel gear. Short walk to the beach but you can’t swim there and the sun doesn’t rise/set in this area but it was still pretty. 15 min to airport, 45 to Hanalei bay / shuttle for the napali coast hike, 1 hour 15 min to Waimea canyon, 40 min to Poipu beach"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The shower was awesome, great water pressure!! I was also surprised to find beach umbrellas, a boogie board and clothes steamer as I don’t believe those items were listed. The beach in not great for swimming but perfect for hanging out on, watching the sunrises and possibly an even seeing the monk seals like we did multiple times. The Lava Lava next door had great breakfast, with lunch and dinner options. Tom’s place is easy walking and close to The Coconut Market Place for some shopping and the The Island Country Market that has all your last minute needs, a coffee bar and tons of deli options (hot or cold) dine outside or take to go. We would definitely stay here again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Lovely grounds. Poolside bar. Firm mattress. Great shower pressure. Really enjoyed our stay.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. Beautiful sunrise views and perfect if you are wanting to walk to restaurants and shopping.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second unit of Tom’s that I’ve stayed in on this property and both were really beautifully updated (light and bright inside- some of the more original units feel a lot darker). It is also very well-stocked (especially the kitchen) to get you through your stay. This unit isn’t directly facing the water but still has an ocean view to the side from the patio and is still only steps from a great little quiet beach. Also an excellent location right on the ocean walking path, and walking distance from many shops and restaurants. Definitely hope to stay again!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Tom was great! Tom was out of town during our stay, but he provided an alternative contact right away. Whenever there was a request, it was handled very quickly!
The place itself was very clean. The bathroom was recently updated and doesn’t match the photos of the listing (it’s way better!).
We loved our stay - perfect place for a couple."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was perfect for our last four nights in Hawaii. We appreciated the luxuriant, well-tended grounds of Islander-by-the-Sea, and its location along a beautiful stretch of sandy beach. A wide beachfront walk connects to trails along the coast in both directions. Although swimming is not recommended directly in front of the resort because of strong currents and lava ledges, there is a fine pool available in the resort, and just a few minutes walk to the south you can find tidal pools great for swimming, with small beaches protected by rocky outcrops from the rougher surf. Tom's studio is modern, clean and comfortable. A sliding glass door opens to a patio with a view out to the ocean - ideal for breakfast after sunrise. It was convenient to be just a few steps from the oceanfront restaurant next door, and there are also excellent Thai and Italian places at the neighboring outdoor mall. A minor qualm: we did miss a closet to hang clothes, although there were a few hooks."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very convenient location literally steps away from the shore, some fantastic restaurants, and a shopping center. The unit makes great use of its space despite being on the smaller side, and it is charmingly decorated. The beach had surpringly clear water for snorkeling, although we only saw a few fish. Lydgate beach park is a short drive away for better snorkeling. If you are looking to stay in Kapaa, the location doesn't get much better than this."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place for two! Well appointed, extremely clean, and a wonderful location. It was booked for a few days as an extension to our trip and had everything we needed- inside and out. Easy access to the beach (just steps away) the walking/bike path, restaurants, and easy parking. We would definitely book again!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"No surprises, everything as expected which was really nice! No communication was necessary because everything went smoothly! Would love to stay again!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location to see the sunrise on the beach just steps out the door.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"WOW, where do we begin? This was the perfect spot for a couple wanting to get away. We spent our wedding/honeymoon here for a week and we never got bored. So many places within walking distance including a 1 minute walk to the ocean! I loved that it was in the middle of the island, we could get to the south or north shore within 30-40 minutes! The pool had happy hour every day 3-6pm. We couldn't recommend this perfect spot more, Tom was always a text or call away! Thank you Tom for the perfect stay on the beautiful garden island!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place in a nice complex. Good size space for a couple with nice kitchenette and good size bathroom. Ocean view from lanai was lovely to enjoy at sunrise.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Unit was exactly like the photos. Just steps away from the beach. Clean and very well stocked kitchen. Chairs and boogie board for use.
Lots of good places to eat and shop nearby. Location was safe and great for exploring the entire island.
Tom was quick to respond to any questions prior to our trip. We didn't have a need to contact him during our stay."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful condo, great location with so much to do within walking distance, Tom is a great host."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tom’s place was very clean and well maintained. The unit was fully stocked with everything we needed to cook a few meals and pack lunches for day excursions. It is steps from the beach and you can see and hear the ocean from the lanai. The grounds are beautifully landscaped and walking distance to restaurants, bike, kayak rentals and a market. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend to family and friends."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tom’s place was exactly as described. Great location - steps from beach, shops, and restaurants. Would definitely stay again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a wonderful and relaxing time! Perfectly located and beautiful condo right next to the beach, but still private. Will be back!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Exactly what we were looking for. Very clean, bright, ground floor studio from which you can walk onto the beach. And sit on the porch for breakfast and cocktails and watch/hear the ocean. Condo complex is well tended. Location is very convenient for walking to an nice selection of bars and restaurants. Very happy stay!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,You can’t beat the location! Nice setting and comfortable unit. Nice shower!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tom’s place is the perfect amount of comfort and convenience in a great location. The ocean as your back yard is always amazing. The grounds are beautiful, friendly people around, and an overall good vibe."

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our time at Tom’s place. It was the perfect size for two people. Perfect location for easily accessing all areas of the island and great restaurants nearby.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Tom’s place was beautiful and exactly as advertised. You can see the ocean from the lanai and is only footsteps away. The location is perfectly central to explore the entire Island. I would love to stay here again and would reccomend to my friends and family.
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time in Kauai. We enjoyed the condo’s closeness to the beach and nearby restaurants and bakeries. This location is also centrally located so we found it easy to visit the north and south shores of the island. If you book Tom’s place, we suggest you give his binder and the guest book a look for recommendations of activities and places to eat that other guests and us have enjoyed. Mahalo!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tom's place is in such a great location. Right on the beach, easy walkable access to great restaurants, nice pool. We had a great time!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,We enjoyed the stay very much. The location is perfect and very close to the sea. We would come back here anytime and recommend this apartment. Thank you Tom!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful studio with beach access a pool and pool bar. Restaurants near the property were pretty good. Highly recommended checking out the Sleeping Giant. One of the best seared tuna dishes I’ve ever had. Location is great for getting to most places on the island. Keeps your options open. Bed was comfortable and the AC kept the humidity down and made it a comfortable place to sleep. Overall I was impressed and would recommend it for someone/couple looking for a comfortable and reasonably priced place to stay.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything in the description was accurate, and yet even better in person. This is a perfect place to stay in Kauai. Would give it 6 stars if I could!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great location, my only complaint is I didn’t stay long enough."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I fully enjoyed my experience in Kauai and the listing of Tom's space was absolutely perfect. The location couldn't have been any better - local coffee shops, markets, shave ice, gifts and restaurants nearby. There was a pool and poolside bar at the location. I could hear the ocean from my room every night. I couldn't have asked for a more comfortable stay. Tom was an excellent host and very responsive to my requests and needs to which I was very grateful. Having access to renting the car was a bonus as well and made things SO EASY. Thank you so much for a FABULOUS stay!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tom’s place was absolutely amazing! We loved being so close to the water! The location was perfect and was a short walk away from many great restaurants. Will definitely stay here if we visit again!!

2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"My daughter and I really enjoyed the condo. It was very quiet, close to stores and restaurants. The facilities were in great shape and it was super clean. Kappa is in the middle of the island which made it quite handy to drive South or North. Tom was super responsive to all my questions. The process of checking in and out are amazingly simple, perfect for a relaxing vacation. Thank you Tom!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tom's place corresponded exactly to the description. The check-in went smoothly, the car can be parked at the parking lot for free. The whole complex is very well maintained, the accommodation clean and appealing, the beach is right in front of the house and from the terrace you can see the sea. There are even beach chairs and beach towels. The property is close to the airport and both parts of the island can be explored well.
Thanks, Tom, we'd love to come back!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Very comfortable. Had all kinds of small thoughtful items that make a stay hassle free. Tons of kitchen items, broom (so necessary at beach), storage space, nice TV, much more. Steps to beach, garden view (doesn't face beach, but right outside slider), nice grounds, quiet. Bar at pool. Easy food in local restaurants and stores. Enjoyed stay."
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place, clean and close to shops and dining. It is a bit smaller than expected with limited closet space but I would definitely recommend especially for couples."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely perfect place to stay and explore Kauai. It was my first time visiting and I can’t wait to come back and stay here again!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hesitating writing this review because I don’t want the secret of Tom’s place in paradise to get out! Visited for the second half of our honeymoon…and we didn’t want to come home. This condo is wonderful, clean, comfortable and inviting. The location is perfect to be as active or chillaxed as one would like. If you want to park your rental car and not drive totally possible with all the surrounding amenities. The beach and pool are just steps away. Long story short we will be back."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great location you can hear the surf as you sleep. Space has been upgraded and is perfect for two people. Tom is a great host. My wife loved it what better endorsement could you want. Highly recommend this spot.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay. Tom’s place is conveniently located to walkable shops/restaurants (coconut market place). Perfect location to explore all of Kauai. Lava Lava Beach club was a gem, we enjoyed breakfast there every morning with unbelievable view/atmosphere. Grounds we’re clean and beautiful."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I booked this spot in Kapa’a for our third stop on our honeymoon and it certainly did not disappoint! The place is small but certainly cosy and well furnished. They were able to make it as comfortable as can be, and everything was clean and the condo was fairly modern. It had great access to the beach and pool, and was very close to restaurants and shops. Tom was very helpful and responsive as well. Would definitely recommend Tom’s spot and would certainly stay there again!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location!!! Loved being able to walk everywhere! Really didn’t need a car. Great restaurants even across the sidewalk lol! Will be back with my boyfriend soon!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location!! Close to the beach!!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our second time staying here and it was just as good as the last time. Such a peaceful stay at a beautiful property. Can’t wait to go back again!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tom's place was perfect for my fiancee and me. Super close to the beach and plenty of amenities (the plethora of extra towels came in handy🙏). Kapaa is a perfect place to explore the rest of the island from and there is quite a bit to do in the town itself. We especially loved being close to Lava Lava Beach Club. Would definitely stay in Tom's place again!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tom was imminently responsive. His great and well stocked place was easy to get into and out of. Great location on the beach and next to a shopping center. Recently renovated. Great shower, great bed and pillows. Perhaps my best airb&b experience. We loved it. Hopefully he’ll let us come back:)"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place for our first trip to Kauai. Centrally located to everything we wanted to explore. Quiet unit with everything we needed. Thank you for sharing your place with us!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tom's place had everything we needed for our stay. we also enjoyed the pool and bar from the place. I would definitely come back!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place. Plenty to dine and do along the beach. Convenient travels Central to northern and southern shores
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very enjoyable
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at Tom’s place. Great space, clean and tidy, all the amenities you need - and just steps away from the ocean."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay right by the ocean and within walking distance of several restaurants. Great location and great airbnb
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,I loved this place for a million reasons. It’s gorgeous. Plenty of space for my mom and I. The remodel is gorgeous. It’s right next to the ocean. Ocean view from the patio. It’s also central to everything on the island. We experienced the whole island easily from here. Someone told us to stay in this region so we could do easy trips to the south and north. Best advice ever. Also there’s tons of food and things within walking distance. We had a car but we wouldn’t have needed it for local stuff. And the hosts were great. Communicated well and highly responsive.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Tom's beachside unit was perfect! The home was clean and updated with everything needed for our 10-day stay. I was apprehensive on renting a ground level unit. I soon changed my mind. It was the perfect place. We traveled with 2 other couples and our place ended up being the gathering place since we had all the amenities needed and an expansive front lawn to relax on and take in the ocean views. The bed was extremely comfortable which was important to us. Tom has a hotplate that came in very handy. We cooked just about every breakfast in the condo. We loved just walking a few steps to the beach to watch the sunrise. The Ke Ala Hele Makalae walking trail is a must. Front the condo to Kapaa Lookout is 4.8 miles up and back. A perfect morning walk. We will be back again next year!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely time celebrating our honeymoon at Tom’s condo! The location in Kapaa is central to the north & south coasts which is what we wanted! Two coffee shops & multiple restaurants and shops are in the parking lot which is very convenient! Thanks for sharing your wonderful, clean home with us!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tom's rental is very clean, accomodating and comfortable. location is very central on the island allowing for reasonable distance to most attractions. there is also everything you need within walking distance even the beach is located right outside the door which makes for watching the sunrise very convenient! would definitely book again!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We really enjoyed our time here. Great location!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Loved the location! We would stay here again. Also, highly suggest attending a happy hour at the pool bar!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Amazing location on the island to stay, updated and clean space, & steps to a less crowded beach that we loved!
the Coconut Market Place is a 2 min. walk from you. Essentially, you wouldn’t need a car and could pretty much get everything you need there. We had a rental car, but thought it was nice when we realized how much was walking distance from us. Lava Lava Beach Club next door is a VIBE! This restaurant offers live music, has a modern beachy ambiance & amazing food at a reasonable price that is also a few feet (quite literally) from you. Walk out every night for shaved ice and a beautiful Hawaiian sunset.
We had a decent air conditioner and good ceiling fan that kept it pretty cool inside. Toiletries, towels, soap, paper towels, silverware, extra pillow, and much more for you while you are there as well. Very good deal considering how expensive Islander On the Beach is to rent direct from the resort. Amazing, would stay here again. Thank you Tom!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,My husband and I had a great stay! The place had everything we needed for a week in Kauai. Awesome little studio that was even better than pictures. Comfortable bed was a plus. Would definitely stay here again!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We loved your place. The location was great. The beach at the resort is beautiful and it was so nice to sit on the lanai to watch the waves and look at the turquoise water. I really enjoyed getting to see the sunrise in the mornings. The induction burner was very handy for making breakfasts. The pool and hot tub were perfect temperatures, too. Thank you for helping to make our 10 year anniversary special."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Central location midway between all points of interest. The area has plenty of restaurants, stores, coffee, etc…, starting within steps from your front door. The main portion of Kapaa is a less than 10min drive to the north.
While the pool area is small and crowded most of the day, you are a 30 second walk to the beach from your back patio. It was a very pleasant area to relax and swim."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The accommodation is very comfortable, clean and modern. it is located directly on the sea, and the next larger town takes 5-10 minutes by car. however, it has a few shopps and food options on site. Tom was very kind and replied quickly."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We love our experience in this condo. The location was great the amenities were perfect. Pros beautiful grounds, location, boogie boards etc. well stocked kitchen for the size. Cons at the time of our visit the walking path was blocked for construction. Not a big deal. Would stay again for sure!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We couldn’t have picked a better place to stay in Kapa’a. Right on the beach, close to food and good coffee, and great pool bar with happy hour. The room was clean and well stocked with dishes, cooler and boogie boards. Would definitely recommend staying here."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great location with a ton of amenities near by!!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay at!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Exactly as pictured and described. Great location for exploring both ends of the island. Would recommend.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was wonderful and steps to the beach! Tom is a wonderful host. He was very quick to communicate and answer any questions that we had. Would definitely stay here again and highly recommend!
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was as expected condo was very organized, communication was great just had a minor issue with TV but resolved right away!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place. Exactly as it looked in the pictures, big bathroom, property kitchen with a good sized fridge and hot plates, everything you need to dine in. property is literally on the beach and also has a great pool, hot tub, and bar area. Right next to a shopping center with a great market, there’s an amazing coffee shop and restaurant on the property, centrally located in Kapaa with the best food on the island. Super convenient to get to and from the airport, and the drive to Hanalei is not bad at all, maybe 40 minutes… wife and I did it three times because we love that beach. Bed is SUPER comfortable, great Samsung smart TV (we logged into our Netflix and Prime accounts for our evening binge watching). Had a lovely relaxing time and definitely would come back!!!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Close to the beach, clean unit! Tom's instructions for check in was crystal clear!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nicer than expected! The unit is on the first floor just steps from the beach. Easy check in. Lots of restaurants and good beaches nearby. Close to the airport. Lovely sunrises here in February. The amenities of the property were also nice: pool, hot tub, ice maker. Great king bed and nice shower. Nice TV and lovely outdoor patio where you can sit and see the water. Will be back next time we are in Kauai!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great convenient place for us as we explored beautiful Kauai! The location is wonderful as it is just steps from the ocean and walking distance to several restaurants and shops. We would stay here again!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We love the location of condo! It’s steps away from the beach and close to shopping and food.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This condo was everything you would hope for in a paradise setting. Tom's was very helpful with the guide he had for restaurants and things to do. If you had any question he was there to answer. I just can't say enough good things about this place. We had no worries with our stay the cleanness was top notch.
Thank you"
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tom’s place in Kapaa is super convenient and easy keyless entry. The bathroom was lovely except no shampoo or body wash. The location is amazing, close to grocery store, a couple food options walking distance and more just a few minutes drive away. The room stays cool in the heat and the TV has all the streaming options. The fridge comes in handy for storing cold drinks. Overall I really enjoyed my stay and appreciated Tom’s excellent communication."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"It's a very nice place to stay. We loved that could we walk off the patio to the beach in a few dozen steps. It's a central location for excursions to all parts of the island. Many restaurants/shops within walking distance. Right next to Coconut Marketplace. Our host was extremely responsive and helpful.
Pros -
Very comfortable bed
Large smart TV
Well-supplied kitchen
Cons-
No stove/oven (but does have a nice electric burner)
No bathtub
Would stay here again in a heartbeat!! Had a fabulous stay!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and newly remodeled! Convenient to shops, restaurants and airport The beach is lovely as is the grounds. Wonderful place to stay"
2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and really good spot overall. A bit of a pest issue so don’t leave food out.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing location next to shops/eateries as well as the beach just steps away! Can't wait to come back to the island and stay at this location again!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This location really can't be beat and the room was perfectly equipped with everything we needed!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Tom’s place was perfect for our vacation needs. Location was central to everything on the island. Beach access right out side our door. Watching the sunrise every morning was the perfect way to start the day. Everything was as described, we will be back for sure."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Steps away from the ocean! Beautifully and thoughtfully furnished. Community pool and hot tub is amazing. Location is near many shops and restaurants. Loved our stay!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I had a wonderful stay here during our trip. The location is wonderful with great access to food and drinks. The perk of being a short walk to the beach and pool was another of the many perks of this place!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a amazing location and perfect center spot to see both sides of the island, the community based around the space is a dream with the beach oceanfront steps from your door and the hot tub open until 10PM. Unit was just as described and can’t recommend this place enough!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a spectacular time in Kauai and Tom’s hale was the exclamation point. Everything was as described but so much better when you are actually there. Mahalo nui hou!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tom’s place was just as advertised, close to the beach and good parking. Cute condo, basics furnished, great host communication. Netflix tv capable a plus!"

Will be back for sure!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This place had everything we needed and more for our honeymoon. Perfect location, central to everything and unbeatable food all within walking distance. Best bar around is right down at the pool and we enjoyed so many other guests’ company during our trip!"

2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time here for our honeymoon! Tom provided beach towels, beach chairs and boogyboards! He had great recommendations for us to do. :)"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a nice stay at Tom’s place. It was exactly as advertised and he is a great host. It is just outside of the very cool town of Kapa’a and a great base camp for exploring the Easter and Northern end of the Island. Definitely recommend
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was better than expected. All of the creature comforts that you could want, chairs, umbrellas, binoculars and guidebooks! The place was immaculate and the pool even had a bar area. Very close to a whole bunch of shops, if you didn’t want to leave the complex you wouldn’t have to. We would definitely stay here again and we would recommend it to anybody looking at it!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was way more than what we expected. The room is lovely, there’s everything you need to cook, super well located and an incredible view from the balcony. We couldn’t dream for a better place in that city!"

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Well kept kitchenette made it feel like home. Slept amazingly. Appreciated the islander book with tom’s personal suggestions on places to go! A very clean & comfortable place. Would definitely love to stay here again! 🌺 Mahalo!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This place was amazing! We loved how close it was to the ocean, the opportunity to grill out and the pool. There is also a great tiki bar next to the pool where we met so many great people and got tips for places to visit while on the island. The place was super clear and a two min walk from a shopping area and a bunch of restaurants. Great stay and would definitely recommend."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We absolutely loved staying at this Airbnb. The property is beautiful and within a short walk of the beach. The room itself is clean, bright, and comfortable. We also enjoyed how short of a walk it is to some shops. We would absolutely return!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tom’s place is fantastic. Great location on the beach with many options for food, activities, etc. nearby. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay here during our honeymoon and we would definitely stay here again!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place and location! We would definitely stay again!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was in a good area, stores and everything you need it pretty close by. The beach wasn’t what I expected, it was hard to walk on, the sand gave way under your feet very easy and it was deep. (I had knee surgery not too long ago so I wasn’t really able to walk on that beach easily) but it is still very close to the room and with a good sunrise view off to the left ☺️ Tom is also a lot of help and easy to get ahold of. Made the whole process very easy!"
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The room was as described and pictured. We stayed there toward the end of our island visit as we were fairly close to airport.
Need to bring your own coffee and shampoo."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tom’s place was absolutely perfect! Hands down our favorite place we stayed on our honeymoon. The bed was so comfortable and all of the amenities were very accommodating. Would recommend without reservation!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stayed here in June 2021 and everything is correct as described in listing. Loved being so close to the beach. Liked having the Market nearby for food options.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Comfortable room!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed every minute of the time we spent in Tom's oasis. Tom was extremely on top of communication and willing to chat with us about whatever we needed. The LOCATION was perfect. The beach is steps away, and there are even little pockets of coral that attract lots of fish to watch. My partner and I really enjoyed the fact that this place is central to all of the activities in the North and West areas of the island. The Coconut Marketplace complex next door provides a sunny, casual vibe. There is a sweet farmer's market in the parking lot some days. Try the local fruit called Longan! The coffee shop right by the place and the grocery there are so convenient if you need something quick. And Kapa'a is a cute town!
The studio condo is set up really well, so you never feel like you're crunched for space or in one another's way. Multiple times, we said ""It'd be great if this place had..."" then we'd open a drawer, and it was there! Tom provides beach chairs, towels, and an umbrella for ultimate beach bum convenience. Parking was a breeze. The hot tub and pool were lovely amenities, especially with the rising moon over the ocean in view. We loved the location and the security of staying in an established resort while having total independence.
If you want to explore the more noted parts of the island, you definitely need a car, but you can just as easily enjoy a more intimate few days biking or walking around the Kapa'a area.
I guess we should be making up bad things to tell you, so we can stay here whenever we want :-)
Thank you, Tom, for providing this experience!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This condo exceeded our expectations. It had everything we could need
-including beach chairs and towels. The place was very clean and well stocked for everything. If we were inclined, we could have cooked a great dinner and enjoyed it on the lovely patio. The decor was lovelas well. Tom provided great communicatioas well.We would love to stay there again. Parking was not a problem during the time we were there."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful time. The market place has everything you need! Loved snorkeling at Lydgate close by.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is perfect. My wife and I took our honeymoon here and it was wonderful. The studio is small and has everything you could need. The induction burner, fridge, and blender make it so you can cook and make drinks from home if you want to. It's close to a store, close to a bunch of restaurants (Lava Lava Beach Club right next door is great), has a coffee shop on the property, and it's right on the beach. There are lots of little touches, too that made the place feel special and add a lot of value – beach towels, beach chairs, boogie boards, a lunch box, a book of recommendations, and a guest book. Tom was very accomodating and answered any questions we had. The sunrises are beautiful. The pool and hot tub are great to have but do be aware they will kick you out at 10pm when it closes. The pool bar is currently closed (May 2021) due to COVID. All of this and it's still a great price! We will be coming back for sure."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing scenery, friendly neighbors, and great location. Close to shops and restaurants. Right on the beach too! We had such an amazing stay!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Location was perfect. We will be back soon.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There is NOTHING I would change about this stay. A perfect central location on the island, but if you never want to leave the complex you don’t have to. In our humble opinion, it’s also the best beach on the island. We will definitely be back as it’s as close to perfect as perfect gets."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect spot for our honeymoon. Absolutely incredible. Extremely comfortable bed, convenient location, and we were able to watch the sunrise from our lanai (and bed!) every morning. Tom is an extremely accommodating and communicative host. We highly recommend and definitely plan to return!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tom takes Super-Host to the next-level! Super helpful host with a perfectly located condo. Right on a beach access just a couple miles away from awesome hiking and a 10 minute drive to the airport.
We took the quick drive to Poipu beach for snorkeling with sea turtles and just down the road to Kauai Beer Co for the amazing flight of house-brews and fries.
Perfect honeymoon stay, and we will 10/10 be back for an anniversary down the road!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was clean and the towels were soft. Had everything we needed for our week stay. It is right on the beach and we enjoyed being able to hear the waves crash in the mornings and evenings. The location was great for us because we went all over the island and it is not far from anything. We loved the hiking, the views from the mountains were breathtaking. This place was a great value for what it was. I would recommend to any couple. We would definitely stay here again and Tom was great to work with."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Incredible location. Steps from the ocean, pool, and hot tub. Get ready to get up to watch the sunrise."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Convenient check in process. Prime location if you want to explore north and south shore. Close to airport. Nice market nearby. Great experience!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great travel items in the apartment, Travel books in the apartment were very helpful and also a pair of binoculars to use for sightseeing. Being right next to the ocean was a huge plus on our trip, steps away from the beach!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was exactly what I was looking for! Footsteps to the beach and centrally located on the island, it’s a great home-base for exploring Kauai."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location.
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,awesome studio right next to the beach! you cant see the ocean til about 10 feet away from the back door. we shared the beach with a seal 1 of the days! strong bleach odor at first so we let it air out for a bit. we'll definitely come back thx!
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this space. It’s conveniently located, and the condo had everything we needed, and nothing more. It was small, clean, adequately supplied, and the pool and hot tub area were a bonus."

2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location.
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great place to watch beautiful sunrises! Very close to the ocean. The grounds are wonderful and the workers are very nice and helpful. Bottom floor unit makes it easy to get to the ocean fast! I love the location of this unit because it is located by wonderful restaurants and a market that has just about anything and everything you might need or forgot. Also, it was nice having beach chairs in the unit to use. Thanks for everything and I hope to return in the near future."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place & steps from the beach. Great basecamp for Kauai exploring!
2019-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The location of this condo was great with the coconut mall nearby to watch the hula show as well as a few paces to the beach and ocean. Nice little kitchen and a cute room that was nice to settle into in the evening and watch some TV. We enjoyed staying here for the last few days of our trip.
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent stay all around! Very well appointed, comfortable and clean. Lots of drawer and armoire space if you're staying a while and the wide vanity makes life much easier for couples. The clothes drying wire in the bathroom was a life saver! No issues with noise at all, just be mindful of the chickens and roosters!
The condo was conveniently close to the airport and almost everything on the island could be reached in under an hour. Tons of amenities within a very short walk- restaurants, shops, coffee, a large drugstore, ABC store and a poolside bar.
All in all, no complaints whatsoever. The only reason we wouldn't stay here again is if we were camping!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome zone, great pool and happy hour spot! Fish tacos at sleeping giant grill were A+ and a short walk away. Loved it so much we came back!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The unit is clean, has a pool, spa and you can see the beach from the porch.
It is a short drive to Safeway and foodland and is walking distance from coffee shops, restaurants and an ABC store.
We enjoyed our stay there and would recommend it to others."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great location in Kauai, this place had most of the things you would need for a week stay in Hawaii including beach gear. Would recommend to anyone that is looking for a reasonably priced place to stay on the island that is in a central location"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place to stay in the best part of Kauai! We will definitely be back!
2019-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location and complex (pool and hot tube) were great. The Unit is perfect for 1 to 2 people. If you like to cook, you’ll want a bigger kitchen not it works for basics. Steps from the beach!!!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"CAREFULLY read and understand the CANCELLATION POLICY. Unlike many of the other AirBnB's I've stayed with their policy is not flexible. Lesson learned. Ok, on to the good stuff... The condo is very comfy (nice bed!), clean, near the pool, beach and some good eats (Lava Lava Beach Club and Coconuts Fish Shack). The hosts have an extensive lists of recommendations which was helpful. And what a nice surprise with the tiki bar and live music (Saturday night) around the pool. Within 10 minutes of getting in to the condo we were poolside relaxing. I can't say enough how much the property is in a fabulous location! You'll enjoy it!"
2019-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This condo is centrally located, nicer than the pictures. Conveniently located within walking distance to restaurants/shops. Cooler and chairs were provided which came in really handy. Would stay here again."
2019-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location!
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Exactly as described by host. Beautiful grounds and best spot for sunrises!
2019-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The condo was clean, close to shops and restaurants. We ate out the entire time. Not really room to keep food in the condo. The Little fridge is good for water and soda. It's great for a quick visit. We loved the Lava Lava Beach Club. Excellent breakfast right on the beach. While the beach is right there, which is amazingly beautiful, it's not a ""walkable beach."" It's steep to get to the water and you can't lay out easily on the sand because there is a lot of tree debris. There are beach chairs just before the steep hill to the ocean. We had to go elsewhere for sunning and swimming. All in all it was a cozy place to sleep with the necessities."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place at great location just a few steps from the beach. The condo has everything you need and for a good price. Close to all parts of the island and ideal for day trips. We were very satisfied!
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Host answered the phone on the first ring, and calmed me down when we had trouble finding our room. As I stated before, we should have gone to the lobby first."
2019-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a great location! Good eats close by. Beach was right outside. Room was very nice and clean.
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is a must if you are just traveling with two. It’s a nice studio apartment that is right by the beach!
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a lovely time here. The studio is super cute, it’s walking distance not only from the beach but from restaurants, bike and snorkeling gear rental, a grocery store, coffee places , all sorts of shops- you could walk to everything you need. The big beach towels and beach chairs are a great touch - and the binoculars! As a woman traveling alone, I felt safe here. I loved falling asleep to the sound of the ocean, and watching the sunrise on the beach. And of course , as everyone says, the view from the lanai is excellent. And the unit’s AC is very powerful.
I had no trouble parking . Friday night there were spaces well into the evening. Saturday I got in early so I’m not sure what the situation was then.
Mary sends very helpful tips before you arrive - be sure to read her emails.
I would love to stay here again."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The location of this rental was amazing! You literally are a 30 second walk to the beach and you can see the ocean from the lanai! We loved the pool area too! It’s walking distance to lots of shops and restaurants as well. We will definitely stay here again!
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary's condo was perfect for us - we loved being right at the ocean, and right next door to Lava Lava Beach Club. We went in the shared jacuzzi every evening. Wailua is a good half-way point between North Shore and South Shore. There is a great burger place across the highway - easy walk - called Street Burger. Pricey, but oh so good!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely space in a great location. Lots to do and see very nearby.
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This condo was a safe, convenient, and comfortable launching point for all of our Kauai adventures. It's cleanliness, prime location, and plentiful supply of beach towels were notable features. I recommend this condo to any couple. While we spent most of our time away from the condo and pnly slept there, I could see those travelers who are more about staying put, getting hammered at the pool or beach, grabbing a meal at the Lava Lava Club, and then stumbling back to the condo really enjoying Mary's place too."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place for a vacation! There are so many delicious restaurants all around (breakfast, lunch, dinner) and a beach right outside the door! It’s in a great location on Kauai- close to the north shore and airport! The condo was perfect - it had everything you could need, even beach supplies!"
2019-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would have given this 1 star, but the view from the patio area was beautiful and it was steps from the beach. This unit is not as it appears. I am not sure if this is a cleaning issue or just wear and tear overtime in the unit being close to the ocean. When we opened the door we got hit with the smell of must. I almost did not want to stay here. The bathroom has a worse must smell than the rest of the unit and we made sure to keep the door open the entire stay and not keep clothes in there. The top bedspread was damp. When I opened the cupboards looking for a cup for water the one on the top left where there were crumbs in it and 3 bugs running around. The closet with beach chair and coolers has a musty smell worse than the room. There is also black mold in a few places on the white curtains going to the patio. The light shades by the bed were rusted. Parking was a nightmare, the lot was full day and night. We had to take out our own garbage and as unclean as the room was when we arrived, the host had the audacity to ask us to tip the cleaners. This place was not clean. I emailed the host when we left and have not yet received a response. I would not recommend it to anyone."
2019-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place itself is as described, however don’t expect a direct view of the ocean. The host isn’t very friendly and seems a bit impatient. Also, the instructions of the check-out are extremely unfriendly and say things like take out the garbage and clean any dirty spots with detergents and such nonsense. To top it off it includes a part about leaving a tip for the cleaners, when the instructions essentially tell you to clean the entire place yourself before leaving."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"LOCATION!! So close to the ocean, 1st floor, quiet! Beautiful. Loved the bar and hot tub vibe at night (although it closes so early, 10 pm, even on weekends!) decent snorkeling right on the beach, used the snorkel gear and fins provided (thank you!) what a great stay in paradise!!"
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is perfect located near many places! The complex is beautiful, has a pool area and is very well cared for!
The room is very complete, in addition there are lounge chairs to go to the beach
We went back and stayed there because we loved it!!"
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"#158 is a perfect place to stay, love the simple and tasteful decor, the location, the resort itself is very beautiful and friendly, we will be back!"
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect. Very amazing value, and it was steps to an awesome beach. There was a pool and a hot tub right outside as well. The room was comfortable and nicely decorated and the bed was very comfortable as well. A fantastic location next to many great restaurants. We loved it. Thank you."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We stayed at this rental for 8 days and absolutely loved it. The resort it is on (Islander on the Beach) was wonderful. It is very well landscaped, right on the ocean and has a great pool/jacuzzi and poolside bar. The location on the island can’t be beat - staying on the east means you can easily go to the North or South for day trips while also having a ton of stuff to do nearby (great restaurants, hiking trails, waterfalls etc). The unit had everything we needed - comfortable king sized bed, A/C (which you will be thankful for), a kitchenette which saved us money from going to restaurants for every meal. If we ever come back to Kaua’i we would try and book this rental first again!"
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ideally located.
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really appreciated the price point, seamless self-check-in, amazing beachside location and well-appointed studio. Make sure to check the closet and its drawers for bonus amenities like snorkel gear, beach shoes, cooler bags , etc. Note: light-sensitive sleepers should bring eye masks — the lovely white curtains don't block much sun."
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place for us to stay. It was comfortable, close to the beach, close to the pool and restaurant. Loved the whole Marketplace!"
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location to watch the sunrise; and to shop and enjoy food! lava lava beach club right next door for a great pineapple chicken rice bowl!
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The condo is located in a fantastic place directly at the sea. We especially enjoyed the veranda overlooking the sea. Super quiet location. Good shopping (and cafe with good coffee) nearby. Perfect starting point to explore the island. Everything was absolutely TOP NOTCH. Highly recommended.
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect space for a trip to Kauai! The condo was sparkling clean, everything you'd need was provided, and the small kitchenette was a great touch. Mary is an excellent host and she always responded quickly if I ever had a question. Mahalo!"
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice condo and great communication.
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great place in a great location! We look forward to returning here in the future. Thank you!
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Exactly what you expect! Beautiful place and it’s a perfect location on the island!
2018-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The condo is very close to a beautiful beach that’s great for swimming or just relaxing. The condo itself is clean and comfortable. It’s perfect for two people.
Besides the beach, the location is amazing. There’s a grocery store, snorkel rental, shops, and restaurants all close by. Great restaurants (go to Street Burger!) are a short drive away.
Things to note (not dealbreakers, just be aware):
There are chickens all over the property and the roosters start crowing at 5am. If you want to sleep later than that, bring earplugs and/or download a white noise app. I found doing both worked perfectly.
Mary has a lot of rules, and it can be intimidating at first, but it’s all common sense and courtesy. Be prepared to treat stains, take out the trash—little things like that. Remember it’s not a hotel.
There’s a shampoo and shower gel dispenser in the shower so if you use conditioner, bring/buy your own.
Overall, a lovely place to spend a Kauai vacation!"
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great location.
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice room :)
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place to stay while in Kauai! It’s centrally located for you to explore all parts of the island and close to the airport. It’s also walking distance to some shops and great restaurants. The coffee at Imua Coffee is great and dinner at Hukilau Lanai was amazing. The view of the ocean from the patio was great or you can walk a few hundred steps and be right on the beach. The pool, hot tub and pool bar were great too!"
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Don't hesitate to book this place! Communications were accurate and prompt. Pictures are reflective of the place and amenties as well as the beach. Location can't be beat. Would suggest utilizing door to ventilate and bring fresh air in. AC works well but it helps to get the air circulating and the ocean noises are amazing.
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for an affordable place with the ocean right outside your door with all the amenities you need then this is the place for you! Mary’s place was a perfect home base for exploring the whole island. Check in was a breeze and Mary was easy to get a hold of. She even accommodated us when we wanted to add another night to our stay. It was comfortable, clean and had everything we needed within the unit and walking distance. The property is beautiful and very well maintained and being on the ground floor was definitely a plus as we were able to walk only a few short steps to catch the sunrise on the beach. The coconut market place is only a few steps away where you can shop at the local stores, buy groceries and even check out the farmers market on Wednesdays. Lava lava beach club is directly next door where you can grab a bite to eat while enjoying a mai tai right on the beach. I would definitely recommend checking out the pool bar during happy hour, especially on Tuesday’s and Saturdays when they have live music. Only 15 minutes from Lihue airport, you really can’t go wrong! What a wonderful time we had on Kauai. Not to mention the cute 4 legged friend that came for a visit every morning :) Thanks again Mary, we will definitely be back!"
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The property is located directly on the sea and while having breakfast on the terrace you can see the sea. The decor was great, we didn't miss anything. Even beach equipment was available. Contact was very good and fast!"
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place right by the beach! Fun family friendly environment with a good blend of couples and full families, with a nice pool area. The beach supplies were a fun plus, and we really appreciated how stylish and fun this place was in real life!"
2018-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time... good location, easy check in, and the apartment serviced our needs for a quick 3 day stay in Kauai as it was in the middle of everything we wanted to see on the island.
the Home is as shown in photos but one thing is that there is not much ventilation and it’s rather damp inside the room without aircon on... so, stay here if you’re okay with sleeping with aircon and keeping the doors closed otherwise you can get a damp room."
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was paradise! Walk out the back door every day to swim and lounge on a beautiful beach! It was amazing. Onsite coffee place, poke and fish tacos, and drinks right on the beach. The studio is beautifully decorated and very comfortable, with everything we needed. It was really, really hard to leave!"
2018-06-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Space was ok. Location was great. Just a bit expensive.
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was very clean, had great AC, and a nice pool. The ocean is maybe 400 feet away from the back door. There are lots of shops and restaurants very close by."
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved this place!! It was centrally-located (right on the beach, near restaurants, bars, coffee shops, grocery stores) and we easily drove to other parts of the island for our daily excursions! Super clean and great amenities - while we already had snorkeled and did some scuba diving in Maui, but it was so nice that they added the snorkels, masks, and fins in the room (a very nice and much appreciated touch)! Oh yes - and the extra cooler for our surfing/beach time!
Thank you for contributing to the success of the last leg of our destination wedding/honeymoon!"
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great condo and so convenient to everything! Loved grilling on the public grills in the resort. We loved lounging on the lanai. The condo was comfortable and clean. We had a great stay in Kauai!!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Allison's place was really great. I enjoyed it thoroughly and it had so many amenities close by. The view of the beach was beautiful and you have access to a pool and hot tub. It was perfect for 1-2 people.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Allison is an awesome host that communicates very well. The check-in and checkout process was seamless. This condo is walking distance to several nice restaurants and has an ocean view. Allison also adds a really nice touch by having robes, chocolates on the pillow, boogie boards, snorkeling equipment and anything you could want at the ocean. I would highly recommend this condo and host to anyone. Great value and even better host."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was a beautiful room that was very clean and well maintained, as well as very welcoming and cozy."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at Allison‘s condo. It was in a very convenient location- right on the beach and walkable to many restaurants, grocery store, the farmer’s market, JoJo’s Shave ice and coconut marketplace. Lava lava Beach club was right next-door also! It was the most perfect vacation. We cannot wait to come back soon!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place and the price was great. Allison was available to answer any questions anytime of the day. Definitely worth the money
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I really enjoyed our stay! The on-site amenities and tons of walkable restaurants and shops made our stay most enjoyable! The room was perfect and the air worked great. We loved the location- it was a comfortable driving distance from all the hiking trails and beaches we wanted to visit. If it's available we will most certainly stay here again on our next visit to Kauai!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a wonderful customer experience!!! Her place was perfection and do cozy and beautiful!!! I will always come back… It was so easy to book and secure start to finish.. After a full day of adventuring and snorkeling, I booked this place last minute and late!!! Allison made the whole experience wonderful. She was SO HELPFUL and stayed on phone to make sure I was safe and comfortable and it was late for her. She is an angel🙏🏽 Truly wonderful oasis and so clean and cozy!! Everything was perfect!!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time even though our visit was short! Allison was very friendly and really easy to work with! The place was perfect for us and we look forward to returning in the future!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Allison was extremely proactive. She reached out several times to offer suggestions and to make sure we had smooth experience. Much appreciated!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Allison’s place was so so special!!! I feel so lucky and blessed to have been at this spot! It was absolutely gorgeous and Allison was super communicative and helpful!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was a gem. It was clean, private and tucked away from busyness but close enough to walk to local amenities. It is also a short walk to the beach so that was a plus. Allison was communicative and responsive throughout my stay making sure I had everything I needed which added to the comfort level of the stay. Definitely enjoyed staying here and I would stay here again. Absolutely recommend to future travelers."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Lupe and Christian’s condo was absolutely perfect for our first visit to Kauai! The place itself was very cute and tidy, and was really well-located. There were several dinner options and a super tasty coffee shop within walking distance. We loved staying in Kapa’a, and found it was a great starting point for all of our Kauai adventures. Lupe and Christian responded very quickly to our messages. I would definitely stay here again!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved our stay. We had such a wonderful time. Lupe’s home was so clean and the AC was ice cold!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our short stay was extremely enjoyable! Lupe and Christian have done an amazing job at decorating and making the studio feel very homey. Lupe was helpful and quick to respond to any questions I had. We loved the area! The Coconut Market was within walking distance for restaurants, grocery, and souvenir shopping. We were able to take a kayak/hike tour with Ancient Tours right next to the property. Traveling around the island was easy from Kapaa, I just wish we had more time to see more."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely wonderful stay! Lupe and Christian were excellent communicators and wanted to make sure we felt at home and had everything we needed. The space was squeaky clean, comfortable, cheerful and was stocked with all beach stuff and kitchen supplies. The coffee shop 15 seconds away was such a nice extra touch (but the condo itself has coffee etc!). Wonderful experience! We can’t wait to come back."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Only stayed for one night, but it was a wonderful experience! The place was clean, cozy, and had everything I needed for a comfortable stay.

2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"As described and very convenient location with restaurants/shops within walking distance. We had some maintenance issues (broken chair, broken kitchenette pipe) but the host was responsive. Host left welcome treats (fruit, nuts and chocolate) which was nice too."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Thank you Lupe and Christian for a great place to stay! It was perfect for my husband and I and our baby. Very clean and had great extras!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had the best week at Lupe and Christian’s place. I cannot say enough about the location, just steps from the beach where we watched the sunrise most mornings, a couple hundred yards from a market place with a grocery store, a few restaurants and some shopping, and then 10 min to the airport and a short drive to great places to eat. We rented a car, had free parking and it made the experience 10x better. The hosts were very quick to respond to any questions I had, and overall provided a great air bnb experience. The space is exactly as described and it worked well for 3 ladies. Thank you for everything Lupe and Christian, you have a lovely space!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a great location for our stay. I very much enjoyed it there. While there was some issues on checking in; due to maintenance. They did a great job helping me out and communicating with me immediately. Had a splendid time for my first time in Kauai!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lupe and Christian were incredibly accommodating. They allowed us an early check in, and then were more than welcoming for us to extend our trip due to the wildfires in Maui, when we were originally supposed to continue on our trip there. The resort itself is breathtaking, and it was a perfect place to feel like a local and take in all of the amenities surrounding us. Thanks so much!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay. We were a family of four, which was a little tight for our group with luggage but worked well for a short stay! Having the garden lanai was key!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful Condo located inside the Aston Islander on the beach hotel. Exactly as described and photographed. Walking distance to pool which is infront of the beach and offers a happy hour. There are a few restaurants within walking distance as well. Free parking was definitely a plus. I enjoyed my stay. Mahalo, Lupe and Christian!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lupe was super accommodating and helpful.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice ground floor unit in a resort setting. Close to shops and restaurants. Lupe and Christian are quick to answer questions.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lupe & Christian were very helpful and quick to reply. They provided a great place to stay and lots of great beach material and a guid book. The only note I have is to put a note in the check in about the door automatically locking behind you. Great experience overall!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Well located to reach all destinatins on Kauai. Very good communication with the hosts!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Excellent hub location for us to explore both ends of the island! The place had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. Plenty of restaurants nearby and a store within walking distance. What really stood out to me were the hosts. I've never had someone so responsive and helpful before which made the trip significantly more enjoyable as well.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely room, just like the pictures! Very clean and located close to many restaurants, shops, a pool and the beach! We had a wonderful stay"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Well located on the island on Kauai. Chris and Lupe were available to answer any questions we had. Wonderful place!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We can recommand the apartment! The bed is comfy, nice terrace, very close to the beach, the pool, a cool coffee/breakfast place, markets/restaurants/grills (1-4 minutes away) & much more. The resort area is big, but it is calm and peaceful!
Lupe and Christian are very nice and flexible and the communication was super easy. We appreciate everything very much, thank you!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"All around lovely place and host. We had a great time using the pool and walking around Coconut Marketplace right next door. We even caught an amazing sunrise one morning. We would come back again. Convenient location, close to many restaurants and things to do."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place! felt very clean and safe. the beach was a walk away! would stay again!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Amazing location!! Lupe’s place was amazing, right by the beach & very central to a lot of places! We had a great trip & felt right at home in her place-she provided everything we needed and was very detailed in her directions. Thank you!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay at Lupe’s! Was the perfect location and the room had all the amenities we needed! Would definitely stay again
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lupe’s place was a good location, it was nice to have a few restaurants and Coconut Market close by. The grounds and sunrises were beautiful. Two cons (we were there with our toddler) - the swimming pool isn’t for small kiddos and the beach isn’t for swimming."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lupe was very responsive to me when I had questions and a delayed flight. She co firmed I made it in and that everything was going well. The place was clean and bright, perfect for a short stay in Kauai. I loved the large SMART TV too because it'spart of my nighttime routine to watch my old sitcoms. Lupe provided coffee and small welcone snacks. I definitely recommend staying here!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place, comfortable in a nice location."
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location is the true value of this stay. Right next to the beach, great restaurants and shopping. The grounds of the resort are stunning. We never did get to try out the pool or hot tub but we loved having the option. The room itself is simple and somewhat dated. My biggest concern was the smell when you walk in. There is a significant smell of mildew. You do get used to it very quickly and it would not stop me from staying here again. The room has most things that you could need on vacation. We were pleasantly surprised by fresh flowers in the bath room as well as a boogie board and chair in the wardrobe. Overall a very enjoyable experience!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Close to everything
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location for me and my 3 friends to stay— amazing area with plenty of shopping, pool and beach options"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lupes place was amazing!!! Such a great spot and easy walk for my Dad to beach, we had a yummy brunch at lava lava on the water such a cute spot so close, coffee shop across from place was convenient too plus handicap parking :) I totally recommend Lupes place. Plus she had shower chair delivered for my Dad within the hour. Such a delight to have her thoughtful communication and service to our family. Lupe, hope to come back again! Mahalo!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you Lupe for the amazing stay! Such a great spot and perfect location wise on the island to go explore around.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lupe’s place was perfect for a last minute stay for my girlfriend and I. It was very clean and provided everything we needed for a couple of days taking it easy on the beach and around town.
The resort the private condo is on is very nice and quiet at all times. We enjoyed that it was almost directly next to the nice sandy and peaceful beach which was perfect for sunrise and sunsets. The patio at the condo was also perfect for reading or a small meal."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was such a pleasure staying at this place! The process was extremely easy. It was an extremely clean room with all the amenities and more! Beds were very comfortable and there was a decent amount of space in the room. The best part was that it was a minute from the beach (walking distance). We ended watching sunrise every morning! Parking was easy and it was right next door to an ABC Store and a bunch of shops/restaurants. I highly recommend this place to anyone!!! A must stay and we plan on staying here again in the future!!! Thank you Lupe! We really appreciate everything!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Lupe’s place was awesome. She was always able to answer any questions we had and provided everything we needed for a comfortable stay. They unit was so close to the beach we walked down every morning. Great atmosphere next to an amazing restaurant on the beach and great coffee place. Everything you needed was right there including the market. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to stay close to the beach in a nice area.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little spot near the ocean, shops and restaurants. Clean and cozy vibe."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful accommodation, the beach 50 m away all amenities nearby. The apartment is just great"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The stay has been fantastic, although for 4 people it stays a little small, it is clean and the location is perfect and Lupe cares about your well-being and always available.
Absolutely recommended"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great apartment and the location was perfectly near the Kapa‘a city center. The check-in was super easy and communication with Lupe was great.
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to explore the whole island. Loved the pool and hot tub area. Nice place outside for having breakfast/dinner.
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can only agree with the consistently positive reviews. The apartment looks like pictured. The beds are comfortable. On the terrace you can have a nice breakfast overlooking the garden.
The kitchenette is very small and has no oven or stove. A toaster, a kettle, a coffee machine, a rice cooker and a refrigerator are available on appliances.
The two large beds in the property make it pretty tight.
Communication with Lupe was great, check in and out went smoothly.
The location of the apartment is great for exploring the island.
I highly recommend to stay at Lupes appartment for a Kauai vacation!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location could not have been better! The resort is right in the middle and close to everything. The resort beach and the restaurants within walking distance are great, you wouldn’t need to rent a car if you didn’t want to. The kitchen was small but exactly what we needed to make breakfast in the room. There were beach towels, a mat, a small umbrella and a guidebook to borrow. Loved it, we will be back!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for our stay on the island!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect location right on the coast. Central point to do all things wanted on the island. Very clean, spacious and quiet condo. Beds were extremely comfortable and the amenities were abundant for any use we would have ever had."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome stay, amazing location. Lupe is very responsive and helpful."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What I most loved about this stay was the location! Really nice resort area walking steps to the ocean, walking trails, restaurants, market and souvenir shops. I enjoyed my early morning runs, truly beautiful sights. We were able to do everything walking distance, we even had a cute coffee place right to the side of our room. We enjoyed yoga at the beach for $20, we had amazing pancakes and avocado toast at Lava Lava Restaurant which was walking distance from our room and with view of the ocean :). We swam on a natural pool next to the ocean walking distance as well. We had everything there! Lupe was very communicative, reliable and very helpful. I had so many questions and she answered them all very quickly! I would definitely stay here again and I recommended 100%."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"nice, clean and convenient location."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Easy to communicate with the host. Beautiful and perfect place to stay in Kauai. Near restaurants, beaches, shops…
The place was clean and perfect for our stay. I definitely book for my next time in Kauai."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to stay for a few days in paradise. The location is great, the property was well kept and clean, no complaints here at all."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location for this BnB couldn't have been better for us. It's easy to walk to a beach, ABC, and various restaurants (including a JoJo's shave ice :D). Since it's around the center of the east coast it's also a good location for if you have activities all around the island.
The BnB was nice and had everything we needed for a great stay in Kauai."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything was great and as described. Lupe was easily accessible for communication and her place had everything we needed!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay. Location was perfect for everything we wanted to do. There is also a marketplace walking distance that had a lot of food and shops. Lupe was also super nice and responsive. Thank you!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay in Lupe's apartment in Kauai. Communication was easy and we received a lot of information before arrival, therefore, check in and check out went very smoothly. The apartment was very clean, and although the kitchen is not so big (exactly as shown on the pictures) we found everything we needed to prepare breakfast and snacks. The apartment is part of a very well kept condo with beautiful gardens and an own beach access, so it is literally 1 min away from the pool and the sea. There is a big parking lot and a small shopping center with some restaurants and a supermarket in direct vicinity. We really enjoyed our stay here and would love to come back one day :) Thank you for hosting us Lupe!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would 100% recommend. A central location to everything! Beach, restaurants and little shops. We had a great visit and would would absolutely stay here again :)"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It is a real paradise here! I recommend 100%!
Thank you,
Alex and Audrey"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"It was a very pleasant stay at Lupe's condo. Kapaʻa is quite nice located, in the middle of the island, so you drive as long to the one side as to the other. Also the location at the beach offered lovely views and the resort itself was very tidy as well. The condo itself was very clean, and the furniture was very descent, within the little kitchen you will find all you need if you're not feeling for having a dinner outside at a restaurant. Lupe was very responsive and very helpful if you needed her, although she is not on the island. All in all, we would choose Lupe's condo anytime again, when we return to the island of Kauai."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"great location, very nice apartment, I would recommend it!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying at Lupe’s place. The room was clean and ready for us when we got there. It’s tucked behind a cute outdoor shopping center and has a great coffee shop Imura steps from the parking lot. The location was central on the island which made it convenient! Lupe was easy to communicate with and responded quickly. Beds were comfortable and hotel staff was helpful with any questions about the property. The property is on the beach so you can walk there for sunrise. Would definitely stay again.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Apartment was super beautiful, at beautiful place with a lots of shops around.
I will definitely come back!:)"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay here. The location was perfect, very convenient. Close to stores and restaurants. The linen and towels were clean. They provided lots of amenities to meet our needs. Would definitely stay again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Solid location.
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Location was good and place was nice. Only issue was the mattress needs to be replaced.
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"We enjoyed our stay in this little house. The bed was comfortable and indoor and outdoor furniture worked well for us. That being said, there was a fair amount of traffic noise at times, and we had trouble with the TV and dishwasher controls. The local restaurants were great and we liked the short walk to the beach."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was perfectly located on the island! It was walking distance to the beach, a market, shops, and restaurants…but it also felt super secluded bc of the landscaping. It’s an older house so some items are dated, but it’s full of charm and extremely clean. I would definitely stay there again.
Ps. It can obviously get humid/hot in the house bc of the climate, but the little ac units will freeze you out!! We left them off 90% of the time and only turned them on for a bit before bed."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful little place to stay and experience all of Kauai!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Wow what a beautiful cozy house to stay in. It was very clean comfortable and had absolutely everything needed.
The location is perfect. Walk to the beach, walk to great food and drinks."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My wife, 16 month old and I stayed here for a week and it was absolutely wonderful. Because of having our little one, we did rent a car (Enterprise); however, it was only about a 10 minute drive from the Lihue Airport so that was nice and convenient. The self check-in instructions were very clear and the house was easily accessible. The pictures on AirBnB accurately represent the cottage 100% and everything the host(s) provide is a plus. We found ourselves going to the Lava Lava Club a lot since it is not only beachfront but there’s a large grassy area where our daughter could run around. More friendly family places include Salt Pond Beach, Poipu Beach (West side) and Lae Nani Beach (5 minute walk). Go to Poipu Beach after sunset to watch the sea turtles come up on the sand. There’s a playground there which is also a plus. Salt Pond and Lae Nani have areas enclosed by rock so small kids can enjoy the water. Coconut marketplace has some great stores and Hukilau Lanai is a great dinner."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The place was very good. Could have had better linens, bath towels, pillows and beach towels. Otherwise-great location and quiet. Good time 🍾"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay here. The rental unit met our needs and expectations. It was nice to be able to easily walk to shops, restaurants, and the beach."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This place was our haven during our few days stay in Kauai. It is clean, organized, and clutter-free. Grocery store, shops, and restaurants are of walking distance. The beach, especially, is only 5mins away. This lovely house felt like home and it had basically what we needed. We could not ask for more. Naomi communicated very well, responded quickly, and helped us a lot during our trip. We have enjoyed our stay here very much and we would definitely come back."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location was great, easy to get to food trucks, the beach and the river!!"
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at this property for a few nights on our vacation to Kauai.
Pros:
-Central location if driving and exploring
-easy check-in
-decent wi-fi with smart TV for nights after long days
-marketplace close by
Cons:
-dated
-bed and pillows uncomfortable, we didn’t sleep well
-shower could use an update (even maybe just a better shower head?)
-beach chairs and umbrella were awesome to have!!!
The beach that is walkable isn’t the best for swimming however we did walk there for the sunrise a couple times. Walking distance to the local market with groceries and deli, shaved ice, bars, and restaurants.
Our stay here was just fine. However, given the price and the second half of our trip it’s much more comfortable to stay at one of the 4* local resorts just for the bed and shower alone."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place great location!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and place to stay! Would recommend.
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice house close to the beach and easily accessible by car. Now and then some noise on the streets you notice
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a lovely place and nice to be about a block walk from the ocean. Everything one could need was in the cottage - extra fans, coolers, beach chairs, snorkels - and some basic kitchen supplies. I wouldn't call it quiet and peaceful but it wasn't too bad considering you were in a combination residential and commercial area. I'd stay again if I went back to Kauai. Kapa'a is a nice midway point for visiting the north and south sides of the island."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Was a cozy spot in a great area! The home was well thought out with helpful amenities (beach chair, snorkeling gear, umbrella, etc). Clean & just what we needed to cruise around the island!"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect size for two and a lot of privacy.
Very peaceful surroundings and a central location."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! Location is great for getting to see all sides of the island! Location is also walking distance from Lava Lava Beach Club (great drinks), a shopping center, Passion Bakery Cafe, and many more! The beach equipment was so nice to have, and the host even let us access it a little bit before check in, while we were killing time to check in. The cottage it self was great and just as described. And the AC works well. It felt a little private with the tress too beside the proximity to the shared unit. Overall great stay and we would probably stay here again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great place to stay on the east side of Kauai! Close to the beach, within walking distance to some good restaurants, and convenient for the things we planned for the first half of our stay on Kauai. We felt like we had our own little Hawaiian cottage while we were here! Would definitely recommend to others and would stay here again. ALOHA and MAHALO!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful cottage. Everything we needed is there.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Evolve was awesome. A block away from the beach and super cozy. They have every utensil and beach gear you can think of. 10/10
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had such a great experience and this property was clean, perfect location (right in middle of North and South Shores), and was so private and peaceful. It had everything we needed for a great trip and would stay here over and over again :)"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect location, truly felt secluded and tropical. Yet it was a quick walk from a gorgeous beach and places to eat and explore."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautifully decorated and peaceful bungalow. Such a zen vibe, clean, flexible and super comfortable. We totally recommend this!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We loved our stay in Kapa’a. The location was awesome, the home is comfortable and peaceful and to boot the decor is thoughtful and unique. We enjoyed the walkability to the beach and farmer’s markets on Tuesday and Thursday morning/afternoons. We felt so at home and enjoyed cooking our own meals due to the full kitchen. We can’t wait to come back and feel so fortunate to have stayed at this AirBnB. Loved it."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great getaway! Amenities were top notch and the AC was a huge plus! Convenient location and would highly recommend.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"great little spot for a quick getaway! Easy Uber to & from the airport. Short walks to find coffee, bars & restaurants, and beaches. Private & secluded for the times you want to spend to yourself. Definitely recommend for solo travelers and couples!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This residence was everything advertised and more. We had an excellent stay and would recommend it!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"great little spot, near everything"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful! This cottage was the perfect size, location, and everything. It was so close to the beach, but was tucked away in trees that made it feel cozy and completely private. The air conditioning was a major factor in the comfortability of our stay. Would recommend this place 1000%."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We were celebrating our 20th Anniversary! This place was AMAZING! We almost didn't get the dates we wanted but they opened just in time. There was nothing ""bad"" that stuck out with this spot. We used the extra amenities. I couldn't imagine not having A/C like other places posted. This place was extraordinary in more ways than one. Thank you and we will be back here to stay."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,No problems. We were happy to be there and nice central location.
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, very walkable to beach, and very quite and private. a great, private alternative to the nearby timeshare type rental properties. The unit was definitely dated and not particularly clean, but was good chill vacation rental. Again, very good location."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A beautifully decorated, relaxing beach cabin. Open the windows, put on some tunes and feel the ocean breeze flow through this comfortable oasis. We were grateful for such a unique space amongst the condo complexes and hotels."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little place
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean and cozy spot. The cottage is perfect for one or two people and is stocked with all the necessary tools and amenities for an enjoyable stay. The 5 min walk to the beach was the best part!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,lovely and secluded but also close to everything.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jenn made the booking casual and headache-free. The place was clean and peaceful. Highly recommend.
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Flexible check in and clean/well thought place
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home is perfect, very confortable and well situated. Very quiete.
Thank you very much !"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I almost want this place to remain a secret because it’s truly so lovely. The home itself is beautiful and well decorated. It’s clean and comfortable and had everything we could need for our stay. We walked to the beach behind the property and wow, it’s not popular at all online but I swear it’s the best beach! My partner and I really enjoyed our stay here and I could definitely see my family renting the other cottage on the property too. The outdoor shower is convenient for hosing off after the beach and there’s a bbq and shaded hut/cabana(?) outside. The only part that I’m iffy about is the very expensive cleaning fee and still having to take out the trash/clean up but for us, but it seems to be common with airbnbs nowadays. Thanks for opening up this place to us! We had a lovely stay."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the private stay
Great time in the comfy cottage"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were looking for a nice place in Kauai that wasn't a condo, and this was perfect.
Clean, cute, convenient, professionally managed, easy to find, near to a commercial area with a few restaurants and shops."
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage is adorable and in a great location. It’s literally across the street from shopping and restaurants. It’s also super clean and the hosts are responsive and nice. My one compliant would be the cleaning fee plus the check out instructions and requirements. $250 is a pretty high cleaning fee relative to other airbnbs we stayed at on Kauai that were bigger than this one. We knew about that upon booking so can’t complain. However, you pay that then have to do a decent amount of cleaning yourself upon check out (take out trash, clean dishes, strip beds, etc).
I’d still recommend this Airbnb with that caveat/warning."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This bungalow was perfect and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay in the Kapa'a area. I wish it had been available to rent the entire stay but glad we had the chance to visit for a few days. Perfect porch, and minutes walking distance to restaurants, bars, coffee shops and the ocean with the feeling of being at home."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Fabulous all the way around 🤙
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything we could want for cooking, for the beach, it was comfortable, clean. We LOVED it. Our second stay/leg of our vacation in princeville was severely disappointing compared to this gem!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfectly located to the beach, restaurants, and shopping"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute little place right in Kapa'a. Nice stay
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"An amazing stay! Great location, lovely space, lots of privacy and just a short walk to the beach. Would definitely recommend and stay again."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This lovely cottage was exactly what we wanted--cute, convenient, clean, and romantic. There is a bit of street noise but it was super walkalble to the market, shops, and beach and a convenient location to explore the island from. We loved our stay and would absolutely stay again."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic little home for a great price. There is plenty of parking as well.
2022-03-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Fun location near to great beaches. House was good location for food and just about anything. If you don’t like waking up surrounded by cockroaches then this place is not for you - and the ac does not operate
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable house in perfect location.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a such a cute cottage! We loved staying here, and it was a great spot for a romantic getaway. I was so happy that we weren't in a generic condo. It's one block from the beach, with lots of beach gear, towels, etc., available for your use. The cabin has lots of little amenities tucked away in closets and cupboards. There's a binder with a lot of useful information, and they left out a welcome snack for us. There's a shopping center across the street with restaurants, boutiques, ABC Store, etc. The bed is comfy, and I didn't feel like we were missing anything.
Cons: I do feel like the cleaning fees are very high, and we definitely saw a few cockroaches, but that's pretty typical for Hawai'i. All in all, we had a really beautiful stay."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great location, well appointed and clean. Bed was comfy and we made great use of the beach coolers and games provided. Would totally recommend this place."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, right next to the beach."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little place. Close to shops, restaurants and the beach. We loved it! We would book again."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the little bungalow. It was tucked in at the end of a street, set in the trees. It was quite rainy when we were there and we appreciated having a cozy little place to hunker down. The place has everything we needed for a comfortable stay. The location in Kapaa was convenient to stroll to the beach. The traffic in Kapaa is not a joke (maybe that is just seasonal?) and would get pretty choked when we were there."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,the house is in perfect location. few minutes walk to the beach and stores and restaurants. the house was clean and welcoming. loved the welcome snacks! would definitely recommend and we will surely come back

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great location with all the extras! The outdoor shower, washer/dryer, and outside seating area was everything we needed to wind down and recharge from our busy lives.
The book with all the thoughtful recommendations was great! When we come back, we will definitely be staying here!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Absolutely Perfect!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"With our first stay in Kaua’i, Kaz made our experience as smooth and accommodating as possible. We absolutely loved this place, from the full kitchen to the outdoor balcony, and most importantly, it being minutes away from the water and local shops. 10/10 would definitely book again!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay. It was for my birthday and kaz went out of their way to leave me a bottle of champagne and wrote on a chalk board “happy birthday Lilly and welcome!” It was an awe drone trip.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was lovely and the location so convenient!! Try Collab Cafe down the street 😊 Only complaint was that the fridge smelled really strongly of fish, but I'm sure that was a previous tenant's fault, not the owner's."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really nice and clean appartment. the Bed ist so comfortable and everything was so clean. We would love to come back. Thanks!

The apartment matches the description and the host was a pleasure to work with. you have a parking spot, two minute walk to a quiet section of the beach, and across the street from stores and restaurants. I'd stay here again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"If you are visiting the island, this is the best location to stay at in my opinion. It puts you right in the center of the island and gives you the time to explore the whole island. It is also surrounded by amenities like Safeway and tasty restaurants within walking distance.
Regarding the unit itself, it was very charming, clean and comfortable. The biggest thing that stood out to me was how proactive and responsive Kaz was. His list of things to do helped us plan out most of our trip. I highly recommend staying here if you are visit. I know we will when we come back!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I would stay here again for sure!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kaz was so helpful during our planning of our trip. He communicated quickly and was very helpful regarding advice of activities to do around the island. His home was a short drive from airport, great location. Quiet and safe area. Everything in his house was comfortable and clean. We really felt relaxed during our stay. I would definitely stay at Kaz home again."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was comfortable and location was convenient so we were able to explore both the north and south sides of the island.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It’s super clean room and convenient area and I can go to the beach in 1 minute

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We loved staying at Kaz's condo. The place was quiet, spotless, nicely decorated, and conveniently came with extras for the beach (umbrella, cooler, chairs, and boogie boards). We liked being on the third floor but if you have mobility issues, keep that in mind. The condo offers easy access to the beachfront path in either direction -- into town or to the Coconut Marketplace -- and it makes a great east island base for exploring. Nothing is too far away.
Pay attention to Kaz's directions for finding the driveway entry off the main road. The first time it snuck up on us, but once you get the hang of it, it's easy. And superbly easy access to the airport when you leave.
The only thing missing for us was a toaster. We would stay again."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed our stay at Kaz's place. The location is very good between the north and south shores. The condo was very comfortable and clean with an excellent usable kitchen, sitting room and bedroom."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Location was great! Walkable to Safeway, a super quiet beach (which felt private), and right between the south and north parts of island. Made exploring all of Kauai very easy! Kaz provided a super excellent list of recommendations well in advance, giving us an opportunity to make any reservations if we wanted."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying at Kaz's place! The apartment was very clean and in a convenient area. Kaz was a great host and we will definitely be back!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay at Kaz’s place! Great location & just as described! We will be back! Great communication & recommendations!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,I can’t say enough about this place and the host. Wow it was an amazing stay. We felt right at home the unit was equipped with everything we needed. It was super clean and cozy. The sunrise views from the beach were breathtaking. There are restaurants and stores right across the street and in walking distant. The locality of this unit is fantastic and close to activities and popular sights. The host checked in with us several times to make sure we were comfortable and didn’t need anything. Which was very nice. Kaz is awesome and by far the best host EVER. We are already planning our next visit and will only stay here… Kaz’s place is definitely a gem!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I really enjoyed our stay with Kaz. Our Airbnb was conveniently located in Kapaa and was within walking distance to a grocery store, Starbucks and eateries. Our room was clean and well stocked.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to stay to check out the island! Centrally located and walkable to so many great food spots. Kaz was a great host, would highly
recommend staying here!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kapaa was the perfect location for us. We wanted to do activities all around the island, so being centrally located was ideal for us. There are lots of restaurants nearby, and the grocery store. Easy parking, nice pool/Mountain View, and just steps from the ocean to watch the sunrise. This beach is way too rocky for swimming or anything though, so having a car to get around to other beaches is needed.
The condo was perfect for two people. The a/c was so nice to have. Absolutely would stay here again. Thank you Kaz."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! Great communication! Would definitely stay again. Thanks, Kaz!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a great time at Kaz's place. It was a beautiful home away from home. Kaz was super helpful and responsive. The apartment is super clean and chic, with all the modern amenities. This was a wonderful central location--which made it super convenient traveling to the North Shore or West Shore. There is also a ton to explore in Kapaa. You can't beat the location--a stone's throw to the beach, local restaurants, and local hikes--and not to mention a very convenient Ross/Safeway right across the street should you have forgotten anything. I have so many good memories to last a lifetime."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kaz’ place was exactly what my fiancée and I needed for our first trip to Kauai. Centrally located, and easy to get to. Kaz is very friendly and super quick to respond.
If you are looking to do a lot of outdoor activities like hiking and kayaking, this is a great option, as opposed to paying more to stay at a resort where you won’t use the amenities much."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kaz was an excellent host! He provided great food recommendations too, highly recommend this place."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was such a great stay! The condo is very spacious and clean. Kaz was a great host. I definitely recommend this Airbnb!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kaz is an excellent host, very kind and very quick to respond. Before he left, he gave us directions on what to do and see in Kauai, and this was very helpful. The apartment is delicious, there is really everything you need, including bath towels, portable fridge, beach chairs, air conditioning, smart TV with a Netflix channel reserved for guests. The kitchen is very well-stocked and this allowed us to prepare excellent dinners that we consumed on the terrace (equipped with table and chairs). The house was really clean and tidy, very comfortable bed. The location is also very convenient, very close to the sea and shopping malls and restaurants. There's no washing machine, but Kaz gave us the address of a very close paid laundry and also provided us with the detergent (which was in the house). We couldn't ask for better. We definitely recommend this place and this host. Thanks Kaz"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice itinerary and environment. The house is very close to the beach. It is a 2-minute walk from the beach. The house is very clean and cozy. There is also a supermarket around. It is good value for money. I like it here.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first time in Kauai and we hit the jackpot with this Airbnb. Super convenient location – it was easy to get to places. The nearby beach walk was a big highlight for us. Just a short walk and you're right there with the sand and waves. Plus, we could easily walk around the area to check out local spots.
The place itself had everything we needed. Felt like a home away from home. If you're thinking of visiting Kauai, I'd definitely suggest checking out this spot.
Thanks for a great trip! We'd love to come back."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great are of the island between the north and south shore. Glad we stayed in kappa.

Will definitely be looking to stay here again for my next visit to Kauai! 5/5"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great place for the right price and centrally located! Kaz has thought of everything: beach chairs, umbrella, cooler and boogie boards are available for use, a guidebook is there for research, and the kitchen is well stocked with tools and supplies. The whole place is so clean and comfortable. Such a relaxing home base!
We chose Kaz's place for the location and easy access to both the north and south parts of the island. What we were pleasantly surprised to learn is that Kapa'a itself is so lovely!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We've only spent 3 days in Kauai and therefore in Kaz's accommodation, but we really enjoyed every second of it. Kaz provided us with excellent recommendations ahead of arrival and the apartment was very clean and comfortable. We would definitely recommend staying there for your visit in Kauai."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We had a lovely stay in this condo in Kapaa. The host was very helpful with providing recommendations and flexible with checkout time. We would happily stay again!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were grateful to be able to stay in a clean, friendly and cool house with Kaz. Everything was the same as the pictures provided in advance, the house was so clean, and the blankets and towels smelled good, so I was happy. The pool was always quiet and we were able to get to Safeway, Starbucks and ice cream shops across the street comfortably. In addition, Kaz was kind and answered promptly every time I asked a question, so I was very relieved from an overseas traveler's point of view. Thank you so much. I hope to come back someday"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Being in Kauai for the first time, Kaz’s place was the perfect fit for us. Kaz is a great host and a heartwarming person, she responded very quickly, provided us with good local tips and helped me to connect with a local lei artist. I can’t thank her enough for this <3
The apartment is a few minutes walking distance from the beach and various places to eat. We loved the Furikake fries from Kenji’s and Wailua Shave Ice. Besides the perfect location, the stay at Kaz’s place was awesome! We enjoyed the balcony for breakfasts and lunches with the view on the pool. The perfect vibe, enough amenities for everything. A perfect stay which we hope to be able to repeat in the VERY near future."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay in Kauai at this place. Kapaa is centrally located, can get to Princeville and Waimea within an hour. The Airbnb has all the beach supplies. We made good use of the boogey board, chairs, towels and the umbrella. Highly recommend staying here."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The condo was perfect for my bf and I celebrating a birthday get away. The condo was super cute with the doors opening up to the living room. They had beach chairs and an umbrella which was perfect for our beach day. Kaz was also very responsive and easy to work with. Wish we had spent another couple of days there. Would definitely go back again!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect location if you’re looking to be centrally located. We loved having this as our home base to explore both sides of the island.

Kaz provided an awesome list of recommendations around the island."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place and great location. Highly recommend
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kaz ‘s place was a perfect home base for the 2 of us. We needed a place to stay while exploring the island. It was centralized and within 30-45 mins from all the places/beaches we visited. Kaz was very helpful with recommendations and responsive prior to our trip. We didn’t really need anything else while we were there. It would have been nice to have access to the washer and dryer as we were beach bums and needed to wash and dry our stuff at the end of the each day. Also, a nice set of lightweight beach chairs and umbrella would have been a plus as well."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely home. Kaz has thought of everything. Really enjoyed my time here. I recommend walking up to Kapa'a town to enjoy the food trucks and nice shops and spending some time at the beach if you're looking for a chill day near the Accomodation while on Kauai. Thanks Kaz!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at Kaz’s place a lot! It was beautiful and really clean. He was a great host. He gave us a bunch of suggestions around the island and was very responsive. Would definitely stay here again whenever I visit Kauai again!

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"All good things to say! Convenient location right by the beach and well positioned on the island (easy to drive from airport and then go north or south). Exactly what we needed: a comfortable bed, full kitchen, chill balcony, easy parking. It was clean and pleasant. Kaz was super responsive but we didn’t need much. Perfect for a couple. I say book it, arrive, and then just drop your stuff and go enjoy the island! :)"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super convenient spot for getting around the island. Lots of restaurants close by

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kaz's place was clean & comfortable, her suggestions for activities, destinations, and restaurants helped us have a great time. The condo is a great in-between spot to head north or south, and the ocean is a building away (very little sand fyi). Stores and restaurants within walking distance (may be faster than to drive in traffic haha). We left by 8am to head South each day and missed the traffic! It was a wonderful home base!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Look no longer, Kaz’s home is the perfect stay for two. My boyfriend and I stayed for 6 days and the home had everything we needed to cook at home and go to the beach! Beach chair, boards, extra towels provided. Super comfortable king size bed with extra blankets. TV with Netflix, etc. Location is right next to the beach, where we spotted a monk seal on the shore! Recommend to rent a car to explore the island, though Safeway and other stores/restaurants are in walking distance. Kaz was great with communication and even gave recommendations for the island. Thank you and can’t wait to come again!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This condo is a centrally located spot on the Eastside that sets you up for exploring Kauai in all directions.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Extremely easy check-in, accommodating host and a great centralized location in Kapaa. For those who have never been to Kauai before, it’s important to note that there isn’t a road that goes all the way around the island so being in a centralized location was so helpful to be able to explore the beauty of Kauai!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing home. Great location with all conveniences within walking distance, a lot of really nice restaurants, shops.

Location couldn’t be more perfect, it’s literally a few steps away from the ocean as advertised! The two pools are clean and not busy at all. Supermarket, laundromat and bars and restaurants are within walking distance and getting in and out of Kapa’a to explore Kaua’i is super easy. To top it all, Kaz is a fantastic host!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kaz Airbnb was super cozy and cute. It was the exact kind of Airbnb we were looking for. It’s close to all the necessary stores and it’s just 10 min to the airport! The location can’t be any more convenient.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful clean comfortable modern place. Fabulous central location. Supermarket and restaurants across the street. And Kaz is an absolutely amazing host. Super easy communication. Lots of great tips for restaurants and places to visit and explore. We had a wonderful time :)
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place and very good location
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kaz location was great! The place had everything you needed for cooking with a grocery store right across the street as well. Just steps to the beach and a happy hour restaurant next door was a bonus. Distant to the north and south shore was perfect.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute place in Kapa’a! Good location for getting into town or driving to see other parts of the island!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great place, great location. Would definitely visit again."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kaz’s place was exactly as described and conveniently located near many shops and restaurants (many of which are walkable). Would recommend if you are trying to stay in Kapa’a.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The unit is perfect for a couple or mom & kiddo!! King size bed was comfy and there was plenty of space for me & my 6 year old. We loved eating on the balcony. The complex has two (non-heated) pools, a ping pong table, 2 bbqs, and is right on the beach. Having a parking spot was great too."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely apartment, everything we needed and a great location. Full kitchen and even a water filter which was so handy. No need for an alarm clock, the roosters made sure we were up for sunrise everyday haha. Kapaa is a great location and Kaz's apartment great value. Thanks so much!"
2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice condo in a convenient, but not romantic location. The photos are a bit deceptive as there is no view of the ocean from this unit. Ocean view photo is taken from a different unit in the adjacent building. Otherwise a good spot and good value."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kaz’s place was exactly what the pictures looked like and he was great at communicating. The airbnb was clean and comfortable to stay in. I really enjoyed my stay here!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a lovely stay here! Highly recommend.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place to stay. It’s close to amenities and it’s super comfortable. Kaz is a great host and was fantastic at communicating. 100% recommend!!
2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice location with pool!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kaz is such an amazing host. The home is really nice and suitable for someone who wants to be cozy and also have access to beach and shopping.
Kaz is so easy to communicate with and she checks with you frequently to ensure everything is going well.
The condo is very clean, has a nice balcony and great kitchen , living and a great size bedroom.
I really enjoyed my stay here and recommend this place."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,One of my best Airbnb experiences!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It's a lovely place to stay. The location is very convenient. I'm impressed by Kaz's attention to detail in the home and their hospitality. Thank you for having us.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect location to many things and a great/safe home base for our trip. Kaz was beyond helpful with recommendations and communication. I cannot recommend this place enough! We hope to be back!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot, very clean and comfy."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and access to the beach. The unit looked brand new and had nice decor. Also, the unit came with alot amenities and supplies needed for your stay."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kaz was a great host who communicates quite well. The photos accurately depict the condo and the condo was very clean. The location is great, both in terms of being central to driving to the various coasts and being a <5min walk to Safeway and several restaurants."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay location central to many beaches and commodities awesome owners very communicative 10/10
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great centralized location with designated parking space. This place is 10 minutes from the airport and there is a Safeway literally across the street. Kaz keeps the unit very clean and well stocked with towels for both showering and the beach. Pre-stay communication and during the stay were excellent. We would definitely recommend staying here.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location for a sunrise run down some beach paths with excellent happy hour deals across the street.
2021-10-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is definitely on the smaller side but it was enough for what we needed in our short stay. Think of it as more of a studio. When we first arrived the apartment was not fully clean, specifically the bathroom was not sanitized and the toilet had trace amounts of fecal matter present. The host was a great communicator and we quickly reached a resolution. The next day the apartment was sanitized to Airbnbs cleaning process standards. I also wish the bathroom had a vent while showering however, we opened the window to let out the steam. As long as this place is fully sanitized and deep cleaned prior to a guest arriving, I would recommend it for a couple nights."
2021-10-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Condo is relatively small one-bedroom, located just off the main street. Easy walk to the ocean, but not really much of a beach nearby. Condo itself is older and the building could use an upgrade. It was generally well maintained, but not as modern or as nice as some of the other buildings in the area."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kaz and his team are excellent hosts and the space exceeds expectations. Great location and an exceptional experience all around.
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kaz and Phil were great with communication and gave us many recommendations. Convenient location to go to north or south, right next to Ross and Safeway. You can view the sunrise right on your lanai or at the beach. The inside of the condo is clean and spacious. It has everything we needed for our stay. The only drawback is that the beach behind the condo is not swimmable. Overall, it was a nice stay."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The layout was great, the bed was very comfortable, the bnb had everything we needed. The AC was nice and cold! My only complaint was that the TP rolled under instead of over haha."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Their place was great, perfect location close to the shore and walking distance to many restaurants!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect stay! Beautiful and comfortable condo. Kaz was a great host!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Kaz is a fantastic host and the unit was perfect for me and my son. Kapa’a is my favorite spot in Kauai based on its central between the northern and southern shores. Kaz’s unit had everything we needed for our five-day trip and we cannot wait to come back. Mahalo, Kaz!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home. Nice view and walking distance to stores. Loved my stay.
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was great for our short stay - it comes packed with chocolate macadamia nuts, a couple juices and drinks, boogey boards, snorkel stuff, and extra beach towels. We were also grateful for the air conditioning. Our one qualm was that from the pics the condo looks like it’s beach front, but the actual building is highway side with a view of the second pool (not the first one which is Oceanside). The beach is still just a short walk away behind one of the other condos. This wasn’t a major drawback with the big bed, warm shower, and spacious/well decorated interior. We also found the location to be great - right across from convenient shopping/groceries and some of the best desserts and baked goods on the island."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was amazing! The condo was very clean and host was responsive. The location is very convenient as it was close to the beach and stores. 🤎 Mahalo for welcoming us!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and clean, with all the amenities. Amazing location and super wonderful hosts! We couldn't have asked for a better stay! Thank you so much!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place to stay while visiting Kaui! Room just as pictured! LOVED the private beach access & pool downstairs! Easy 20 min drive from airport & close proximity to other parts of the island! Philip was such an amazing host! Gave us some great tips on where to eat & visit! Definitely will be coming back in the near future :)
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kaz and Phillip were super helpful and the condo was so convenient comfy and like the ad states so close the the beach. It was a wonderful stay!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed at Kaz and Philip’s place for a getaway together and we had a lovely time! The hosts were very responsive and helpful with any questions we had. They gave us recs on places to go and things to do. The location is perfect because it is very central to the island. There is a really nice path right outside the door that follows the shoreline if you like to bike, walk, or run. The condo was just as pictured and described. Well-equipped for making meals at home, which is easy since Safeway is right across the street. I would highly recommend staying here!!!🌺🌊👙☀️🤙🏼"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Clean, great location and extremely friendly host. The condo is so cozy and perfect to return to after a day of exploring or perfect to relax in or by the pool."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"In the heart of Kapaa which happens to be such a central location to the North Shore and the South. This very unassuming little building is just that...just ok from the outside and inside it’s beautiful. The unit is so well appointed. Stylish and functional. This was a workation for me and the WiFi was fantastic for zooming. Then there’s the sweetest host ever, Kaz, who is gracious and kind. The aloha spirit is here. This is the place to plug into the island."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot and great location. Would recommend! Perfect spot for sunrise.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,loved this place. right in the middle of everything. amazing restaurants right across the street and a safeway. water pressure is absolutely amazing. place was clean and the a/c worked very well. place was a dream.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"To be completely honest, the building complex itself kind of resembles a motel but don’t let that fool you, this one bedroom condo is fantastic. The interior was super nice and felt very modern, clean, and comfortable. We really appreciated the extra amenities such as coolers, beach mats, and chairs. We also loved the Airbnb’s central location on the island allowing us easy access for exploring both the north and south shores. Prior to our arrival Kaz also offered great recommendations on things to do and places to eat in the area. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kaz’s place was absolutely perfect. Located centrally in Kapa’a and has everything you could think of for an Airbnb. We had to book late and Kaz responded immediately and accommodated us quickly.
Amazing hospitality! Kaz is beyond a superhost. We’ll be back. Thank you again!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My stay here was absolutely perfect! Kaz was very easy to communicate with and made my stay here on Kaua’i a breeze. Her place is wonderful and filled with everything and more! A home away from home for sure. I will be booking here again in the near future:)
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. We stayed in the middle of a hurricane, and Kaz was great with communication, caring and understanding. Condo is clean and had all the essentials and more. We will be back!"
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Kaz is so amazing. Communication was at a 100!!!! We will definitely stay there again next time we are on the island of Kauai!!!
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Amazing location, super clean and very responsive hosts! We’d come back again!"
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kaz’s place is in a great location, very clean with nice size rooms. We really enjoyed our stay here!!"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great stay and we would book it again on a future trip. The apartment was easy to find, in a great location, with shopping centre and eateries right opposite, plus it was an ocean side location with garden and pool, and was clean and super well-equipped and comfortable- the bed in particular after an overnight flight was so comfy and lovely. And Kaz was really quick to respond and friendly and accomodating. Thank you.."
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing. Perfect location, everything you need in a holiday stay. We had a great time!"
2020-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,If your looking for a nice clean and homey place to stay while on vacation Kaz has the place and location.
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome space--modern, very clean, personal/homey and centrally located, especially if you want to explore both the north and south coasts. It is also close to many great restaurants in Kapa'a. Kaz provides everything you might need--including coffee and great info pre-arrival. It is quiet and perfect for a couple's getaway. I just wish we had more time!"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay! Clean and stylish. Location is perfect to shops and the airport. Will recommend to anyone who travels to hawaii!
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spot right in Kapaa. Walking distance to shops and restaurants! Easy check in as well.
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Kaz's place is perfectly located for those looking to enjoy as much of the island as possible. It is centrally located making either side of the island a reasonably short drive away.
We did a lot of our own cooking and found the kitchen to be very well stocked, we did not want for anything.
The apartment was very clean and organized. The bedroom was very comfortable.
The beach is truly only steps away, we even saw several whales from shore. We really appreciated the snorkeling gear and beach chairs supplied.
Downtown Kapa'a was a great place to walk around with many cool restaurants, cafes and shops.
We would definitely stay here again, and highly recommend!"
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great central location for people trying to explore all sides of the island. Walking distance from a grocery store and great dinner spots was a hit.
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great condo! Location is convenient and the place is beautiful and clean.
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kaz’s place is beautiful and cozy!! The location is great, walking distance to stores and restaurants.
Very clean and beautifully decorated, it felt like home 🏡"
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a great time staying at Kaz's condo in Kapa'a. The room was very clean, nice, and contemporary. It had all the amenities that we needed, and the location is a good middle ground for visiting the north and south sides of the island. There are also two supermarkets across the street which was a nice plus. Kaz was a very responsive and helpful host, she gave us many great recommendations for activities to do around the area and answered all of our questions promptly. We would definitely recommend staying here!"
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our time at Kaz's lovely home. The condo was exactly as described and fit our needs perfectly. The kitchen was well appointed and the location was within walking distance of the beach, restaurants, and grocery stores. We enjoyed breakfasts on the lanai each morning and had a wonderful time."
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem! This place is perfect. It’s stylishly decorated, easy to find, and has so many things you might need in an air bnb like coffee filters and olive oil. The condo is right across the street from a Ross and a Safeway if you need anything. It’s in a quiet complex and we had no trouble crashing after very active days.
Kaz had so many tips and was very responsive to annoying tourist questions.
The only heads up for future dwellers has nothing to do with the actual place but the traffic in the area. While this is a very good location to access both north and west of island, it took us 50+ minutes some of the days if you had to go through Lihue. Do give yourself ample time if you actually have to be somewhere like airport or a tour.
Kauai was magical and this place helped! I’d definitely come back and book this same location again if available."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice place, very clean and well kept. Absolutely spot in as advertised and Kaz kept in constant contact to make sure we were comfortable! Excellent host!"
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Incredible condo located near grocery stores and downtown Kapaa which is the quintessential charming Hawaiian town! Perfectly centrally located between the north and south end of the island. Kaz was a phenomenal host and provided outstanding recommendations for activities! Hands down the best and most informative Airbnb host I have ever been experienced.
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay at Kaz's place in Kauai!
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Kaz's place is perfect if you want to stay close to the beach and plan to explore all parts of the island! It's very convenient being equal distance to the north and south parts of the island, and so very close to the airport. The place was very clean and stocked with great kitchen/household supplies. The AC worked wonders and was definitely needed! We would stay here again in a heartbeat :)"
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I am so glad that I had the pleasure of staying at Kaz’s place!! My experience exceeded all my expectations. The space was impeccably clean; beautifully, tastefully, and lovingly decorated; filled with a fully stocked kitchen (even with a full set of nice Tupperware for storing leftovers!); so convenient to Kapaa and the beach. Another highlight of my stay was all of my correspondences with Kaz. She was so warm, thorough, conscientious, quick, and made sure all my questions were answered and that I was well taken care of. I can’t wait to come back and stay here again! 😍"
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location to stay and walk from that point
The apartment is very nice and cozy
I recommend it 100%.
It also has parking!"
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was great
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Lovely condo. Comfy bed. Super communication with Kaz who provided great tips to enjoy our stay. We didn’t have a view on the ocean. But besides that the condo was really enjoyable. We liked being on the last floor with no neighbors stepping loudly above. The location is convenient even though not in the old town center. But you can walk for groceries, restaurants, bars,... overall great Airbnb experience :)"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, comfy, quiet and clean! Not a speck of dust anywhere!!The bed is comfortable, the air conditioner is strong but the ceiling fans are a nice feature as well. The assigned parking is an added bonus. Kaz quickly responded before, during and after my stay. Click to book, you won’t regret staying here!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Just as described, very clean, great area. Would book again at any time."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kaz's place was perfect. It was incredibly comfortable, clean, and convenient. Felt like home. She has practically everything you need. The kitchen is fully equipped. Even beach chairs and beach bag. The location is excellent, right in the center of Kapa'a. (Kapa'a is a great base location if you want to explore the island). There is a small shopping center a block away, so it's easy to pick up whatever you need. And almost anything else you need within a few minutes drive, including some great restaurants. Kaz responded to any messages very quickly, which was appreciated. I highly recommend her place and would definitely stay there again next time I go to Kauai."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location with plenty of amenities close by and walking distance. Darling condo, very quaint. It was a perfect space for my husband and me to spend 4 nights while exploring the island."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kaz’s place was awesome. Kapa’a is a great location in general to stay if its your 1st time in Kauai. I would highly recommend this Airbnb.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, lots of amenities, quiet, and Kaz was a great host.
Good communication as well as good location. Definitely worth it. The only thing I’d keep in mind is that it’s on the 3rd floor. If anyone in your party has mobility issues, it may be a challenge getting to the unit. Stairs only, no elevators. Aside from that, 5 stars in my book."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing location. Kaz’s place is perfectly situated in Kapaa. She was very helpful with recommendations for the local area, which made our trip so much better! 10/10 would stay again!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place to stay! Has food and shopping and a beach all in walking distance.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Kaz's place is in a great location on the island of Kauai. It is right in the middle of the island making it an easy drive to see the North, South, and West. Her place was extremely clean and provided all amenities for a relaxing and comfortable stay. She provides great tips for things to do and places to eat upon arrival. Would recommend her place to any guests staying in Kauai."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great air bnb experience! It was my husband and I’s first trip to Hawaii and kaz helped us out so much! This place is a 2 minute walk to the beach, perfect to see sunsets and sunrises, located in a primo spot of the Island easily accessible to all tourist activities! Kaz’s place itself is immaculate- super clean, stylish and great amenities- nothing short of a 4-5 star hotel! she has been a great host and explained the Island and activities before our arrival- this made looking for activities to do super easy ! Her response time is quick and efficient! Will definitely be returning to this Airbnb next time we’re on the island!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kaz's place exceeded our expectations! It was sparkling clean, stylishly decorated, and had everything we could possible need for an enjoyable stay. We felt like we were at home; there is nothing better when you are on vacation! The kitchen was well-equipped (food storage containers, spices, various pots and pans, etc) and the bed was exceptionally comfortable. The air conditioning was a huge bonus as it was rather humid during our stay. Perhaps most importantly, it is ideally located from all major points of interest, making it easy to get to both the north and south shores of Kauai. We loved our stay and cannot recommend Kaz's place enough. She provided several suggestions on activities, etc that proved quite useful during our stay. An excellent value and a wonderful AirB&B experience!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"great location next to the beach, close to shops, absolutely everything is OK, I recommend it to everyone"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Kaz’s place is amazing! Very beautiful and homey. It was a very nice place to finish off our stay on the island. We appreciated the cleanliness and comfort of the home.
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kaz’s place was perfect for what we were looking for. Extremely central location, clean/spacious place, and excellent A/C (critical). Kaz gave great recommendations and we did most of them - highly recommend the nearby bike path. Would definitely stay here again!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay in Kaua’i! It was a great central location to be able to travel to both sides of the islands. She had great amenities, such as sunscreen, aloe and even Tupperware. Super helpful for when we wanted to pack food. Overall, I recommend this place for your stay!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious, well stocked apartment. Kaz gave us lots of great suggestions and recommendations!"
2019-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location for our stay in Kauai! Would definitely recommend!
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Kaz’s place. She gave us lots of tips for things to do in the area and let us check in early since the place was ready, which we really appreciated. Very clean, central location, and had everything we needed. Would definitely stay again!"
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay at Kaz's place in Kapa'a. The self check in was convenient and the place is as described, clean and stylish, and spacious for two people. Having a designated car space was great as was the location of the apartment itself. There are supermarkets and plenty of good restaurants very close by, as well as a laundromat. The A/C was very nice to have. The apartment was a great base to explore all of Kauai from and we would love to come back again! Thanks again and mahalo Kaz!"
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We love staying in Kapaa because the little downtown is charming and it's a great mid point between so many places on the island, so we were happy to find this condo. for our most recent trip. It's in a great location, steps from the ocean. The condo. itself is exactly as pictured - clean, well appointed, and lovely. We saw options in less desirable locations, without full kitchens, with similar rates.
This was a great find and we would stay again. We enjoyed relaxing here in between adventures and walking to the nearby shops and marketplace. We were sad to leave!"
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great Condo! It had everything we needed and is in a perfect location in Kapaa! The bed is super comfortable and the complex is quiet and right on the beach. We loved having the nice sitting area and full kitchen. The balcony overlooks one of the pools but you can't hear anyone with the windows shut. Great value I would recommend this place to anyone!
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place in a wonderful location. Kaz was extremely helpful and responsive! Would definitely stay here again.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,I loved everything about the place. The one thing that could be improved upon was the laundry/towels situation. We were only provided one bath/beach towels each for one week. We had to go to a laundry mat down the street to dry them.
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at this AirBnb! Great location and peaceful atmosphere. The only thing that bummed us was that the advertised free bikes weren’t included with the stay. When reaching out to the host a few times asking for clarification, we sadly didn’t get a response. Otherwise, we received lots of recommendations for things to do on the island!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,David's place was great. The views from the room were beautiful and the guide they put together is full of ideas and places to visit all over the island. I would recommend David's place and I'd be happy to stay again.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a perfect getaway for Kauai. A resort like setting with a wide variety of restaurants and shops walkable from the unit and all the amenities you could hope for on property.
The host was super clear on how to get in and out of the unit, and had plenty of listings of things to do in the area as well as on the island."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Pros - great location, right on the beach, keyless entry(hate needing a key or card), mid-stay cleaning/restocking, attentive hosts
Cons - no washer or dryer(bring enough clothes or be prepared to go up the street about a mile for a laundromat), roosters squawking about 5am until dark(bring a white noise machine), mid-stay cleaning/restocking(not enough towels or toilet paper)"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is about as perfect as it gets for two people on their first trip to Kauai. It’s got close access to the beach, pool and hot tub. There are delicious cocktails and food at Lava Lava Club next door. There’s also plenty of restaurant and shopping options right next door. The grounds are well cared for. There’s a relaxing cove that’s pretty good for snorkeling nearby at Lydgate beach. The location is pretty centralized being on the east part of the island so halfway between the north (Hanalei) and south (Poipu). We explored both but it didn’t take us long to drive to the west side (Waimea and Koke’e). This place is very convenient and allows you to buy some food to cook in as well. Seriously consider staying here!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,A great time
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time staying at David’s. It had everything we needed and it was the perfect location on Kauai. Would stay here again in the future.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location, location, location. The condo was centrally located on the east side of the island and allowed for close exploration of the N, S, and W parts of the island. Close to food, shopping, and the bike path. The condo had everything we needed for the beach. The hot tub was a great end to each night. David was quick to respond, and had a book of great recommendations of local favorites. The A/C didn’t work, although David offer to send someone to fix it, we declined. Bikes were a little rusty."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space was very clean and perfect for my parents to spend their vacation. David was a great host! He provided clear check in instructions, recommendations in the area and was very responsive to anything we needed. Even offered bikes to ride and a mid-stay clean which we appreciated. It had many shops and restaurants within walking distance while maintaining the peaceful resort feel and the short walk to the beach was very convenient. Would absolutely return in the future!"
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"For the same price in Maui we had an amazing villa
Verifying the price of a room at Islander on the beach, it was cheaper
Ask yourself before renting air bnb not always advantageous
All in all, very small but very well located room
Logements three three cher in Kauai"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Would highly recommend staying here. This condo is in walkable distance to the beach, Lava Lava Beach Club, shops, restaurants, bike rental, and more! The condo was very clean, easy to get in with a code, and David had many recommendations for the island. Plus you get a free alarm clock every morning- the roosters (: we had a wonderful honeymoon stay."
2024-02-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"We've stayed in this community many, many times - and always enjoyed it. This visit was sadly, and vastly different. We were excited about the listing! --- the bike rentals, the photos of the furnishings, and overall amenities in the listing. Unfortunately, a lot of what was shown, and listed, was inaccurate. Prior to arrival, David was very hard to reach, and automated messages pointed us to a contact that hasn't worked with him for 7+ months. On arrival, the condo was superficially sound. However, as we settled in, we quickly realized the place wasn't as photographed, the amenities and furnishings weren't as shown, and as a major inconvenience, the AC wasn't working at all! Most of the staple items were expired as well - even the sugar was completely liquified from the heat. We tried reaching the host, and never heard back. We only received several outdated, and automated messages - pointing us to contact people that haven't worked with him since July 2023."
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful grounds, great location. Condo was as described, only con was the bed is very hard and furnishings could have been cleaner."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this unit! David was a great host and always responsive. Very clean and smelled tropical when we walked in with Hawaiian music playing. The bathroom had everything one could need if you had forgotten something. The kitchenette had k cups, sugar, creamer, toaster oven, microwave, refrigerator etc. perfect for our stay. The grounds even have bbq’s at the pool. We loved the prime location next to Lava Lava. We had our coffee on the beach daily and highly recommend this unit for two people! Thank you David for everything. Mahalo."
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,Nice place to stay and enjoy beautiful beaches. It is as advertised.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our first time to Kauai! This place is so charming. Felt right at home. It was clean and quiet. Plenty of places to eat without driving. Loved the sand bar and the walking path! Hoping to be back!!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Blissful Kauai Retreat
Our stay on Kauai was pure magic! The ocean view from the apartment was breathtaking, and having restaurants, bars, and shops within the resort was ultra-convenient. Just a 10-minute drive from the airport made it easy to dive into our island adventure. Parking was a breeze, and the apartment's cleanliness and Hawaii-inspired design created a charming and cozy retreat. The resort staff exuded the aloha spirit, making us feel right at home. In a nutshell, a perfect Hawaiian getaway. Mahalo!

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time here. The location was beautiful, happy hour by the pool was really fun, and the central location worked well for our exploring from Hanalei to Port Arthur and Waimea Canyon. We rode bikes on the oceanfront path and walked to nearby breakfast and dinner spots. Every night we slept with the slider open to hear the ocean and stay cool. While you can see the pool area through the plumeria tree, the condo is private and people honored the quiet hours. We didn't need the AC. David supplies nearly everything you need to enjoy your activities. The only thing missing is a small cooler which is supposed to be there but we didn't see it. We'd definitely stay at David's place again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay- wonderful amenities, walking distance to a lot of restaurants, brewery, activities, and a marketplace! I loved using the pool, hot tub, and walking to the lava lava beach club. David had numerous helpful recommendations- cannot recommend this spot enough!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing setting steps from beach. We loved starting the day out with incredible sunrises. The condo was well stocked with the necessities. Thank you! Highly recommend!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Islander on the beach is an absolute paradise, we spent 4 wonderful days here and absolutely want to come back. The apartment is clean and super cozy, you will experience the best sunrises and sunsets just from your own Balcony, or you can go out a few steps to the beach to watch it there. The apartment has god working AC and a nice Kitchenette. We had unforgettable mornings on the balcony with a cup of coffee. Next to the Islander is the coconut marketplace with lots of shops and restaurants. The convenience store sells sandwiches, salads, bowls and other food that is perfect for a day at the Beach or when you go hiking. Kauai is insane beautiful! The communication with David was easy, he is a nice Host, who wants you to have a perfect holiday in his apartment. I highly recommend to stay in this apartment, I’m sure that we will come back, there is so much to see on the beautiful island. The restaurant at the resort right next to the Islander serves very good and tasty food."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"David's place was cute and has a great view of the water. I will definitely stay here again! David was amazing and gave us local resources and recommendations. Definitely a Awesome host ! Thanks David.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"David me place was super cozy and had all the amenities we needed. It was a great central location to get around the island, and had plenty of good food and market spots close by. The room was exactly what we needed."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay in David’s condo! The room was great with all amenities we needed or wanted and the location was perfect- a short walk from the beach and delicious restaurants.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice little apartment with a good location. Ideal for all activities on the island.
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place for 2 to stay. Loved all the recommendations from David and the extra amenities including snorkeling supplies, beach chairs and a beach bag."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The room was very nice and clean! It had everything we needed to spend a few nights there comfortably. The resort area also has lots to offer. I wouldn't hesitate to book again!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot for resort life with nice pool, hot tub, and beach access. But also a great jumping off point for exploring Kapa’a or other places around Kauai. Request the bikes early on your trip so you can explore the bike trail both north and south directions."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As a fellow super host it is great to stay at a place that cares so much about the quality of their Airbnb. All of the details were as described and then some. I would recommend staying here, and my wife and I hope to return."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Would book again.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay, great location!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"David's apartment is truly a perfect foothold to relax and enjoy the greenery and resort amenities. Comfortable and with a nice view of the ocean. Beach towels and beach chairs are a great plus. All resort amenities, but with the convenience and savings of airbnb."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place and responsive host. There were more kitchen items than expected which was nice. Great view and breeze from the large door.
Was disappointed with the featured free bikes in the photos that were not included. Sounds like they were stolen unfortunately.
Pool and hot tub nearby. Free chairs along the beach. Good food also nearby at the coconut marketplace.
David was very responsive and helped with any questions we had."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My recent stay at Davids Airbnb was beyond expectations. The location was unbeatable, offering breathtaking views and easy access toa many things!Cleanliness and attention to detail were great. Davids's hospitality and thoughtful touches made it feel like a home away from home. Highly recommended for an amazing Kauai experience!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Maybe identify in the instructions that the room is part of a resort? The address doesn’t exactly match up. Islander? Maybe I just didn’t see that part?
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location! Probably best for a couple instead of a family due to the smaller sized units in this complex. David was a great host. Despite a little miscommunication initially, it was rather smooth and prompt thereafter. We were allowed an early check-in! Pool & hot tub were great to relax after a day of convenient adventuring. David was very accommodating to make sure we enjoyed our stay! We would stay here again!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Easy walk to the beach to see the sunrise. Nice pool and hot tub available. Not a very big kitchen area but did it’s job. Said they had bikes on post but we had to ask about them. He did offer to rent some for us but we had been gone for the day and delivery didn’t work out. Love location of this place
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"David’s place was perfect for our visit to Kauai! Loved the location and relaxed vibe of the condo complex, with pool, tiki bar, and gorgeous beach close by. The unit had everything we needed (we didn’t plan to cook anything) and David was very responsive to questions. Can’t wait to return. Thanks, David:)"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place for a Kauai getaway. Great location & tons of walkable shops/restaurants. Beach gear + pool/jacuzzi were an added plus
2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,The location is great with walkable restaurants and shopping very close.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location for a great getaway! David was a great host. We took advantage of his bike rental for the duration of our stay. Two very nice bikes for a great price. We felt like we got the upgraded bike package. The bike trail leaves right form the property and is one of the most beautiful trails you’ll ever find. We did the entire trail twice. David also had great recommendations for most anything you’d like to do.
Thanks for a great stay!"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was in such an amazing location! Central to a lot of our tours and walkable to restaurants and bars. The only down side was figuring out the audio on the tv but the fix is to go to settings > system > restart and it will work! Thank you so much we will definitely be back.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable well equipped Could fall asleep listening to the ocean waves. Great location
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, nice condo, good communication with the hosts. Mahalo David and Jillian!"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"PROS: location, free bikes, beach gear, everything is close, beautiful maintained property, everything you need in small mini kitchen , view of the pool and beach , cute decor and a box of chocolate
CONS: wasn’t like the pictures, shows pure white room but was all colorful , hard generic bed and polyester sheets & bedding, AC barely worked , Neighbor’s up stairs and downstairs are loud , you can hear them walk all day and night above you, dirty carpets that drove me nuts I didn’t even want to walk on them, old stained towels, and only gave me 4 coffee pods for a 7night stay. I didn’t want to ask for more because I had to ask for more towels as you only get 2 because of saving the environment but she took 4.5hrs to get them to me. I didn’t like taking my time to worry when she was finally going to get there. So don’t ask for anything unless you want 20texts about what her day is like."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent!!!!!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"David's place was great and we would definitely stay here again. It is centrally located between the south and north shores. The complex is beautiful and peaceful..quiet and relaxing. The ocean was a little too rough this time of year so we didn't go in but watched the sunrise and sunset a few times right from the beach. There are a few stores/restaurants in the Coconut Marketplace which is a quick walk and plenty of other restaurants at the nearby hotels. The condo was great and had everything you could need...lots of beach items, toiletries, kitchen items. The beach chairs were super nice to take to the beach with us! Would have loved an extra towel or two but that's my only complaint so not really an issue. Loved the ocean breeze and Hawaiian music playing as soon as we walked in."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Location was great… easy walk to the coconut marketplace which had everything from food, drinks, shopping, groceries etc.
Condo was perfect for a small family. Very clean, great view from the balcony and equipped with anything you might need.
Very short walk to the pool or beach.
Host was very responsive to any questions.
Would highly recommended."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The condo was wonderful with a great view. The grounds were neatly kept and beautiful. Centrally located with shops and restaurants close by. Thank you so much for sharing this little piece of heaven
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I LOVE Hawaii and I had a wonderful stay in Kauai due to David and Jillian's hospitality and the location is beautiful. David and Jillian were both proactive and responsive communicators. I found the host guidebook and video was a nice touch and provided some supplemental information to what I gathered from the internet.
The unit was easy to check in, clean, and comfortable containing all that I needed. I was only preparing simple breakfasts in the small kitchenette, but it is well stocked for its size. The unit is in a great location for driving to all attractions and places I wanted to visit on the island, which was from top to bottom. There is a bit of traffic that builds up on the road in that area, but it can be avoided to get to the unit because of an alternative entrance to the road leading to the unit, which is nice."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a fabulous vacation. Location was great, close to good restaurants. It was quiet."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was amazing!
We especially love the Jacuzzi.
Overall David’s place exceeded my expectations. This was my first time booking an Airbnb. All my questions & concerns were answered and they were super helpful!
Overall I highly recommend This place!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful condo in a spectacular location. Loved the place and will definitely return. David and Jillian were excellent communicators and even provided us free bikes during our stay.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was just what I needed for a weekend stay in Kauai. It is well located, with easy access and central to most of the main areas on the island -- you can easily head north or south/west. The bed was comfortable, I had dinner one night on the lanai overlooking the gardens/pool area. I would definitely stay here again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful condo in a great location. Communication was great with David and Jillian and they provided some great suggestions for the area. Would definitely stay here again and highly recommend to others!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great value for the price!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice central location on island. Handy food stores near by within walking distance
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We lived David’s place in Paradise. We had a view of the pool and the ocean. We loved leaving the balcony /lanai door open at night, so we could listen to the ocean. Everything was perfect. Best of all was the location. We went all over the island easily, and we were really close to the airport when it was time to leave. The Coconut Marketplace has a great deli counter. I got prime rib and my husband got ribs, both as carry out that we ate on the lanai!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed David’s (Jillian’s)condo! Perfect location and so convenient to stores as well as a great swimming beach. I would highly recommend this location if you’re planning on visiting Kauai! The provided beach chairs and towels were super helpful for us as well! Thank you!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place in Kapa'a! Would return.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an excellent stay!! The location was absolutely perfect. Very walkable and close to the beach, restaurants, bars, grocery store, etc. David and Jillian were wonderful hosts and very responsive!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Seamless check-in, getting parking pass, and entry to unit. Great view from lanai. Unit was as pictured, did not face the sun and stayed cool. We kept sliding door opened for breeze and overhead fan on, and did not need AC. Beach towels, lounge chairs, etc. available for use. Proactive and good communications. Great location; walked to restaurants and Coconut Market plaza. Enjoyed our holiday getaway. Highly recommend. Mahalo!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"David’s condo was perfect! It was very clean, well equipped with everything you need and the bed was comfortable! We loved the easy access to the beach and the quick access to stores. The location is perfect and central when considering different areas of the island to visit. David had a great guidebook and we used several of his recommendations. We can’t wait to go back!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jillian was responsive and communicative. Great location, centrally located for food and many activities to explore Kauai. Beautiful view from our room, clean and as described with amazing breakfast at Lava Lava restaurant steps away along the beachside path on property. Property is equipped with all you need for your beach day with chairs, umbrella, cooler, boogie boards and snorkel gear...all came in handy!!! Thanks for a perfect stay for our Baby Moon getaway :)"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This unit was spectacular! Where do I start? The unit was clean and the Hawaiian music playing when we walked in just added to everything and reminded me that I am in Hawaii. The unit had everything we needed and even had beach accessories for us to utilize at the beach. Speaking of beach, the view was amazing with the pool and beach right outside our balcony. When I come back to Kauai, I will definitely look to book again."
2022-11-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good location. Lots of options within walking distance for dinner, etc. Unit is hotel room sized. Unfortunately bathroom shower was full of mold and appeared not to have been cleaned in some time. Can’t recommend this unit."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Definitely as advertised. The property has every convince within a short walk. Amazing ocean views.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place and great location! Hosts were very courteous, responsive and informative. Highly recommended."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"TWO WORDS… Welcome Music!
Yes, you read that correctly. In all my times staying in hotels, resorts, vacation homes, etc… I have never stayed in a place and the moment I walk in the room, there is WELCOME MUSIC. That moment there hit me and made me fully realize I was on vacation.
Okay now that is out the way. My time at David & Jill’s place was wonderful.
The communication leading up to the trip, the day of and during was on point. They really made sure that all was going to plan and you felt at ease. Oh and the guides were thought out and very helpful.
Their place was a 10, it fit all my needs. Nothing was over the top or unnecessary. Great location to the beach, literally 50 yards away. Great location to everything on the island, it was ideal.
Would I recommend, depends. If you like a busy location that is lively (just know Kauai is not the party island), no. If you like the county side for peace and quite (lots of roosters), no. But if you like to have best of both worlds but not so much of the cons that come with them. Then I would say YES, I WOULD RECOMMEND!
Looking forward already to my next visit to Kauai. This will be the first place I will book (again), if available."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything about this stay was great! We would love to stay here again in the future!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hosts were great communicators, giving ample suggestions of activities. Room was clean and full of extras. Great location for our stay!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,What a great place to stay! The room was so clean and the hosts were quick to respond to all of our needs. We utilized the kitchen tools so it was so nice to have them. The lanai was a relaxing place to hang out any time of day. We definitely recommend staying here to anyone looking for a getaway in Kauai!
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a nice stay on Kauai at this condo!
The complex is beautifully maintained and situated right on the beach.
This is a great option if you’re looking for fewer kids around - we found it to be much more adult/older crowd than the nearby hotels.
The room is perfectly nice and pretty well stocked with everything you need for a beach vacation.
Hosts were very communicative and helpful throughout our stay!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This place is perfect. Location is awesome. The beach out front is really nice the water is crystal clear. Also, the pool is never crowded and offer a small bar with happy hour. The coconut market place is just a two minute walk and offers everything you could possibly need during your stay. I would stay here again."
2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Location is good to local attractions
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a find! We had an amazing stay and the hosts were excellent! Highly recommend!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location for exploring the island (we hired a car) but also a great spot for just relaxing by the pool or beach (which you can see from the balcony). Walking distance to several good food options too which was great. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at David's on our first trip to Kauai and hope to return soon.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful location, great host and lovely view!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great vacation rental all around
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot!
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"David's place was just as he described. We had blast on this trip mostly in part to reading the guide book David and Allison have put together and picking the activities that suited our style.
Don't hesitate to book this place it is perfectly located to access the whole island."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice spot to check out this side of then island.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect small complex for those not needing all the bells and whistles. The grounds are immaculate. The pool area is small but most people are out touring the island and visiting beaches. The room was small but has everything you could possibly need. David was quick to check on us and gave us a list of favorites.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter and I stayed here for the first half of our trip to Kauai. It was everything that was described, plus charm, ease, and aloha that can't be conveyed, only experienced! David, Jillian, and Allison are exceptional hosts. They went above and beyond to give recommendations and tips, and made our stay so easy and sweet. The Islander is a small, easy going resort that is literally steps to a beautiful beach. Beautiful sunrises just steps out the door. The condo itself has a beautiful view and the grounds outside are full of tropical beauty and lots of birds. We decided to rent bikes instead of a car for this part of our trip and David made that so easy for us. The bike path to the north is a beautiful ride. Lots of beaches along the way, too. The food scene in Kapa'a is also excellent, and every place we went was an easy bike ride. There are lots of food trucks, which were our favorite! We only wish we had longer to stay at their spot. Next time! If this place is available for your dates, jump on it!
Mahalo to our hosts, who were beyond helpful, communicative, and warm. They really shared the aloha and we could feel it!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a fabulous stay with a great view and amenities. Would definitely go back again!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Place was exactly as described and has all the necessities for a great stay! Free parking was fantastic. Conveniently located and what we needed for our short stay before our flight. Great host, would recommend!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at David’s in Kapa’a! The complex is right on the beach along a nice walking path. Super convenient to grocery, coffee shop, restaurants, etc. Great location to explore the rest of the island as well. Appreciated the beach equipment which we used beach hopping on the north shore. They also provided us with a ton of great recommendations for activities all over Kauai. The unit had everything we needed and was very comfortable! Highly recommend!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We truly enjoyed our stay here! The view is absolutely incredible and the location is amazing. It's a very short walk from amazing shops and restaurants and steps from the beach. It has a great pool, hot tub, and tiki bar right outside with an ocean view. The host responded with all questions in a timely manner. Highly recommend!!!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place has everything you could want. It's walking distance to many places including coffeeshops, market, and restaurants. A short walk outside takes you to a bar by a pool and hot tub with several shady tiki huts (claim them early). can walk to the beach in five minutes. everything on the island can be driven to from her in an about an hour or less. Great place to stay and highly recommend it."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our short stay! The space was exceptionally clean and beautifully decorated. Coffee on the lanai at sunrise was peaceful and the beach was only a short walk away.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Walking distance to a calm beach and a pool and hot tub. Walking distance to good restaurants and a market. Hosts provided everything needed for an enjoyable stay.
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great spot to stay at. Close to shopping and restaurants. If you're looking for something very private and quiet probably would not be my first choice however it suited our needs as it was the very last night before returning home. Allison was highly responsive and thoughtful!!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and had everything you needed
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Incredible location central to everything. The host was wonderful and kept in touch before, during, and after the stay to ensure everything went smoothly. The host provided personal touches that made it feel like an island oasis. We’d love to stay here again one day and enjoy all of the amenities!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful place to stay while visiting!
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,the location was great! close to shops and restaurants and the market. we even went to the farmers market and bought some fresh fruit to enjoy poolside. it was easy to walk to the pool and beach and if we needed anything we just went back to the room really fast and grabbed it and came back. I got sick the first two days there so it was nice to have somewhere to just lay down with AC and Netflix and just wait out the sickness. Allison was very communicative with everything from before we came to check out. They have lots of beach gear outside in a storage bin. Whilst we never used them it was a nice gesture all the same when visiting somewhere. overall it was a nice time!
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"It’s a nice spot, and if you’re looking for an ocean view and to be right on the water, it’s a good option. But there are way better places to stay around the island for the price."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We LOVED staying here! Great communication, great amenities, great location! Can’t rave enough."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay! It’s a central location on the island and makes it easy to use as a home base to explore the north and south sides of Kauai. The patio looks out to the pool and the ocean - we enjoyed eating dinner outside each night. Allison and David provided a lot of great suggestions too. We rented bikes for the time we were there but didn’t really use them because we were out exploring each day - I would take this into consideration. The kitchen is very small but the bbq’s by the pool are great. Would definitely stay here again!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location. Right near a tiki bar and great food options. There’s a cafe for the mornings too. Beautiful beach with not that many people in the sand. Highly recommend taking a bike on the bike path heading north.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful location! The condo is small but functional; we stayed busy during our trip so we really only used our room for showering and sleeping, anyway. Proximity to the beach, market & shops was very convenient. The grounds are beautifully manicured and the pool/hot tub area is great. Very attentive host provides lots of recommendations and helpful information. My only criticism is that the water pressure in the shower is low so it takes forever to wash thick hair/the sand off your body. The toilet was also not working properly during our visit (talk about a bummer!) but I didn't inform the host until after because I didn't want to deal with a plumber stopping by while we were there. Overall the condo was a great homebase for a memorable trip! We will be back."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent stay! Communication was prompt, yet we had no problems. The location has everything at your fingertips… easy access to shops, restaurants, beach, and pool. We especially appreciated the beach chairs, beach towels, and soft cooler to take with us. There was a free ice machine one floor down which we utilized for our beach time. The area is close to things, but it’s not noisy or too busy with people. Our vacation was wonderful! We definitely recommend staying here."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the thoughtfulness and attention to detail at the condo! It had everything we needed and was the perfect stay for part of our vacation. Despite some initial hiccups, this place was super clean and comfortable. Wonderful location central to everything!"
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the place! Location was great. Clean and thoughtfully stocked with everything we would need - umbrella, beach chairs, boogie boards , etc. Host responded to my questions quickly. Very enjoyable time spent here. Beautiful balcony views. Would highly recommend. Mahalo."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Ali was absolutely wonderful! The condo was perfect - the most scenic views of the ocean and added bonus of a pool on site. She was great with communicating the best spots and to-do’s in Kauai. Can’t wait to go back and stay there again!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Allison’s place was amazing! Great location with great views. We would definitely stay here again
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a beautiful stay! My son and mother accompanied me and it was amazing. The views are to die for and Allison made sure the room was properly prepared and communicated very well with me the whole time- from booking until checkout. It was such a nice, beautiful room that my mom already booked it for November! I definitely recommend this for either family or couples. Thank you, Allison! Mahalo!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place had everything we needed to make us feel relaxed and pampered during our three day stay. The unit had plenty of space for my wife and I, and everything was very clean. The kitchenette was very well stocked, and had a toaster oven in addition to the microwave and fridge. The Wi-Fi worked well. The balcony was very nice and had a good view of the ocean. The ocean was just a short walk away and provided beautiful views of the sunrise. All the little extras really added up – plush comfortable bathrobes in the bathroom, olive oil in the kitchenette, really tasty instant oatmeal for breakfast, many kinds of sunscreen, and a very well stocked first aid kit (which we fortunately did not need). If we are lucky enough to come back to Kauai, we would definitely stay here again."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a beautiful hotel room! Great view of the ocean and right outside the pool area. Plenty of shopping and food near by! Would definitely recommend it!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Allison and David's home is an ideal location for your vacation right on the beach of Kauai. The setting is quite and relaxing yet shops and restaurants are within a walking distance. The room is very clean and decorated with a charming honu theme. Coffee, tea, glasses, cups, and bowls, you name it, they thought of everything to make your stay comfortable. Prior to my visit they provided names of nearby restaurants/cafés so i don't have to scramble to find and some sightseeing locations and activities to explore.
Be aware of rooters in the property. They may be beautiful to look at, but I have lost the sense of time.
When I return to the island, I would stay with Allison and David's beautiful condo on the beach again."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Just finished a week at Allison's place, on the first leg of a 3-week island-hopping adventure. Allison's place was absolutely the perfect way to start the vacation, and set a high bar for others to follow. The location was perfect; the pool, hot tub, pool bar and beach were great. It's right on the bike path, and centrally located for so many activities. Allison's communication could not have been better, and she offered so many suggestions for activities and places to go and eat. She was truly an outstanding host. I can't wait to come back!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Awesome location, pool and bar"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Allison’s condo is perfectly located within walking distance to a variety of restaurants & cute shops. The condo is spacious and has everything you need to relax and enjoy your time on the island.
I’m looking forward to returning to The Islander soon!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Allison’s place is absolutely perfect! The location is great within the complex and she has thought of everything to make your stay epic! Highly recommend staying there!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This was our honeymoon and stayed for 13 days. Perfect location, wonderful price for what the unit offers and what the property offers. Allison was great to work with and highly recommended her and the property."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you are running an Airbnb or small inn their communication and support and local things to do was perfect
The room is Super clean and makes you feel like you are on vacation- all the necessities you could need and plea to of great ideas of what to do .... definitely a role model of how I want to run my little inn"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hosts were great, they had nice little touches around the unit (e.g. left us a bottle of wine for our celebration) that went a long way to us. Unfortunately we had 1 more day left on our trip and the unit was reserved (we had booked this trip last minute) for our last night so we stayed in a different unit on the same property and that one failed in comparison on many levels to this one. Would highly recommend staying here given its price point relative to the major hotels that were charging $700+ a night at the time, not overrun with tourists like the major hotel chains, it was well kept and in a great location."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place and great hosts. One of the great places on the east cost. If you want to stay in the middle of the north and south coasts this is the place. We’d stay here again for sure.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great stay! Very easy checkin and we appreciated the amenities like beach chairs, boogie board, beach bag and snorkels. good location close to lots of things and sites on the island. Great communication from Allison and David!
Thx u!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location, easy to get around to popular food and beach locations. Beautiful scenery an overall stay was really comfortable. All neccesities are within walking distance. Highly recommend."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect hub for our exploration of Kauai. I just wish we had a few more days so we could have taken advantage of more of the great recommendations and had more time to enjoy the local area too. To be fair, this place was nicer than what my wife and I expected. It wasn't our preferred location but in the price point, for a king size bed and a beach view (which were our requirements) - and we are so glad we chose Allison & David's place. Check in was simple, the bed was comfortable and the close by bike path and restaurants were pleasant surprises. We'd love to stay here again if ever back on Kauai."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Best location and view for a more than reasonable price
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The location is absolutely perfect. We sat out on the balcony and watched the ocean waves everyday. The unit had everything we could have asked for and so many thoughtful items included. The bed was comfy and the place was very clean. We will definitely come again.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Of course, it's Kauai, but...our stay was incredible. We showed up about an hour early and we found the housekeeper getting our room ready. She let us stow our suitcases and we went out to explore the area. This was a perfect place to stay for me and my wife. The Condo is clean and comfortable, the owners made the experience as easy as could be. It is a very (I mean very) nice place to stay, just a few steps away to the beach. We enjoyed the view of the ocean from the patio every morning for about an hour as we lounged before heading out for the day. The lava lava beach club restaurant is a 2 minute walk and the place was awesome. Thank you Ali and David!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was really great! It was right by the beach, had a pool and hot tub and the place came with beach towels, chairs and snorkel equipment. Allison was very responsive, helpful and accommodating. It’s also located right next to a coffee shop and plenty of other shops and restaurants literally right outside of the resort property. I would recommend this place to others!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot! We really enjoyed hanging at the pool and taking advantage of the happy hour at the pool bar after hitting the beach. Traffic seems like a regular occurrence on Kauai, but luckily the location makes it easy to get around, and there are a lot of things to do and places to go within 10 minutes of the condo. There are plenty or close restaurants within walking distance too. We hope to come back for a longer visit!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was so cute! Right on the beach, and just a very short walk to an awesome dinner spot on the beach with live music. We had a blast, the room was clean, and checkin and checkout was a breeze. Definitely want to come back again."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spot.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a steal! Great location near a bunch of local shops and a marketplace. Close to multiple beaches, views, hikes. The host was always quick to reply and had stocked the condo with extra beach gear like towels, chairs, umbrella, snorkel gear, etc. The bed was more firm which wasn't our preference but we loved the pillows. This resort is beautiful and we enjoyed watching the sunrise each morning, even on the cloudy days.
BTW highly recommend getting a car on this island if want to see the whole island. Taking the bus still required lot of walking. We ended up getting a car after a couple days and enjoyed our stay much more."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Allison’s place is a perfect getaway for your vacation of Kauai. Located a few miles south of the town of Kapaa, Allison’s place is a perfect condo for a relaxing beach day or island adventure. The Coconut marketplace a few minutes walking from the condo has everything you need in terms of shopping, dining and contains a small marketplace for anything you may need for your stay. Everything on the island is about 1-1.5 hours away (max) and many of our adventures were 5-15 minutes driving from the condo including snorkeling beach and jungle mountain hikes. Highly recommended for your stay of Kauai!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,loved this perfect little gem.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was great. It had everything you needed! Walking distance (like 1-2min) to the pool, beach, and food/restaurants. The room was very comfortable and they provided beach chairs and beach towels and more! Would definitely stay here again and highly recommend!
Communicating with the hosts was easy and they were super responsive."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Clean & comfortable room. Close to everything you need for your stay. Outstanding communication from owner. Sunrise from the lanai worth twice the cost!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Outstanding location! Beach, pool, food, shopping, views. Probably the most magical place I’ve ever stayed. We brought our kids and they loved it!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Exceptional stay. Allison went out of her way to make our honeymoon extra special. The listing was well equipped, comfortable beds, great water pressure, and all the amenities you could need for a beach stay. The lawn chairs and boogie boards were a great surprise. The space is cozy, but absolutely perfect for two people for a couple days. We loved the property, the beach was fun — and lots of great restaurants near by. Fish Market Deli is a must stop for lunch. Thanks again. Highly recommend."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Expect a wonderful stay! The room is amazing and beautiful. Get swallowed whole by fluffy cloud like comfort. Enjoy!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location, walking distance to restaurants, bike/kayak rentals and overall great place for a R & R vacation!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location, friendly and communicative hosts, and clean. Highly recommend!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location near the coconut market and lava lava beach club. When we had questions, Allison consistently responded in a timely manner. We enjoyed all the amenities offered, especially the beach gear!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, very close to a market, restaurants, and stores! Fantastic amenities and very clean place. Highly recommend staying here. Location is in a central area and easy to get around."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We did a last minute trip and Allison made the process very easy for us.
The place is perfect. It has all you need so you save a lot on rentals. The resort is awesome, everything is walking distance. The pool/bar is really nice and clean, we spend most of our stay there!
We were celebrating our first year anniversary and Allison added chocolates and wine for the occasion!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful host! Perfect spot in paradise! Very convenient location to food and shopping within short walk! Gorgeous Gorgeous Gorgeous!!! Can’t say enough good things!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and very clean! Nice amenities at the condo.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This is a great place with all the ammentities . Location is right on the ocean . Host is very responsive and offered good ideas on hikes and dining .
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Allison and Dave have an amazing place that truly is in paradise. Great location, easy key pad check in and the unit has all the things you need for your vacation. Don’t need to bring your own beach gear! Allison and Dave are easy to reach as well. The mid-trip check in to see if we needed anything was thoughtful and appreciated."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great spot! The area is convenient and cute with lots of shops and restaurants to go to. Allison was great at answering questions and having advice on places to go to. I liked that they had things like boogie boards, a beach umbrella, and other beach necessities. Thank you for the welcome gifts too, the special touches added to the experience. We will be back Mahalo"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful airbnb that is in a great location! Easy check-in and check-out and communication was on point! They had complimentary chocolates, and provided beach towels, snorkel gear, and beach chairs! It was so welcoming walking into the clean airbnb with flowers scattered around all the rooms!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing experience at Allison’s condo, the resort is great and the location can’t be beat!
Nothing to do with the home, but plan extra time to get to the airport, who knew there could be such traffic on Kauai!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The entire experience could not have been any better. Everything was clean and the check in and out process was very easy. We really loved the ocean view, the pool and jacuzzi, and being right next to the coconut marketplace. I would definitely go back again!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The resort vibe was fantastic. Right on the beach, a nice pool and hot tub, and a comfortable room with all the amenities!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The condo was extremely clean, comfortable, and centrally located. We loved being able to see the ocean from the lanai and having beach chairs provided at a private beach. The surf was rough when we were there, but it was possible to swim and play in the waves. The AC was also a welcome perk since many places on the island do not have it. Also, the bed was very comfortable, which is important when traveling! Definitely recommend!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely amazing place. We had the best time! Super quick communication made it an easy and carefree stay. The air bnb had everything you needed and close by shops. The beach was so close by! We can’t recommend this spot enough!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at 3 different airbnbs for this trip and this was by far our favorite!
The location is perfect, we could walk to the market, to dinner and right down to the beach. The bed is SO COMFORTABLE and the room was extremely clean and so relaxing. Also, the little touches of flowers around the room was gorgeous. Highly recommend!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay, communicative hosts, and beautiful room. Appreciated the additional beach gear provided."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had an excellent time at Ali and David’s place. Some of the best customer service I have ever received from Air BNB. Ali attended to our every question and need even though we were only there for two nights. Very comfortable and complete for a small place. Centrally located. Definitely recommend staying there
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is the best!! So close to the beach. It was so clean and Ali and David’s ocean toys were a great plus (boogie boarding and snorkeling, anyone!?) It was so clean and had so many adorable Hawaiian details. We loved it here. It is a studio so has a hotel room feel. Perfect for my husband and I! The balcony is the perfect spot to eat dinner and watch the ocean."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect place to stay in Kauai. It was just me and my wife. The place is perfect for 2 people. There is a small refrigerator, microwave, and coffee maker. Place was clean and in a great location. The balcony overlooks the swimming pool and has a great view of the ocean. Within walking distance is the coconut plaza which has shopping and many different places to eat. We really enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back. Alison is very responsive to all texts and emails and check in was super easy. The front door has a keypad that you enter a code to get in. This was a nice feature as we didn't have to worry about keeping track of a key when going to the beach or pool. Highly recommended place to stay in Kauai!!!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Allison and David's place is AMAZING! We enjoyed two wonderful weeks in their condo, with amazing ocean views from the room, and a beautiful private beach to enjoy. Not to mention the pool and hot tub and all the outdoor/beach essentials they have to offer. Their condo had everything we needed, with all the added amenities that made our time in Kauai so fun."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We just stayed here. May/June 2021. it was very clean. Very comfortable bed and towels were like new. Excellent location. Hosts offer great communication. We would stay here again.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great area to stay and the beach is in your backyard. Would definitely stay there again!!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We couldn't have had a better time our first time in Hawaii and we think it was because we chose to stay here!! Our favorite things: seamless checkin and checkout, all the beach equipment you could dream of!, sunsets at the beach just steps away, super easy parking, being right next to coconut marketplace and so many good restaurants, and being in such a central location and close to many great hikes and the airport. The hosts were also so kind and were helpful every step of the way. 100% would stay here again!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing place! Super easy check in, location and beach!
There is an ABC store in the village located next to the resort, a super market within walking distance, neighboring restaurants and bars, and a great little beach break great for floating… even saw turtles!!!
Will definitely be staying here again!!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great experience! Loved staying at the condo, it was very clean, and had everything we needed for our trip. 10/10 would recommend."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The perfect place to stay in Kauai! Has everything you need and was stocked with all the beach essentials. A very comfortable bed too! Highly recommend.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a hidden Gem!
Allison and David were the best.
So helpful and made everything seam-less.
Place was spotless and perfect.
Awesome view and great beach, just literally right in front of the pool.
Hottub was so amazing! You could hear the crashing waves. I enjoyed the BBQ area and how the restaurants and shops were just next door.
Best part was the location!!
So close to the kayaking on Wailea falls and all the cool areas on island, plus it was less than 10 minutes from the airport.
I plan on coming back every year now and bringing my friends.
Best value on the island!"
,,,"Five words: screaming crying baby next door. Would not wish this on anyone. Got it twice in a row at 5:30a and 6a, lasted for hours and kind of threw me off. It's right where the bed is too. Then there was weird loud stomping the first few nights, right after my long flight when I was trying to chill.
And it's Hard to find coming from the airport. The buildings aren't labelled which doesn't help either. Called Kaz but no answer, luckily the cleaning lady was able to help lol. Then the code in my itinerary was wrong. Pretty unclear and frustrating experience overall.
Great location
Love the ceiling fans
Bed is not very comfy
Only 4 towels for 6 nights, really?
Kauai Shores is right down the street, is cheaper and is an actual hotel. I'd stay there if I were you."
,,,"I had a very stressful stay in this unit. I would recommend staying at this resort (Aston Islander on the Beach) in a different condo if you can live with a few problems.
As to the resort, there are 3 things I had to overcome. First, is the roosters. They crow loudly and you can hear it well even on the second floor). I know lots of people are bothered by that because I googled Aston Islander on the Beach TripAdvisor. Lots of people mentioned it. I’m a pretty heavy sleeper so I just downloaded a sleep app that plays ocean waves. That was good enough to drown out the sounds for me. Second, there is currently construction on the road coming out of the resort complex that is an issue. During the day the traffic backs up really bad and some people might have a problem turning left (lots of things are to your left). At night, after a luau that was 7 minutes away, it took 40 minutes to get back home. The third thing was construction on the sidewalk in front of the pool/spa/bar area. The construction noise was so loud some people might not enjoy that area. They just started that construction the day before my last day.
Having said that, I really loved the location. The grounds are BEAUTIFUL. There are restaurant options within an easy walk. I especially loved the Lava Lava Club next door. There is also a small grocery store that is within an easy walking distance. There is also some shopping within an easy walking distance. It is only 10 minutes from the airport and right on the beach. It’s so nice to be centrally located on the island as well.
I loved the unit itself as well. There is quite a bit of essentials packed into an efficiency and most of the items are in good shape.
The tough part of my stay was with the owner. I’ve only had good things to say about other Airbnb and VRBO stays. He either entered the condo without telling me in violation of Airbnb policy or he didn’t and lied about doing it. I have sent screenshots of our conversations to Airbnb in the hopes they will let him know if he does it again he will be banned from the site.
The reason the owner did it was because of a problem with the lock. Jilian, his property manager, told me other people had problems with the lock as well. He kept blaming the problems on user error, but I sent videos proving otherwise. It’s either a defective lock or the batteries were bad. (I have a similar lock). After no one would commit to coming out and fixing it, I was messaged that the batteries were changed. The batteries can only be changed from the inside.
When I confronted David, the owner, about entering my unit, he then said he didn’t. He only tested the lock. I don’t know which time he was lying, but, either way, I would not stay in this unit again.
One other issue is the code on the lock. It’s super easy to remember and guess. Based on a message from Jilian telling me to enter a second code, I know there are two super easy codes to guess. I can’t prove it, but I believe that he’s not changing the codes between visits. That is like giving a guest a physical copy of the key and letting them keep it so a previous guest can re-enter the unit and sexually assault or rob you.
I hesitated in posting this, even though I was lied to at a minimum, but I don’t want this to happen to anyone else. By posting about it, I’m hoping the owner will be shamed into doing the right things going forward."
