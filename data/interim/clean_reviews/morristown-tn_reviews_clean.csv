2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"flexible checkin, coded door entry. no rooms, just a studio sized apartment, but as it has all the amenities, the bathroom is well supplied, the bed is adjustable (awesome). Only complaint id have is if you plan to sleep in, there is trains in the area. otherwise, awesome stay."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The home has recently been remodeled, squeaky clean, well organized, with lots of thoughtful extras such as a great sound machine (trains nearby), room darkening shades (I do suggest a sleep mask if you are sensitive). Adam couldn't have responded more quickly, accommodated better, or left clearer instructions. Thank you!"
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,It was good
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect for my needs
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay, the place was very cozy, clean and had all the amenities we needed. It’s located in a great part of town, close to the supermarket, gas stations, restaurants and the mall. Overall we had a great stay and would definitely recommend and return in the future."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Adam’s listing was a great spot for me and my guest. It was right by everything and it was very comfortable to come back to. Would definitely book again if given the chance.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We needed a place to stay for 2 weeks. I work from home, and I needed good Internet. This place met all our needs and it was very affordable. Adam was also very helpful."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice little studio! perfect for my husband and I for the weekend. The studio was very nicely updated and clean. we had a great weekend stay!!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,very affordable and clean. my stay was lovely and peaceful. the host was very responsive and easy to reach. would stay here again!!!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay, I worked remotely for a couple of days and the internet connection was great. the place was clean and in a great location. There was great communication from the host. We would stay there again."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adam's place was very cozy and nice. We loved staying there. The walls are a little thin so make sure your TV isn't too loud. The neighbors also kept hitting the shared wall so that was a little annoying but I don't think it was anything Adam could have helped. Also there is no washer and dryer so be prepared for that. All in all, it was super clean and nice. We would definitely stay here again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We needed a place to stay medium term and Adam’s little place was perfect.
The kitchen is fully equipped with fridge/freezer, microwave, oven, sink and counter tops. The bathroom has a shower with multiple settings and good pressure, a toilet and a sink. It also has fast wifi, a Roku and a comfortable bed.
Autumn at Adam’s place was gorgeous, the two big trees in front of the place had beautiful autumnal colouration through October and November.
Adam was very accommodating while checking in, allowing us to check in early and move in for the stay. Throughout our stay he checked on us and washed the linens weekly on our terms, while being respectful our privacy.
The neighbours were very friendly and quiet.
In terms of walkability there is a pals, food city and gym across the road. Downtown is a 20 minute walk and the mall is a 30 minute walk.
We really enjoyed our stay and we highly recommend it to others.
Hugo and Alyssa"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing place definitely worth it. I would definitely recommend.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I came down for a wedding, and Adam's place was perfect for what we needed. It is close to downtown and a grocery store, and within 10 minutes, you have shopping and restaurants. We definitely recommend the Hillbilly Cabin. We ate there twice it was so good. We loved the cozy feel to the space. The furniture was nice and comfy. Having a stove and full refrigerator was nice as well. The house is on a busy road mainly during the day but you don't notice the noise while inside. Adam is very responsive and friendly. He answered any questions we had. We did have a minor issue, but Adam took care of it right away, and it did not affect our stay one bit. I would recommend staying here and would stay here again. Thank you for sharing your beautiful and welcoming space."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would book this anytime I came to Morristown. So clean and well taken care of inside. Adam was excellent in communicating and you could walk to the grocery store, Starbucks, a Hamburg joint, and fitness center. The bed left a little to be desired. Thanks Adam and hope to see you again in the future. Mark and Audrey"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great host, the studio was well decorated and clean. It had a full kitchen, plenty of extra linens and blankets, and a comfortable couch. Maybe the bed needs to be replaced because one side was sloped downward to where it felt like you could roll out of the bed."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautifully decorated. Everything like new. Very thoughtful and practical details.
Very good communication.
Small place but perfect for two people. Very quiet surroundings. Nice back porch with comfortable chairs and peaceful view.
No washer and dryer, no dishwasher.
It is a great affordable place for a short stay."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Adams place was beautiful and so comfortable. Id love to stay again the next time I’m in town visiting family.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice cozy wonderful space had everything that I needed. Other amenities were close and a short drive to the mall. The home was super clean. I will keep this on the short list of places when I go back home to visit family.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Exactly as pictured and felt at home.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was most enjoyable and relaxing. We really had a good time. If we come back we would like to stay at the same place. It was close to everything.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My stay here was absolutely amazing. The place was perfect for my needs, especially staying long term. Adam was a FANTASTIC host. They often checked up on us and were always responsive in a very quick manner.
I was actually very sad to leave. Would go again in a heartbeat."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great little place. Comfortable and perfect for our needs
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Adam’s place was extremely clean and welcoming! Modern but comfortable. This was perfect for my husband and I to stop for a quick overnight to break up a long road trip. You can’t beat the price with all the amenities. So glad we stayed here instead of an average hotel room that would have cost more for less amenities.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Quiet neighborhood and place fully accommodated for a brief stay.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Adam's Place was perfect for our stay. It was very clean and we loved the decor. It looks just like the pictures. The bed mattress was so comfortable and so was the bedding & pillows. It was set up with all the necessities we needed for our stay. The host was very nice and responded quickly when I reached out to him. We appreciated the suggestions for restaurants in the area that are in the guidebook. We would highly recommend Hillbilly's Cabin restaurant. The food was really good. The books on the coffee table with suggestions for things to do were a nice touch. We really think the sound machine was a great idea and used it every night. We want one for our home now. The USB outlets on the nightstands were a great touch. The studio has great lighting and when the curtains are closed they block the outside light really well. The parking spaces are right in front of the house and you can back up close to the door for easy loading & unloading of a vehicle. We would definitely stay again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay here. The studio is extremely clean, well-appointed and tastefully decorated. The Wi-Fi worked great for working, and the kitchen - although small - is amazingly well stocked and had everything I needed!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a great stop for an overnight stay! Everything was clean and comfortable, and the host was responsive. My only note is that there were quite a few bugs that I had to deal with (no bed bugs though!). While I was comfortable with managing them being from the South, and I think it'd just a product of being in a warm climate, it may not be the best location for you if you typically don't do well with bugs like spiders. Otherwise, I was very happy with the accessibility of the space, especially the shower seat. (For wheelchair users I'd note that there are ledges, but the area is pretty spacious enough to wheel around, and the bed is lower to the ground.) Thank you!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,place was very nice and comfy exactly what you would want for a studio and hosts were kind and very responsive
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a unplanned trip to Morristown as my Mother In Law had just passed.
Adam was very responsive to my messages and was extremely helpful. We had to make adjustments to our reservation and he went with the flow.
I liked how the place was located in a quiet part of town. The next door residents were friendly as well. Looks like a Police Officer lived up the road so that added to the sense of security. There is a nice grocery store within 2-3 blocks as well.
This place was sooo nice! Nice touches, good lighting, bed was comfortable and so clean!
I’d would stay again if I’m in the area.
Thank you"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very friendly host. Very clean and cute studio. Great location.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I spent one night here due to attending a graduation the next day. The home was very beautiful. He even had a booklet made with recommendations of popular restaurants and local spots. He was very responsive and answered quickly. I would absolutely book with Adam again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great large and clean airbnb A++++
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Adam’s place was newly remodeled and spacious; very clean and comfortable with nice furnishings. He communicated clearly and was quite responsive. Convenient driveway parking right in front makes unloading easy. There is a cozy backyard patio. This is a duplex with a family living next door.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Adam is a fantastic host. The place is just as describe, furniture clean and comfortable. The bed was very comfortable and I have back issues. I will stay again when in Morristown. He is very responsive and let us know right when the house was ready.
Angel"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Adam's space was beautifully decorated, well approved, and immaculately cleaned. I can't think of one detail that wasnt thought of. I loved the decor and will be using some of the design choices as inspiration for my own home. The bed was plush and comfortable. We were only there for sleep and shower due to our itinerary comimg back from Florida but wished we could have stayed longer."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a nice studio if you coming into just need a comfortable nice quick stay! Personally it was a bite noisey due to the neighbors that are connected to the apartment and games from the baseball field which were actually nice at times but keep alot of traffic. Pros the studio was spacious, comfortable and really really clean!! Also I want to stay how great Adam was as a host, he was very responsive and accommodating. I would book again just would probably book if I was alone amd not working from wherever I am. Overall it's a 7.5/10 only bc of the location"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I will definitely try to stay here the next time we're in Morristown. Such a great place
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It exceeded my expectations, everything was clean, warm and welcoming."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,very clean. very cute. very accommodating.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spot for a short stay in Morristown.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adam was super quick to respond and very agreeable to last minute changes I had. Place was quiet and clean, very good location to restaurants, grocery, and food."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was a great space and very well set up! Just what I needed
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"If you are coming to Morristown I highly recommend this place. I honestly can’t say enough great things about Adam’s place. It is exactly as described in the listing and as pictures show. It is probably the best studio I’ve ever stayed in, and I’ve been to many as a travel nurse. It was very spacious, clean and had everything we needed for our stay. Bed was super comfortable and the sound machine was the extra bonus points. So many things that are very detail oriented I could go on and on. Host is quick to respond to messages. Absolutely beautiful."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved this cute little place. Would definitely stay again. It was so clean and cozy! The neighbors were also friendly. Can’t beat the price either.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Don't hesitate to book this place. Perfect size for a quick stay in Morristown. The studio is very well equipped with lots of nice comfortable furniture and amenities. Both the bathroom and kitchen are spotless and have everything you might need. The location is quiet, I'm a light sleeper and typically don't sleep well when I travel. I got a good night's sleep both nights during my stay thanks to the very comfy bed and the provided fan. The value of this place is amazing, it really punches above its price point."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I was hoping we’d see the mountains there was no view of the mountains but we were tired when we got here so we just stayed inside most of time nicely had coffee for us a full-size refrigerator for us to cooler drinks great job Adam
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was perfect for a quick night's rest. Adam was flexible with check-in which was convenient since we were traveling and stopping in the middle of the night. It was easy to find at 4am. The layout is simple yet it provides a full kitchen, comfortable couch and chair, clean bathroom, and kitchen table. The bed wasn't comfortable to me but I had no issues with moving to the couch. It is close to a road but a noise machine was provided to help block out the unwanted noise. We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again during our travels from PA to Memphis. Adam was great communicating with me throughout the process."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a really cozy and efficient place! Close to grocery stores, food and other shopping. Inside its all one room but its a huge space. Nice big comfy couch, flat screen Roku TV, nice sized kitchen. I loved the little details like having a luggage rack! This place is basically brand new, spotless and really well done. No issues with noise, had its own temperature control as well. Bed was comfy as were the pillows. Only downside was, its not sitting on a box spring so the bed is lower to the ground. My suggestions for future guests would be to leave the porch light on, as it was difficult to see the keypad at night. The lights inside were VERY bright. I couldn't keep them on as it made the place bright white. I opted to just leave 1 on it, so perhaps softer lighting. There are now darkening shades so this gets plenty of sunlight. I will keep this place in mind!!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome! Well stocked place! Very helpful host! Thanks for the great stay!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Excellent place for a business traveler or a couple. Nice, clean, and cozy."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Although we were only there one night we really did enjoy our stay. It was so much better than staying in a hotel room. Everything was new and clean, beautiful decor with very nice touches. Extra blankets, plenty of pillows, kitchen had everything you would need for an extended stay. I know it sounds like a little thing but having the water bottles available was great being we forgot to stop before checking in. Very thoughtful hosts."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My wife and I needed a place to stay overnight on our way to Bristol, TN. The apartment was close enough to the highway that we didn’t have to drive very far out of our way. The inside was recently remodeled and cozy. Plenty of cooking utensils if you plan on cooking while you stay there, although we did not have time. The place was a great value, I would recommend staying there."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place clean and comfortable!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If there were a 10 star review this adorable little spot would get my rating!
Spotless, extra accommodating host, exceptionally equipped, very cozy atmosphere!
Planning on making it my go to spot when traveling in the future!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Adam's place was very cozy. it has its own door to the outside and it's own off street parking. It was clean and nice. There was occasional noise that sounded like a train in the distance.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"it was amazing, really comforting and one of the best prices over ever gotten"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I just wish we had more time to stay in Morristown. It was a lovely town, and the home was super cozy and had everything we needed. If we'd stayed longer I know we would have called it our home away from home spot. if I'm ever back to the area, I would recommend the home and find it very cozy and quiet, peaceful neighborhood."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great place would definitely stay again

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing place felt right at home
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kevin’s place was immaculate. It was clean, packed with amenities, and very comfortable. It is much more spacious than the photos are able to represent. Kevin has also equipped his place with the most updated technology, charging stations, and much more. It is definitely worth the money and I would love to stay again. We loved it so much we started to ask him if he’s accepting tenants! LOL"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was great! My mother-in-law was in Morristown-Hamblen hospital and this place was so convenient.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We booked with Kevin twice during very sad circumstances and it was so comforting to have a nice place to stay after flying from across the country. The home is very comfortable, clean, and in a quiet safe neighborhood. We had everything we needed at our fingertips and our host made sure we were well stocked in necessities. An added bonus was being so close to historic Morristown, shops, and restaurants."

While I would normally pick a more secluded location, Kevin's home was clean, comfortable and exactly where we needed to be for this trip. I felt very comfortable walking my 2 dogs around the neighborhood by myself. Kevin was very friendly and quick to respond. I didn't need an EV charger, but for a lot of folks, that would be a huge plus. If you are looking for in-town location, this is a great little home for your stay."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"House was very cute. Had just about everything you could need for a stay. Very clean. Very close to a lot of food, Walmart, activities. We came down to visit Carson Newman University and it was such a nice and easy drive from the house! Would recommend! :)"

Kevin was very accommodating to a “late check-out” request due to some last minute changes in our plans. That was very much appreciated. We travel to Morristown almost every weekend during baseball season and this is the perfect home away from home. We will definitely book this space again! Five stars!!!"

2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,Great location! Close to all the essentials. Stayed here because I had to work at the hospital and wanted to be close for when I was on call. Constant ATM sounds from next door and a noisy water heater but that didn’t bother me.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Kevin’s place was great. We would definitely stay again.
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Upon arrival we found that the property has homes, a bank and counseling building around it. The bank does have a 24 hour ATM rather close to the house.
During our first few hours we discovered several things about this property. The couch was inviting and the TV in the living room was enjoyable. However, there are sounds of trains rumbling on tracks, the blowing of the train horns, street traffic, as well as the usage of the ATM that can all be heard in the home at all hours of the day and night. The water heater is in one of the bedrooms. It is in the closet with only a utility door. It also can be heard at all hours filling and turning itself on and off to keep the water hot.
The property does not offer recycling. But we found that it was still possible to recycle in town. The Ingles on West Andrew Johnson Highway will recycle both paper & plastic."

2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Place was great and it was a nice little getaway for my family and I. Only negative was that the lake water level was so low that being on the lake was almost pointless. Also the beds and couch we not very comfortable. Everything else was great!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We love this place is awesome
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great time at the house! Loved the quiet peaceful surroundings and the view! I gave the “price you paid for” stars low because I was unaware of the unusable dock due to the lake being so low. The dock was completely beached. Was expecting to be able to get in/out from the dock with a raft/canoe. For future renters, if there was a “due to the time of year, the dock won’t be available to be used” caption that would’ve been helpful. Loved the space, it was open and very neat. Another suggestion, John does list to bring things for the firepit, which we did so thank you, but did not mention to bring disposables such as coffee filters, paper towels, and bottled/filtered water (if you prefer it). Maybe there could be a Brita water pitcher available? Or add it to the list of stuff not on property. Did not base my ratings on that missing stuff, these are merely suggestions. We had an awesome time! We went hiking on a trail less than 5 miles from the house and it was all beautiful!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,The place was super clean and had everything we needed. The wifi wasnt working while were there which wasnt a big deal except cell service isnt very good there either. John did what he could to try to help us but it was obvioulsy a provider issue. The view from the front deck was beautiful day or night. We felt very comfortable and will definitely be returning!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean. Nice location. Plenty of Linens and cleaning supply. Would be nice if you got a newer coffee pot. The coffee had a plastic taste when i used it to make coffee.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The only thing I wish I could have changed about my stay in Bean Station, at John’s lake house, was the length of time I had to enjoy it! It was wonderful, and we will try to book it again soon. 😊"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,There is indeed a sign for the road. Our GPS had us turn early and our first landing was short by a few hundred feet.
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing!!! Me and my long time friend had a girls getaway and loved every minute of our stay. Super clean. Felt safe. All neighbors were friendly. Only recommendation is a ladder on the dock. I’m 50+ and hate for my feet to touch the bottom of the lake. Everything was perfect. Highly recommend. Don’t forget to check out the green tomato grill about 10 minutes away… some good country food.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for a wedding and needed somewhere close by to stay. The house was clean, easy to locate, and the view was gorgeous. I would definitely come back and stay just for a relaxing weekend!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Best of everything - quiet, laid back lake living in a small community of homes with sweet neighbors. Very family friendly stay. Close proximity to major routes gets you to quaint downtown Morristown in 20 minutes and Knoxville or Pigeon Forge in around an hour. Plenty of local history within a half hour. We swam nightly off the dock and enjoyed beautiful sunsets. Bring crocs or water shoes as the ground is rocky and the lake level rises spring and summer and goes down in fall and winter. AC in the bungalow is super effective and quickly cools the place down in the hottest part of the day. John and Carrie are great hosts and got back to us quickly when we had questions. We loved our stay so much and would most definitely rent from them again."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We love the location and accommodations of John's bungalow. It sits far back from the road with a generous amount of grassy lawn on both the front and back sides of the home. Our kids loved the freedom it allowed to run around where the house sits a very safe distance from the waterfront. The property slopes gently as you walk down to the lake. The TVA lowers the water in the winter months providing plenty of rocky beach area for kids to play and explore as well.
We enjoyed lots of pink and purple sunsets over the lake from the comfort of the couch inside the picture window and often from the rocking chairs on the covered porch even in the winter.
The covered porch, abundance of blankets on hand, crock pot, fire pit and open concept between the kitchen and living room were some of our favorite features.
John is an accommodating and super responsive host. We'd be glad to book his place again.
15 minutes to the mall, movie theater, Ross, Walmart SuperCenter, etc.
9 minutes to Holt's IGA or 12 minutes to the Walmart Neighborhood Market for groceries
10 minutes to Cherokee Park (playground and splash pad)
The G H Coffman Country store (inexpensive, homemade breakfast and lunch Thurs-Sat and old-fashioned candy) down the road and the Red Barn Produce (tons of jams and spreads and some Amish made products) in Rutledge about 10 minutes away are some of our favorite local small businesses."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful place! Cute, clean! Beautiful view of the bridge. We arrived late at night and when we woke up, the view was just amazing!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cute little house right on the lake. We loved the huge covered porch while we were there. The house is nicely stocked and the beds are comfortable. We will definitely try to stay here again.

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"5 star stay enjoyed my stay during thanksgiving weekend first time in Tennessee and I stayed in bean station to say the least it was amazing, Knoxville drive wasn’t to far and also went to visit the veterans memorial. House was clean views was amazing to see the lake in the morning and at night."
2021-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very nice home and a great location. Stayed in November and would recommend for any time of year. We hope to go back during the summer. House was clean, fully stocked, and a top notch stay. The owner was quick to respond to our questions before checking in and this is a great place for a weekend or longer."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect for fishermen, with direct lake access and a marina right across the creek. This hit the price point for us 3 guys for a 4-day trip."

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my 1st trip to Tennessee. I cannot say enough good things about this tiny gem. The house is immaculate, cozy and just the cutest, little home with a gorgeous view. The weather was rainy so I didnt take advantage of the fire pit or grill. The road it's on is easy to pass if you're driving in the dark. But not tough to find. The kitchen was stocked with basic applicances, cookware, dinnerware, serveware that's needed. No wine glasses, but that's no biggie. I will definitley be making plans to come back!"
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin and location are great but the host controls the temperature in the cabin. If you have a problem with cold temperatures you might want to find another location. The outside temperature this morning was 46 and inside was 55. The three of us are retired military, in our 60's and 70's, and have an issue with cold temperatures. As nice as the cabin was, we will not return due to the host controlling the thermostat."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Location was just what we wanted - a getaway that isn’t too far away. Provided perfect accommodations for our family. Was peaceful and we enjoyed the lovely sunsets from the porch and the dock. Big yard was nice for playing ball. Good communication from John. Everything was simple for check in/out and connecting to wifi. Thanks!

2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,The road that the house is on does not have a street sign but it was still pretty easy to find!

Thank You John and Carrie for your great hospitality and for sharing your wonderful lake home with us."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved every minute of our stay. The place was just right and exactly what we needed for our getaway! We enjoyed the easy walk down to the water (just watch for goose droppings) hanging out down at the dock (bring lawn chairs), or sitting on the covered porch watching the rain, even the views of the sun setting over the water and behind the trees from the BIG window was picture perfect! Thanks so much for making your place available for us renters!"
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay...very clean..very peaceful...the only con i can give it is the walk to the dock was a little longer than expected...loved having the german creek marina right across the bay. Their staff and service was WONDERFUL! We rented a pontoon boat and docked it at the house for lunch and such. Very convenient!
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,If you stay here be prepared to bring all condiments with your food. There are no extras. Very relaxing stay.

We even enjoyed a meal on the grill! We saw sunsets over the lake from the porch. It was so beautiful. Definitely a nice change from the flat cornfields in Indiana! We spent time down on the dock and in the water. It was a lot of fun! We would book here again, without a doubt. It was a great time!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved staying here. My family enjoys the water more than anything. It's affordable and a very nice home.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I wish there had been better access to the lake. Felt like if I were to walk I. I’d be hanging with the fish and if jumped in from dock, there isn’t a ladder to get out. Everything else was fantastic and will be back!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay. Access to dock and Lake Cherokee. Very clean. Host answer promptly when you have a question. This is the second time staying at this house. They have added a Fire pit and grill for some fun times and good memories.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful and clean house that overlooks Lake Cherokee. This was our first time at Lake Cherokee and it was perfect for our family getaway! We can't wait to book again!

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and a beautiful spot. Very responsive host. Not as secluded as I thought but, that was not a problem.
It felt secluded. Well stocked kitchen with pots and pans but you will need to bring your on salt, pepper, oil and other spices. Well stocked linens, towels, blankets and pillows.
Beautiful views, far enough away to ""get away"" but also great little shops and eateries near by.
Was a wonderful weekend for solo traveler!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were driving in from out of town and booked this very last minute (a few hours from arriving). I was shocked that it was still available! John got back to us super quickly and made the process so easy and painless. When we arrived, we were pleasantly surprised to see that the place was even better than described (and we thought the photos looked pretty amazing to begin with)! Super clean, comfortable, beautiful view and access to the lake, and had absolutely everything we needed and more. If we are ever in the area again, we will definitely be staying here! Highly recommend!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place for a little weekend get away! Literally at the lake shore, this place couldn’t be in a better location. It was also extremely clean. I’m so glad I picked this place to stay in!"

2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time staying here! The place was clean and cozy, exactly what we expected. The only downside was the freak snowstorm, which meant we were stuck inside mostly and there wasn’t any sort of shovel for us to clear a walkway."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very nice little cabin. Has a great view and in a awesome location.

2020-10-01,2.0,Stayed with kids,"Our daughters birthday weekend was ruined.
4 hours into our 7 hour drive from home, both Airbnb and John/Carrie reached out to me about the place needing to be cancelled.
John/Carrie never spoke to their previous stayers to check to make sure what their dates were. They apparently thought they were booked another night.
Another thing, we’re in the middle of a pandemic and you book people HOURS before each other when COVID 19 needs two weeks to die in any certain area.
My family and I were looking for safe, social distanced vacation and unfortunately that’s not what we got."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place for our fishing trip with covered parking and close to boat ramp. Highly recommend it

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house is a perfect little cozy place to get away. It has a great view of the lake and is very quiet. The house is set back from the road so there is very little noise.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My son and I spent 4 days here to hang out and do some fishing. Lake was a bit low, so be careful on the water. Under laying mud flats and rocks can not be seen. Pay attention to depth finder. FYI
The house has everything you need for a nice get away. Very clean and Cosy. Fully functional kitchen. Just bring your food. Very nice area around the place. A short 100 yard walk to Private dock. Just hop in the boat and go. Boat ramp is about 4 miles away. We very much enjoyed our stay there, and will be back next year."

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stop scrolling and read this:
You wanna book this. If you’re needing a get away headspace trip? Do this. This is a tucked away tiny home that has a beautiful lake view, delightful charm, and every amenity you would ever need.
My husband and I came through and spent a week here, we wanted to be close that we could drive to the pretty mountains and Gatlinburg.
If you don’t mind the hour and twenty minute drive then this is it. It’s affordable 1/2 the price of any other smoky mountain AirBnb and it comes with sweet like views? Amazing
We also had everything we needed. There wasn’t that usual AirBnb moment when we had to run to a Walmart because there weren’t any plates or a toaster. We saved money and cooked a lot there.
This is an amazing place, truly I do recommend it."

2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,we loved it thank you 😊

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I came to Morristown for business many times in the last year. I found this house a few months ago, and I have stayed here the last four times I have been in town. this is my home from home. it is a perfect house, and I live sitting on the porch.
So, many deer and squirrels. there are three male squirrels I have named Moe, Larry, and Curly, and one female named Betty White. they love peanuts. Larry will take them from your palm.
Stay here you will love it!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time I have stayed at this house. it is impeccable and rivals my personal home. I come to Morristown often for work, and I have decided to stay at this house! I have already scheduled it for my next visit.
The porches are wonderful to just sit and listen to the woods. Yesterday, I was sitting on the front porch eating my dinner and looked out the screen to see a deer standing in the yard enjoying a meal itself. I don't think you can get that anywhere else.
The top floor has the bedrooms, a quiet formal living room, and a great kitchen to cook in. In the downstairs is the family room with a big TV, pool table, and stand-up arcade game. I learned I still suck at Pac-Man. The place is huge!
if you want a quiet woodland house that is ten minutes away from the city, this is it! Also, Becky is very responsive and helpful. I strongly recommend this place, book it!"
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"very cozy, comfortable furniture & beds, nice quite location, nice porches, we saw lots of deer in the side yard, but did not have enough essentials in the house, ran out of toilet paper, needs to add drinking & coffee cups, bowels, forks & spoons (not enough for a family), no TV in the living room-we moved the TV from bedroom because we like to watch movies/tv as a family, lv room lamp does not work, teens loved the basement game room, very steep narrow driveway that you have to back down but had lots of outside lights to help get around the house. Great place to stay just needs to be better stocked for a more enjoyable stay"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My stay was absolutely fantastic, truly a picture perfect vacation. Becky was extremely accommodating and very friendly. My friends and I had a great time, and would definitely recommend to anyone!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an absolutely amazing time. The house was just as described! Everything was perfect. Felt at home. Definitely would stay here again, maybe just longer! Thank you Becky for sharing your beautiful home with us ❤️"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"So, I would describe it as a porch with a building attached. There is this amazing porch on the front and one on the back from the master bedroom to the kitchen. They're amazingly peaceful. I spent a week there for work, and to be able to leave work and sir on the porches listening to the Carolina wrens, blue Jay, and the owls so absolutely wonderful. I come to morristown tennessee every other week, and this is my favorite place that I have stayed at, and if I can not pull it off, the only place I will stay at from this point on."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was very relaxing and peaceful! There were lots of nice amenities
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriend and I escaped to Becky's place to catch up on a few craft projects. We had a great couple of days and were successful in catching up. Wish we could have taken advantage of the pool table and arcade game, but we had craft goals and abstained. The space was perfect for our plans and we plan to be back... Maybe next time with the guys."
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Loved staying at Becky's. We travel alot with my son's bass fishing career and love finding places that we can put on our list to go back to again. This one made the list! Thanks Becky! ❤️

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great secluded cabin... very quiet!! Exactly as presented in post. Very nice game room with pool table, but we didn't get a chance to play as we were exploring the area. Although secluded, it was only short drive into town!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super comfy beds and couches! very nice stay, highly recommend.
notes: some neighbor dogs came over and I told them to go home and they eventually did. I mention in case you have someone in your group that's afraid of dogs like my daughter.
Master shower can be a bit slippery so be careful there."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at Becky's. All of the little extras Becky left were so nice..... granola bars, popcorn, oatmeal, etc. Also, the bathrooms had shampoo, soaps, etc if you forgot your own. The place was just as the pictures indicated. It is above a garage and I wondered how that would feel, but once you get inside, it is a really well constructed and cozy place. We spent alot of time on the screen porch, loved it. The setting is very peaceful. Just something to note, there is no TV in the living room area, (which does allow time to just visit without all the noise.), but if you have mobility issues or want to watch sports or movies as a group, you must watch TV in the master bedroom or down in the game room. We had a few issues with the hotspot connecting, but Becky was very responsive and worked with us to get it resolved. She was quick to respond. We would definitely stay again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place for a great price had no problems. Would definitely recommend.

The cabin was fully stocked for our 5 day stay, like we would have been in our home. Everything was nice and clean. Becky was super friendly and was quick to respond when I had questions. We will definitely be back to this little hideaway!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stay in Bean Station many times throughout the year and so far this our favorite. Here are our reasons why: Ideal location from the msin road 25E, located on a quiet cul-de-sac, nice view of the lake from the cabin, perfect for two people, several lakes and rivers near by to enjoy the day, clean and comfortable cabin with all necessities needed. We have property nearby in. New Tazewell so this cabin was perfect for us. Thank you for a pleasant and easy check in process and great communication. Hope to stay again soon."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,An amazing little house in a beautiful location that we really fell in love with. Friendly neighbors that welcomed us and Taylor was outstanding throughout our stay. We were actually sad when we had to leave to come back home. The experience in Bean Station and at the tiny cabin was really outstanding. We are already planning our return as we enjoyed it and the surrounding area so much. Thanks to everyone that helped to make this a fantastic time for us.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and peaceful. Very responsive owner I felt as good as if I was in my own home. If you are in the area of Bean Station this is the place to stay from the fireplace to the outside area it was just perfect.

It is right on the lake and the views are amazing and it was very peaceful there. I’d absolutely stay again. Felt right at home and I could live there, had everything you need. Taylor was also very helpful and responded quickly when I noticed a wasp nest. We left to grab a bite and before we even got to the restaurant it was took care of. Was a excellent little place with a huge yard. We was hoping to get to enjoy the fire pit but unfortunately didn’t get to. Maybe next time!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"to be honest this wasn't our first choice, our original booking cancelled on us late minute, due to property damage. this place was everything we were looking for new years eve. After experiencing a busy experience, too many people stay in Gatlinburg. We had a quiet personal spacious relaxing time here. All the basics to have a great brunch and feast of dinner. Enough space for a 5 year old to explore and not be under feet the whole time. if we are ever in the area we will definitely look into seeing if this place is available."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Kevin's place is very spacious and wonderfully decorated.

It’s like the Goldilocks of AirBnB’s – everything is “just right”. It’s close to everything, but far from noise. It’s luxurious enough to make you feel indulgent, yet relaxed enough to make you feel calm and rejuvenated. It has all the amenities you could possibly want, yet it’s totally uncluttered, with enough space for you to easily spread out and enjoy yourself. Check-in is a breeze, communication with Kevin is easy and he gives you everything you need in a concise and organized manner. It just doesn’t get any better than this. Click Reserve now!"

I had a wonderful stay and will definitely keep this place in mind for future trips in this area!"
2023-10-01,2.0,Stayed with kids,"Kevin was very nice and helpful. The place looked like the pictures but is an older home. One living room, bedroom, and restroom is in the basement along with the laundry machines. The stairs are narrow. Our biggest issue was a moldy smell and a bad smell coming from the bathroom on the main level. We didn't feel comfortable on the beds and linens. Kevin was accommodating, and we appreciated that."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great place to stay, very clean and the home size worked out perfectly for our group, also the host was very responsive and friendly."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great, if short, stay! We needed a place to stay in Morristown while we waited for our car to be repaired, and this was a great place to spend the night. The house is large, clean, and well-supplied with basics like soap, coffee, etc. Definitely recommend if you're in the area, particularly if you're a larger group (we were 3 adults and a toddler, had plenty of room to spread out and relax)."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Everything was as advertised, very cozy, quiet, close to all amenities and my place of work. Very relaxing visit. Thanks Keven......"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We ended up here on accident but wowqi Kevin's home is beautiful and every aspect is so comfy and clean. Since we only got to stay a night I cannot say much about surroundings/the area but this space is larger than you think. if you book with others it's easy to make and get your own space. I would most definitely recommend this home to those booking with at least 3 guests :)
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was our second time staying at this rental. Kevin responds to questions quickly, the rental is clean, well stocked and beautifully decorated. We were very comfortable staying at this location. We look forward to our next visit.
There is plenty of off street parking."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I was traveling home with my family from Arkansas and needed a safe clean space to stay. Kevins home was perfect for our stay. When we visit Tennessee we will be keeping this home in mind.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed for a horse show at Great Smokey Mtn Expo and Kevin’s place was exactly what we needed - great space, clean, comfortable, and good location!
Would definitely stay again!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home & very spacious.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The house was perfect for us. Two adults and a baby stayed for a month. This was our first time home in four years so we had several family members visit throughout the month we stayed. Having the extra guest rooms was perfect. Nobody had any complaints while they visited.
It's in an area close to all the new restaurants and is close enough to the interstate to not be an inconvenience. I would recommend Kevin's place to anyone that asked and have no reservations about staying here again in the future."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Always enjoy staying in one of Kevin's rentals.
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"We were in town due to my daughter's wedding, this home had everything we needed for our overnight stay. It was conveniently located and easy to find. very clean and comfortable."

2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"The home was perfect for our needs. We felt safe, the home was clean, beds were comfortable, and there was the perfect amount of space for us all. The exterior is deceiving - the home is quite spacious inside. Our only complaint was that there was no pizza cutter. 😉"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice house
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Nice place for a nicer price
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place with lots of room. Home is exactly as described in the listing. Kevin is always great to deal with, often answering questions and giving information before you even think to ask. Providing guests with Netflix is a simple but very appreciated little extra. Sometimes it is easier to just put Netflix on than trying to navigate a ""new"" channel line up of live TV. Having a Netflix account provided is nice so guests don't have to sign into their own and worry about remembering to sign out before they check out. This isn't a problem or a complaint, but a FYI for future renters, the tread (depth) on the steps going downstairs felt a little shorter than what I'm used to. The elderly may need to take extra caution if going downstairs."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,the best family gateway 😍will definitely recommend Kevin's place.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The home was perfect. It made us feel at home. The host was super responsive to any questions we had. Will definitely stay there again.

I was skeptical at first but we were very pleased that we chose the Kevin's arib&b. It was a great place that was very clean, roomy and very reasonably priced compared to checking in a hotel and renting 5 rooms. Being in the middle of Morristown it made it very close to travel to friends and family.
Thank you
Wayne Coldwell"

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,House is bigger than I expected from the pictures. Great house if you are staying with a larger group and need some separate areas (like for sleeping babies/kids). Extra large closet in the basement can fit a pack-n-play if you want your little one to be separate yet still close to your bedroom. Everything was exactly like the description. Great place to stay for families.

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was a gem! We were 4 adults on a business trip that needed a ""home base"" after working during the day to come back and strategize and work together in the evenings. A huge plus was to bring the family dog! The place had a lot of updates and was fresh and clean. We loved the basement bedroom and sitting area so we didn't feel cramped. Kevin went to a lot of trouble to put all the details together for local recommendations. It was a perfect stay!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Group trip,This place is amazing!! Super clean and the beds or so comfortable. The amenities were amazing. Definitely would stay here again.

2020-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Great location to prepare for our wedding!!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The easiest check in! Although the neighbors are close by, when you step inside you will forget all about them. The pictures online are great, but in person it’s perfect! It feels like you’ve stepped into your very own vacation home. The place is very neatly kept. You’ll have the basic amenities and a couple of extras; coffee, snack basket, cold bottles of water.
The area is very peaceful and for the most part private. I recommend waking up early and drinking coffee on the deck with the sunrise.
The hosts themselves are more than accommodating, they make you feel at home. They came with great recommendations on food places. The locally owned restaurants are really good, but be prepared to drive for your typical chain food places. As for the hosts, they even offered to take us out on their boat, so we did! Early morning guided fishing trip on the Cherokee Lake? Yes please! The boat ride itself is worth it, alone.
Do yourselves a favor, BOOK NOW!
Thank you for a fantastic stay!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Group trip,The house was located in a very friendly spot. It was clean upon arrival and had a secluded back yard. The air hockey table was broken which was a booking point for us but it wasn’t a deal breaker. A very spacious house to fit a bunch of people and it was located right by all the disc golf courses.
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"House was very spacious!! There was a bit of cleanliness that could be easily taken care of. Paint splatter in the entryway, master bath tub, etc. the air hockey table lost a screw during normal play. It was hard to get the key out of the lockbox, ended up getting it out but a better entry would be easier. Overall I would rent again because the property is spacious and a very beautiful place"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thank you very much for allowing us to come to your beautiful property...
Very clean and accessible to the lake...
I will definitely go back to your clean and beautiful house..."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"My sisters and I stayed here for our nephew's wedding in White Pine, TN. The location was perfect for the wedding as well as for visiting with family prior to the event. The house was clean and met our minimal needs. It's in a quite area and roomy enough for a large group. We didn't use the kitchen other than for morning coffee but it appeared to be stocked appropriately for cooking."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Ivis's place was super clean and convenient to the things we were doing in Morristown. In town to visit family, we were out and about quite a bit.

Bright decor throughout the home."

2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Kevin’s house provided great accommodation for our gathering of retired siblings. The house is an older home with a nice cosmetic rehab, clean, comfortable with large common areas for gathering and relaxing. Located in a quiet, clean, well-cared for neighborhood with easy access to Morristown and the surrounding area. The house was well stocked and ready for use when we arrived. Communication before, during and after our stay was exceptional, Kevin clearly has the hosting routine nailed down. Everyone in our party was very complimentary of all aspects of this rental and wouldn’t hesitate to book again should the opportunity ever arise."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very nice large home. Kitchen was great
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"My husband and brother sing in a gospel quartet and were invited to sing in a church in the area. We wanted to find a spot that was affordable enough and allowed all of us to stay together in one place that would allow the opportunity to do any last minute practice if needed. This was perfect! It allowed everyone their own space but also the ability to hang together. Also we weren’t certain how many from each of our families might tag along so it allowed enough available space to accommodate whoever decided to come. I can’t say enough about Kevin’s responsiveness. We wanted to be able to check in a little earlier if possible and he was able and willing to make that happen. We didn’t have any issues while there but if we did I’m sure he would’ve taken care of them as quickly as possible. While it may have been a little more expensive than staying in cheap hotel the value of being together in a clean and inviting environment was well worth it. Big family or multi, Highly Recommend!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Me and my family had a great time in Kevin’s home! Kevin was super responsive and made us feel welcomed! Highly recommend!

2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very nice place with plenty of room for our family to stay, gather and enjoy. Close to grocery, restaurants and mall. Movie room was great! The drive way is a bit dark if arrival at night. Could use some outside lightings on timers or motion lights. We had a great holiday break visiting family in the area! Thank you."
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Perfect place for our group to stay…loved the movie room for the guys to have their own place to watch TV. Bedrooms were nice and the 3 1/2 bathrooms were great! Will definitely stay here again

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Movie room was really a cherry on top here! Fenced in back with access from the basement was convenient
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Enjoyed our stay. Kevin was a great host and provided very clear, concise instructions. Home was clean and well maintained. Would recommend"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, would stay again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very great place, will stay here again soon!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Lovely home in a quite neighborhood. Home was spacious and well kept!
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Kevin’s place is absolutely gorgeous and has a tremendous amount of space for a large family. It’s very comfortable and extremely clean. The amenities are high end. I thought I was staying at a five star resort. The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. The neighbors are welcoming and helpful. The home is beautifully decorated and has an amazing media room for all to enjoy. Kevin is an amazing host that responds to you promptly and is extremely helpful. If I had to rate Kevin’s interaction with us, I would say he goes beyond “Superhost”. I would say he is a rare extraordinary Superhost. The home is not far from many beautiful cities such as Pigeon Forge, Gatlinburg, Knoxville, Jefferson City, and Rogersville. I’m sure there are many other beautiful cities to explore, but we just didn’t have the time. We will definitely be back and I highly recommend you stay at Kevin’s if your visiting Tennessee."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time renting Kevin's home. This time, I rented it for my best friend and her 4 young adult kids. They loved it and had lots of room to spread out. The biggest plus,it's one mile away from my new home!! We are still unpacking so we were not as ready as we had hoped to be to host our company/family.
The house is clean, nicely appointed, easy to feel right at home and conveniently located near grocery stores, restaurants, etc.
I would definitely recommend this home!! I am sure it won't be our last time either!!!
Thank you, Kevin!!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Kevins home was perfect for our family of 7 after a long day of traveling! Rooms were exactly as pictured, spacious, and comfortable. Kitchen, Laundry room and Restrooms were stocked with all necessities. We weren't there long enough to enjoy the movie room, but the kids were in awe of it! Check in was easy, even for our late night arrival. And last but not least; Kevin was a great host with quick responses. Would recommend!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Kevin was a great host. He proactively reached out and made sure we had all the information to make our stay enjoyable and as smooth as possible for the week+ that my group of 10 was there. It was so nice to have a place that felt like home to recharge each night after long days of activities in the area. We didn’t have small children but I noticed the extra care taken to cater to groups and families at all stages of life including a fenced yard, baby gates, etc. I would definitely stay here again when we’re back in the area."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a nice stay. The house was the right size for us to all have our own space. We liked the large table so we could all play games together. It was very hot and humid but the air conditioner kept us cool inside. The kids liked the movie theater. Nice to have the office desk as son in law ended up having to work some. The beds were comfy. Would stay here again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place.
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Kevin's home was just as he described. It was perfect for us. The screened in porch was amazing! Although we didn't get to use the movie room it looked amazing!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kevin was very communicative. We decided to get an Airbnb last minute instead of driving back out of town at night. It was quick and easy and within the hour, we were there and enjoying the movie room haha I wish every Airbnb had one of those! Thanks Kevin."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a lovely. I only stayed there for one night but I wish I could havebeen there longer. really nice
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We are very grateful for Kevin and allowing us to stay in his home. We just relocated from Florida and our moving truck was taking too long to get our stuff here. Our stay was very easy and comfortable and the home was clean. Our dogs loved the backyard too!! I would definitely recommend this home to others!

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Had a great stay. The house can easily accommodate 2 to 3 families. It was super clean and the kitchen and bathroom were well stocked with the essentials.

2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Wonderful stay! We originally booked with the intention of bringing our dog, which was no issue at all! Nice big backyard if you have kids or doggies.
The house has its own online manual which was super helpful since we were traveling with a group of people who would be in and out at various times. It’s located on the west end of Morristown, tucked away in the hills, just perfect for what we needed! Quick access to I-40 or Andrew Johnson HW. It had plenty of space, blankets, towels and the beds were very comfortable. Already has shampoo, conditioner and body wash in every bathroom along with a straightener, hair dryer and curling iron! Made packing much easier! Can’t thank Kevin enough for opening up his home!!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Kevins place is truly amazing 10/10. This is the beast place near Morristown to stay!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kevin will make sure your stay is exactly what you expect. Follow his dining recommendations we went to 3 of 3. Pals has good old thick American burgers.
2022-07-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"House is close to main stores. The price is not to bad, although there isn't a whole lot to do in Morristown. It also wasn't super clean but I believe if they put a little effort into cleaning, it would be fine. There is a camera on the front porch which feels like an invasion of privacy. All in all, if the camera wasn't there I would stay here again."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great home. Perfect layout, so much space for a group! Kids loved the theater room, and the extra air mattresses ensured everyone had a comfortable place to sleep. House was very clean, plenty of towels, extra sheets and blankets too!"

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Lovely home! Warm, comfortable and lots to do. Nice big, backyard and a gas grill (which we didn’t use). Kevin was very responsive, and was proactive. He has this down to a science. The information he sent was relative and not overwhelming."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Kevin had clear communication and a really nice home that is perfect for Airbnb
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Just want to say Kevin was awesome and the home is better then the pictures. Very cozy, close to shopping and food places, in a nice quiet area. we had emergency at another Airbnb and booked Kevin place at 12:45 in the morning. Kevin made a special accommodation for me and my family and saved a trip and my kids got to see snow for the first time! The communication WiFi passwords and expectations was very professional and prompt. I’ve stayed at a lot of Airbnb but this is the most professional homes I stayed in great job!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a wonderful home to spend Thanksgiving in. This home had everything we needed during our stay. Very conveniently located. Kevin was a very helpful and organized host.
2021-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"I cannot recommend this place enough. I came here with a few friends for a Friendsgiving, and the place was perfect. The kitchen was spacious and was stocked with cooking supplies, there were plenty of (comfortable!) beds, and we loved the screened-in porch."
2021-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"The home is beautiful, clean, well-stocked, and roomy. Our family was in town for a wedding, and there was plenty of room for us, our 5 adult
children, and two little pups. We enjoyed coffee on the screened porch surrounded by red & gold autumn trees.
Kevin is the most organized AirBnB host we have ever rented from. Communication was excellent every step of the way, and he is very responsive for any questions or concerns. Even after we checked out, I realized I left an item behind, and he graciously offered to mail it to, easy breezy.
I highly recommended Kevin and his home in Morristown."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Kevin offered my family and I a very clean and quaint spot for a super short getaway. We loved the movie theater and the ample choice for where to bed down. Location is super convenient to town and host is quick to respond. Not to mention flexible in how he can help. Thank you Kevin!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was Big and clean. The beds were very comfortable. Would 100% recommend this place for a nice family get away.

All the rooms are clean and comfortable.
Amenities are excellent.
We felt Kevin's good hospitality^^
I am sure we will have another reservation on Kevin's place for our next visit."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was great, we made this trip with my wife and family for our anniversary, house is clean. Kevin replies very quickly, took care of a small problem with the door the very next day. Overall, a great place and fun."
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,It was very clean and had everything you needed!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,place is absolutely amazing and super cheap! this is a giant house with an amazing theater setup with couches that have built in wireless chargers and full surround sound. amazing master bedroom. just all around awesome! Definitely coming back
2021-07-01,4.0,Group trip,"We could not have asked for a better place to stay during our trip to Morristown. The location was perfect - close to anything you could need. We thoroughly enjoyed our coffee out on the porch, except for the several hornets that were also enjoying the patio. Our family was grateful for all the space and the large fenced in yard. Overall it was a wonderful trip!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Awesome place! Kevin is a great host! Highly recommend!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,House was wonderful and as advertised. Kevin's communication and service was excellent. We were in the area just for one night and this was a much better alternative compared to renting a room elsewhere. We really appreciated the Britta water pitcher!!!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,pictures are not deceiving. Its as nice as shown.
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"lovely house in a good location, a few minutes from grocery and restaurants. but this house has a small issue with pests."

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything is perfect!!! Love it!!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time in Kevins house. It was clean and had a great kitchen with all you would need to cook a great meal. We had plenty of space and we were all very comfortable. It was in a great little neighborhood, but far from all the tourist things in Gatlinburg. Depending on what you like that could be a positive or negative. Lots do in the area!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful stay for a lake day! It was gorgeous! The roads are a bit winding driving up to it but it makes the drive fun. I would love to stay there again sometime soon! 10/10 :)
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,The cottage was clean and neat. The views were beautiful.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,If you’re looking for a peaceful place to relax this is the spot! We loved it here.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our little getaway. The kitchen could’ve been laid out a little better however, I have no complaints. We had a beautiful time and loved the spot loved fishing and enjoy the peace and quiet well worth the time, energy, and money to get there."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What can i say the view was amazing the place was great.. we will be back

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Clean place
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Picture perfect stay - thank you!
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Very clean. If you like a very firm mattress, than you're in luck. They even supply you with tea bags and k cups. Very nice. There are several steps to get to the ""Catfish Cabin"". Also it is a good idea to bring a flash light. Little hard to see the steps at night....Not lighted very well. Beautiful view of the lake. Johana and Hank were great with communication. They were very helpful. Would recommend this place."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you for letting us stay in such short notice while we toured LMU for our daughter. It was a great place to stay- wished we could have relaxed longer!!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay at a clean, well maintained Airbnb. Photos were accurate, the furniture was comfortable and the hosts were great. I wouldn’t change a thing and would definitely stay again. I wasn’t bothered by noise from the unit above as others have mentioned; it’s no more noise than would come from normal apartment living."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,it was such an amazing place. the view of the lake is absolutely beautiful and the home is incredible!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Johanna and Hank's place was exactly as described. It was very clean and comfortable. The location although a little difficult get too was beautiful. Lovely views of the lake and the sunset. We had a great stay and would stay again. We and a little problem with the water going out at the very end of our stay, but that has been solved now. We were there in the winter, I am sure it is even more beautiful in warm weather."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Fun and beautiful place! The layout of the home was nice. Getting luggage down the hill and back up again (stairs and not fully paved) was not the easiest thing. Loved the outdoor common areas and dock though!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place for a good price, only thing is that you have to park a little far any carry your luggage down a flight of stairs"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Hank was a very warm host who always went out of his way to help us with everything we needed . Property just by the lake and the fireplace just out of your living room is such a great combination and this property just gives you that.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay in that part of the state, any time of year. Comfortable and safe."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great views
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful location! The photos don’t do it justice. It wasn’t an issue for us because we needed to be back on the road early in the morning but you can hear EVERYTHING from the unit above. Host is super responsive!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful place
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I enjoyed my time there. Thank you.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This house was quite a treat! It was my first stop on a solo roadtrip and exactly what the doctor ordered! Hank was responsive and helped me navigate my way in the dark to find the place at midnight! Great hosts and awesome place. Can’t wait to come back!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The lake view was absolutely gorgeous! Loved how clean and neat the place was. The email sent gave us all the information we needed to know - this was super helpful! Thank you - we had a lovely stay!
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you so much! Your place was so cutely decorated and clean! It was great having the fire pit right outside our door! Beautiful view!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I was nervous about the size of the road you arrive to the air bnb on and they offered a full refund due to the inconvenience. I decided to stay because it was so beautiful and relaxing and they made the stay feel very peaceful. The hosts put a lot of effort into making me comfortable even though the air bnb was slightly hard to find on night one. Everything is well signed and the descriptions for parking were spot on. Would stay again!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks. It is an amazing place.
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,The decking needs replaced in a few places and the steps are really steep on one leading down to the cabin. Over all satisfied with the stay and would recommend. Would stay again
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,it is a beautiful place on the lake clean and equipped with everything you may need. It is a walk from the parking spot but bring a wagon and you will be just fine!
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful place inside an amazing location. You hear everything from the apartment above and the description lead you to believe it’s a private cabin not a basement apartment. When you have a lot of things, the parking situation leaves a lot to be desired with no steps leading down into the yard."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful cabin overlooking the lake; loved sitting on the dock at twilight. The place was immaculate; all the amenities needed.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Awesome place to spend a weekend. Great views of the lake.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Just beautiful! Very hard to leave
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"we enjoyed our stay and the hosts were responsive and friendly.
unfortunately, there is another unit directly above this one and you will hear nearly every step from you upstairs neighbor.
majority of the space is shared with the other 3 cabins, so the stay felt a little more crowded then we prefer.
still had a good time, the lake was great. fair price point."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A lovely cabin! The apartment was spacious and clean, and the lake was beautiful. The stairs down to the door are tough in the dark but nothing unmanageable. I would absolutely come back and stay longer."
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay. Would stay again. Perfect for one night. However, be aware that the parking for this unit is not even in the driveway. It’s in the grass at the top of a hill. Not ideal and didn’t feel great about leaving my car overnight. For what you pay, you should have a parking space like the other tenants at the units at the same property."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place on the water! Very nice and very clean. You might want to bring your own pillows though.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,It was an awesome place to stay on Cherokee Lake!
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Being in the bottom unit, footsteps above are a bit disruptive at night and bed is quite squeaky, as well as the bedroom door. WiFi cut out every 10-20 minutes while trying to watch Netflix on provided TV.
The hosts were kind and very responsive when we had a concern during our stay and it was seamless to check in. I also appreciated there wasn’t a laundry list of check out rules! Overall a decent stay for the price!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely a beautiful spot and would highly recommend for an overnight/weekend getaway. Space was clean and matched photos however it was not as private as the listing made it seem. There are several units on this property, this one being a nicely renovated basement of an upstairs unit with a great outdoor space a view. There are a fair amount of steps, yard, and slopped driveways to navigate to this unit from the designated parking space which is the furthest away from the access point (essentially off property)."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cute and clean with a great view. Johana and Hank were very helpful when we got lost.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Gorgeous place to stay. We were only stopping for a night of rest but we may just have to return for a weekend getaway. Beautiful views, right next to the water, and some outdoor areas where you could potentially make some friends! Not to mention it was pet friendly! I definitely recommend it."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,This is a great spot for a couples getaway! Small and quaint but very peaceful.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great experience
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The scenery was absolutely beautiful and the cabin was modern and even nicer than the pictures. I think this place is a pretty good choice for a little retreat or a stop on a road trip. My only complaints are the lock to the door is a bit temperamental and does not seem the most secure. I also think blinds on the sliders would go a long way, as you have no privacy when other guests use the fire pit outside. Other than these pretty minor mishaps, I really enjoyed my time here."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Johana & Hank were easy to work with.
The lake is BEAUTIFUL and I spent most of the time outside on the water.
I didn't like that the listing says it sleeps up to four but to get to the bathroom you have to go through the two-person bedroom. The space and updates are great but it was missing small things like oven mitts for the toaster and it didn't have enough flatware for four people. The lake is beautiful and the shower felt like a spa!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent hosts! Great time on the water and surrounding area. Stunning views across the lake
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely spot, with peaceful sitting areas in the yard and on the dock. Apartment was very clean, nicely appointed. Host was super responsive when we needed assistance for a late check-in in the dark, and VERY gracious about my mistaking the departure date!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location and perfect cleanliness, everything was spectacular, very kind hosts, I will definitely be back and there is a grill to do a barbecue."
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute little place for a couple. Host was very nice.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place is beautiful! I highly recommend it
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay. The cabin was extremely clean, the lake view was pretty, and having a grill and fire pit was very nice. I would have liked to know before hand that the unit was a lower unit in a cabin and had other people staying above us, but overall the place was very nice."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Stayed here with my fiance, dog, and little brother and had an amazing time. we made the best of our short stay and had a great time kayaking on the lake and roasting marshmallows by the fire. We've already discussed coming back in the summer! This place is a gem."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Fantastic location and lodging. My wife and I would stay there again. It really is a beautiful, serene location."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful downstairs unit by the lake. The space was very open and modern. Defiantly will stay again!
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place, newly and nicely decorated, clean. bathroom is very well done. the kitchen is small and no dishwasher. The views of Cherokee Lake are beautiful. We very much enjoyed the fire pit.
Be aware it is a lower level unit sharing decks with other cabins on the property. Otherwise very secluded. There are a lot of steps down to the water/dock. And a couple long staircases from the parking spot to the unit."
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a super nice little place in a great location and well worth the cost. There are some things to be aware of though as well.
Pros - great/responsive hosts. I was able to extend our stay for a day and a couple minor things the prop mgr is nearby to help with quickly. It's clean, in a gorgeous location and what seemed like a nice and safe area. It's not too far to town if anything is needed.
Cons - unit is the lower level of a building, there's another unit right above you, so depending on who's staying there it could be noisy. We met the people staying above us - they were great, but that may not always be the case. The kitchen is small - the fridge/coffee/toaster oven all kind of share space, so you need to move the fridge in and out so the doors clear each other. Parking is a little awkward, and plan to haul your stuff a fair distance down a hill and stairs. Be aware of neighbor dogs - they'll come after vehicles and lay in the road.
Overall - great value, we'd stay again."
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cooking is limited, there is no dishwasher or washer/dryer, but the place is beautiful with an amazing view. It is hard to find though."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,i was obsessed. it’s so cute!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,the home was gorgeous and so cute! i loved it so much!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Pleasant stay
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful scenery; super cute, clean home. Hosts were also very responsive. It can be difficult finding the entry way but they called me instantly and walked me through it."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,absolutely one of the most beautiful places I've stayed! perfect for mine and the hubby's weekend getaway! will definitely book again.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved our stay. It was very peaceful and the views were amazing. It was very spacious and had everything we needed. Watching the sun set and ride by the lake was amazing. We will come back forsure!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place was wonderful. Everything is new and top of the line. We’d stay again for sure. So pretty.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"After a breakup and the one year anniversary of my fathers passing, I decided that I needed to escape somewhere clean, quiet, and off the beaten path. Johana and Hank’s property was exactly what I needed. It was in driving distance of Johnson City, Cumberland Gap, Knoxville which was great for hiking and sightseeing.
Bonus points for being able to bring my pup and for how responsive they were to my questions!
I would absolutely recommend staying here to any solo travelers and would love to come back with my family!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We were so pleased with our stay in Bean Station. The view of the lake was so amazing. The place was very clean, with great space. It was absolutely what we needed for a stay in the area. I was very happy I could bring the newest family member (our pup). There was some noise from the people in the apartment above."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The unit was clean and neat. We had plenty of drawer space for our things! I love that! Often you get there and there's no place for clothing and you have to live out of the suitcase. But here, we had plenty of room to unpack. Also, not a lot of clutter on tables or furniture or in the bathroom, so we could spread out. Made it feel much more like home! We had a minor problem with a leak in the ceiling that was quickly addressed. Overall, we enjoyed our stay. The view was beautiful and we recommend this spot."
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The listing does not state that this is a lower level of a cabin where there will be other guests/residents above you. That was communicated via the hosts once I already booked and they sent check-in instructions. Had I known that, I would not have picked this place as I was seeking a private getaway. While it was mostly peaceful, I woke up to footsteps above us before my alarm went off, and I heard a man yell the evening before. I didn’t like the particular parking and requirement to essentially navigate the grounds a certain way because of the multiple, separate residences on the property.
Aside from that, everything was great. The place was as cute and clean as pictured. I asked a couple of questions and the hosts were super responsive and helpful. I also liked that the listing was available for a one-night stay versus a two-night minimum like a lot of places require."
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"I thought the space was very beautiful and comfortable!! The photos are exactly what you get when you show up! The instructions were clear for us to understand from where to park and how to navigate the cabin spaces. There are other rentals on the same property, but still very private! In this space, it is under another cabin so you can hear the people walking above you, but it wasn’t much of a disturbance. The view is very pretty from the living room, but my only recommendation would be to have a curtain or something for guests to have more privacy. The sliding door was completely open with no way to cover, so anyone who may be passing can see into the living room/kitchen especially during the night when you can’t see outside but people can see inside lol. The bedroom is completely private which is good. The road leading up is veeeery narrow. You would have to let other cars pass or other cars let you pass, if there is even room for that. Overall great though!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay, right on Lake Cherokee. About an hour from Pigeon Forge, easy commute. Rental was just as pictured. Keypad entry. We enjoyed our low-key New Years Eve away from our busy city life. The bed was very comfortable as was the furniture. Decor was modern and tasteful. Hosts were very resposive to any questions we had. Id love to see this place in the summer!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks again! We had a great stay. Wonderful place, we stayed (2)nights while on a road trip. Much needed downtime & this place delivered. Peaceful & quiet, no complaints from us!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Excellent location, great host."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The cabin exceeded our expectations! What a perfect little place exactly what we needed and such a beautiful view! Wish we had time to stay longer and explore the area.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was beautiful
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nice place. Bathroom had someone else’s hair on the floor. Back area was nice but we had no wood to make a fire and the leaves were all over it and seat cushions were dirty. Place overall was nice just a few tweeks: wash rags, more kitchen towels, cleaner back area and water pressure in shower was flat.
Having said all that, it was nice and peaceful."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is my second time staying here. The place is beautiful and the hosts are amazing. Highly recommend!

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay on the lake! We only stayed one night, as a halfway point on our road trip back home, but so glad we chose Johana and Hank’s place! It was so relaxing after a day of driving. The home itself was immaculately clean, beautifully decorated, and had everything we needed. The shower is like a spa! The bed and couch were extremely comfortable. And my fiancé loved the big screen for football. We will absolutely be back for a longer stay!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This little apartment is a perfect getaway for a couple. It's spacious, bright, clean, and beautiful. The bed is comfy, the huge shower is great, and the kitchen had just enough for a long weekend. The access to the lake is unbeatable!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect little spot for a quiet getaway. Ample amenities, extremely clean, great views."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had an amazing time! Everything was clean and comfortable, we really enjoyed our stay! The lake is absolutely gorgeous, what a fun place to relax."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful, beautiful space and we and our pup loved it! Dock is perfect for a boat rental or just swimming around! Note the common spaces are shared with many other units (potentially 20+ people) but everyone was friendly and not out at the same spaces at the same time! Great views and perfect for a weekend getaway! Will definitely be back!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriend and I had a lovely stay, easy access to the lake and beautiful views made our time very enjoyable. The rental is small but perfect for the 2 of us, we were very cozy. There are other units on this property, our unit is below one of the others and you can hear the upstairs neighbors some but it wasn't a problem. Each rental has its' own outdoor space so we never felt encroached on. We would definitely stay again, very quiet area and perfect for a relaxing getaway."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This location was just like the pictures. The place was a clean, modern efficiency perfect to come home to after a long day out on the water!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and very beautiful!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Second time staying on the property! Really enjoy the view and how peaceful it is.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place! Has everything you need, right on the lake. Parking is the only downfall. It’s a small patch of grass by the road with little to no room to turn around. There are signs all over telling you that you cannot turn around in the neighbors driveway, which makes it very difficult to get in and out of. If you plan on bringing a boat here, don’t! You won’t be able to park it, and it would be a literal nightmare to turn around. And backing all the way out the one lane road to the main road would also be a nightmare."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a great stay with Johana & Hank! Any small issues/requests were efficiently dealt with and they were kind and courteous! Would recommend 😊
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was the cleanest place we've stayed at in the area. We had a great time and our dogs loved it. Will definitely be coming back!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great rental with an amazing view! The hosts were very responsive and definitely a place we will come back to!

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you're looking for a cute, clean, and peaceful spot by the lake, then this is the perfect place to book! The location was easy to get to and the accommodation was perfect for a little getaway. Check-in was super easy and the unit is close to town if you need supplies. Would rebook!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place looked brand new- large dock with deep water for swimming, fishing, or just relaxing!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this spot, such a beautiful peaceful location!!! We wish we stayed longer. The unit/cabin we stayed in was immaculate and beautifully decorated as shown in the pictures. If we end up in bean station again….this will be our go to!
Thank you"
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space is beautiful and brand new, and the lakefront location with dock access is primo. My pup & I really loved swimming and lounging on the dock, and there’s a nice state park with great trails nearby. There were some first-time renter glitches that hopefully won’t be an issue for future guests. Also note that this is a downstairs unit in a multi-unit property, so it’s not particularly private and there’s a fair amount of noise from the upstairs neighbors."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We were honored to be the first guests in this exquisite AIRBNB. Well designed and beautifully decorated this was a great overnight stay. took a dip in the lake and watched fire flies on the patio. Loved it and even took design ideas for our home. Thanks
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Getting the apartment spontaneously was as described and really cheap. Very good for a new host, but there is still some room for improvement. But I am sure Karla will do that too. Definitely recommended if you need a cheap overnight stay."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved it, just understand it's over an hour to pigeon forge and Gatlinburg, not 30-45 minutes as listen in the description.
Otherwise was clean and went the extra mile with toiletries, waters, etc."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was just what I needed! I stayed one night, with plans to go to Dollywood the next day. The place looked just like the photos. I was traveling alone, and I felt safe in the home, the neighborhood, and at the nearby disc golf park I went to. My host was incredibly responsive, but she also gave me my personal space. It was everything I wanted."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"On our way from DC to Nashville we stopped in Morristown and spent the night at Karla’s place. She was very flexible about our late check in, the room was clean and we had everything we need. Karla answered quick and always made sure that we feel safe and comfortable. We definitely recommend her as a host. Thank you!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Karla’s place is very nice! She is super friendly and Evan excellent communicator. Karla really went the extra mile to make sure that we were comfortable during our stay. The space is very cute and cozy.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This home met all our needs and is in a great location. It is a well kept older home with some modern updates and plenty of room. It is very homey feeling inside and the hosts have made sure to provide many additional items such as extra cleaning supplies, plenty of linens, books, games, etc. The showers were hot, the sheets soft and clean and the AC worked great! The neighborhood felt quiet and safe. Would stay here again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"we are locals and stayed here while having some renovations done to our home. Sarahs home is a lovely place and is a great location! Very quite neighborhood. You will hear the trains, but not bothersome at all. Everthing is very clean, and both larger BR have Tvs as well as the living room, so that was really nice for us. We worked everyday so basically all we did was sleep and shower. I didn't cook but the kitchen is very nice and spacious. We would definitely stay here again if the need arises."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were able to book Sarah’s place last minute as we were coming into town to help a family member move. Communication began right away, and check-in was so easy. We found the beautiful home immaculately clean and so comfortable. She’s an excellent host, and we would definitely stay again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Sarah’s place was perfect for our family weekend in Morristown, TN! It was close to parks, restaurants and grocery stores, which was handy for our trip. The home is truly “family-friendly” and I appreciated the simple furniture and toys for my one-year-old. The snacks were also a plus since we were arriving late!!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My wife and I enjoyed Sarah’s home very much. The layout was great. The kitchen and dining area is quite large, with everything you need. The living room is great for relaxing. The bedrooms and bathrooms were excellent. The beds were very comfortable.
Everything was very clean and taken care of. It was as described or better. It is a perfect location, near enough for day trips to Dollywood/Gatlinburg/Pigeon Forge, the tri city/NE area, and the Cumberland Plateau.
Sarah and Barbara’s communication was excellent.
The neighborhood was slightly louder than we expected, (mowing at 6:20 am, dogs barking, etc.) but that is to be expected as you are walking distance to much of the city, and a 2-5 minute drive to the majority of the shops and downtown area of Morristown.
We were very happy with our stay and would recommend Sarah’s home to everyone."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Enjoyed our stay here. Sarah was so accommodating and responsive when we asked for an extra night! The house is cozy amd my children loved all of her board games. ❤️

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home was wonderful. Clean, no issues with the home. There were some sketchy people hanging out in the parking lot that borders the back border of the property. It appeared they lived in their car, and they moved along after a few hours. We had no issues at all with the neighbors. There is a train that comes through several times per day that is close enough to be easily heard. Outside of that, the house was great and we would definitely stay again."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Sarah's house was comfortable, a great location and very clean. definitely a good place to stay"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was a great house to stay in very clean and had a lot of room. Only thing that I could say bad was the living room area smell like mothballs.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Sarah’s place was perfect for my graduation weekend! We had plenty of room, the space was cozy and clean, and we felt right at home!

I would absolutely stay again and highly recommend this Airbnb!"

While the outside of the house might strike you as older, the inside has been nicely redone and was comfortable and felt like home. There were plenty of games and things for families. A person in my party has mobility challenges and the front entrance and small step down into the kitchen were very manageable. The house is located near plenty of shopping and restaurants. We definitely recommend this house for your next stay in Morristown and the surrounding area."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely LOVE Sarah’s home. We have secretly declared it our Morristown vacation home (lol) and we just pray it will be available each time we go.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Sarah was very thorough in making sure our needs were met. We wish there had been a few more pans in the kitchen but we made due.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at Dillon's space downtown. It was beautifully furnished and had plenty of amenities like popcorn machine, darts, fireplace, wine fridge, jacuzzi tub, steam shower, the list goes on! It was right in the middle of the downtown area and even with a transit van, we always had a spot to park. Entry and exit were a breeze with the lockbox. The only areas that could have been improved were timeliness of responses, and there happened to be some long hairs on the towels. No evidence that they weren't cleaned, this could have just been something that was floating around. We just grabbed another one from the many towels available. Foot traffic in front of the windows was heavy, so we opened and closed the blinds as necessary to feel comfortable. As Dillon states in his house instructions, the blinds are delicate. Unfortunately they fell during our stay (sorry!). Otherwise the place was spotless, perfectly located, and I would definitely not hesitate to stay again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great spot! Highly recommend

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the location. Sweet little restaurant a block away. Also there was a festival that weekend to enjoy along with the brewery. Great place to have my hometown girls come hang out while I was in town visiting.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely had the BEST stay. Only a few dust bunnies, but only in a few spots, nothing to worry about really though. The space and furniture was SO nice and beautiful. It completely checked every box for me and our needs. Freezer space was hard to fit the frozen pizzas in, but we only had to keep them in there around an hour or so. Overall, highly recommend!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Internet speed 183down 236up
We live in Airbnbs full time (going on 2 years). This is the best one we have ever stayed in. Comfortable, cute, very well appointed, and perfect location for easy walking to all of downtown Morristown. Personal touches such as a working, old-fashioned, popcorn cart, a dart board, a record player (with records you’d want to listen to), and a kitchen that would make Gordon Ramsay smile.
It is at the top of our places to return."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying at Dillon’s place. The accommodations are beautiful, modern, clean and relaxing. Communication was quick and easy if we had questions. We have family in the area and will definitely stay again. Five stars from us! Thanks, Dillon!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This cabin is absolutely fantastic with great views. Being able to pull our boat up to the back yard is amazing. Kids loved the game room. Highly recommend coming in August when the water is at its highest. We found an island with a rope swing and swimming area too. We also loved being able to bring the dogs and have fun with the whole family! 10/10 recommend.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was just as described. However, the pictures don't really do it justice. The hill is steep, however fairly easy to manage, and we do appreciate the heads up! The cabin temp was perfect, and each room had an additional fan if needed. The cabin was clean. The kitchen was fully equipped, all we needed was our own food. The game room was perfect for the two 15 year old boys we had with us.
The beach is very private. I was a little concerned about having the neighbors so close, however, we seldom saw them, and we pretty much had the lake to ourselves. Boat traffic was very minimal. Visiting around was pretty easy as well. Traveling around was easy as well, your location wasn't too far away from the more popular areas.

We had planned to have a campfire, but it was still quite warm at night, so were opted to watch a movie in the nice cool game room two of the nights. Cheryl was very easy to get ahold of and answered my questions quickly."

,,,The beds are poorly constructed. Most of the flooring in the house is crooked and the stairs were cried to the point of feeling unsafe. The heating system would only heat two rooms way too hot while everyone else froze!
