2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything was very nice. The home is clean and the beds we’re comfortable. The host reached out prior to our arrival and wanted to ensure that we would have adequate parking for our truck and trailer. We will definitely recommend this home to others and be back if we are in need of a place to stay while playing at the Beaver Dunes!

The co-host was great at communicating, and checked in to ensure everything was as it should be. The place looks exactly like the pictures. It was very inviting, and felt like home! This was definitely a great find in such a small town! Will definitely stay here again when back visiting family!"

We were only there for a quick overnight stop, so it was much more than we needed, but still very nice. If you're in Beaver, this is a great place to stay."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My family of 4 stayed at Drew's place for my father's funeral. The house was simply adorable. The beds were so comfy, and there was more space than we expected. The entire house was very clean, and they had everything we needed. The host was very friendly and showed real concern when I was unable to get into my Airbnb account to respond to his messages. My father had been missing for some time, so the town was aware of his passing. The host was so kind and thoughtful to leave a single rose on the kitchen counter in my father's memory. I will definitely stay at Drew's place again when we return to Beaver to visit in the future. Thank you for everything."

They even let me keep my bicycle in the foyer to be extra safe! Met me at the door, personal sign as I walked in welcoming me, showed me my room and the beverage nook (free soda, water, coffee, hot chocolate) and even helped me find a restaurant for a to-go order!
Room was spacious and beautiful, with separate vanity room and bathroom... Almost more like a suite than just a room. Bed was comfy and since I had to leave so early, they were kind enough to make me a Grab & Go breakfast! I'll definitely be staying here again!
Only suggestions I have:
- A sign with B&B visible from the road

The hosts were very responsive and willing to help. The only issue we really had was not at all their fault.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic guest house on a small ranch in Hooker, a perfect alternative to the standard Panhandle hotel/motel. Mignon was responsive to all messages, went out of her way to accommodate our early arrival, and was a wonderful communicator through the AirBnB platform. The guest house was spotless and comfortable, and offered way more space than we needed or would have received elsewhere."
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"My sons and I come to this area to pheasant hunt. Instead of the same ole motel routine we decided to try something different.
This was everything that was listed. A beautiful well equipped place with a super cool basement.
Hope to stay here again next year."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely satisfied with our stay. House is beautiful, clean and very peaceful area. Wish we could have enjoyed it more. 10 out 10 recommend!! Complementary home made bread is delicious. Hamburger meat as well! Definitely planning on coming back!!"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was huge and very clean! The host was super nice and even gave us some complimentary banana bread and hamburger meat from their ranch. We were greeted by a very friendly ranch cat on the way out. Our stay was short, but it was wonderful!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything was great. This house is very nice. It is much bigger than the pictures show. We loved our stay.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay if you are staying in the panhandle. Mignon was very helpful to my family as we came together for a funeral. Will definitely use again if we all need to come together again.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,One of my favorite airbnbs ever. Everything was perfect. Mignon and her family were so kind. Woke up to 2 calfs eating grass in front yard a memory my kids will have forever. Loved Liced this place . Definitely will be back!

2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Nice place very nice hosts definitely recommend to anyone passing through! Nice clean and comfortable very fun place and generous hosts
Can’t thank them enough!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,An unfortunate family funeral gathering brought us to this nice ranch AirBnb. It was nice to have family in one place during this sad time. Mignon even brought home made goodies! Everybody enjoyed their accommodations. Will book again! A+

2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very nice, clean house with nice owners"
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,It was just what we were looking for
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was such a great home for our big family. We needed a place with lots of space and beds, this was perfect. It was warm and welcoming that made us feel right at home."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We used the house as part of a family get together due to it's central location for everyone coming. We were all so impressed with the house! It was clean and had a great layout with various living areas, bedrooms, and bathrooms. Sometimes on-line pictures can be deceiving but not this place, it was more impressive than we expected when we arrived! Mignon takes great care of this place, is very easy to work with, and has an affordable price point. We will most assuredly consider having future stay here mostly because of our experience with the house and Mignon."
2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great house, very clean and well stocked with what you need."
2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Wow! Talk about a Super Host!!!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a very roomy house with a well stocked kitchen. It was a great location for my family to get together for Thanksgiving.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mignon’s place is wonderful!! Clean, beautiful, comfortable - with so many thoughtful touches!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a wonderful place to stay!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great property. Clean and spacious with a kitchen with all the cookware/dishes etc you will ever need!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a quiet and spacious place to get away from it all, this is the place!!!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Loved the place and location.I would definitely recommend to anyone looking to stay afar and still feel at home! Mignon is a very gracious host! We enjoyed the beef! Will definitely be staying again!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Huge space with three floors, lots of beds. Super friendly outside cats and dog! Really enjoyed the local ground beef, and zucchini bread."
2021-10-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"It was nice to find a place near our friends to stay. It was spacious and unique so the kids loved the house. The kitchen was well stocked with nice pans and utensils to make our own meals. I hope you use my old school potato masher when there ❤️ because it got left behind by mistake. The abundance of two plate sets allowed us to not have to wash between meals too, so we spent more time visiting. The outside patio table allowed us to enjoy the weather and make a fall wreath. The bathrooms were stocked with clean linen and finding hairspray available in the bathroom saved the day. The large friendly cats were funny. The farm was a favorite of the kids and my daughter loved the calf but I strongly recommend children not be allowed to roam with a bbgun while the property is occupied. By the grace of God our stay ended well."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"When we arrived we were extremely happy with our choice to stay there due to the house being spotless, spacious and peaceful. It was kid friendly as they had crayons and coloring books and kids puzzles which we appreciated due to having two kids under 3 with us. With the limited options in this area this has to be the best option by far and I would highly recommend. Matter of fact we booked it on our way home too and can’t wait to stay again"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I sincerely doubt there is a better place to stay in the area!
There are 3 floors, each with their own sleeping area as well as an extra space to sit and relax. There is a large front porch to escape and a picnic bench out the backdoor. I was glad there was an enormous garage to park your vehicle. And the stars, oh my goodness, I think you could actually see other galaxies ( of course, I am not an astronomer).
You would be absolutely crazy to stay in a hotel if this place is available!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was the perfect place for our family of 6. The house was very clean and the decorations were perfect. We enjoyed being able to stay in Hooker as we visited family. The hostess had the cutest welcome sign, homemade chocolate banana nut bread, and we had access to farm fresh ground beef.
We highly recommend this Airbnb if you are traveling through the OK Panhandle and need a place to stop."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A perfect place for a short or longer stay. Absolutely super and attentive host. A truly clean, comfortable and well maintained house, great beds. A very quiet and beautiful location in Western Oklahoma."

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Incredibly beautiful and spacious house! 10/10 recommend!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Weather you want a great place for two of you or for six this is the place to stay. The house is great and modern in every way except the city noise. Easy to find of the main road but not so far you can’t be back on it in five minutes.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a lovely home on a fun cattle farm! Very spacious, clean and accommodating! Thanks for the nice stay!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was a great stay
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean and spacious. Felt safe to stay alone while working at the local school. Would be a great place for family gatherings or get togethers for people that live far apart or even families that need a large space to eat and stay the night.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our first stay of probably several here. It is conveniently located just out of town and on a direct route to my Aunt's house. The house is very roomy and tastefully decorated. We had plenty of room for family to gather that were in Hooker this weekendfor a memorial service at First Christian Church. We will be back again.
2021-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house is so cute. Easy to find location. Our group of 3 couples had plenty of privacy and space to spread out, but also several spaces to congregate. Many extra touches to make us feel truly at home. Great hosts with excellent response time. Perfect place for a quick stop on your way to somewhere else, but I could have stayed a week!!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you are looking for a family stay in the country that will allow peaceful surroundings at a great value, this is a lovely place! Host had welcome note and loaf of banana bread waiting upon arrival, along with pound of ground beef from ranch for those that grill. These were just some of the nice amenities. Overall, lovely home and stay."

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very nice stay if you are in the area! We stayed for just one night on our way through town but it was very nice, spacious, and looked even better than the pictures!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Hands down the best stay yet!! We recommended this stay a million times over! house was super clean! and we literally walked in and had a beautiful arrangement so snacks and drinks! Bathrooms also had toiletries and plenty of necessities provided!!! Unfortunately our daughter got very sick and we had to make an unexpected ER visit.. I could not imagine having her so.sick in a hotel room! and the snacks and drinks we very much appreciated by my teenagers while I sat in ER with our daughter! I can not begin to tell how grateful we are to you guys! Thank you! so much! We will definitely be back soon!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ we give this one 5 stars! and more!

2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Shea did an excellent job communicating and supplying anything the guests might need! Cold water bottles in fridge, snackies on counter, large selection of bathroom essentials. Plenty of clean towels and washcloths. The cleanliness and condition of the house is mediocre."
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place, very responsive and helpful host. Very spacious and accommodating."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Shae was a great host and communicated with us. If we are back in the area we will stay again.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Camry is an incredible host and I would recommend this place a million times over. Super clean and comfortable space! 10/10!!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was our 2nd stay. Camry was extremely accommodating and the space was welcoming and comfortable.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We felt right at home at Camry’s. She has really thought of everything. Camry was so helpful any time we had a question. Can’t wait to come visit again.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"GREAT place, spacious, clean, quiet and comfortable. Carry was responsive, the space was inviting and absolutely perfect for what we needed and it was a better value than a hotel room."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first time renting an Air B&B. Camry was very helpful and very responsive to our messages, even after getting in later than expected. The apartment was very clean and very welcoming. We will definitely stay at her property again."
2024-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"My reservation was changed to another on Jacob’s properties in the same area. The BNB was clean and comfortable. I love the area the BNB is in because it is away from traffic noise and is remote.
My only complaint is the lack of table and floor lamps. The only lighting in the main room and the bedroom is overhead lights."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Nice and cozy
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I stayed here on a recent cross-country road trip. We were looking for a safe and quiet place to stay the night and relax a bit before hitting the road in the morning. It is outside of town and away from the trafficand noise of the construction on the streets in town. If not for the wind that seemed to blow all night, it would have been extremely quiet."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,All good👍🏻
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay. We highly recommend Casa Chiquita to anyone who is looking for a place to get away. The place is nice and cozy and very quiet.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The cottage was cozy and clean in a RV park outside of town. It was very quiet and that's what we needed. We travel with a dog and it was a good place for him with land to walk. The bed was comfy, large TV, clean kitchen. well worth the price."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay. It was in the perfect location for us. We would definately stay agiain and would also recommend the place. It was quiet and peaceful.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay if you want a quiet and restful night. Nice amenities.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The tiny house was away from town so it was quiet. It is not a beautiful location but it was in a safe rural location. The inside of the house was clean and nicely decorated and new. It was better than the pictures I thought. It was cool inside when we arrived on a sunny afternoon because the window unit works well and the temperatures dropped 50 degrees overnight so we got to test the heater too! The bed was firm but comfortable and we slept well. The TV worked great and was easy to find something to watch.
It was just what we needed and if I’m ever in Guymon again I would stay there."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Enjoyed our stay. Great place for a good night's sleep, comfy bed. Smelled great!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was the perfect place to stay for my doggo and I on our cross-country road trip. We slept great, super comfy bed. And Theresa was very responsive and friendly before and during our stay!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It was great for us and our dog Ollie, plenty of room for and peaceful."
2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"Location was private and close to the highway, so perfect for an overnight stop on a long road trip. It was as described and pictured. We arrived later in the evening on an especially hot day and the place was unbearably hot. Even with the air on all night on high, it was still so hot we had to put the kids in diapers to sleep instead of pajamas and our bulldog was nonstop panting. The filter needed replaced in the window unit too so that could also have been the issue. It was not especially clean either. There was hair on the sheets (so we washed them before sleeping on them) and in the bathroom. There was also half eaten takeout and leftover random food in and on the fridge. It doesn’t appear to have been cleaned, or at least not well, between guests so that was disappointing."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Really enjoyed how easy this place was for us. It was right off the highway and easy to access so it worked really well for our travel plans. It was peaceful and really pretty around the home. We enjoyed our stay
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Best bed ever! Slept so good. Lots of nice little touches. Very clean! Would definitely stay again.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a really cool stay outside of town. Great amenities, nice little bench outside which was a perfect place to stargaze. Would definitely stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We reserved Jacob & Theresa's tiny home last minute - they were quick to respond with directions and we were very happy with the accommodations. The home was larger than the pictures and had plenty of room for 2 people. It is off a paved road, but we had no issue getting to the property and were very happy with the overall privacy as we had 2 full cars on our trip. We had dinner at a great Mexican restaurant in town and enjoyed our short stay."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jacob was the kindest host! We needed an early check in after caring for my parents in Arizona. What a restful, peaceful, perfect accommodation ! I would not hesitate to return. He even brought in fresh flowers for us😊. A must stay for rest and relaxation !"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"During my stay, I was treated with such great hospitality that it already has made future plans to rent again! I came here with my brother and we had a blast over here in Guymon, OK! Although it’s a small town our host and the people of Guymon made our stay worth the trip! Definitely making future plans with more guests!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My partner and I enjoyed our stay here, very nice couple and great home to rent. Loved that we could take our fur baby with us. Would definitely stay again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was beautiful and relaxing. They even had flowers waiting on the counter. It's very private and peaceful. There was a storm at night so it was a little loud but didn't lose electricity or wifi. Will definitely be back.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jacob and Stacie were very responsive and welcoming. The place was unique and even though a small space everything was thoughtfully laid out for guest comfort. The kitchen and bathroom were spotless and had every amenity needed. Really enjoyed the space and even with some huge thunderstorms I enjoyed a good nights sleep and some great lightening viewing! I will definitely return next time I am in the area. Thank you for your hospitality!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely beautiful and peaceful! Very clean and very comfortable! Had the best sleep I’ve had in a long time there!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place away from the traffic and noise of town. Awesome concept and will only get better from here!!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Nice place! Good communication!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was very peaceful. It is a very quiet area off by itself.
The home was nicely done, loved the Primary suite and the large bathtub at the end of the hall.
If I am in the area again will definitely stay again!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very nice place , great host!!!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We will definitely be utilizing this property again. The hosts were so easy to work with and responded to my messages very quickly. I have never stayed in a rental that’s kitchen was stocked with so many quality things. The bathrooms also had plenty of towels. Not just the required 2 per guest. I have stayed in multiple Airbnb and this one truly felt like a home, not just 4 walls that are sometimes occupied. The pictures were exactly how this beautiful home looked."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We would honestly stay here again, the place is huge. Perfect for my big family. Was able to have a small get together with family for a few hours. We all enjoyed the house to the fullest. Wasn’t a big issue but had no shower soap like listed. But I believe everything was good enough for us. We had no issues. Yes there are cameras but you can unplug them all when you arrive. We had no issue with the cameras or anything."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Host was very responsive, and accommodating! We had a great time."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Love this place. I’m staying again when I’m in the area

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The owner is very helpful and responsive. He allowed us to check in early which was a huge bonus. The listing is super nice and the house is beautiful!
2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Place seemed haunted
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house is in Elkhart Kansas, not a place people would go to find vacation type activities, but in a nice quiet little town. We were there for a family reunion and it was just what we needed. We didn't do any cooking or use the kitchen much but it was awesome if we'd have needed it. Elkhart had been getting a lot of rain and had some large storms so we were having trouble opening the door. I reached out to our contact and got help immediately. It was unlocking, just took some muscle to push it open and we weren't trying hard enough at first. We thought the lock wasn't working and didn't want to break anything. I would definitely stay again anytime I need to bring my family to Elkhart."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Chads place was nice and roomy. We enjoyed our stay.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house is awesome. We especially enjoyed the kitchen, the game room, and the back patio."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Everything was great. We had a large group and we all enjoyed our time there. It was easily accessible from the location of the event we were attending. Great house- very beautiful. Our host & Co-host we also wonderful. We would rent the house again if there was an opportunity to do so. 🎖️🎖️🎖️
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Whoever cleaned this home deserves a medal. Spotless in every regard. We stay in many AirBnB's and this location has to be our all time favorite. So much space. Kitchen is pro grade and very well equipped. Nice choice of bedrooms. Backyard space and huge, private grounds are awesome. Our only regret is that we do not get to visit Elkhart more often so we can spend more nights in this wonderful home. Thank you Chad and Melissa."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place lots of things to do in the house. Sadly we where only passing by so we didn’t have the time to use all the amenities. But everything looked great. Would recommend for a family getaway or even to just spend the night like we did,
there is cameras in the common areas which you can disarms as soon as you get to the property.
Lots of privacy"
2022-11-01,3.0,Stayed over a week,It’s alright
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful house! Clean, Nice rooms, plenty of space, Large bathrooms. Awesome kitchen. No problems with checking in or anything with the house everything worked great. Would recommend this place to anyone!! Thanks for letting us stay!!"
2022-10-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"No hot water, no internet, no TV. The place was not very clean although not exactly dirty either. The cement floor needs paint so it looked dirty. The windows were filthy, hadn't been cleaned in a very long time. The host left a note demanding that we take the garbage out and wash the dishes or we'd be charged extra. Seems like that would be included in the cleaning fee. That was not a big thing, but I resented the threat, especially since we did not get all we paid for - hot water and internet. What is going on here is that if we don't do his job (clean the place) then we are charged extra, but if he doesn't do his (provide hot water) we have no recourse. That is a bad way to do business."
2022-09-01,4.0,Group trip,"Worked great for our retreat. The only thing that really was a problem for our group is the per person cleaning fee. Otherwise, it was great."
2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"not very clean, had to fix broken cabinet because they charged us for it and said that we broken it ""it will be expensive for you"""
2022-06-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"I was pretty disappointed upon arriving . I usually can over look most things. But before arrival we were charged per person a hefty cleaning fee. And the day of arrival we were informed that a man would be staying in a camper on property. He was literally off the front porch and made us feel uncomfortable , especially since there weren’t any window coverings in common areas . There are several cameras inside the house that made you feel like your being watched. The house was dirty, dead bugs everywhere and piles of them on floors and dishes in cabinets were dirty. His place has potential, but needs some TLC to make you feel welcome. We were very considerate of his property, but a few days later he said we ruined a TV remote. We never even turned on a TV. I should have taken the time to read all the reviews before booking. Several people have had the same complaints. I needed a large place in that area to stop and rest on our way to Colorado and there aren’t many in the area. This place has the potential be a wonderful AirB&B so hopefully they will take the criticism to help improve it for others."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice big house! Lots of room for different gathering areas. Love the huge kitchen! Beautiful double gas grill stove, and gigantic refrigerator freezer!"
2022-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"I don't think its right to say a house accommodates 8 people and then charge extra when you have less then 8 people staying there. For the price of the ""cleaning fee"" I would think the house would be much cleaner then it was.
I unplugged the cameras on the inside, there are cameras outside. Be careful using the recliner it is not stable. Don't be surprised when the door handle for the bathroom fall off.
Shower stalls are small and the water pressure in one is low and the other will drowned you."
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We made a very quick trip through Elkhart, showed up late at night and left very early in the morning. Kids were disappointed we weren't able to use more of the amenities. Next time we will have to plan more time there before leaving."
2022-04-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"The house was ok. It is a large house with a game room and it was clean. The bed my wife and I slept on was comfortable. There is no master suite so the bathroom is down the hall. We had two issues during our one night stay. The first issue for us were the cameras inside the house. There were cameras in the kitchen, living room and game room. Not sure if there were more. This was disturbing for us; it didn't feel private and felt like we were being watched/monitored during our stay. The host told us to turn the cameras around if we want but, in my opinion, there should not be active cameras inside an Airbnb residence. The second issue was the front storm door. We received direction to make sure we closed the storm door all the way. We followed the hosts directions and didn't have any issues with the door during our stay. After we left, we were contacted by Chad that the door had been damaged. They requested that we pay $750 for new hinges. Airbnb settled the dispute in our favor but renters be aware."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful and very helpful host and cohost! The place was huge, well kept, and had many great amenities! Wonderful stay for a night, a week, longer!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Our workers stayed here and loved it!
2022-02-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place for a highschool or family get-together. Found bird feathers and what was animal fluid in the refrigerator. The wood was too big and no axe there to cut wood to burn in the inside stove. The showers have low pressure and the first shower is hard to set to the right temperature. I followed close out instructions but had issues with the host. I would not stay here again since they have too many instructions and cameras inside the house. They advertise 125 a night, however, that's for one person only. After you select the stay you'll be charged an addition 30 dollars per person. The kitchen was dirty and disorganize and we left out cleaner than I found it."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My stay was excellent. Amenities were splendid. I’m glad this property was available.
These other guests were worried about security cameras…????… I have them in my home for my kids. That’s home protection and security. Duh!
Thanks Chad!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Happy with our stay. Good communication. We will be back. Thanks.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,See you later.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Aaaa+
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent
2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay and make awesome memories. For families or friends.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This house is INCREDIBLE. We were driving from AZ to IA and this was a perfect stop half way for us. The beds were so comfortable and we enjoyed a wonderful night's sleep. We got back on the road early and were bummed we didn't get to spend more time here. We appreciated the dining options info left on the desk, cleanliness, and abundance of private rooms. Stay here if you get the chance."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What an amazing house! Chad is a perfect host. The entire property is wonderful and it was the one of the cleanest Airbnb’s I have ever stayed at. Definitely book here! FYI - if you are on a long road trip like me then this is the small town to rent in as it has the most
Gas stations and businesses then any
Other small town off the main road."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Excellent place to stay! We had a mixed group of coworkers sharing the house for a last-minute work scheduling change and the large house accommodated space for individuals to share the space without feeling crowded. Nicely redone, great accommodations. Clean and owners were very accommodating with quick and reliable communication. I would highly recommend this stay in a beautiful community!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect!
2021-09-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"Spiders spiders everywhere!! Went to flush the toilet spider, went to shower oh hi spider! Walls, ceilings and everywhere else were spiders. There’s also this musky mold smell in the kitchen and the living room. I tried to open the windows to freshen the area but the owner has put screws on them so you’re unable to open. But the worse part of it all is that there was about 5 security cameras inside throughout the house, I don’t even know how this is allowed through Airbnb, I understand some for outside but inside is invading of privacy. The house is surrounded by cameras on the outside as well, it’s a fortress. So the area has potential if all the diys were completed and the place was really cleaned up."
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The house is enormous and would make a wonderful get away with friends or family. There’s a game room which we loved and a well stocked kitchen that made my girlfriend very happy. My only complaint would be the cleanliness of the house. We found 4-5 spiders in the bathroom and more in the living spaces. It didn’t bother me but someone with a fear of bugs, especially spiders, would find being there quite difficult. Still, it’s a big, quiet space that for the right person will prove a perfect space, especially if you have kids."
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"loved the place, super nice inside. it was a little hot when we entered and the inside cameras are a little odd but good experience otherwise!"
2021-09-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Chad’s accommodation was immaculate and very spacious.
Check-in on the other hand was so so. Waited about 45 min after check-in time started to get 4-digit code.
Lots of security cameras in- and outside property as well, which was very weird. Didn’t feel private. We were able to disconnect all 4 cameras, but again, felt very weird.
Place was very clean and spacious, but will probably pass on staying in the future."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean and cozy home. Barely any stairs so very accessible to those who don’t like stairs, the whole home is one level. Very spacious and definitely a place to call home temporarily in small town elkhart. My boyfriend and I only stayed the night along our route to the West Coast and although we have never been to Kansas, we felt very at home at this airbnb. For our visit, the no cleaning fee was VERY useful, as sometimes booking airbnb’s for 1 night and paying an $100 cleaning fee when we barely rustled the blankets is a bit frustrating. It was nice to be able to just clean up after ourselves from the short time we had stayed and not have to overpay. If you were to stay a full week and cook meals in the home, the cleaning fee may be more worth it than scrubbing the place clean but in our case, it was nice! The backyard was spacious for the dogs and the security cameras/system outside was comforting considering were new to the area. Also, the floors being majority concrete made it very pet friendly. If we were ever in Elkhart again, we would definitely return!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good place to get away and well priced for the size. It's in a quiet location. Everything closes by 10:00pm around town so get all snacks, drinks and toiletries before you arrive. Any questions asked had a 1 hour delay for a reply. Other than that, it was a good stay. Make sure you visit WILDCAT CAFE for breakfast. Great and prompt service with friendly staff!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect spot for lots of friends and family!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful home - and tons of space to relax and enjoy…whether you are staying one night or a week! Will definitely stay again!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing place! Would definitely stay again with the whole family. Tons of space.
Spent a lot of time in the game room. HUGE kitchen with everything you need! This was one of the main reasons we choose this place.
Big back patio with plenty of seating and a fire pit. There is more than enough to do to keep you entertained during your entire stay.
They even have nice high-end appliances to use. Excellent communication and very friendly!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great bang for your buck! The home has tons of space and a lot of activities for every age. It was truly a treat to find such a great home for our travels. Thank you!

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Whether you just need a place to spend the night or planning on spending several days, this is the place! Fantastic house, that has everything you will need on the outskirts of a small town that doesn’t have neighbors close by so it is very quiet."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Huge awesome house! Hosts were awesome too! We want to come back and stay longer and bring more family. I've seriously never cooked in a kitchen like this. What a blast! We totally enjoyed our stay.

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is absolutely amazing! Plenty of space. Lots of rooms and bathrooms, and TVs. The backyard is a great place to hangout and the pool table and shuffleboard table are awesome.

2021-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,A lot of space to spread out.
2021-03-01,5.0,Group trip,This place is very nice and has many common areas for big groups. We loved all the games provided and had good meals with the huge kitchen and all the appliances! The house is located right inside town so finding a grocery store and gas was very convenient! We did visit the point of rocks about a 30-40 minute drive from the house and it was pretty worth it considering the location of Elkhart! Overall a great experience for our last minute trip.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,thank you
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lots of space!
2021-02-01,4.0,Group trip,"Thier house is definitely impressive, I would be happy to visit again. The bedrooms are spacious so if you'replanning on a long stay you'd be more than comfortable. Easy access to the t.v.'s. There's a basketball court in the front and a merry-go-round in the backyard. Lots of space to hang out pretty much anywhere, tables and chairs outside as well as a fire pit. The grocery store is about 10 min or less from the house, like a said a wonderful space to relax and create memories with friends and family!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"love, love, love this home. kitchen is five star. patio, yard, rec room, bathrooms, bedrooms are all amazing. find a reason to come to Elkhart. Need coffee mugs."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing place! We are a family of 7 so finding places that are comfortable and functional for all of us isn't an easy task. This place is so beautiful, spacious and functional. Having a washer & dryer available is a huge help. Hosts' communication is top notch, always quick and friendly. Easily one of the best places we have stayed at! If you are looking for relaxation, space, peace and quiet you won't be disappointed with this house!"

2021-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,A very big and bright place to stay with a super fun game room!
2021-01-01,5.0,Group trip,I definitely recommend this place! It was the perfect place to rest after a long day of traveling. The beds are comfortable and it was extremely clean. It was very spacious as well! I wish we could’ve stayed longer than just a night!
2021-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place! We stayed here to cut our road trip in half; however, if this place was local for us, I could see us renting often for get-togethers. Lots of space, gourmet kitchen, amazing amenities for entertaining. Loved it and would definitely rent again if in town."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clinkingbeard Manor was great! The house itself is beautiful, with custom craftsmanship, and spacious design. The location was great for a family getaway. The rooms are large, with king size beds, closets, TVs, and light blocking curtains. The whole place is incredibly spacious! We enjoyed cooking the amazing kitchen, relaxing in multiple sitting areas, and spent a lot of time in the game room. In addition to the pool table, we enjoyed playing the board games there, and my son enjoyed the toys available in the 4th bedroom. We would absolutely stay here again!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a beautiful home. We went for a Christmas COVID get away, and couldn't have chosen better! We checked in and didn't even leave for 2 days. When we ventured out on the 3rd day, we found the town offered some dining options and a really nice home town Grocery store.
We chose the location because we wanted to get away and rural is a nice choice during this period of the pandemic. It was about 20 degrees warmer than our home town and very flat and open, everything we were looking for. We traveled with 2 dogs and they loved the yard, it is fenced, but there is an opening near the front gate that our adventure dog found, we were able to block it with available plywood for the rest of the stay. It was a bit difficult to find in the dark as it is well hidden and private, but it is through a large metal gate. The home had everything we needed and more. We cooked a lot for ourselves and there wasn't anything missing in the kitchen.
Beautiful home, lovely stay, nice communication. We look forward to visiting again!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place for our work crew to stay, while working nearby. Had everything we needed, and we appreciated the numerous t.v.'s and game room. The host was nice enough to accommodate us arriving a day earlier than initially planned, and let us checkout a day early, as our work finished quicker than we though it would. We would definitely stay again!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Chads place is a great size for large families, is pet friendly, and was a perfect place to rest on a long road trip. Quiet and remote setting was especially nice and the home is equipped with games, comfortable beds, and plenty of space to spread out. Host was friendly and responded quickly to messages which helped so much as we were arriving and leaving in the middle of a snow storm."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was perfect for a recent stay that was necessary due to a family members funeral. This house is very large and had plenty of space for us, the back deck is beautiful and we really enjoyed our coffee outside in the mornings. Tessa was a fantastic host and checked in to make sure we had everything we needed. She knew we had a toddler and made sure that we had extras that would help like a Mickey Mouse towel, soap and shampoo, a high chair etc. We would definitely stay again when visiting family."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This space was exceptionally well suited for our needs. Wonderfully welcoming, tons of space and every amenity we could have possibly needed.
Moreover, the hosts predicted our needs fabulously and made sure the home was ready for my family. With two small children, we appreciated this very much. From the blankets to the crib to the snacks, toys and even milk.
Highly recommend this space and highly recrecommend these amazing hosts!
Well done. Thank you!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,As a hunting family this was a great place to stay for opening weekend of dove season!! Thank you so much for an incredible vacation for my family and I. I cannot tell you how valuable it was for us to have such a wonderful place to stay and spend time together. Your willingness to be flexible was more amazing than I can tell you. You communicated with us the entire time and made the stay truly seamless.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay with extended family- lots of bedrooms and fairly large living spaces. We especially enjoyed the back patio and the kids had fun running around in the yard. Easy walk to town.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a large family group with a few little ones and this house was a perfect fit for us! The hosts went above and beyond to ensure the house was equipped for our stay, and even jumped through a few hoops to accommodate us during our stay as well. Tara was very responsive and thoughtful in all communications. If this house is available for your dates, book it. We’ll be back for sure!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was absolutely what was promised. The beds were comfy and clean. Tara was an excellent host. She was super helpful and very accommodating.

Always good food…always friendly and fun!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Trey and Jenna were the ABSOLUTE BEST! Super communication and quick to respond to one issue that came up!
Would highly recommend!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The stay was great. We were in town for my niece's graduation and staying here with my parents. A couple of the front steps were lose and Trey was quick to fix them. If your in need of a place to rest your head then this is the place. It is just of the hyway but at night it's really quit! We enjoyed the stay!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The location is spacious and looked like the images on the website. Private parking and easy to locate. Very responsive and helpful hosts. Reasonably priced but very clean. We have stayed here twice now which might say more than anything else I might write.
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Over all nice place, for middle of no man's land."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Treys was a great place for me and my family
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Great host! Had to stay an extra night and was very understanding.
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great Host! Had issues with the door and was very kind and helpful.
Had to stay an extra night and was soo understanding! Definitely will stay again when in the area!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Excellent location near the highway. The house was super clean. Host was responsive to all questions.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Trey’s place was great! Anytime in the area I will stay again. Very responsive and accommodating!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,was very pleased with the price point
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,I think the place is a little overpriced and could do better cleaning in the bathrooms overall okay.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Wonderful place to relax and spend my time after work!
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! The hosts are very accommodating!
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,There are not many options for staying in this region but we needed a place to rest our heads. The place felt like a house you moved in after living in a college dorm for years. It needed polishing but had the essentials. Very close to road so if you cant sleep with trucks passing its not your place. The heat is concentrated in the master bedroom. I did not feel comfortable letting my infant crawl around. Over all it was a okay place to rest our heads in our travels.
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,great house and great communication. would stay here again for sure. really cared about our stay and made us feel welcome.
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Perfect stay. Would recommend anyone looking for a place to stay here. We are very happy with our stay and the place was perfect.
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"After checking in we realized the sheets on the king sized bed were still wet they smelled good you could tell they were freshly washed someone had just rushed them out of the dryer. Luckily we found this early we stripped the bed and put the sheets in the dryer and we notified the host. We then left to have dinner with family and when we returned Trey and Jena had brought over a new set of bedding ,remade the bed, and left a note. Trey and Jena were very responsive and super friendly! They answered every question promptly! It is clear that the hosts are working on making it more comfortable and up dating it. Literally my only complaint would be the front steps/porch could use immediate attention as my boyfriend is an amputee and uses crutches to get around. The steps leading into the house are in pretty bad shape and the floor of the porch isn't a flat surface and could easily be a trip hazzard other than that I would rent this place again. It was a comfortable stay with great hosts"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Great communication
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great place for a couple techs working at a job site nearby! Great host as well!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Nice and comfortable, clean stay. Trey was very responsive and made sure we were taken care of."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, owners answered all questions and helped us check in!"
2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"I wish that I had known that we were booking a mobile home. The description never mentions that you are staying in a trailer park. There were storms the first night we were there and I was nervous we had nowhere safe to go.
Inside the actual home, we were provided with what basic needs- beds, a place to eat, and bathrooms. However, the state of the place was not welcoming. The floor was dirty and the surfaces of the kitchen were not clean. I spent some time sweeping and wiping everything down when we arrived.
There are quite a few updates that need to happen to make this place a little more comfortable/ presentable. Simply having a towel bar available in the bathroom can make a difference. The outlet in one of the bathrooms does not work. Curtains over the windows in the living room and kitchen can help guests feel like it's a more private space. This is a home more suitable for college kids wanting to party who may not care about cleanliness."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Trey’s place was comfortable and a great deal for the few days we spent there. We had a little issue, but the place was so affordable and comfortable in spite of the difficulty that it did not overshadow the experience. We had plenty of room for the several of us who stayed there and there were extras like a coffee hutch and extra provided toiletries that demonstrated the hospitality of our host. Made some good memories!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Ed's place is a one of a kind place, nestled right in the middle of nothing. talk about peaceful country living, the house had all the amenities that we needed.

We will definitely be back, gotta come back and visit our buddy Jeter."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jana was great to book with. Very nice and responded very quickly. She was also great at communicating and making our stay easy.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a great Airbnb and host. Jana was very communicative and proactive from start to finish. She offered extra amenities and advice that were relevant to our stay. We felt like we were in good hands and that any of our needs would be met. Regarding the location itself - there are not many places to stay in this small town to begin with - however this exceeded our expectations and was nicer than most of the big hotel chains. Very homey, lots of amenities. The room was very large with plenty of space/furniture to be comfortable. The community fridge is full size (unlike the mini-fridge you get at most hotels) and was a very nice feature that we utilized for all our drinks and food during the stay. The kitchen area was fully stocked with a number plates, utensils, napkins, etc. The commons area was a nice place to hangout at the end of each day. Highly recommend!"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We needed a spot for the family to break up our long drive. My only regret was we only stayed one night. It would have been great to stay and play cards woth the kids and go out to eat. Wish my hometown small town had a great air bnb like this!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very cute boutique hotel! Easy check in, spacious and comfy! There were lots of extra little touches to make it a convenient stay. Thanks so much!"
,,,"I pray no one has the experience I did. After driving 8 hours all I wanted to do was take a shower. Unfortunately the second I opened the shower curtain I realized that unfortunately the shower had not been cleaned at all probably in multiple visits. There was spit and hair on the walls, dust built up in the shelves, and worst of all there was mouse crap all over the floor of the shower stall. I then got told I was full of crap (with different language) by the absolute “Chad” that’s owns this house. Even though I had pictures of the spit the hair and the mouse poop was still on the sponge I used to do their job. He has been too lazy to take out all the old tiles, concrete chunks, and old rotting pallets. This should have led me to realize that he would’ve been to lazy to make sure the house is clean. Horrible experience someone would have to pay me 3x the booking price to have to deal with this joke again."
,,,"We are 5 star Airbnb frequent users. We generally don’t write negative reviews and were going to let this one go but have reason to believe the host wrote a false and defamatory review of us.
We stayed here for 3 days as a result of a car accident that stranded us in Elkhart, KS - far off the beaten path. The host tried to collect $455 in additional cleaning fees as a result of our dogs - the place purported to be pet friendly.
Here’s the truth: This property has a “pool” of standing, rancid, brackish water in the backyard. The yard is also full of dead animals and old dog poop. Like most dogs would ours apparently foraged in this grossness. As a result one dog had an accident on an inexpensive, small rug. We cleaned up as best we could. The place has cement floors so it’s not really possible for dogs to do any real damage.
The host was aggressive and called us a series of names when we refused the baseless cleaning up charge. Among them: that we were not adults, not responsible dog owners, liars etc. Read our other reviews and you can determine for yourself whether what the impolite host here said is true.
Also: When we checked in the place looked like it hadn’t been cleaned at all let alone Covid cleaned. Dirty dishes in the dishwasher and old coffee and filter in the coffee pot.
Again, since we were essentially stuck here with nowhere else to go, we weren’t going to complain. But when the host makes up a story, calls you names, and trys to take advantage, we are not going to be silent.
Everyone else we met in Elkhart, KS was a pleasure. The host here was not."
