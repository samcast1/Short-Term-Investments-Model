2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,place was great! clean and cozy with comfy beds.
2024-05-01,4.0,Group trip,"The house was amazing and beautiful exactly as described, we did have some issues though. There was a cockroach in the bathr room, I found an ant in the bed I was sleeping in and woke up with 2 bug bites on my legs, and the bathroom door in the master bedroom
made a very loud squeaking noise whenever it was opened and closed. But over all the house was beautiful and very fun and open, this review is just serving as constructive criticism for the owner."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had such an amazing time. The location and home was perfect for the week visiting our son at college. He was able to invite his friends over to visit. The house was huge, clean and we would definitely be interested in staying there again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Listing was exactly like the photos, the entire home was spotless and decor was very charming. Anh’s response time was very fast and was very helpful for whenever we had any questions. Thank you so much for having us!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host. Friendly and prompt. We have stayed at his properties in Wilson NC several times.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I loved the carriage house on Necho’s property! It was quiet, beautiful and spacious. The porch was a lovely spot to sit in the evening and the morning. I was visiting Wilson without a car and enjoyed the house’s proximity to the amenities of downtown: I was able to easily walk to restaurants, shops, and the whirligig park. Necho was proactive and communicative through the entire process. I would highly recommend this property to anyone. Thanks for the wonderful visit!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Comfy overnight stay. LOTS of space! Would recommend.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Necho was a wonderful host for this first time AirBnB user. He was extremely quick to respond and was wonderful to communicate with. The property was exactly as advertised. Will stay here again when I come back through town.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved, loved, loved staying at Necho's Carriage House! We could not believe how spacious it was!!!
It was so pretty ( we loved all the antiques, beautiful floors, historic vibe etc)... the bed we chose to sleep in....there are 4(!!!)....2 in each very large room...was the beautiful brass & iron white king sized bed. SO COMFORTABLE...slept like babies ( we are seniors lol). We've stayed in hotels in Wilson but really wanted to be downtown....so finding this gem was a dream come true. It's more like staying in your or a friend's home & so quiet & private. The parking is a dream....right smack there at front porch etc. Maybe a 2 min drive at most to downtown which is exactly what we wanted...definitely walkable too ( I would probably only walk while daylight). There's not a kitchen but this is clearly specified in description. There is a small fridge, coffee maker & microwave which was just fine for us. We can't say enough good things except we definitely hope to be back SOON!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you for being so helpful to our family as we stayed at your place to attend a funeral. You were very thoughtful and sincerely sympathetic.

Necho was very quick to respond to any issues we had which was super helpful. The buffet next door was within walking distance and had amazing southern soul food. would definitely stay here again"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved it! Cute old place, we likes the separate rooms each with their own full bathroom! The foyer has the small fridge and microwave. Our son loves running around the property and looking at all the cool statues. Rooms are really big and high ceilings give you that extra space. We will stay again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The rooms are huge! Floors, bedrooms and bathrooms are very clean. The town of Wilson is a fun place to explore. We would definitely come back."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Good deal. Nice place. Comfy bed. Spacious.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the third or fourth time we’ve stayed with him in one of these two properties. They’ve been everything we’ve wanted when visiting family and enjoying the unbelievable food next door at the Western Sizzlin. Walkable to the library if I want a different place to work, but internet and work tables are very convenient in the house. I heartily recommend, but stop reserving it when we want it! :)"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Necho was an amazing host and traveling to Wilson was an incredible experience! I’ll recommend Necho’s beautiful historic architecture and grounds to everyone!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Rosebud Carriage House is set back from the road on a quiet, pretty complex of historic homes. The shade and peaceful setting on the front porch are perfect for reading and relaxation. The blossoming, artsy downtown is only a 10-minute walk down Nash St. This was a very convenient location for experiencing Wilson. Necho was a great host. Would stay here again!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Host was quick to respond to my questions. Great location close to campus and walkable to downtown coffee shop and restaurants!

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We have stayed here before and that's why we returned.
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Necho was very friendly and responsive. The place was pet friendly and was as described. The porch was well lit and there was plenty of parking. The space was clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. Unfortunately, there was a noticeable odor of cat pee throughout the residence. The rooms were also used for storage, so there was some clutter and the provided towels and washcloths were mismatches, worn, and threadbare."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was comfortable just what we needed for our stay
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Necho’s Carriage House was the absolute cutest! My mother and I were only there one night but would have easily stayed a week. The furniture was gorgeous, well cared for and time period appropriate. I didn’t realize before going that this was previously an Inn and a historical location! That’s totally up my ally and we reveled in it. I only wish I could have learned more about the location honestly!
There were some festive decorations which were a nice touch, everything was extremely clean which I appreciated and the beds were comfortable. We would absolutely stay again. Necho was also very proactive on communication."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I had a great stay, it was just as advertised.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A lovely Southern estate, appointed beautifully! The host was responsive and helpful, and the space was very comfortable. Large rooms with vaulted ceilings; parking directly outside the door; no full kitchen but coffee supplies, microwave, mini fridge and many nearby restaurants made this an easy and relaxing stopover. We will return to explore the lovely city of Wilson soon."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice property decorated with antique furniture. Very comfortable. Walkable neighborhood. Not enough towels and washcloths provided for a two-night stay.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"So happy to have been able to rest our heads at Nechos! The most comfortable beds, spacious rooms, & comfy atmosphere. Even for one night, communication was great & accommodations were perfect. Would love to come back!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in the large house in June with our kids. This time it was just me so I stayed in the smaller Carriage House.
Both were perfect for what we needed. We got to spend valuable time with grandmother after helping her sell her house in June."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place! Close to Barton!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was truly breathtaking historic and timeless. To be able to experience the beauty and opulence of a moment in time preserved, it was as if I opened the door to a time capsule I will definitely stay here again"

2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Clean and convenient.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Necho""s place was located just a few miles off 95. it was perfect for our one night stay traveling from Florida to Maryland. Due to our short stay I can't say anything about what the area has to offer. Necho was a good host, very considerate and communication was good. Easy check in and out."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful stay in the cutest historic home!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This space was perfect for our family. Communication was awesome, apartment was clean and it was very quiet. I would recommend it to anyone visiting Wilson."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at the Carriage House! Necho was a wonderful host and made sure we had everything we needed. The location was perfect right in the middle of town, but tucked away enough for us to have space and quiet."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Lovely place with beautiful furniture. Very comfy and cozy. Necho communicated very well too. 5 stars!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The Carriage House was a great place to stay for the two of us and our 3 dogs. Both rooms in the Carriage House have bathrooms and are nice large rooms. We enjoyed our stay. There is ample parking and great lighting outside for the after dark doggy potty breaks. Check in was no contact and easy.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Rosebud carriage house is a lovely two-bedroom unit, with one set up as the main bedroom and the second with a dining or game area, small refrigerator, tv, and comfy seating. Each has a full bathroom. Both are furnished throughout with comfortable period pieces. The host thoughtfully has plexiglass over the tops of most, so no worries about placing your toiletries, etc. It was just as described in the listing and even better in person. Communications with Necho were easy and timely. We would definitely come back again.
The check-in process was seamless with the key in a lock box. Rosebud is part of a small compound of historic units in a historic neighborhood of Wilson with off street parking right in front, making it very easy to unload the car. There’s a front porch and in early June, jasmine bushes were blooming scenting the night air. Downtown is a thirteen minute walk. It’s a town center making a comeback and if you can’t find what you’re looking for there, there’s plenty of malls for shopping and dining on the way in from I95.
We enjoyed learning about Wilson and staying in this very comfortable and welcoming property."
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Necho's guesthouse is the perfect spot for a stop over. I was driving from FL to NY and this was a safe, comfortable half-point. Necho's communication was excellent and helpful info in each message."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful place to stay !
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"When we walked in we were surprised at how large the bedrooms are and the abundance of space. Everything was very clean and check-in was a breeze. Necho, the owner, was unbelievably accommodating and his communication was amazing. I even left my pillow behind and he made sure my family member was able to retrieve it. We will definitely stay here again next time we are in Wilson."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Necho’s place is charming and comfortable all in one. And, the town of Wilson is such a nice town. Everyone was friendly. Big box stores, including grocery stores, and restaurants are close by but not too close. Wonderful stop between Maryland and South Carolina. Will definitely stay here again if passing through NC!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I stay here often for work, ventured out this time and tried the nearby steakhouse. It was yummy and in walking distance!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is so charming and comfortable! And Necho was a great host. After a long day of travel with my dog, I arrived and promptly locked myself out. 😫 Necho was prompt and communicative in helping me fix the situation. Highly recommend!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,love this place nice clean in the owner is very nice in respectful...
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a nice historic cottage (outhouse of the main building) and it's very spacious... high ceilings and plenty of space. The TV had Disney and everything which we loved. The mini refrigerator and a microwave did do for us and Necho kept plenty of disposable utensils and plates. The nearest restaurant is a 1 minute walk. Everything was walkable. We enjoyed our stay.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place - lots of history - good location - great owner - prompt and courteous - eager to help on all levels. Superb Commnication!! You won't go wrong staying with Necho !!!!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a pretty amazing space, especially if you’re looking for convenience to downtown Wilson, AND you need lots of room to spread out. VERY spacious bedrooms. Would recommend especially to a couple wanting to treat themselves to something a little bit special!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lots of character, easy check in and convenient location."
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Large space, clean, king size bed I slept in had a terrific mattress. Strong shower pressure. Only wish more of the windows opened as it was a beautiful spring night. Maybe on another visit..."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Whenever you come to Wilson NC, this Abnb is a fantastic option. There are zero issues, and the rooms are amazing. five stars instantly. the only issue was I got confused after driving a long distance as the entrance is on the side road and not the address road. If I wasn't tired, most likely I would have found it easily. Still, mega 5/5."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cordial host. Very responsive. Will definitely stay there again
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great communication with Necho. The space was clean and quiet. We had a walk around the neighborhood and slept really well.

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Necho's carriage house was perfect for our road trip stop over!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The place is gorgeous; full of interesting history and elegantly decorated.
It was cozy, quaint yet roomy. The accommodations are among the best we have ever had at an AirBnB location like this.
After leaving we had a discussion in the car and it was agreed WE WILL RETURN TO THIS PLACE for a stay many times in the future."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was an ideal place to stay for the few nights we were in Wilson. We were a few block from our event at Barton College, and easy to get to everywhere we needed to go. The guest house was spacious and very clean, and very well appointed. They have put a lot of loving care into the accommodations. Check in and check out were easy. Thank you again to Necho and his family for the historic guest house"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The carriage house was a delightful place to stay for our visit to Wilson. My daughter and I stayed for a few days while visiting my son at Barton College. There was a slight snafu with the address/directions that Necho quickly responded to and corrected. I would recommend the carriage house to anyone visiting Wilson and wanting to deviate from the hotels.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I stay here regularly when traveling for work. Has all the things you need!

2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our one-night stay at this quaint, historic location was very pleasant. The location is only about 7 miles off I-95, but it seemed a million miles from the hustle and bustle of interstate travel. Check-in was simple. Parking was extremely convenient. Accommodations were comfortable and quiet. We would stay here again."
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"A perfectly charming spot to stay the night. We were only passing through on a road trip so it was a quick stay, but it was cozy and comfortable, and that's what we needed."

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved the huge space, sweet front porch, and adorable decor. Clean and super cozy. Communication with the host before check in was easy and it’s in a good location with ample parking. It was great to have the two separate private bathrooms and there was plenty of plates and so forth so we made use of the microwave and fridge. It is a really fun space to hang out and relax in. I would totally stay again."

2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wilson is our stop on the way to and from Florida. We were looking for a stay at some place other than the many I-95 motels. At those places you sometimes luck out but many times are dissapointed as they are not clean and are not as presented in the ads. The carriage house was extremely clean and located in a neighborhood of beautiful old homes. Oh, and the king bed in the main bedroom is so comfortable."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very comfortable and super clean accommodation right near Barton College. In a great neighborhood to walk around and stretch after a long drive. The host was helpful and followed up immediately when we were lost trying to find the property. It carriage house is cozy and well appointed with everything you will need for a comfortable stay.

Necho was very prompt in answering questions and requests. He also had good recommendations for places to visit and nearby restaurants."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is our go to place whenever we need a local Airbnb! We always, always, always check out the availability here first. The house is beautifully decorated, there is plenty of space for two people or eight. The exterior of the home looks nice and offers an area for your pets and/or children to play in a safe, enclosed area. We absolutely wish we could keep this place our little secret (to increase the availability for us) but we love to tell others how much we love it here when in town!"

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful house with a nice layout, but the house needs a grill to make food on outside, a nice fireplace for fires out back, a tv in the master bedroom on the first floor & more kitchen/bath towels.
Overall a nice quite place to stay while visiting family in the area. Lots of room. We will be back."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent place to stay!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family and I were traveling to Orlando and needed a half way pit stop from New England. House was spacious and clean and very close to 95. The in home washer dryer were also very clutch. The house was perfect for our needs. Would highly recommend.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely amazing place. We would definitely stay here again.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is great! I was traveling with my mom and two dogs.
Pros: The fenced in yard is absolutely perfect, and in great condition. The yard is big, and very enjoyable. There’s no neighbors close by so everything felt very private, which we loved.
This is definitely a home in a very country setting, so if you’re looking for a lot of amenities near by, you will have to travel about 10 minutes or so.
Loved that we could use the garage attached to the house, and the house was large and spacious!
Cons: the door to the back yard locks when you close it. You also use a key to enter through the front door as opposed to a key pad. This caused us a bit of trouble, as we had the key on the kitchen counter, and went out back to enjoy the yard and closed the door behind us, locking us out of the house. The host was very helpful though and came right away to let us back in. The upstairs bedrooms while lovely, I do not think are air conditioned.
Would stay again 100%"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Superb for a quiet getaway. Loved it.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Saudy and her partner are fantastic hosts. The house was pristine and lovely! We had a small issue with the alarm beeping and Saudy immediately gave us instructions as to how to take care of it.
We wish that there were instructions as to how to use the fireplace and I think that it would be a good idea to leave that information for the next guests.
The bed was so comfortable! We will definitely be back when we visit my sister again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful place to stay for the night. Quiet and a beautiful house and property. I would highly recommend to anyone and would stay here again if I was traveling through the area.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Clean, spacious, great location!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great country house. Roomy. Very nice.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"They house was perfect. Clean, and supplied with everything you could need. I would absolutely stay there again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stayed here while my son raced at Southern National Speedway. Very clean. Easy check-in. Host is quick to respond. Loved the fenced in back yard.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We always travel with our two dogs and Saudy's place was by far the best place for our four-legged friends to be active and safe! It was calm and peaceful and exactly as described.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Quite possibly our most comfortable, homelike Airbnb ever! We love this place, and it is our go to every single time!"
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"House is pretty big. It just wasn’t homie so to speak. There was no coffee. The alarm was beeping for the door and a smoke detector battery was chirping. There is not much good cooking gear and the shelves are pretty bare.
If the owner does a few things inside to create more of a theme it could be great.
The old country road is fine but unremarkable.
This was a fine place for two of us to stay overnight but just pretty blah and ordinary otherwise.
It’s a 4 for me for sure but not a 5."

We were able to sit and watch the riders through their lessons, see an abundance of animals in the fields, and wake to a serene sunrise before we left out. It was close enough to town to be able to take a short drive if we needed anything, but definitely secluded enough not to know that there was anyone close for miles. The AC was cold and coffee was well stocked. Perfect place to unwind and relax!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Gracie and Pedro’s place is an authentic little horse and cattle ranch convenient to 95 and Rocky Mount. Off the beaten path and nestled in Elm City, North Carolina, this little slice of heaven was the perfect place to lay our heads for the night. The sun setting through the trees bid us good night and the same sun rising over the ranch welcomed us the next morning.
The bunkhouse itself was comfortable and clean. There was a queen bed and two bunkbeds so it would accommodate a family nicely. The bunkhouse was equipped with a small refrigerator, microwave and a Keurig. That was more than enough to get us started and back on the road.
Highly recommend!"

We loved waking up in the morning to the animals, seeing the horses playing in the fields. Everyone was so nice, and my grandsons loved taking a riding lesson. The inside of the bunkhouse was very comfortable. The mattress was one of the best I’ve slept on. I can’t speak for the bunks. The only thing that would have been a help would be disposable eating utensils and paper plates since there is no real kitchen."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stayed at Gracie’s. It exceeded my expectations. She was friendly and always available to any questions I had. I highly recommend this place. I wish I had more time to be able to take advantage of a riding lesson.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This has been our place to stay for the last two years when we visit friends in Wilson for their Christmas event. We enjoy the horses and cattle, and just the sheer solitude of this place.

We will plan on coming back next year when our friends host another Christmas event."

Great value for the price. I was not crazy about the loose dogs on the property but won’t take away from the 5 star review because that was stated in the description that they would be there. I just checked the property before walking my dog from the cabin to our vehicle and had no trouble. Over all good experience.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I, along with our two dogs, stayed at the ranch for a couple nights before heading to the beach. Gracie was responsive and kind during all interactions we had with her. She was flexible with various aspects of the booking and later, the check in process. When she says make yourself at home, she means it! Her husband, Pedro, was welcoming and kind also. He was responsive and engaging when we asked questions about many things ranchy. We especially enjoyed watching Gracie and Pedro team up during the cattle sorting event! 🤠
The bunkhouse is exactly as shown in the photos. There was plenty of room for our two dog cages to easily fit. We enjoyed seeing horses, cattle, roosters and dogs going about their daily life. Mother Nature’s finest right outside your door!
Overall, our bunkhouse stay was relaxing, a breath or fresh air, and just what we needed!
Thanks to Gracie and Pedro for sharing their beautiful ranch!!! See ya next time! ❤️🤠"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed our time here. Lots of cute animals to welcome you when you arrive. It is quiet and peaceful. Gracie was incredibly responsive with some last minute travel changes that I needed to work with her on.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The bunkhouse was a one of a kind stay for my kids and I. It was picturesque waking up and eating breakfast with my kids at the picnic table while looking out on all the horses. The space was a perfect fit for our group of 6. We would love to come back if we are ever in the area again!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Gracie is a great host, very responsive and friendly. The bunkhouse was comfortable and very clean. Nicely appointed, cozy accommodations and complimentary coffee! My husband and I were traveling with my niece and it was
the perfect accommodations for a restful night sleep. We checked in a little later than we had hoped to so we didn’t do much other than sleep. Definitely will book again!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lovely and peaceful spot for our family of 5 to stay in the bunkhouse for a night and experience the farm during our road trip. Gracie fit us in for riding lessons in the morning before we left, and she and Pedro were great with our kids, teaching them about the horses and how to ride. Would definitely recommend anyone staying here, with or without the lessons."

Would definitely recommend and would stay there again! Would have loved to do a riding lesson as well if time had allowed."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved the suggestions of Wilson's sites. Found the artwork at the museum across from park amazing. Did a Century Ride the following day in Rocky Mount, so this was the needed quiet before the push. Thank you. Ruth"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful stay! Gracie was kind enough to let us interact a little with one of her horses and the bunkhouse was adorable!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place for an overnight stay on our way to DC. We had a lovely evening in Wilson. The place was homey and slept our family of 4 very well. Would stay again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Gracie's place kept it Ranchy. The Bunkhouse was very comfortable. The AC was cool, the bed comfortable and the surroundings were what I expected. My son enjoyed the cows and horses. Next time we'll plan on a riding session. I imagine she's always booked when there's an event but I'm sure that would add to the ambiance, I think it would be fun to try."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super cute farm and very interesting Airbnb stay compared to others. At night it was so peaceful, could hear the horses and I loved it! I also did a horse riding lesson for $75 and was worth it!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We absolutely loved our stay on the farm! It was the rustic feel we wanted with all the comfort amenities! It was definitely a wonderful time we both enjoyed every minute of it!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Gracie was out by the barn when I arrived. When I expressed interest, she invited me come watch a horse lesson after I got settled in. The place is so cute and super comfortable. There are horse pictures and hangers which adds to the charm. I love having everything in one space, bed, bath and small meal prep with table and chairs. It was a great setup! I hope to visit Gracie’s again."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our two nights in the bunkhouse and even got to take in a barrel-racing show, right out our front door. Our dogs loved walking around and seeing all the animals and people.
No TV or WiFi, so plan ahead. There is only a microwave, so we brought mostly cold foods to get through the weekend. Would definitely come back!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place for a quick rest up or short get away from the busy life.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gracie’s was cozy, clean and it was very private and the surroundings where beautiful. Gracie responded quickly and was very kind. We felt at home wish we could have stayed longer. I would definitely return!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Gracie’s Bunkhouse was the perfect place for a quick stop on my road trip from NY to Florida. Very accommodating about checking in late in the night, was a little tricky to find but i had also been driving all day and arrived in the dead of night. Most adorable, cozy, welcoming atmosphere. Extremely clean and air conditioning worked like a dream. would absolutely book again, and very much plan to in the future."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We love staying here, it’s close to our family and better than staying in a hotel. We love all the ranch life and it’s fun to see all the horses and cows too. Gracie is super responsive and attends to any questions you may have. Great couple and great property!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was one of the most unique places we have stayed. Beautiful surroundings, quiet and super cute and quaint. My only regret is that we didn't have more time to spend exploring the Ranch. Gracie was an incredibly gracious host with our last minute reservation and very flexible with check - in. We would absolutely stay here again when we have more time to spend there."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place to overnight horses! Hosts were great. Ranch was beautiful! Stay for a Saturday night rodeo if you can!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A lovely, private, peaceful retreat from the long drive up and down 95. The kids enjoyed the ranch, petting the dogs, meeting the horses. Gracie is very kind! We got to watch her practice her roping! A super fun stop that beats the heck out of a hotel along the highway."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"After a long drive on our road trip it was nice to be off the beaten path surrounded by farmland and animals! I wish we could’ve taken advantage of booking a riding lesson, but we had to get back on the road early. Gracie was accommodating of my fur babies and responsive when I reached out."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Gracie was a welcoming and inviting host! We had a great time at the ranch and learned a lot! We will definitely be back!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The Bunkhouse was a comfortable place to stay for a long weekend soccer tournament in Rocky Mount. It was nice waking up to the peacefulness of the farm as opposed to the normal commercial stuff. Everything we needed was there and we greatly appreciated the ample supply of coffee!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We chose to stay here while heading to ECU in Greenville for our daughter’s graduation. The bunkhouse has a nice, cozy feel to it. The ranch is picturesque and has lots of beautiful horses and cattle. The ranch manager was very friendly as were the other workers we spoke with. I didn’t have an opportunity to meet with Gracie, as they were preparing for an event Saturday evening. However, the beauty of our surroundings, friendliness of her staff, privacy that we were given, and overall ease of our entire stay speaks volumes.
If you are looking for a beautiful, relaxing, inexpensive place to stay over, give Gracie a try. They may even be able to provide riding lessons during your visit."

Everyone is friendly and welcoming even the animals
Try it out guys worth every penny !!!!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This location is a great stopping point for long drives down I-95. It provides a really good farm and scenery instead of being bunked down in a hotel. There are really cool farm Animals that come really close to the house (fenced in).
Make sure you bring your own food. It’s a bit of a drive to the local restaurants."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,quiet and comfortable place that met our needs

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing place to stay! Gracie and Pedro were so nice; we felt right at home to minute we turned down their driveway! The sunrise is beautiful overlooking the horses grazing in the pastures. We stayed during their No Lopin Ranch Ropin show and it was a blast! Fun for the whole family! The food was delicious, people were friendly, and the animals were incredible. I can’t wait to go back!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed at Gracie’s ranch for one brief night on a long family trip. This was the perfect stay for our family of 7!

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay at Gracie’s place was fantastic! The bunkhouse was cute and cozy, and the surrounding land on the ranch was beautiful! Gracie promptly responded to all our questions and made us feel right at home! Would definitely stay again if we are ever in the area."

It was nice to go for a walk to see the horses."
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,My travels were on business and the Bunkhouse was certainly fine for the short stay. Had I had more time the setting on the ranch would have been even better. This will be my choice if I come back to the area overnight.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Met our needs for a roof over our heads and hot shower.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"So nice to stay with our horses. It’s everything you need on an active working farm. So quiet and peaceful at night. And the hosts are wonderful, helpful people."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great Spot, free of distractions and peaceful. It was the Glimpse of the Ranch life. I enjoyed my stay! I slept great! The place was clean and comfy. Gracie was responsive and quick to reply— I had no problems whatsoever!"
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Bed was very comfortable but seemed to be smaller than a queen which was in the description/ thanks for having the heat on for us as we came in late and it was a cool evening/ nice clean overnight stop when passing through the area
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very cute and quaint place to stay for an overnight on our trip south. The place was just as pictured and very clean. There was a coffee machine for the morning and fridge/freezer to use. It was a bit cold when we stayed and unfortunately the little space heater couldn't really keep up. If it's looking like it might be on the cold side during your travel, maybe bring an extra blanket :)"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a wonder retreat to stay at Gracie’s as we had a 12 hour road trip ahead of us the next morning! To walk in to a cozy cabin and watch the horse training outside and be in peaceful surroundings, made for a wonder night’s sleep! Thanks so much Gracie! And for the wine bottle opener 😀"
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great little place that met our needs well.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our stay
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for a great stay! Place was clean and had everything we needed. Wish we had better weather to book horse riding lessons but we were able to find somethings to do in town! Thank you!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I and my friends loved it here! My fiance and I shared the big bed and it was so comfortable. The coffee maker was convenient and worked amazingly. I loved how the bathroom was spacious and clean when we got there! My favorite thing about the bunkhouse was how cozy it was! We did not realize there was no wifi when booking but we brought so many card games that we did not even care about that in the end! The host was awesome about responding and had our well-being in priority mode from check-in to check-out. Definitely will recommend in the future!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Pictures don’t do the Bunkhouse justice!! It looks small from the outside but once you open the front door, it’s amazing!! We loved being able to watch the horses but unfortunately, were not able to schedule a ride due to our short time staying. My husband and I plan on trying to rent the Bunkhouse on our next drive through NC. Thank you Gracie!!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nice quiet place perfect for a resting point. Clean and comfy, couldn’t ask for more!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful ranch stay, you drive past horses to get to the little cabin. We had our two cats with us and they were very accommodating and pet friendly. We had a long drive and got there in the early hours of the morning and accommodated our late check in. Excellent host and phenomenal communication. Perfect place to stay if you want a family farm/ranch atmosphere."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Gracie and Pedro are amazing, caring hosts that went out of their way to make both of our short stays enjoyable and memorable. The ranch is beautiful - serene and exciting at the same time. The bunkhouse is decorated to carry the character of the ranch and is very roomy and comfortable."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Coldest night of the year and the bunkhouse was toasty warm. Gracie warned us the floors may be a little cold (so we brought our slippers!) and she gave us the option to back out with a full refund at the last minute. I'm glad we didn't!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We always have a wonderful stay every time we stay at one of Gracie and Pedro’s places! The new addition of the wall heater in the bunk house was fantastic! We were so warm and cozy. Everything was spotlessly clean, and beds are always comfortable. The red and white bath towels with the candy canes placed like a heart was such a cute idea for Christmas! Always enjoy stopping here overnight. One of our favorite places to stay!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very cute, no frills spot in the middle of a cute farm. Super convenient for our drive and woke up refreshed and ready to go. Wish we could have stayed for horse lessons!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Excellent place to stay for the night! Quick visit to NC and this place was a hidden gem. Thank you
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I was only here overnight but Gracie had helpfully very clear instructions to access the space on a somewhat mazy (but beautiful) property. The space itself was true to description, simple and clean."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Gracie’s ranch is beautiful and I would recommend to anyone wanting to stay in the area! Looking forward to coming back and staying again for a rodeo or event
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I love the Airbnb concept! Last week I spent the night in a caboose in the urban Washington-Baltimore metro area, last night I spent the night at a rural eastern NC ranch!
This place is what I love, far away from the noise of congested cities, out in peace and tranquility with horses and cattle. A very sweet kitty cat greeted us and hung around the area. The space was comfortable and roomy, we enjoyed it!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is great. The property is beautiful and starting in the bunkhouse was truly a unique experience. Would definitely love to stay over again in the near future. Thank you!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay. We enjoyed having all the animals around. Will definitely stay again next time we're in the area.
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Enjoyed our stay.
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful setting! We loved seeing the horses and cattle on the property and being far enough out of town to enjoy the starlit night sky.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was PERFECT!!! 5 stars isn’t enough!! Everyone on the ranch (including animals) are SUPER friendly!! Fantastic place!! I would not hesitate to book here again!! Thank you for hosting us!!
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Gracie was a super host and we loved the charming bunkhouse . We will visit again.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Cute place to stay and worked out perfectly for what I needed!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful cabin, very clean, beds are comfortable. Great communication."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absouletly loved our stay at this bunkhouse! We only needed a place to shower and sleep for one night and Gracie's place met all our needs. We had someone in our group with limited mobility and although the place isn't designed with disabled people in mind there weren't too many obstacles that we couldn't overcome (but I would caution that won't be the case for everyone). We very much enjoyed watching the horses and wished we could have stayed longer to get a riding lesson. The location was a little too far off I-95 for our liking but the farm/ranch is just so charming that we weren't that mad about it. We checked-in by just walking in (same for checking out) and if you're the type that prefers to keep to yourself, we were never bothered by anyone. The bedding was comfortable (very soft!) and cute especially the llama sheet set. There were plenty of towels readily available and small bottles of shampoo and soap to use. There is no dedicated kitchen but the small fridge, microwave, and k-cup coffee were enough for our needs. Disposable cups and cutlery were available but you'll have to bring plates. The bunkhouse does have a rustic appearance but it's very clean! All in all we have no real complaints and think most people would enjoy staying at this bunkhouse."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Love this place—this was my second visit and I plan to be back. Wonderful vibe, easy checking in and out, and I love all of the happy and friendly animals on the ranch!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Awesome place for a family getaway!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our stay was short but we are so glad we booked the bunkhouse. Our little one loved seeing the animals and had plenty of room to run around and play. We enjoyed getting a glimpse of ranch life!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I loved the cabin. Not too far from city activity but still quite and serene. Glad I found this little gem. I hope to come back.
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,simple cabin on a really cool horse ranch.we loved the dogs and beautiful horses.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"For those seeking to escape the humdrum and unplug for a weekend, Gracie’s bunkhouse is perfect. Communication was perfect and the place was exactly as described. I would stay again no doubt."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our overnight stay.
The Bunk House is located on a beautiful ranch property.
Very quiet and serene, out in the country, but very close to Wilson and US 301 highway.
It was somewhat rustic but pristine inside with everything we needed.
Beds were comfortable and bathroom & shower were fine too.
Cool pictures of the ranch and rodeo events hanging throughout the interior.
Communication with Gracie was top notch! She was most accommodating and always responded promptly to our text messages. We would stay again if in the area in the future."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was a wonderful location and so pet friendly. If you love horses, great place to stay."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay, as always"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, peaceful, and clean place :) would definitely stay again!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Just a special place, wish we had stayed longer.
Just as described; cool experience and good people."
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Had to stay here for a night with my family and it was great! It was very cute, and I loved the selection of coffee."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family I had a wonderful here! Considering it is on a ranch, expect a very rustic experience! The night we stayed was an going on but bunkhouse is far enough away that it really didn't affect my nights sleep all. Would recommend to anyone who needs to get off the road for a bit and enjoy a night out of the city."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely clean accommodation with a nice sized shower. Be aware that there’s no TV or WiFi , but that is all part of the charm of being on an authentic working horse ranch. The decor is so in keeping with a ranch, and it was great to start the next day off with a keurig coffee."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Just like all the reviews I’ve read, we loved our stay in the Bunkhouse! We’re city dwellers so I was nervous about being way out and away from everything but this place is incredible and right around the corner from everything you could need. The dog and cat we met are super friendly. The kids went horse back riding and had a blast with Carmen. If you’re looking for a place that’s peaceful and away from it all (but not too far away) this is it."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"awesome stay, awesome host, and Gracie was an amazing instructor as gf and I learned to ride horses! definitely will be staying again 😁"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful farm place. I wish we stayed more than a night to see the farm. Owners have been welcoming.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Thanks is not enough for Gracie and her entire crew at the ranch for the AWESOME food recommendations, the wonderful place to stay, the hospitality, and the overall experience of our stay. We are truly grateful, and will DEFINITELY stay there again on our way through, or maybe even for a short getaway! Everything in the description is 100% accurate, the bunkhouse would be awesome to bring a few kids along for the weekend, and to give them a bit of a ranch exposure. Gracies's dogs all got along so well with our 100 pound American Bulldog, who is usually a bit shy around new dogs, but well-socialized at the local dog parks. They ran around for a bit, and it was great to see her have a bit of freedom. The driveway is long and off the road, so your stay is very quiet, and well groomed (one of our vehicles is a low Corvette and DIDN""T DRAG the air splitter NOT ONE BIT!!!!) for any ride. The bed was very comfortable, and the very hot shower felt great after a long day on the road. This is EASILY one of the BEST AirBnB places we have stayed. Thank you!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We loved that Gracie’s place was dog friendly. It was only an overnight for us during our drive from Maine to Florida. We wished we could have stayed longer because the property looks absolutely beautiful!
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"What a beautiful location! We enjoyed our stay in 'The Bunkhouse' immensely. There are minimal cooking options, so be sure to plan to eat out while you are there. The nearest town is about a 15 minute drive away. The farm is beautiful and well maintained. I wish we would have been able to enjoy some time with the horses, but we were only there for a quick overnight stay. The bunkhouse itself has a funny smell possibly from the older furniture that is in it. It is definitely clean, but has that 'old furniture' smell I have found at a few Airbnb's."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Fun experience to stay here and the kids loved the play set!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to get away and just relax. Very nice group of people and very well ran outfit.! Recommend 10/10!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Gracies place was amazing. My family two sons, age 13 and 16, and two nephews, age 10 and 15, loved staying here. They enjoyed being able to lounge on the swingset while watching the horses and playing with the cat. The house was adorable and comfy. We will definitely be coming back. If you're looking for a place to relax and enjoy country living this is the place for you."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great little bunkhouse on a beautiful ranch! The location and decor makes you feel like you just came from a rodeo. Plenty of room, large shower, and the host was able to accommodate for our early arrival. 10/10"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Gracie and Pedro are great hosts! Their bunkhouse on their ranch made us Texans feel at home.
Gracie had very clear and timely communication.
We had everything we needed for our family of 6. From bath supplies to the cute play set outside.
We felt safe, secure, and refreshed. The bunkhouse was clean and well organized.
Highly recommend to any families. Or even couples."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The ranch is a wonderful place to stay! The place was very clean, easy to find, very quiet and right off the freeway. I’ll definitely be back for a longer stay if I’m in the Wilson area again!"
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Gracie was very communicative. It was super clean and comfortable.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,What a lovely place! Definitely THE place to stay if you are into the farm life. what's not to like about waking up and seeing horses outside your window? Gracie is such a wonderful host and super on top of everything! would stay here in the future!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is something special. What you see is what you get. Nothing fancy and a bit rustic, but the beds were comfortable, it was clean and shower was great. The atmosphere was amazing with animals and beautiful fields all around with some friendly cats and dogs to boot. I traveled with my 4 year old cousin and she was fortunate enough to have a morning lesson with Gracie…she will never forget it. Can’t wait to go back."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was just as described and clean. We had a great stay and it was very quiet w beautiful scenery outside around us. Easy check in process and Gracie was quick to respond to the questions we had.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you Gracie your Amazing Husband for the most amazing Airbnb stay I’ve ever taken. You and your husband are amazing. someone should do a little write up on you how amazing your place is and let the rest of the Airbnb travelers in the world know you’re a complete gem!! Thank You from the bottom of my heart!! 💚❤️
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Basic bunkhouse that was a nice place to rest on our trip between Florida and Virginia as a change from a roadside hotel! You do need to come prepared as there aren't any amenities close to the property (part of its charm!). The coffee bar with travel cups was perfect and there is a fridge and microwave to make your own breakfast. My kids loved the super friendly cat and dog.
2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"We stayed here and absolutely loved it. I cant say enough good things about this. The ranch is beautiful. The bunkhouse was so beautifully decorated and clean. We took horse lessons and had the best time. We learned so much and had so much fun riding the horses. This was the highlight of our vacation. Amazing experience, wound give this 10 stars if I could!!!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Awesome place. I’ve been to AirBnBs everywhere - from the Florida Keys to the mountains of West Virginia and beyond. One of our favorite stays. The farm dogs are so sweet and will greet you everytime you come and go. Nice bathroom, hot shower. Quiet and peaceful. Bed is extremely comfortable. We really enjoyed our stay at the Ranch and would definitely stay again."
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great for a get away! Says it sleeps 6 but you have to squeeze in but not horribly bad. Adults no but 2 adults and 3-4 kids or teens. Very sweet church people
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay, you won’t be disappointed. Gracie was very welcoming and paid attention to every detail inside the bunkhouse. The bed was very comfortable and the kitchenette was perfect for what we needed."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place, we really enjoyed it! Off the beaten path which is a plus, not the normal pain of hotel travel which is a big plus! Gracie was prompt an very informative. We would gladly stay there again."
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Loved the location. Our doggies did too.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We highly recommend this stay! It’s cozy and cute. We loved looking at the cows and horses and hearing them in the morning. The property is beautiful, as is the drive to get there."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Fantastic. We enjoyed the setting and a ride with the horses in the morning. The ranch hands were awesome with our small kids!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay. Gracie was so nice and everything was perfect. Would definitely return.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful cabin located in the middle of breathtaking ranch!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Necho was a helpful and informative host. He gave clear instructions on how to access the home. The home was a beautiful place to stay in. My stay felt like I was at home. I recommend booking with Necho!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Overall a wonderful experience. We were in town for Barton's graduation and the house was the perfect hub for the family. Lots of places to sit, eat, and relax. The family atmosphere created a stress free weekend as we celebrated our graduate. We used the grill to cook-out and the neighbors in the shared space were very friendly, as well. When I needed something, Necho was quick to respond and very helpful. I wish that I would have discovered this property sooner. I would have utilized more often."
2024-05-01,4.0,Group trip,"It was a very nice historical old house. We really loved the house. It just needs a lot of love and attention. I couldn’t give a 5. The outside needed a lot of attention. Litter on the grounds, broken boards on a porch. The front door was unable to be used, the doorknob was about to fall off. One of the downstairs bedrooms needed cleaning behind doors (when going to close the door there was a lot of dust and looked like chipped paint on the floor); several lamps needed bulbs or extension cords; back entryway light is out. Windows were hard to see through.
Love and attention would make this such a more beautiful house. Overall it was a great place for us to stay. And we would return. We loved that the Christmas tree was still up. And some of the outside lights on the shrubs worked, but not all of them."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were told the night before that our house that we originally booked was not available, but turned out to be fine for our girls trip! We each had our own bathroom and bedroom."
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a historic house turned into an Airbnb rental. It is like staying in George Washington's house. The place is comfortable for a large party. It has antique furniture, original hard floors, and woodwork which we appreciated. What made us not to give it a 5 star is the condition of the front yard-- broken branches and litter made a bad impression. Windows were covered with dust and while we know those are old and hard to clean, we would have liked to see them clean. The overall cleanliness of the place was good. Other things to note were the broken dishwasher and malfunctioning shower head in one of the bathrooms which we let the host know. Also, some of the lamps needed either bulbs or extension cords to be able to plug them in. We let the host know of it. Otherwise the house had several grand chandeliers working. We loved the house but left it with the feeling that it needed a bit more love and care. Communication with the host was fast. He was flexible with check-in/out."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a hidden Gem, a beautifully preserved piece of history. Our host was simply lovely and presented a beautifully well appointed space for our family.
We had a wonderful stay. The history and character of this home is worth seeing. Furnished with beautiful antiques yet modern amenities.
Necho is a delightful, accommodating host who had excellent communication, flexibility and understanding of our needs for the weekend.
I highly recommend this gorgeous home, we had the most relaxing time on a busy weekend. We hope to have the opportunity to come back.
A big thank you to our host and for making us feel so welcomed and right at home. Five stars plus for this stay."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is our second time staying with this host. Very welcoming. Stay is always comfortable. House is very unique and feels like a historical piece.
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful older house. Close to things to do. Really enjoyed our stay here.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Necho's place was well-located, comfortable, clean and well-maintained. We enjoyed our stay here and would recommend it for anyone who finds themselves in Wilson and wants a big house with historic details. Necho was also a friendly host and great communicator!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,we enjoyed our stay in this beautiful home!
2023-12-01,4.0,Group trip,By far the most unique place I have stayed! Necho was an amazing host…extremely responsive and flexible. The house was clean but it did not have the little touches I have seen at other Air B&Bs.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A great place to gather our families. Necho promptly answered our questions.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We came to Wilson for the Newberry vs Barton College football game. We very much enjoyed our stay, especially the front porch. The house had way more rooms than we even needed. Everything was neat and clean. We also enjoyed all the local food and entertainment recommendations from the host. It was a beautiful home and beautiful town."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful old Victorian with a mixture of antique and modern furnishings. Great place.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our family was just traveling through headed to OBX. This home was perfect for us. It was all adults and this gave us plenty of full size beds to accommodate us all. The home is beautiful and historic. Our host was very nice and helpful. He recommended local restaurants and we chose Marty's BBQ. Fantastic. For breakfast the next day we went to Amy Jo's. highly recommend both. Our family will be booking again next fall for our vacation. Thank you, Necho."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Incredible experience in a very authentic historical house. The house is extremely spacious with lovely pieces of furniture. Necho is a very attentive and responsive host. A pleasure to stay at his place!
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Such a cool and unique stay. I would recommend!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This home is perfect for large guests. It has plenty of space for eating and sleeping. There are more than enough bathrooms for everyone.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great historic house - which the kids translated as haunted but it definitely was not! Necho had excellent communication. I’d stay here again if we’re ever in the area.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I would give this a 5 star 10 times come, one of the most beautiful homes. I've ever stated in. My family and I will definitely come back and stay here. I was mesmerized by the palms the antique look of this house it's breath taking. Beautiful front yard. All our family took some really nice pictures outside the house and inside. The house was very comfortable. And very convenient for every bedroom to have its own bathroom. Big plus."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Thank you Necho for hosting us, we really enjoyed our stay at your home. Thank you."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house is so worth visiting the town of Wilson. It is beautiful and was beyond comfortable for our family of 10. Almost like stepping back in time to a wonderful old southern “mansion.” So many rooms and a huge kitchen that made us all feel so much at home. We were traveling for our son’s graduation and Necho even left a Congratulations card and balloons at the house on the day of graduation. Such a nice thought. He was extremely responsive and always answered quickly. My father-in-law is in a wheelchair, but it was not too difficult to get him in and out of the house. Just a short step to enter the house and was able to maneuver him in the wheelchair.
I would love to visit the house again. The town is so welcoming and the restaurants are great. You should plan a destination retreat to this beautiful home."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely LOVED our stay! The pictures do not do the historic charm of the estate justice. I felt like I stepped into a Jane Austen novel. there was plenty of room that our family of 8 didn't feel like we were on top of each other, and we even had room to host extended family for dinner one night.
Absolutely exquisite stay and have already recommended it to several other family members."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great property and awesome host! We really enjoyed our stay.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,great place! worth the money! beautiful home and very comfortable. would have loved to stay longer.
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,A great option for our group to stay and make great memories.
2023-04-01,2.0,Group trip,Space wasn’t the cleanest. Found bugs in the bed. House was not warmed properly. Very dusty. Does not sleep 11 full grown adult men. Only sleeps comfortably 7. Would not recommend.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Necho was great to work with, and the place was great. It is a beautiful old victorian with tons of character. It was exactly what we were looking for, and will definitely stay there again."
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Thanks Necho! We loved the stay!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,My family and I stayed at one of Necho homes last year. I love how friendly and respectful he is most of all how beautiful the homes be. If I can't book with Necho I won't book with no one I'll wait to one is available from him before I think about visiting home again. I can't wait to book with him again .
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Necho's property is one I will definitely return to. The communication was simply excellent - and this is an AirBnB owner you can Trust. If you like historic properties, you will love this home. A++"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great experience!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were in town for a soccer tournament and the house was perfect. Large enough for all our guests, plenty of space and bathrooms for all bedrooms. Central to everything in/around Wilson. Necho was a fantastic host and was very friendly and accommodating."
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The host was very responsive to messages. The house was huge and big enough for our 11 guests to move around. The number of bathrooms was amazing to accommodate everyone. Each headroom
Had a bathroom plus a half bath plus a full bathroom in the laundry room!
Easy instructions to get into the house and check out.
I addressed the cleanliness of the house with the host and he said he would talk to the cleaning crew. The cleanliness was a major concern with my family. I feel if this is addressed this house would be the best stay for families for the amazing price."
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,It was wonderful!!!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The home was just as advertised. Definitely has the feel of an old mansion. We had a group of teenagers for a youth conference nearby, and the bedrooms spread out but the common areas like dining room and the big kitchen were perfect for our group. We really appreciated the communication from ownership and wouldn’t hesitate to stay in this wonderful home again."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Love the house, host is super easy to work with. It’s our go-to place anytime we are anywhere near the area."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This house is really awesome

Our entire family had plenty of space and we loved that each room has a private bathroom, perfect for a large group!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house is stunning! Staying here is truly an experience in itself. Extremely spacious and beautifully ornate, it’s like stepping back in time but with modern comfort and convenience. I really loved that each room had its own smart TV and its own bathroom. we had a large group, including small children, and everyone was very comfortable and happy in this house. Highly recommend!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,My friends and I had a wonderful weekend! Fun reunion and a comfortable and very interesting house to come back too. We’re hoping to have a few more “old” Girl Scout friends join us for the next one in 5 years.
2022-09-01,4.0,Group trip,"An awesome house in a great location. Necho communicated with us very well and we enjoyed how much space we had for our large crew. Other than a few cleanliness issues, the place was just perfect and we’ll stop again if we’re every in the area."
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,We rented 4 of Necho’s homes for our wedding party and family to stay in. His houses are well maintained and very comfortable. He was wonderful & accommodated all of our needs. Perfect place to stay if you have a large group!
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Our team stays at the locations Necho rents us. The houses are always well equipped and everything is provided. Just perfect. Thank you so much!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying there! Thank you!
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"The listing can't do this gorgeous home justice. We had a blast just wandering through getting lost while fighting over whi gets what great room. It's obvious the home is handled with love and we just had the best stay. Can't beat the location, either. Can't wait to stay again when it isn't the height of summer so we can properly take advantage of how walkable everything is."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent host and property; extremely comfortable as well as historic. Perfect for family gathering.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I am from Wilson and this AMAZING compound of historic well kept homes is PERFECT for anyone wanting to visit the South. Our Host was amazing and there if you needed anything. If I could give 101 Stars is give it. I host over 50 family friends and EVERYONE enjoyed these amazing Homes.
2022-06-01,4.0,Group trip,"We enjoyed our visit and check in was great. The house is huge and one can get turned around, but not for long. :) Necho's quick response to our questions were on point. We were able to share some areas of improvement concerning house maintenance. We had a very comfortable stay during the really HOT days. The AC kept us very comfortable. Best Regards"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay, a lot of fun to explore. Hide & Seek is scary in here at night.
Pet friendly was a key focus on this trip so it was great to have that as an extra.
lots of towels and toiletries available for guests to use."
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful place to stay. Necho is very accommodating.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The BEST place to stay in Wilson! Our family ended up renting out all of Necho’s properties for our wedding and it was so nice to have everyone together and on the same grounds. Not to mention it was centrally located and each property was so beautiful. Can’t recommend enough!
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,This home is magnificent! It is gorgeous inside and out! It was perfect for housing my large family during my graduation weekend! The rooms were large and everyone had ample space. I love staying in unique homes such as this one. There was so much character in this house. It was also very clean and had everything we needed. The host was amazing and was so easy to communicate with. Highly recommend this place!
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Thank you for your beautiful home!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, unique home with very responsive owners!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,The house was amazing comfortable and clean. Couldn’t have asked for a better place. There was enough space for our families. Definitely be back in the future. Thanks to Necho for being a great host.
2022-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Necho’s house was a great place to stay it was beautiful and had very charming decor. The beds were very comfy and the house was up to all our standards.
2022-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Necho’s passion for Wilson is evident in how hard he works to make sure his guests enjoy their stay in his beautiful historic home. He is very responsive and attentive to his guests needs as well as providing local recommendations. When renting this home remember it’s an old home, which means its got its quirks and is in a constant process of restoration, but its irreplaceable charm can’t be beat by any ordinary rental. A huge selling point for us was having a bathroom to each bedroom! Staying in this home gives you such a unique experience that you rarely find for such a reasonable price. I would highly recommend it!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great property spacious rooms and very neat and clean and convenient check in and check it out had a great time in Wilson
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Necho’s property is a treasure, Victorian Home with loads of character and very functional for multiple families traveling together. It was the perfect place for us. Very clean and great communication throughout the stay."
2022-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place is an amazing location for anyone looking to get away. The house not only is gorgeous on the outside, but beautiful on the inside. The host definitely went above and beyond my expectations! If I could give 10 stars I would loved my stay"
2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Unique and great holiday stay! We spent our Christmas holiday here with our family of 7. Plenty of space to gather. This home (built in the 1850s) was really unique and well decorated for the holidays. Necho was a great host. We're looking forward to visiting again.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful home, incredibly clean. Communicative host and pet friendly was a big plus"
2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is a majestic, comfortable old home that has amazing high ceilings, fire-places in almost every room, and gorgeous wood floors and details everywhere. The kitchen is large and would be easy to cook in, although we didn't have time to cook while we were there. The location couldn't be more centrally located in Wilson- right around the corner from the University. If you need to stay in the area, this is a way to do it while also feeling you are stepping back in time with all the comforts and space you could possibly need. If you need a central area to watch tv or movies as a group comfortably this could be the only drawback of the layout I can think of- all the televisions are in bedrooms, except for one which is in a sitting room that has table-seating only. Maybe some moving of furniture could remedy that, though? I do highly recommend this property. The owner was very responsive and seemed to truly care about us having a wonderful stay."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very nice and spacious home. Located in a nice neighborhood. We had no issues with the host very kind and profesional .
We will return !"
2021-11-01,5.0,Group trip,We stayed at the Wilson Estate with my family for the Thanksgiving weekend! And Necho was very accommodating and we were very pleased with our stay here! It was my first time staying at an Airbnb and it was a perfect experience. Necho always responded in a timely fashion and answered all my questions. We all recommend staying here!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent stay. Great host.
2021-11-01,5.0,Group trip,This house is stunning. It transports you back in time. We travelled for the Whirligig festival with friends and made it a weekend. This would be an amazing place for a small team retreat or a family event. We’re planning already!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect home…Perfect location for our family. Beautiful historic home with incredible charm and extraordinary amenities. We will be back for sure
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A lot of places to shop and eat within a close proximity
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Comfortable and spacious . Very close to restaurants and downtown Wilson.
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Necho is a great host and available if you need anything. The home is very lovely and comfortable. I love historic and being in it made me feel I was in an old movie. The home is old but sleep well with lots of space. It was perfect for my women ministry retreat and we will stay there again.
2021-09-01,4.0,Group trip,"Our family (nine members) stayed 2 nights at the Enchanted Estate during the holiday weekend.

We are extremely appreciative to Necho for allowing us to modify our booking without penalty and also allowing us a late check out! Necho (Host) was very responsive and super friendly. We booked the entire home and the pricing was great for 3 nights. The estate is historic, quaint with plenty of natural sunlight and location is nice with ample parking.

The rooms are very spacious, each with queen size beds and an adjoining bathroom for each room. We had a full kitchen, with plenty of space which included stove top, fridge, cooking utensils, pots and pans. Simple things like paper towels, cleaning products were readily available and it was really nice to be able to cook meals.
There were several housekeeping issues we had to address during our stay. The water temperature in the showers could have been hotter, as the water was cold after several showers were taken. But this wasn't a deal breaker. However, the property was not thoroughly cleaned as we expected and everyone had different experience. We contacted Necho immediately and we were very impressed with his understanding and attentiveness to our concerns due to the COVID pandemic. He was very apologetic and shared his dilemma with keeping housekeeping staff due to COVID. He immediately addressed and went above and beyond to rectify our issues. He also agreed to move us to an adjacent property to ensure we were comfortable. We really appreciated the quick response and customer service provided.
Necho also provided us a personal tour of the adjacent four properties which will be undergoing renovations. It was very nice to be able to wander into each room of each home. We were able to see some very interesting architectural features of the homes.
The property has some nice spaces, but could use a little more TLC to be awesome. But it's still a great place! It will more appealing once the major upgrades and renovations are completed. Our family will consider having next year’s family reunion onsite. Overall, I would recommend/stay again once all renovations are completed."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Edge Loft was an awesome experience! The unique layout, artistic decoration, and uncluttered, clean layout offered a great weekend of rest for our family. Barbara was extremely helpful in her instructions checking in and offering recommendations in the area. It was a great visit!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I ❤️❤️❤️❤️ this place from the decor to the art work. It gave you urban while being in Wilson couldn’t believe I found this gem in Wilson
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Barbs place has to be the coolest spot in Wilson. Bright natural light, amazing art, books and detailed touches throughout the place. The only Airbnb I’d book when coming back to Wilson. Thank you barb!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect little stay! Filled with art and spacious, airy, and relaxing. Excellent quality sheets and towels and comfy mattress (clearly a nice memory foam topper on both beds. Cozy throws and good pillows. Everything we needed in the kitchen! 10/10 stay. Will definitely stay again in the future. Perfect with young kids, they loved the open space and crayons and paper! And the big bath tub!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Barbara’s place is absolutely stunning! The space is open and welcoming; the beds are very comfortable.
We stayed for a family celebration, and Barbara’s place helped elevate the weekend and our stay! Barbara was also so sweet and left great recommendations on where to eat around town, perfect for those traveling to town. I highly recommend it if you are looking for a quiet and relaxing place to stay!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful loft with fantastic hosts!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wow!!! Run, do not walk, to Barb’s spectacular loft apartment. The space is incredible and even more beautiful than the photos. It is spacious and in the heart of downtown Wilson. Barb and Sebastian are welcoming hosts who were available, although never intrusive, and so kindly showed us their art studios. We simply cannot wait to return!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of the nicest Airbnb’s I’ve ever stayed in. The space is great. Spacious and exactly to my tastes. All of my interactions with the hosts were prompt, super easy and helpful.
The town is interesting. I did not know what to expect. At first I saw a post-apocalypse dystopia. But it worked its charms. There are very cool things, plus I had a top five lifetime cheeseburger off a food truck. I’d go back, but only if I got to stay at this delightful spot.
If you’re thinking of staying here, stop reading my nonsense and click book now."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place with an awesome host!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Loft at The Edge was not just a stay; it was an experience. We loved staying in a loft and the space definitely delivered. Not only was it comfortable and spacious, but it was clean and just a cool place to stay. Well decorated with art, books and magazines to get your creative juices flowing. Thanks Barbara & Sebastian for being gracious hosts & providing a tour of your galleries and the great restaurant suggestions. The location was a good midpoint for us traveling from NJ to SC. We, including our dog, highly recommend The Loft."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying in the loft when in town to visit family! We will definitely be staying again! Barb was so responsive and friendly leading up to, and throughout, our entire stay!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Barbara was an outstanding host. The loft is very unique and simply beautiful. I loved all of the decor and the open feel of the space. I highly recommend the stay, well worth the money and within walking distance of many local galleries and restaurants. Will definitely book again when I am in the area."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful space. Was very surprised there was something that nice in the area. Close to restaurants and some nightlife. I really enjoyed my stay there.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family of four absolutely loved staying at the loft. The location was perfect we walked to breakfast at the Carolina Cheese Company and played Arcade games and ate delicious pizza at the Hub one night. We found parking around the area to be very easy but also very walkable. The loft was extremely clean and beautiful . It had all the amenities we needed. It offers a lot of space even though it is one open floor plan it is divided up beautifully. Communication was instant over the air bnb app and my husband even got to meet Sebastian while we were there . The owners put very much thought into everything from the soft fluffy towels to the crayons and colored pencils. We will be sure to stay again when we are visiting the area . Thanks Barbara & Sebastian
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place. Better than the pics show!! And they look amazing!! Would stay again for sure!! Barb is very proactive and responsive.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely fabulous Airbnb! We loved it so much that we were torn between spending time out of the Airbnb vs. in the adorable town. Fortunately, it rained quite a bit and our outdoor plans were shuttered so it allowed us to spend some cozy time in the loft. The design, art and book selection(oh my!) were all top notch. I initially thought it was overpriced, but after the stay, I was glad I’d paid a premium for such a premium experience. We’ll be back, for sure! One of our new favorite places!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place is a gem in downtown Wilson. We will always try to stay here when we visit Wilson.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,very nice
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cleanest air b&b I have ever stayed in. Area was nice and lots of options for food and fun
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The loft was absolutely beautiful and the location couldn’t have been more perfect for us. We wanted to explore downtown Wilson and the loft was in walking distance of art galleries, museums, restaurants, breweries, coffee shops and the acclaimed Vollis Simpson Whirlygig Park and museum. Barb, out host, was incredibly warm, friendly and helpful. She was quick to answer any question I had and helped to make our trip even more special. I would recommend this location to anyone planning to travel to the area. You will not be disappointed!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The loft is as beautiful in person as it is in photos, and it’s also a very peaceful and relaxing space. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second of many stays that I have planned at the Loft. This time the children (12 and 24) came along who decided that The Loft is ""one of their favorites"".
Although it rained the entire stay, the atmosphere and set up at the loft made way for a ""family art jam session"", family spa day, games, reading, journaling and plenty of good food choices.
I appreciate that my second tour at the art gallery downstairs (The Edge) was ""different and yet the same"". The new upstairs exhibit included a ""red rock theme"". Sebastian's musical /pop art downstairs is timeless.
I highly recommend a stay at The Loft for outstanding host(s)/hospitality. Other experiences include: The Artisan Farmer's Market, different art galleries, museums, small town spa, food trucks, good food and friendly people."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful stay at the loft on our way up North from Charleston. The space is beautiful, inspiring, relaxing, and so much more. We can’t wait to stay in the future, and cannot imagine going back to a hotel after this experience.
I also got so much inspiration from an interior design perspective too. It was just stunning!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything was beautiful and looked just like the pictures!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved staying at this location. Met all our needs. Very walkable to local pubs and restaurants. Ample, easy parking."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely gorgeous. We really enjoyed our time at Barbara’s property. A unique stay with gracious hosts. We hope to return soon.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Recommend
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at The Loft was 10 stars!
From beginning to end, Barbara was ""the hostess with the mostest"".....she genuinely cares about providing a space that fits the needs of her guest, so much so she/Sebastian purchased a blender for my visit.
Out of every place that I have stayed, this one is top notch special. The decor, furnishings, amenities, books, art, activities, cleanliness and fresh smell set a high bar within the industry.
It felt as if I was staying at an ""art-spa hotel"" with a personal concierge included.
All of this yet with a ""small town-at home"" feel.

I was granted an early arrival for the local Artisan Farmer's Market which was also a wonderful experience. The local shops and food are also great. The people and hospitality add to what makes this place a ""hidden gem"".
The Edge Gallery (below The Loft) is a must see. Whether you're an ""artsy"" or not Sebastian's work is AMAZING!
I will most certainly share my experience as well as return with family and friends."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a relaxing stay, with great hosts! We hope to return."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The loft is beautiful. Barb is friendly, helpful, and responsive. My husband and I really enjoyed our stay."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is such a gem in Wilson! We truly enjoyed our stay here.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is the second time we have stayed at the Loft. It is one of those truly unique, one-of-a-kind places. We’ve only had one night stays but next time we will stay longer so we can spend more time enjoying the space, looking through all the many books, working on the jigsaw puzzle, and discovering more of the interesting galleries and unique spots in the town of Wilson."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,My mom and I were traveling north from Savannah and Wilson was a perfect stopping point. I’ve never been so I didn’t know what to expect so we were delighted to find a historical town with a focus on the arts! The loft was enormous! Every detail was comforting and beautiful. Thank you so much to Barb and your partner for giving us a tour of your gallery. It made me want to come back to visit! The coffee shop next door was fantastic and very convenient. I took a short walk around town before we left and it felt like such a special undiscovered town. Thank you again for everything!!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really enjoyed this gorgeous space! Perfect for a weekend getaway, downtown is beautiful with a lot of nearby small businesses to choose from!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Exquisite environment to unwind, relax and be visually and intellectually stimulated simultaneously. Wilson is a town on the way to becoming a true haven for creative minds and souls. Barbs amazing loft is comfortable, warm and welcoming. Next time we visit we plan to stay a week!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We’ve stayed at AirBnb’s all over the world and this is by far our favorite! This is worth a visit to Wilson!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wilson, NC...inside was like a NYC loft.
Awesome decor and daughter liked the smells.
Loved the giraffe. I want one!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place is beautifully decorated a really great space for anyone and the hosts are very nice and accommodating
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This loft is absolutely GORGEOUS and even more amazing than pictured. Walkable to coffee shops and restaurants. Barb answered all questions I had so quickly and was amazing to deal with. 10/10 recommend. I will 100% be booking a stay here in the future!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful experience! So much charm and character. The soaker tub was icing on the cake. Completely accurate description of everything. Appreciated the local recommendations. I hope the downtown continues to re-energize as many storefronts were empty. But the slow pace was just what I needed.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We recently had the pleasure of staying here and it was hands down the best Airbnb experience ever. The loft was incredibly stylish and beautifully decorated, with a mix of modern and vintage furnishings that made it feel like a home away from home. Barbara and Sebastian were the perfect hosts - extremely knowledgeable about the area, friendly, and accommodating . They were able to recommend great places to eat and drink, and even gave us a tour of their art gallery, The Edge, where I ended up buying a piece of art to remind me of our stay. The location of the loft is perfect - it’s in a quaint town with a charming bakery next door which was a perfect place for a cup of coffee and light breakfast. Barbara and Sebastian were so welcoming and made sure we had everything we needed during our stay. I highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a unique and memorable experience. We loved it so much we ordered take out and made cocktails in the loft so we didn’t have to leave! 10/10"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cool space. The hosts are very nice and went out of their way so we would have an enjoyable time. Very friendly neighborhood as well. We wished we were staying longer to check out the gallery down stairs and some of the other restaurants.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed at a lot of Airbnb and this place was incredible. Barbara’s loft was like something from a magazine. Beautifully decorated, spotless clean, and the attention to every detail ….WOW. I cannot say enough wonderful things about this hidden gem in Wilson and it’s host. Barbara was the perfect host and she is also a brilliant artist. If you are planning a trip to Wilson look not further. This is the place to stay. We will definitely be coming back"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a wonderful gem in Wilson. We didn’t expect to find a place outside of the normal hotel chains and this was a very welcomed surprise.
An NYC style open loft with new and old style touches made this place absolutely amazing.
Located downtown, it is ideally located around some great local businesses such as Tig’s Courtyard and Treat Yo’ Self Bakery just to name a few and 2 blocks from the great Whirligig Park. Within a mile of the Barton College Campus this is a must stay."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Treat yourself to a one of a kind experience in a beautifully designed, peaceful and restorative space in the loft above “ The Edge”, an art gallery in downtown Wilson, NC.
This rural, formerly bustling, tobacco town, is undergoing a metamorphosis into an artist enclave filled with positive energy.
The loft is full of light and spaces to sit and enjoy each other. My sister’s and I (3 of us) spent a long weekend just soaking in the pleasure of being together. The loft has everything that you need and is in walking distance to the Vollis Simpson Whirligig Park and many cool art galleries, the Wilson Arboretum and the Wilson Rose Garden. There is an amazing bakery Treat Yo Self (with a pink roof) about a block away from the Whirleygigs that I am willing to drive from Cary for their wonderful treats.
Barb is a 5 star hostess and will enthusiastically guide you to the wonders that Wilson has to offer. She is an amazing artist and we all left with a piece of her art to cherish as we remember our time together.
Be a part of the transformation of this formerly forgotten town into a spectacular destination for everyone. All it takes is viewing the potential of the town with a positive attitude and absorbing the energy of those with a creative vision. We loved our stay at Barb’s loft and could not have been more pleased that we found it on airbnb. A true delight."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This space is immaculate and cozy! Barb is so gracious and generous as a hostess! Great views, art, chef’s kitchen, and such comfortable beds!!! 10 out of 10!!!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I think I could write a whole book on what we liked about The Loft. It is the perfect type of space that I search for - contemporary, modern, light filled, open design.... The space is full of unique and interesting objects and a wonderful selection of books and magazines. I just wish we would have had more time to enjoy it all - especially to work on the partially completed jigsaw puzzle. We had a delightful conversation with Barb and are definitely planning to return in the future."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The loft was as pictured (gorgeous, bright, and spacious) and check-in was easy. Barbara was welcoming and had good recommendations for things to do in the area, and was responsive during the booking, check-in, and check-out process. Highly recommend!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The loft was so spacious. It is very well kept and CLEAN. I loved the boho chic design with the safari accents. There are a few local breweries in walking distance, so it was the perfect location for me. I look forward to future stays."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A fabulous place! We felt like we were in a NYC loft. Extremely spacious and comfortable with lots of special touches. Will definitely stay here again!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The loft was as advertised and provided an ideal place to stay for a brief visit (two nights) to attend some Wilson Tobs baseball games. The location was very convenient to the ball park, just minutes away and was within short walking distance to a nice coffee shop and a few pubs. Communication with the host Barbara was efficient and quick and although we didn't need anything, I felt confident that Barbara would have helped in a timely manner. As to the loft, it is just very comfortable. There are several clutches of chairs, sofas, and tables where we were able to chat and socialize very comfortably. The beds are VERY comfortable - had two very restful nights. I will definitely plan to stay at the loft again. While more expensive than a chain hotel for just two people, the comfort and home-like feeling is so much worth the greater expense. Simply, a very easy and relaxing experience."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This loft is fabulous! Everything was crisp, clean, and stylish. A great relaxing vibe. The bed was super comfortable. The open shower/bathroom concept was so cool, and the bathtub made for a relaxing evening. Loved all the personal touches and art that made me feel at home. Felt like I was in Soho NYC or Wicker Park CHI. If you’re exploring anywhere in eastern North Carolina, I’d highly recommend making this place your home base."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My wife, 5-year-old daughter and I were just delighted with the whole experience we had in Wilson, largely due to our stumbling upon Barb's fantastic place. Clean and well-appointed, the loft is spacious and beautifully decorated, with very positive energy and calming undertones. The beds are INCREDIBLY comfortable and were just what we needed after a long day of flying and driving. On top of everything else, it was a real pleasure to meet Barb. She was a perfect host, greeting us when we arrived to show us up to the flat, offering great tips for things to do / see / eat in Wilson, and educating us about this very sweet and welcoming town. Will definitely reach out to book again if in the area!!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was Amazing!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really nice place and great host!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Absolutely the best Airbnb experience you can ask for. This space is an absolute gem and getting to spend three weeks here while I was visiting my daughter was amazing. The space is absolutely stunning to look at. Everyone who saw it was amazed and everyone at work kept thinking it was a Zoom background… they couldn’t believe their eyes. Barb is an incredible host, is super attentive, communicative, and absolutely bent over backwards to make sure everything was perfect. I hadn’t even given the keys back yet when I was making plans for a return. I haven’t even flown all the way home yet and I miss this loft already!! What an amazing experience!!!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Barbara has lovingly created a beautiful space that we felt at home the moment we walked in. The loft is bright and airy, with an inviting warmth that’s tastefully appointed with soft textures, comfortable furniture and art she’s either collected or created. The windows and the skylights let in so much natural light and with the cross breeze on a beautiful day, it was perfect to lounge and take in the space, while reading one of the books from her curated library. Barbara was a gracious host, answering all our questions and taking the time to show us all around the loft and introduce us to Wilson. It was an excellent and refreshing way to celebrate not only my 30th Birthday but our first trip away post-quarantine. She should be very proud of the place she’s so thoughtfully created & we highly recommend it to anyone looking for somewhere very special."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved everything about our stay in Barbara's loft! Spaces this unique, beautiful & comfy are few and far between - we were grateful to add it as a stop while traveling from VA to SC, and so happy that Barbara has chosen to share it with others. The loft is super clean and the light that filters in through all of the windows and reflects off of the white brick walls is so gorgeous that I kept taking photos. You can see the care put into every design choice from the thick marble kitchen counters to the salvaged building wood made into long rustic tables to the open shower and vessel tub in the bathroom. The decorating is so comfortable - deep, inviting sofas facing one another, a pillowy soft duvet on the bed, welcoming deep armchairs for reading, etc. Barbara recommended Varee nearby where we picked up delicious sushi to enjoy in the loft, then we walked two doors down to Tig's to grab breakfast & coffee in the morning. So worth a visit if you love historic, artistic spaces!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I couldn’t have been more charmed by the space, the host or the town! The Loft is fantastic — somehow even bigger and more beautiful than the pictures. Immaculately clean. The bathtub is where I would have spent the entire trip, but there was so much within walking distance that I had to go outside some. (That Whirligig Park is after my heart!) My partner is six and a half feet tall and could still enjoy the rain shower (a rarity). I know this is probably irrelevant to the big picture, but the towels were made of the softest and nicest smelling fabric i’ve ever touched — such a luxurious touch. Barb is the perfect host; she adds those luxurious and delightful touches everywhere. She stocks the bathroom with quality products and the kitchen with essentials, including several coffee & tea options. She even brought us oat creamer when she found out we don’t drink milk. She left us to our own after a quick & useful tour, but engaged when we initiated. Her recommendations for dining & activities were spot-on. The little town of Wilson has multiple art galleries within walking distance, and she pointed us to them all. Barb’s gallery (located downstairs) was the best, of course. But my favorite pieces of art were decorating the Loft.
You shouldn’t trust a review that only gushes, so I’ve tried hard to come up with a negative. All I can muster is that the blinds don’t fully block out light. Personally, i enjoy waking up with the sun and appreciate the amazing natural light. But if you want to sleep-in or take a day-nap in the dark, bring an eye mask. Also be aware (which Barb will remind you) that nearly every Downtown business is closed on Sundays. You’ll have to plan ahead with groceries, or be willing to drive 10 minutes to find an open restaurant."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Barb was a fantastic host. Very accommodating to my travel schedule. The loft is spectacular! It’s extremely well designed, tastefully decorated and very comfortable. Perfect location for walking around town."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Barb’s loft is exactly as pictured: stylish, open, and extremely comfortable. My partner joked that if we closed the shades, we could tell people we were in Manhattan and they’d never know. Our night in the loft was perfect and we had everything we needed. We were located a short walk (2 blocks) from local restaurants and a very neat brewery. We spent our evening there and then came back to the loft for drinks and relaxation. We didn’t have a need for the second bed, but noticed they were situated for optimal comfort and privacy. The queen bed has a privacy shade that you can draw and the king bed was situated on the opposite side of the room. I can’t say enough nice things about the stay, especially Barb! She showed us around and was very kind and efficient. She clearly loves her space and wants others to enjoy it as well. We will definitely be back!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Magical experience at Barbara’s beautiful and thoughtful loft! A wonderful and caring host that supplied us with beautiful surroundings! Wilson is a great town to explore by foot and my children and I made great memories with our visits to Barbara’s gallery with her beautiful artwork to The Selkie, a gift stop with carefully curated artisan pieces, to lunch at Ruckus and Redemption, pastries at Treat Yo Self and of course a visit to the magical Vollis Simpson Whirligig Park. Barbara brought us by other local artist’s galleries and made our stay most enjoyable from bringing us breakfast goodies to recommending local attractions. I couldn’t recommend her place more! I look forward to returning to this wonderful town!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent stay, very spacious loft with all the amenities."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Barbara’s place is a must stay!!!! I will definitely be back to stay here. It is so relaxing and beautiful. The art and comfy beds, couches and chairs were an added plus. It is so beautiful to have the light coming through the windows and sky lights. I loved being here. Communication was great too with quick responses and check in’s. This place is A+ in my book."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Barb's place is fantastic. Spacious, open, clean, and comfortable. Great location too. We didn't want to leave! Barb is a perfect host. Communication was easy. We plan on coming back again!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Necho was great with communication! We came after dark and not quite sure where to park, Necho responded immediately with an answer and a welcome. Great historical home that was comfortable, clean and perfect after a long day on the road!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Great Host!! House was great
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful historic location! Great communication from Necho and gorgeous historic home. We arrived to Christmas lights outside and a beautiful tree lit up inside. We only stayed for an overnight but would have loved to have had longer to enjoy the home and the area further.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,amazing as always.... this is the only place we will ever stay in wilson.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very beautiful old home. Perfect place to stop last minute on our road trip. Would definitely consider staying again if we need a place to stay in that area.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Necho is a superb host and is very responsive to questions and helpful with instructions on how the check-in and check-out process works.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We love staying at any of these properties when we drive through. We love the history, the high ceilings, the private bathrooms for each room, the location, and all the charm!
They are old places, and come with some issues and some dust, but nothing that we would ever complain about.
Necho is a great host and very communicative. We will stay again for sure!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful house with a piece of history. Very well kept and clean!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Necho's home was more than we ever expected. Not only was it historic and beautifully decorated in an historic period decor, it was inviting and comfortable. Our only regret is that we could only enjoy the home one night. We will definitely return again and again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved our stay. The house was exactly what we needed for our weekend trip. Necho was 100% responsive to the many many messages I sent and very helpful with all of the information provided. The house was much larger than I thought by looking at the photos and the set up was perfect inside. Added bonus was the trampoline outside. The kids really enjoyed it. It was the perfect location and close to shopping and restaurants. If we are ever back in the Wilson area, I would love to stay here again."

OMG, this place is HEAVEN! From the quaint surroundings to the beautiful decor to the hidden treasures. I am here on business, but will be coming back to visit his property again very soon! I've been so busy with work, I didn't get a chance to just sit and enjoy the house. The only drawback was that the washer and dryer were a little outdated, but even so, they did their job :) I promise, if you stay here, stay one more day than you intended. You won't be sorry!
This home is suitable for a large group traveling, and would even be a perfect place for generational family members to gather and enjoy themselves. There are lots of things for the kids to walk to and have fun exploring about.
Necho is amazing! We came in late night during a really bad storm and he was kind enough to ensure a few lights were left on to guide our way. Seriously, no complaints from me...well, maybe one. I wish I could've stayed longer and enjoyed some more of both his home and this cute little town."
2023-09-01,4.0,Group trip,"While there were some positive aspects, there were also areas where improvements could be made.
The location was convenient. The host was friendly and responsive to our initial inquiries.
Unfortunately, the accommodation didn’t fully meet our expectations. The listing described it as spacious, but it felt a bit cramped for our group of 6 adults. We had an additional family member join us so we had to find other accommodations to fit our family comfortably."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was amazing tons of charm beautiful home. lots of room so so clean the owner was so responsive very friendly. Will always see if this place is available when traveling to Wilson to see family. I would not want to stay anywhere, but here.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This isn’t our first stay, but as usual, the place was amazing! We used two of the houses in that area and we loved both.

We will be back!"

The house itself is beautiful and Necho was nice enough to give us a tour of the other air bnbs available at the same location too! The front porch of our house was perfect for sitting down to catch up with old friends or just enjoy the fresh air. The neighborhood was nice and quiet for our whole 5 day stay there. The house was clean and neat, everything was obviously well taken care of. I really have no complaints at all. We will be back again asap and I think anyone would love this place.

2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Lovely historic home close to downtown Wilson. Loved being here!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Barefoot-Riley House was larger than we realized and a lovely stay! Every single bedroom had an en suite full bath. The kitchen even had a bathroom! Off the main road and tucked into a private lot, plenty of parking. Safe and easy check-in. 4 mins from Brentwood and 2 mins from downtown Wilson. If we had bikes we could’ve ridden them tot he whirligig park! Clean kitchen, good water pressure, and plenty of towels/blankets. Be wary - the door locks every time it is closed and the oven is locked so you can’t use it, but our stay was great! Necho was extremely responsive and welcoming."

Would definitely stay here again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my great grandparents’ house, so spending a few nights there proved an excellent way to reconnect with my past.
The house is spacious, with 12 foot ceilings and comfortable furnishings from many periods. Given that it dates back nearly 125 years, the mixture of vintage charm and modern comfort is just about right It was easy walking distance to downtown Wilson, where we attended the Eyes on Main Street photography festival and enjoyed its reborn nightlife. Ample, well maintained parking and well tended grounds were a plus; we were able to socialize with the guests from the other cottages on the property.
Necho was instantly responsive. The couple who stayed with me definitely wants to return next year when we attend the festival again."

2023-04-01,4.0,Group trip,"Beautiful old southern home in rural Wilson. The home was comfortable and I felt right at home. It was quiet at night and we got a good night sleep. They could have done a much better job cleaning. We were given one towel each for face and body which was very thin and falling apart. There were
cobwebs on the ceiling and there was black soot everywhere. My feet got black walking on the floor without shoes.
Necho was a great host and was accommodating to our early check in and difficulty accessing wifi. He was very friendly. All in all we had a good stay."

2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,We were in town for a large four day event and shared the house with 2 others from our group. We loved having a bathroom in each room. Our only regret was that we did not get to spend much time in the home!

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"While we weren't there long, Necho's place was an amazing home to spend the night. He was so proactive and communicative and everything was as he described. We got in late, so it was helpful to have such an easy place to locate and enter. It's a very interesting and historic old home and we wish we had been traveling with more friends/family to enjoy it. It could be a great place to have a family reunion or get together with friends.
Necho was truly one of the best hosts we have dealt with on Airbnb and we appreciated all he did to be so hospitable."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The house we stayed in was so charming. The furniture really fit the period of the home and felt very elegant. We were comfortable. We are interested in speaking to Necho about how we can advertise his Airbnb for an event we’re hosting at Barton College in October. We ourselves would like to reserve the cottage in the back for our stay for that event for 3 nights. Thank you for hosting us. The house was nicer and more comfortable than any of the hotels I have stayed in in Wilson.

We enjoyed walking around the neighborhood and looking at Christmas lights! The location is very close to I-95 and we are so happy we made the choice to stay the night there instead of booking a hotel. The whirligig park nearby is a really neat attraction as well.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We compared the price to a local motel room. They were nearly identical, but at Necho's place, the kids all got separate bedrooms! We didn't use the televisions, but the table was perfect to work and play at, and the kitchen met all of our needs. The place was very clean and well-maintained. We were finishing up cleaning out grandmother's home of 40 years after she moved out of it, and it was a nice, convenient place to relax, and near our favorite family restaurant (Western Sizzlin, the best in Wilson!).
We got to talk to Necho afterwards and he told us some of the history of the homes. A VERY comfortable and enjoyable place to stay for our family!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed for three nights in May 2022, and enjoyed it very much. It is a 19th century house, so while some aspects are decidedly dated, on the whole it has all the modern amenities anyone would want. Each of the three bedrooms has its own bathroom, television and even its own thermostat. But above all, Necho (the host) is local, and very responsive to any concerns his guests might have. We will definitely stay here again the next time we are in Wilson."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Highly Recommend. Easy check in/out. Comfortable place!

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Authentic turn of the 20th Century place. Comfortable, quiet and charming. Antiques spread throughout. Walking distance to downtown Wilson, TIGs coffee shop and the GigEast Exchange (and Larimer coffee). Necho is very responsive to any issues that might pop up."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great gem in the heart of Wilson! Perfect location for hanging out enjoying this spacious, historic home. Every bedroom has its own tv and bathroom and the huge living area is perfect for just being together. There is a full kitchen and a grill and picnic tables if you want to cook out. You will be only minutes from the one of a kind Vollis Simpson Whirlygig Park and museum. There are art galleries galore and a brewery right at the park with food trucks. A short block from the park is “ Treat Yo Self” bakery and you don’t want to miss that! We had a great weekend and the house provided the perfect home base. Even though it is a historic property it is perfect for families and feels like a home - not a museum. Will be sure to come back for another weekends adventure. Thank you, Necho!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Necho's house was perfect for our group. The house is very clean, roomy and comfortably furnished; kitchen and bathrooms are well equipped. We'd definitely book again."

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This location or one of Necho’s other properties will be the ONLY places we stay from now on. Cozy, at-home feel. Great management. Great location. Impeccable communication when we needed something. 100000X better than a hotel. Even our family from Wilson were awed by this hidden gem. We will definitely be back!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a pleasant stay in this spacious and elegant home. It is within easy walking distance to Barton College and historical downtown Wilson, with it’s remarkable Eyes on Main Street photographic exhibit and delightful Whirligig Park.
Necho is a great host and responded quickly to my questions. I would definitely stay there again if I return to Wilson."
2022-03-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Overall the stay was honestly just OK. There were several issues, some of which I would typically brush off, but all combined made the stay just OK. First, there was a lack of kitchen cookware (no pots, just pans) and some of it was dirty and/or rusty. Not all of the silverware was clean. Each bed only had 1 towel (including the King size and double bed) so I had to ask for more and find them. There were no hand towels at all. The instructions for check out say to leave dishes in the dishwasher which does not exist. Finally, there appeared to be animal hair on the sheets.
Aside from that, it’s a solid 15 min off the highway for those traveling. Not a reason I deducted stars, just something to note. I personally didn’t love the overall feel of the place, but that’s just my preference. The photos are accurate. There isn’t a cozy living room which was something I definitely missed but again did not deduct stars for, as it was shown accurately."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything about this stay was easy and straight forward. The location was great and loved the house and all it's furnishings. Made for a wonderful stay.

Great value, especially if you use all three bedrooms and stay multiple days. Necho wonderful communicator and cares about his customers. I hope to return."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Quaint and unique place to stay. Feels like a mini museum. Comfortable and simple. Car traffic on a side street at night is audible, as well as a train, but wasn’t something that really bothered me.
Parking lot is well lit. There are some steps at the entrance. Each bedroom has there own full bath which is nice. Perfect place to rest our heads after a long day."

We were in town for a tennis tournament, and it was a perfect place for us to regroup after matches and get some much-needed sleep before the next day's activities. Spacious bedrooms and sitting room gave us plenty of room to stretch out and relax. Bathrooms in every bedroom are a huge plus. We made use of the outside picnic tables for dinner one evening. It is super-convenient to downtown Wilson, and in general was very drivable to all of our match locations in surrounding towns. If we're fortunate enough to make the tournament next year, we'll definitely try to book his place again! Necho was great. We got the chance to meet him while we were there, as he was doing some work on a nearby property, and he was a joy to talk to. We wish him the best, and would gladly stay in one of his properties again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed my stay. Location was perfect for me this weekend. would book again for sure.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed at the pool house and it was quite lovely. There is a private porch off the side of the house where you can drink your coffee and watch the sun rise.
There are lots of lights around the pool so I would recommend bringing an eye mask.
The evening sky is beautiful and the crickets will lull you to sleep."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stop for the night on our long drive! Peaceful and beautiful. Our pup loved to explore the property. The owner made sure to say hello while out on the property and check if we needed anything.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The pool house lived up to its expectations. The pool access was excellent, the brick wall surrounding the pool provided ample security for our dog. The area around the pool was large and there was a supply of pool toys mainly for humans so make sure you bring your puppy’s favorite. The surrounding yard was flat and easy to walk. The host was quick to answer any questions through the Air B&B app. Highly recommend."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I just stayed here with our pup. Super easy to find and gorgeous property. Instructions were clear on how to get into the home, which was nice after driving several hours and arriving after dark. The inside was adorable with lots of space and a very comfortable bed. Thanks for having us! We’ll definitely be back for our next road trip."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Charming transformation of a pool house into a roomy studio apartment with well-appointed kitchen, eating table, bathroom and awesome walk in shower. Set next to a lovely pool in the center of a historic farm property with additional lodging, peaceful surroundings yet convenient to the highway and nearby towns. Would be a great place for a family reunion or friend gathering to hang and grill by the pool. Great hosts too!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is one of my all time favorite Airbnb stays . It's clean , quiet, comfortable and well equipped . The farm scenery is so beautiful & the pool is perfect . Meika and her team are always helpful and continue adding more great surprises each visit.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The property and surrounding scenery looked like something out of a magazine. Very beautiful, peaceful, and comfortable. The hosts were very welcoming and made me feel right at home, while also giving me my privacy.
Warning to anyone who stays there: If you do not have a dog, you will want to get one! They have the most adorable, well-behaved dogs. Especially Cash, who has trained his people to play a special kind of fetch.
Overall, this property is #goals!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay! We were traveling for a business trip and this home provided everything we needed. Unfortunately we weren’t able to take advantage of the pool, but everything was warm, cozy, and inviting. This host is remarkable! We weren’t from the area, and we’re unfamiliar with its stores. She was able to help us find what we need and even offered to give us things to keep us from having to make a trip to the store. So nice! We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Simply amazing! Super responsive host and very kind. Clean and very comfortable place. Would definitely come back! Thank you so much to Mekia and Mekia’s family for having us over.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for ECU's graduation. We enjoyed the peacefulness of this location. An easy drive to Greenville or Farmville. Host responsive, helpful and accommodating. Quiet and private with comfortable bed. Everything was as descibed in the desciption. We would stay here again when back in the area without hesitation. Thank you for a great weekend!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had a great stay! Meika was super nice and responsive,and her husband was very friendly. The place was super cozy and had everything we needed for a night away. Hated that the weather wasn’t nicer for us to use the beautiful looking pool! Definitely will stay again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Nice place to stay with close proximity to the hwy. Everyone was friendly that we met around the homestead. During the Summer the pool would be very inviting.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Was easy to find, about 20 minutes from I95.
Nice quiet area, and even though we didn’t use the pool, it is big.
Comfortable bed.
Our cat Maggie liked exploring in it, up to the top of the cabinets and refrigerator, lol."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Meika’s place was great and she was a wonderful host. I was on a road trip and her place was a perfect stopping point for me. I booked that morning and asked Meika if I could have early check in due to a work call. She was super flexible and generous, even letting me know that if the room wasn’t ready before my call, that she would provide a different space.
About the pool house—it’s a lovely little studio behind the pool. There are people working around the property who will say hello during the day. My impression was that they will speak with you as little or as much as you want. Definitely more friendly than us Northeast city people!
People bringing dogs—Meika and Josh have a sweet goldendoodle who loves to say hello. He has full off-leash access to the property and there are also other dogs potentially off-leash on property who may have different temperaments, so just something to note depending on your own dog’s temperament.
Overall great experience. Thank you Meika & Josh!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Terrific place and great host, wish we could have stayed longer!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"House was very clean and nice she was very kind , and friendly I appreciate everything she did to make my stay perfect stay is 10/10 very good place to stay !!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Meika and Cash, her dog welcomed us to their property when we arrived. Even through the lockbox code was in our instructions, Meika gave it to us. She encouraged us to let her know if we needed anything. The Inner Bank pool house was delightful and very comfortable. We woke in the morning and looked out the window to see 4 wild Turkey in the field. I would highly recommend this Airbnb. Meika, thank you"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Overall the place is very nice and peaceful out in the country. Always happy to have a place to stay with the dogs. I was rather surprised this morning when I went to walk my dog and there were three or four running around.
This explains the poop I stepped in in the dark last night when I arrived
I do wish people understood that not everyone wants their dogs to play with other dogs"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Meika was wonderful !! Everything about the stay was better then expected.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Easy access affordable clean with a beautiful sight
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Host responsive, helpful and accommodating. Designated free parking on premise. Quiet and private with plenty of sunlight. Comfortable bed. Drafty in the winter near the bed, but warm enough under the covers. Definitely a more worthy deal in the summer, when guests could enjoy the swimming pool and all the amenities associated with it."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This has been my best AirBNB experience so far. The hosts were friendly and helpful. A fire pit was kept burning daily with guests welcome to sit around it. The location is very peaceful with open fields surrounding the rentals. If you want to relax and get away from the city or crowded places, this is perfect. The rental was clean and appeared freshly painted. The kitchen had enough cooking supplies to get me through two weeks. I would not hesitate to rent there again."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,If you're a travel nurse STAY HERE! I had my own private space but felt safe because Meika and Josh were on site in the main house. They were attentive to my needs and checked in to make sure everything was going ok. So much better than an extended stay hotel! Would 100% stay here again.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great host! Meika and her husband Josh are very friendly and accommodating. Beautiful place to stay and relax.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Easily the best Air BnB experience I have had. Meika and Josh (her husband) were very friendly and easy to chat with. They had the fire pit going each day I was there, so I was able to have outdoor social time with family when it got colder. Very pet friendly. Their dog, Cash, is adorable and loves fetch. Definitely recommend staying if you are traveling or visiting the area! They were very accommodating of my fragrance allergy by removing any air freshners before arriving. Will definitely be returning for future holidays with the fam!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Melika and her husband are some of the most kindest and Family Oriented people I have met. She accommodated me when I had to bury my sister. I am so grateful, appreciative and thankful that God put them in my life. I want God to Bless them beyond what they ask him for. They really deserve it."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our first experience with airbnb! Accommodations were as advertised - spacious, clean, comfortable, with well stocked kitchen and bathroom. Great shower and ammenities. Interesting historic home and personable hosts. A terrific experience."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect venue, hosts, location and atmosphere. Convenient location off of 95. Outside firepit, pool and we even line danced for sunrise. Historical home tour with piano recital from the host. Great hosts greeted us upon our arrival."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Historic property with a beautiful country view. Quiet and peaceful, close to Wilson and many other areas but quiet nights with a beautiful setup. Great and responsive hosts."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a terrific AirBnB experience! Gracious hosts with an absolutely beautiful AirBnB property! Upon arrival we were immediately greeted by Josh and his Doodle dog as well as a Harvest Host guest who was also staying on property! What a terrific welcome! Our pool house accommodations were perfect! Spacious kitchenette area (with a fantastic countertop oven/airfryer), comfortable bed, large walk-in shower with a separate toilet area. We had more than enough room for our bags as well as ample space for our two large dogs and their beds. Everything was absolutely spotless! Honestly, this space reminded me of a perfectly appointed studio flat. We loved it!
After we were settled, Josh and Meika gave us a wonderful tour of the historic house and grounds. Their talented son also gave us a mini piano concert! Wow! As an endurance athlete, I was grateful for the use of the gym house's treadmill for my morning run. There is also have a bowflex machine and inversion table for those who might be interested.
As this property is on our travel route when visiting family in the Northeast, we will most definitely return... next time as Harvest Host guests in our Airstream. Highly recommended! Thanks so much, Josh & Meika!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Hands down, my favorite Airbnb I have ever been to. From the hospitality to the environment, it was the definition of perfect.
They were so amazing and hospitable to us & our service animals. The dogs even loved their yard & pool. The bed was so cozy, I even delayed my alarm 6 times to sleep in.
Worth every cent."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing experience. Meika went above and beyond. Highly recommend.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect location and close to ECU! Pool house was absolutely lovely! Super bright, comfy bed, and pool was beautiful, especially over the stars at night."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I stayed in the pool house and found it to be very cozy.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Our stay was super! We loved the pool house! Meika was so friendly and accommodating. We would have enjoyed staying longer.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a fantastic evening at the Scarborough pool house! We were met by a friendly face directing us to our door. As we came in from the heat the air conditioning was perfectly cool. The decor was beachy and fun and the bed was super comfy. The kitchen had all the amenities that you need. The shower was extra large and unique. We loved ending our evening with a dip in the pool and dinner poolside. We would definitely stay here again!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"For my first AIrBNB, I was extremely impressed. Friendly, accommodating, nice place! I will be booking again and highly recommend."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful property and very comfortable quiet place, wish I’d had more time to enjoy the place."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very beautiful home! Clean and homey. Would stay again!!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I can not say enough good things about this rental! Super easy booking and great communication with Meika right from the start! Super cute pool house with a comfortable bed, full kitchen and gorgeous shower and bathroom with tons of upgrades. And only steps away from the amazing pool!! This is not your standard rental! Quiet location, super friendly host family and better than any hotel stay I've ever had! Inner Banks has it all!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We decided to break up a long day of driving by staying the night at the Inner Banks. So glad we did! The host could not have been friendlier or more helpful and the pool was perfect. The unit itself was clean and welcoming. We enjoyed the pool, an evening around the fire, and the comfortable bed. Woke the next day refreshed and ready to finish our drive!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Our stay at the poolhouse was amazing! Beautiful spot and great hospitality. It was a real treat to have the pool with lots of privacy. We recommend a visit to the Whirligig Park in nearby Wilson.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a wonderful getaway spot. You get to stay on a historic property with a fascinating history but it also has very comfortable and modern accommodations - including things like a clean, deep and inviting pool, a gourmet countertop oven, and a very comfy bed. The area itself is quiet and rural and perfect for rest but also very close to several towns with everything you might need."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great stay on a beautiful and quiet property. I was there on business. So unfortunately, I could not take advantage of all of the amenities."
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute little pool house, contains most things you need. Missing a few basic comforts like some decent towels, extra blanket/pillows, hand towel by the bathroom sink. Cleanliness wasn’t great either - things like floors, window sills, and appliance handles were dirty or only partially cleaned. The pool house also had a significant fly and bug problem while I was there causing me to have to spend more time fly swatting than relaxing while inside.
Also, and this is mostly for single women or the antisocial among us: the host Josh is VERY around and talkative. Expect to bump into him a lot. Certainly made me a little uncomfortable at times. I only saw Meika from a distance once.
To end things on a positive note: they were fast to respond to my messages, the internet is decent, the pool is nice to cool off in, parking is ample, the location is convenient, quiet, and beautiful, and they have an adorable friendly dog."
2022-07-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Meika was very communicative and her space was great, we really enjoyed the pool!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Overall great place.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Amazing host! Great location for our needs and beautiful country side location. We appreciate everything!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a great place to stay. Meika is awesome!!! :)
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The pool house was a great space for my ""get away."" Meika is a super kind host. Highly recommend."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"If your looking to stay in not only a quiet, spacious and comfortable place but also luxurious with amazing views, then I highly recommend booking with Meika and Her husband Josh! We traveled 19 hours from Texas and this was nothing short of home away from home! We can’t wait to come back and visit! -Ronnie
As a travel nurse, wife and Mom of 3 girls, traveling so far away can be so daunting and overwhelming to say the least, but Meika and her family were so inviting, loving and did so much to compromise with the needs for my stay! Coming from Texas, being outside of the City limits and in a country setting while ALSO having all the bells and whistles, POOLSIDE 😍 and still being provided with a warm-bright, and oh so comfortable place to lie my head at night made my heart and mind feel so much more at ease! Not only did Meika and her husband provide me with a peaceful and updated pool house stay, but they provided me a sense of safety without evening knowing it! They are also set up with state of the art security surveillance systems and with a pretty sweet Wi-fi set up to too, which I know Josh is proud of, as well as his lights show! Lol p.s. thank you for keeping my hubby entertained while he was there and also for not using your bad boys alarm warning on me!! 😂 ❤️ Though I would have loved to have stayed longer, I am forever grateful for the kindness, and understanding you gave to me from start to finish, even when I could have expressed it more during my stay. You truly blessed me, and showed me there are still genuinely good-hearted, loving people left in this world! I know Ronnie would agree when I say this, but our doors are without a doubt always open to your family if you ever find yourself in Texas in the future! We can show you guys around the stockyards, take you to the best Donut spot in Downtown Fort Worth, and bless your family, as you have done for mine. I hope we can all stay in touch in the meantime, my girls are still fully prepared for a trip to NC so they can enjoy your pool, take a visit down to the Outer banks, and of course meet you all! Also, Josie says she is very, very sorry and has now fully committed herself to a window blind free diet from now until forever, and she will definitely miss her newly gained friends from her first, probably last, long distance trip. 😂 Until next time friends! -Tyler and Josie!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay here! The property is great with great views. Our hosts were friendly and responded to our questions and needs promptly. We will definitely be staying here again!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a great place to stay and we wish we got to spend more time here! The owners responded quickly to our questions and were incredibly kind. They even set up the fireplace and surprised us with smores! We will be coming back again!

2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"This home is absolutely beautiful and so comfortable. We were dismayed that we couldn't find a location closer to downtown Raleigh, but after checking in, we wouldn't have had it any other way. Just an absolutely wonderful stay. We hope to return!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Anwar’s place was absolutely beautiful and exactly as described. It felt like home and was a comfortable place to stay.
Anwar was also extremely responsive, within, minutes when asked a question while there. He even let us know of a hole in the wall that was made prior to us arriving to let us know it was there. Definitely a 5/5 and a place we will book again in a heartbeat."
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"I would absolutely stay here again. This host was a great host- very responsive and available to answer questions everything I needed was included.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Anwar was wonderful and his house was beautiful, he was very helpful when I had a question. Got the back grill going for me so we could grill for superbowl !!!! Heck he even moved my Gracie’s off the porch for me one evening before I had gotten home. I just can’t say enough about my new home away from home in Wilson, I hope it’s available for my next visit. Thank you Anwar, you are all 5 stars with me!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Very nice house with 3 seperate bathrooms, great for my company’s work trip will be visiting again"
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great setting and lovely house. Small things...master bedroom TV didn't work (but that's getting taken care of) and be aware that there is free instant coffee but if you want to make coffee bring a machine, or you can just goto the nearby Dunkin's. We'd do it again for sure!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Upon arriving, I was a little confused because there were two keypads. However, as soon as I was about to contact Anwar, he reached out to me via ring camera. He responded to all inquired as soon as they were submitted and very kind.
The residence was like home and we enjoyed our stay. He also put personal touches to have a little in-site as to what he likes as well as possible career field."
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Thanks for hosting us.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Anwar was extremely professional and polite from the acceptance to check out. Very nice home well maintained. Check in was as simple as it gets with no issues at all. I particularly enjoyed the jacuzzi tub (twice). If you are In the area or want to get away for a night or two, I highly recommend you visit Anwar’s home. I’ll be back."
2023-11-01,4.0,Group trip,"Anwar's place was beautiful. I would have given it 5 stars, but a lot of the light bulbs needed to be replaced. Also, the only bedroom that has a TV is the master bedroom and the remote was missing. Other than that, it was great. It was in the perfect location for our event. I would definitely stay there again."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice house in a great area.
2023-10-01,2.0,Group trip,"This place was spacious and convenient. It was not clean to my standards and had some spiderwebs. My family and I had to go bye some towels, wash cloths and cleaning supplies to make it work for us. At about 3 o’clock in the morning a man came on to the property startling me, saying that he was coming to take out the garbage. I wish that would have been communicated to me. It is very unsettling to be in a foreign place and have to feel like you might have to protect yourself."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful part of the country, will come back :)"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We will definitely book here again next time we come to Wilson. House was great - they had everything we needed for our stay. Anwar was very responsive and flexible with us. Everything worked great - we didn't have any issues at all. We were only a few minutes from the soccer fields so location was perfect. Additionally, its a beautiful house in a very private, quiet neighborhood. Our stay could not have gone smoother."

Very quiet neighborhood was able to sleep without any disturbances. Close to everything to include grocery stores and restaurants. Plenty of board games for the family to enjoy. Love the decor, lots of natural sunlight and plenty of space to move around. The host Anwur was very responsive and tended to all my needs. The code I received worked so there was no problem getting into the house. The house is fully stock with everything we needed. Plenty of towels, toilet paper, and kitchen items. This place is worth considering if your in Wilson."

2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Gracie was very friendly and responsive. The Cabin is small and intimate but that's exactly what we were looking for. We especially loved all the animals on the ranch and the quiet dark night we got to spend. It felt safe and comfortable.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I had a great time at Gracie's listing. It was nice to get away and be with nature. The ranch was really cool and it was so nice to see all the animals. The biggest perk was being able to see all of the stars at night. Overall, she's a very welcoming and kind host. Hopefully we'll be back for horseback riding lessons"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Best description I can think of is rustic, I’m a camper so that works for me. I was greeted by a friendly dog soon as I exited my truck I’m a dog lover so that was nice. The room was very clean, good place to crash for a night."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I stayed on the ranch for only one night but would absolutely stay again. My friend and I had been driving for 14 hours and arrived very late at night and were dead tired, but we felt refreshed and relieved once we hit the ranch. The interior was cozy and welcoming, the beds were comfy, and having so many animals nearby was food for the soul. Because it was so late we had a bit of confusion upon arrival, but we were able to text for answers. I would recommend this location whole heartedly to anyone looking for a bit of comfortable peace!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Enjoyable stay, friendly host and answered all my horse questions"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is my 5th or 6th time passing through and staying at the ranch. I needed a place to stay on the way to Raleigh and this was perfect. We were safe, it was quiet, and we were warm on a cold night. That heater is amazing!"

2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Decent place for one person. It is cute if you enjoy being away from the business of the world. The bed is very firm, so I had a little trouble sleeping, but otherwise, everything was ok! Not many amenities as with other AirBnBs, so it was alright."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Bring your horse and enjoy the ranch! We love staying at Cavvietta!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Gracie provided a quiet, peaceful and comfortable place on her ranch. We arrived after dark, but there were no issues. Super communicative and clear, simple instructions were provided.
We loved being greeted by one of the farm cats who was very welcoming! The pillows were comfy and waking to beautiful surroundings was a lovely surprise after arriving at night. The sun on the ranch, horses, cattle, an adorable & friendly goat paired with a hot cup of coffee was perfect. Although our stay was really short, and we had to leave the very next morning, it was the perfect place to lay our heads and have a peaceful sendoff after visiting with the animals. We will certainly come back again during our many trips to and from New Jersey and South Carolina."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We’d happily stay at the ranch again. Thank you for having us!

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place was an accidental gem!! I waited for the last minute to find a place to stay on our road trip from New York to Florida, and I booked the first place I could find, since it was really just a place to rest our heads. Well, not only was Gracie a great communicator, but the room was beautiful, the farm was peaceful, and everyone we met who worked there was friendly and helpful. We actually want to book again in the future to stay on the farm and take some riding lessons this time!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful space. Worth the stop since we were on our way on 95.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The cabin on the farm was the perfect little place for my stayover in my roadtrip from CT to FL. It was late when I arrived and had a little trouble finding the right turn, but that was my own tired eyes not reading the directions clearly the first time. When I arrived, it was pretty dark and I texted Gracie just o make sure I was going to enter the right cabin, since there were 2 buildings. She responded right away. There were free roaming dogs on the property that ran up to my car as I pulled in. I could also hear lots of others barking and howling in the distance. I'm a dog rescue volunteer, and had a rescue dog with me going to his new home in FL. Since I was unsure of how he would be with the farm dogs, I was a little hesitant to get him out of the car until Gracie's dogs wandered off.
The cabin was super cute and the bed was very comfy for my 1 night stay. Had a nice morning waking up to farm animals and walking around the farm."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Gracie has a beautiful ranch with a cute private cabin. We enjoyed everything however we wished that we could've pet the animals. That would've been fun but other than that it was a great 1 night stay.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Love staying here. Clean and serene
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,The cottage is just like pictured and described. It is about 15 miles off Route 95 but arriving and watching the horses makes the extra drive worth it. Also there are no close by restaurants so I would recommend eating before you arrive or get take-out on the way. It was definitely fun watching the farm animals and activities during our stay.

2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,It was a bit further off 95 then I had hoped but probably my fault and not the owners.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the horse ranch was one of the best Airbnb’s I have stayed at, Gracie was easily accessible and was a great host, watching and listening to the horses in the morning while drinking my coffee at the picnic table was so relaxing, I hope to be able to come back again.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great stay at the ranch! I would love to stay again
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gracie was very kind and attentive while we were at her cute little cabin! The weather was very cold, which was out of the ordinary for this part of NC, but the space heater more than did its job!
We had a short time with frozen pipes due to the very unusual temp drop, but Gracie did everything possible to make things comfortable for us, including offering a full refund even after staying the first night. (I was visiting family for the holidays, so I really just wanted a quiet and comfortable room to sleep in!). The water was running the next morning, so it really was nothing to get fussed about when the cabin is so comfy and cozy!
It’s very peaceful and all the animals are lovely, so why not stay here on your travels! The stars were also beautiful to see on a clear evening. Gracie is great!"

2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice, I was searching vrbo and getting very frustrated. Airbnb was SO much better! I found a place right where I was looking and it was great...I HATE hotels/ motels and Gracie's place was really cool."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Staying at Gracie’s Place was a delightful experience. The cabin was both rustic and quaint. The price was reasonable and the service was excellent. The best part of the whole weekend was the very personal and professional horse riding lesson by the incredible Jessie.

2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was clean and the bed was comfortable. Gracie was very prompt in answering our call and her husband came quickly to help us get inside the cabin when we had trouble unlocking the door. I wish the weather had been clear and sunny and we would have explored the ranch.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place was cute as a button and the location is gorgeous! Everything was neat & tidy. Gracie was a perfect host.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was very convenient and tucked away, and quite. Everything was clean and cozy and comfortable including the bed. I was on a road trip with my daughter so waking up to a beautiful property like this one was amazing. If we had, had time we would have gone horseback riding but we were on a time crunch. On a side note please be aware of the farm cat that likes to hang out, he’s very sweet but super nosy. Lol"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a great experience and a perfect place to stay if you need a night or even more than that. It was beautiful and fun to be able to be right in the middle of the action the ranch! Thank you for such a great experience!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing place to stay, my wife and I stayed just for one night on our way to another destination and it was great. Super clean and perfect place for us to stay at the end of a long drive."
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Perfect if you want a real ranch experience. Small “cabin” that barely fit a full size bed. More like a trailer park than a “cabin” setting. …the cabin sits up on cinder blocks like the trailer that shares the lot. Would recommend as a 1 person bedroom & small bath. Host was extremely nice.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I loved this place! Perfect in every way! The owner is very responsive and accommodating! I highly recommend staying here whether laying over, need a get a way or want to try the ranch life!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful little cabin on a ranch! Very comfortable bed, has everything you need including coffee in the morning. Active horseback riding/training going on nearby. Wish I had time to book a ride! Only issue I had was the long driveway - it had quite a few ruts/potholes. But it is a ranch, so it’s no problem if you have a truck! Cars need to be cautious especially at night. Overall, I’d stay there again in a heartbeat!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The location was perfect, not too far from 95 and just far enough for some quiet. The host was very helpful and answered any questions I had. The cabin was clean. I would recommend it to anyone."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our second time staying here and we love it. Clean, comfortable, simple, quiet, and a great price. We love the friendly animals, especially the super snuggly barn cats that visited us both times. Excellent stay!"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved every bit of it! The cabin is small and cozy and situated smack in the middle of a working horse and cattle ranch. It was truly a memorable AirBnB experience to picnic under the stars and wake up with the roosters to stroll around the lovely grounds as the horses and cattle get breakfast. Looking forward to returning.

,,,"I’ve stayed at countless Airbnbs and have had various experiences but never a nightmare like this! I realize she has good reviews so I don’t know what made my visit so different. If it was the sole fact of her being stressed out because of having a rodeo that night, then she needs to never rent out rooms during events since she was pissed off about having to be a host. But I’ll go chronologically.
Before arriving, she told me there would be a rodeo and if I wanted to attend, to go buy tickets online, which I did. What she didn’t tell me was that the rodeo would be right outside the cabin I would be staying at and I would be watching that rodeo and could watch it from the window whether I wanted to be or not. And could hear it from the speakers blastingly loud from inside the cabin. I say this because if I have been paying for peace and quiet on a farm, I wouldn’t have gotten it, so I don’t think it was fair I had to pay for the rodeo tickets and she should have been upfront about that. I was also not allowed to park near the cabin because the vendors were parked there so I had to park in a huge field and walk far away to get to the cabin. She should have also given me a heads up that would be the situation. Since my journey was part of me moving since I got a new job that needed me to re-locate immediately, I didn’t have an easy overnight bag and I had planned on just grabbing items loosely from the vehicle. And then the fact that it was pouring down rain made going back & forth that far away to the car even more miserable.
There was no key to the cabin and I was worried about leaving my stuff unattended inside with hundreds of people walking around. Her listing had sounded very friendly about calling or texting her or her husband for anything I needed, so I called her just to ask about the key and she acted very frustrated and annoyed and gave me instructions as to where to find one. Well, the key didn’t work. I even recorded a video of me using this key in every direction on both locks on that door to prove it didn’t work. I sent her one simple nice text letting her know the key didn’t work and she never responded.
Since I didn’t want to leave with our stuff in there and I didn’t want to go through the rain to go back to the car to look for something to entertain my six year old with, I started looking around the place. Tons of dead flies on the windowsills. More than could have died and just that one day. But that’s fine. I can deal with that. But then I noticed the lamp on the nightstand had a funnel spider on it near the top where you would need to put your hand. A LIVE funnel spider. I am arachnophobic! I then started to worry and inspect things further. I peeled back the sheets and there were dead bugs and grass in them! The towels were in this little basket and there were dead bugs, hair, and dirt inside the fabric of that basket that could’ve easily been cleaned. maybe 30 minutes had gone by since my last text so I sent another with the pictures, such as of the funnel spider, and told her I was disappointed with finding the bugs in the sheets but that the funnel spider was too much and could somebody please come at least get rid of the spider. Still no response.
The rain started to let up and then there was pounding on the door that was so loud and aggressive both my kid and I jumped and I was scared to answer the door. I honestly pictured there being three angry men outside the door but the pounding wouldn’t stop so I swung the door open from far away and it was her just beating repeatedly on the door as fast as she could with both fists. She immediately started SCREAMING at us at the top of her lungs—like full of utter RAGE! “HOW DARE YOU CONTACT ME DURING AN EVENT! GET OFF MY PROPERTY! I’M CALLING THE POLICE!” My son starts crying and wailing, grabbing stuff off the bed to try to run away from her, telling me to run because she’s going to kill us—-that’s the level of terror she inspired. I was shaking & asked her to please calm down and communicate with me civilly and that she was terrifying my son. “OBVIOUSLY YOU’VE NEVER STAYED ON A FARM! LEAVE NOW!!!! GET OUT!!!!!! THE POLICE ARE COMING!!!” My 6 year old starts screaming that we’re going to jail. She stomps away backwards, screaming and repeating the same things to get off her property and the police are coming, waving her fists around at us.
I reported that I didn’t feel safe to Airbnb support and then called them and they told me not to leave yet. I tried to tell them how scared my son was and I had no idea what the protocol was in a situation like this nor did I know if we’d find anywhere else to stay this late (maybe 8pm by then?). They transferred me to someone else, who also told me not to leave yet and then eventually they said I could go ahead and go and just send them pictures. Unfortunately, their message wouldn’t let me send any of the videos I took.
For the record, my grandparents had a farm (my Dad lives there now) and I have actually LIVED on a farm! But living on a farm doesn’t mean you want to get bit by a spider on your nightstand lamp! Or that you don’t desire"
