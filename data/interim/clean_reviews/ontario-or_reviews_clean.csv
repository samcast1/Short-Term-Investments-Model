2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is an absolutely beautiful Trailer/Home. I struggled w/ the key pad..but Jill was available to come guide me. Once inside it was simply amazing. The bed was heaven. One of the greatest parts of this visit was the ""detailed welcome book"" and EVERTYTHING is labeld..so you dont have to guess what each lightswitch does..or how to run the AC/heat or which remote to use.
The outdoor seating area is private, roomy and open.
This is a fantastic stay. You will not be disappointed at all.
Thank you Jill !!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Stayed for just one night - was an impeccable place as far as cleanliness and helpful informative host.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Staying at Jill's place was a pleasure! We literally wanted for nothing. Directions and parking are a cinch, check-in was simple, and the RV is VERY well appointed! Everything we needed was provided, down to a fan in the bedroom. I usually travel with my own so it was a joy to see one waiting for me! Local restaurants and stores are only a couple of minutes drive away. Be aware, this neighborhood is full of life and that does bring sound. Knowing we may encounter sounds during the night/morning we opted to turn the HVAC fan to ""on"" so it ran continuously while we slept. It was the perfect white noise to block any enthusiastic kids or waking roosters. We awoke peacefully on our own terms the next morning. Jill's place was the perfect stopover point for our road trip and we hope to return. It would be a great longer-term base for exploring the area. Highly recommended!"

It was extremely clean, well kept, and everything was labeled with clear instructions on how to navigate the RV. I felt safe the entire time which was important to me as I was traveling alone. I was very comfortable and the bed was my favorite part!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A nice change from the standard hotel room. Easy access, clean, quiet and comfortable."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Big, cozy, clean 5th wheel. Great bedding and delightful electric fireplace. I don’t know if it was because it was a Friday night or what but there were lots of loud trucks and cars in the neighborhood. So not as quiet as I expected or hoped. On the other hand I loved the sound of the neighborhood rooster in the morning!!!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great stay at the RV. The space is perfect, super clean and very organized. The host is very responsive and kind. The only minus I could think of is the constant weed smell from I think the neighbors. Inside you don't smell this tho, only when walking to your parked car. I'm definitely staying here again, especially for the soft pillows and fireplace ❤️"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great option for my husband & I. Very clean, private, comfortable, and much better than a hotel!"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,So comfortable I didn't want to go home. I could have stayed another day just to lay in bed and relax.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Finding Jill’s place on Airbnb during our cross country road trip was a blessing. We had a late check in and it was very easy and convenient to check in with the lock system. Jill’s place was conveniently located off the freeway.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A cozy, thoughtfully designed space to rest while we were traveling through town. Very convenient location to everything you need. Great communication. The only bummer is if you’re sensitive to smells like me, the chemicals used to clean the space were very strong. Otherwise a delightful stay.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a wonderful and unique experience for me. I never been inside let alone stay in a nice luxury camper trailer before. The hosts placed helpful notes everywhere for those, like me, who do not know the ins and outs of a camper trailer. I was very pleased to see it was far more comfortable than the typical hotel rooms for a fraction of the costs."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an unexpected Gem! Great communication, super easy access for getting in as well as parking.

The location was great, outside of town, but less than five minutes away. The only downside, and this is not something that was advertised anyway... would have been nice if there were one of the outdoor fireplaces."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Wonderful place right across from a park with a fenced dog park attached. Jill was the perfect hostess. Better than any hotel in the area. Especially for the price. This will be my go to whenever I’m working in this area!

We left the airbnb to go to an event and in the end, we had all wished we would have spent our time at the house instead. It was so awesome! It was a big hit going with an airbnb vs a hotel room. What a difference! Thank you for making our night so memorable.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"the farm house is hands down number best Airbnb we ever stayed at and Tyson is so friendly and accommodating to the people who stay, wish more people were that way , the house was right out of the picture book story of how a farm house would be looking modern day way, the beds are so comfy and he mostly provides everything you might and may need on your stay. from a personal welcoming no matter what time your arriving and making sure you have everything for your stay and how to work every thing you might use during your stay, his created the perfect image of what your might picture how a farm house would look today, it's amazing. long with a beautiful setting and a cat or little dog that might come say hello to while u stay, fresh apples depending on what time u stay that you can actually pick off the tree yourself, witch is a amazing if your a city girl like me that's never actually seen them growing on trees. I would recommend to anyone who wants a safe comfortable relaxing stay while visiting fruitville to stay here, way better and much quieter and inviting than anything else offered in a 100 mile radius of this place. we diffently always try to stay here time we visit, cause it's actually with the money we been crazy not to stay here. the farm house is so warm and inviting you'll never want to leave , I know I didn't!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"HEATHER AND NATHANS WERE WONDERFUL HOSTS!
This place was just right for me and my Bestie the reason for the stay, She flew in from South Carolina to visit me!
Heather and Nathan contributed to a wonderful fun comfortable night! We had a GIRLS NIGHT TO REMEMBER! Heather and Nathan made that possible! ""-)
I always like to end my reviews with the best and worst thing about my stays. So here we go. BEST: how the rooms were set up, it was open and for us gave a feeling of being away at camp. WORST: Would have liked a lamp or light I could have on in that would be a dimmer bulb where the personal business area is. The track lightings too bright, because of how the beds are set up puts to much light out. If one person is trying to sleep and the other is still up in the business area doing some work.
So if that is the worst thing I can say don't ya think you are pretty much guaranteed a good stay? If not then your just too PICKY!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Heather and Nathan’s home was great! It fit our needs perfectly! They even responded very quickly to our request to book and stay late in the evening after a long day of travel, which was very nice of them!
They were also willing to rent to us for an extended period of time while our company was in town doing a job. They offered to bring over fresh linens, heaters, or whatever we needed to make our stay extra comfortable!
I definitely recommend staying at their house and I will look for them the next time I’m in town!"
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Comfortable beds for our overnight pit stop.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Heather & Nathan’s was a nice place to stay. It was spacious for 3 of us. Overall, the space was very clean and met our expectations . I think they forgot to clean the bathroom before we came. The bathroom mirrors and sinks were not clean and the shower drain had hair on it. Everything else was very clean and we were comfortable in the space."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely fabulous stay! The best hosts in all of the AirBnB world!
Thanks for a great stay!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great hosts, they make their home feel like your home away from home!
Please come stay with this host and find out!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean, nice lighting, good kitchen, comfortable living area, well-heated, great shower. Beds were too firm for me but good for my wife. Nice selection of teas and coffee. Good for travellers for overnight stay--near highway but super quiet with quick access. Liked no pets policy!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Absolutely Great Host and a great home and location. The stay was carefree and seamless, had an awesome stay! Thanks!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, was more spacious then I was expecting. Location was easy to drive to most of Ontario. I loved the way it was decorated. We didn't use kitchen but it appeared to be well stocked and was a full size kitchen. Main room was nice for hanging out. The beds were firmer than I usually like however, I slept super deep and was comfy. Well sound proofed, felt like a separate space from the main home. If you are debating between similarly priced hotels, I would recommend this place 100%."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great spot. Comfortable, efficient layout."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Heather and Nathan’s place makes you feel right at home. It’s a very nice comfy place. Thank you for everything. I would definitely come back.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Heather and Nathan went out of their way to accommodate our need to move a small family gathering from a local park inside due to the excessive heat, and gave us a particularly early check-in option which was nice. When we needed something a little more unusual for the kitchen they did their best to supply it very quickly. We found the beds supportive and everything in good working order. The space is very spacious and thoughtfully designed for a simple layout. The neighborhood is on the north end of town and not especially walkable, but that is the nature of most of this rurally located small-medium sized city. I would not hesitate to recommend their loft to others."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always Staff's Favorite Place to Stay when traveling to Malheur County for work! Heather always communicates well and treats us like old friends! we love coming here!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Much better than a hotel. A very spacious unit with a large layout. While the beds were new memory foam mattresses, they were a little stiff for me. But that is a personal preference, and I wouldn't ding the hosts for that- it's a great place to stay."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very solid Airbnb!

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a lovely stay. We were just passing through but it was perfect for us. If we ever happen to be in the area again, we would definitely stay again.

The place was pristinley clean. Everything listed in the description was there. We were even pleasently surprised by the extra touches that Traci provides, ie iphone chargers, paper towels, coffee pods, laundry soap and a basket of welcome snacks.

We highly recommend all Airbnb enthusiasts to come to Mimi’s Fruitland Retreat."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Was a beautiful home and place to stay for a relaxing get away to visit family in the area. Very comfortable furnishings and a great place to just hang out. We brought a few board games and enjoyed the extra large table for playing and dining. Also has a nice TV in the family room for movie nights. Great kitchen, loved the extra storage that the walk-in pantry provided. Also was very convenient to be able to park in the garage. We're so glad we decided to go with an AirBNB instead of a hotel, and are very happy we came across Traci's beautiful home.

Due to health issues for both of us, we are very careful about the beds we sleep in, including the bedding. My husband is still in awe over the night’s rest he got and how soft and comfortable the bedding was.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Comfortable and clean. I spent 2 weeks there and it was a great home away from home. So easy to load in- you can drive right up to the door. Kitchen has everything you need. Bathroom very nice and modern. Dog park righ across the street. Was a GREAT place to stay while I had a 2 week trial- the kitchen made a fantastic “war room” where we could huddle up every day after court and strategize for the following day- the glass cabinet was the perfect area for putting up dozens of big post-its for various trial ideas. Lightning fast wifi. Absolutely PERFECT for working. HIGHLY recommend. Oh- and checkout? No cleaning required! Just wash your dishes and lock the door. Unbelievable! Usually the downside of an Air bnb is all the chores- so hard to do in the morning when you’re trying to get to work after!!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was perfect. I could live there!!! I was driving from Spokane, Washington to Reno, Nevada and it was too far for a one day's drive. Ontario was approximately the halfway point so I stayed at this AirBnB for just the one night. But, it was perfect in everyway!!! I will definitely stay there again the next time I take a trip. It tremendously beats Motel 6 where I stayed the last time I made the trip."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were in town to watch our son play baseball with his college team vs the Treasure Valley CC squad. This unit was very close to the college campus within a neighborhood of similar size houses and apartment complexes next to a great park. No grass in the front yard but well done hard-scape that creates lots of parking and a couple outdoor seating areas that were nice and shady in the evening hours. Jill has thought of everything as far as I can tell! The kitchen was superbly stocked, linens were plentiful, house was clean and nicely decorated. We only stayed one night but we had everything we needed and we did enjoy the local recommendations and the guest book. Would definitely stay again!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jill’s place made us feel right at home after a long day in the car. My kids appreciated the little complimentary snack tray she had out. We slept like a dream, had everything we needed to get back on the road the next day. We felt safe, and with toddlers that isn’t always easy!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our 3-year old was ecstatic about the playground across the street after a long day of driving. There were even some neighbor kids there that she got to play with. Jill was an awesome host; beautifully redone and curated home and clearly dedicated to her host role. I didn’t realize when I looked at the listing that it was a split house with another Airbnb spot which was totally fine, I just felt bad that we had a crying baby but we couldn’t hear anything from the other side so maybe they didn’t notice!! It had its own door and parking and we didn’t run into each other. Loved the very thoughtful touches like coffee/creamer/sugar. Very comfortable (probably new) mattresses. Loved that!!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jill's place was absolutely lovely. Perfect spot to serve as a home base while in Ontario. Very clean and Jill has thought of everything her guests might need! Already recommended to friends. Thanks for a great stay!

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Clean, clean, clean!! The host was friendly and checked in with us after our arrival to make sure we had everything we needed.

We will absolutely be back to visit with family and this is our number one place to stay."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you so much Jill! Your place was the perfect spot for our relaxing girl’s getaway. We loved the little town of Ontario. Such nice folks and centrally located. Many adventures surround the area. We loved every minute and highly recommend. Much gratitude.

Very positive experience all around. Great value for a great cottage."

Even a basket of complimentary snacks in the kitchen! The house is very comfortable, and has a great vibe. The location is great and easy to find. I made a mistake and sent Jill a message on the app asking her to call me and it was almost instant, she was so great. It was also nice being able to relax in the warm house and smoke a joint, yet if you're not a smoker you would never be able to tell she allows weed inside. 100% will book this house whenever I come to Ontario from now on!"

The kitchen and home are well appointed and were entirely clean. The beds were comfortable. Jill went above and beyond by contacting us about something we had left behind after our stay and we were able to get it before we left the area. The communication and instructions leave you without any questions about what to expect before, during and after your stay. Her kindness is an additional example of what makes her a super host."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely perfect little stop in Ontario.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home. Well stocked. Everything as described and promised. Beds were very comfy. Would stay again if we were in the area.
2022-08-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"I often wonder if people who give places like this these glowing reviews actually spend more than 5 minutes there. I spent $170 for one night here. Based on the fact that I had one of the worst night’s sleep ever, that’s about $70 more than it should have been. I’ll start with the positives. It’s clean and nice looking. The free bottles of water and snacks were a nice touch. The Wifi worked well; my laptop tested at about 40MB download speed. Now, for the not so positives.
I’ll start with the biggest problem, since the entire point of staying at a place is to have somewhere to sleep at night. The bedrooms were hot and stuffy, which made sleeping almost impossible…unless you like sleeping in 80 degree rooms. There are two small window air conditioner units, one in the living room, and one in the kitchen. Guess what rooms don’t have A/C? Both the bedrooms. So the back of the house is a totally different (and much warmer) temperature than the front of the house. Based on their size, and the fact that half the house was too warm, the A/C units don’t appear to be adequate to cool a 4 room house. This could easily be solved by having two stand-alone fans (one for each bedroom) for guests to use to cool down the bedrooms. It was in the mid 90s the day I checked in, and the bedrooms remained warm the entire time. There are ceiling fans in the bedrooms, but I had them on for several hours before I went to bed, and they did little to cool the bedrooms down. Additionally, as someone with sinus issues, having ceiling fans 5 feet above the bed blowing lukewarm air on me all night wasn’t an option. Oh, and if you’re looking for outside air to perhaps cool down the bedrooms at night, good luck with that. Neither of the bedroom windows open (and the other 2 windows have the AC units in them). So the house is hermetically sealed up like an office building.
Just when I thought the sleeping situation couldn’t get any worse, once I got into bed I realized it was equipped with a hard-as-a-rock memory foam mattress AND pillows. Good grief. If you know anything about memory foam, besides being rock hard, it also absorbs body heat…and, as I mentioned, I was already hot enough being in a hot bedroom. Out of frustration I was trying to beat the pillows throughout the night when I couldn’t sleep, in a futile attempt to soften them up. It didn’t work. So I spent the first 2-3 hours of my night trying to get to sleep and being half-awake most of the time. Finally around 4 AM I passed out, because at that point I was too exhausted even with the hot room and hard bedding.
Other “features” of the place: Upon entering the house, I was greeted with the smell of a potpourri explosion. I’m guessing that because the owner allows people to smoke pot in here, she needs to then mask the scent with some awful spray. Um, how about not allowing smoking instead?
The lighting in the bathroom is atrocious. Unlike every other bathroom on the planet, there are no lights above the bathroom mirror. Instead, the bathroom lighting is in the center of the bathroom. What does this mean? It means that while the shower is lit up decently from the lights, you get to see yourself in the dark in front of the mirror. The left side of your face will be partially lit, while the right side will be in the dark. So if you always wanted to look like the Batman villain “Two Face”, have I got the bathroom for you. Don’t try to shave your face in front of that mirror unless you’re feeling brave.
Last but not least, there is no way to adjust the volume on the TVs. They are Roku TVs, which theoretically should come with remotes with a volume button on them. Instead, the only remotes provided are the same ones you get when you buy a Roku box. With the AC blasting in the living room, it’s often hard to hear the TV. I searched through every menu option on the TV I could find, including Googling it to see if there was a trick, and nothing allowed me to adjust the TV volume. Because a lack of light is a theme in this house (the bathroom wasn’t the only room that was unnecessarily dark --- the kitchen was the only well lit room), I couldn’t see what may be on the side of the TV itself, so I even used the flashlight on my phone to search for a volume button on the TV, but couldn’t find any.
$170 for all this fun? I think not. Ironically, the Wifi name in this house is “Giggles”. I guess that could be one reaction to this place….maybe after some of the green stuff."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean and comfortable. Easy access to I-84 and we’ll stay here again if we are in the area.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"a beautiful quiet space to rest my head. spaceous enough for 2 people. I am 6'5"" and despite that I had very little issues getting around the playhouse sized space. This will be my go to place to stay Everytime I end up in Ontario."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Close to the highway, easy to find, and a big off-street parking spot made it easy to park my cargo van. I only stayed for one night, so the “Tiny House” style accommodation was perfect for that. The hosts were very responsive and everything worked out great!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The space was wonderful, and unique! We went during a very cold snap and the space was a little chilly. The hosts were super responsive and brought us a space heater that worked well.

Nice to know we can return here when we do more Eastern Oregon road trips and feel
comfortable and rest easy."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a great little place. They offered to bring me eggs in the morning and let me know where the griddle was so I could cook myself breakfast. They have their own little chicken coop so I was offered the best eggs.
They were very communicative. The little house was nice and clean and the bed was comfortable."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My partner and I are traveling back home towards Boston and needed a place to stay for the evening to break up our drive, Heather and Nathan’s place was perfect for what were looking for. Affordable, private, comfortable and had wifi! Very easy to find, clear instructions to get in (and you see some chicken friends in the way in too!) overall I highly recommended this cute fun cabin. It was perfect for 2! **Noted that the stairs are in fact a little steep inside and it is a smaller space if you’re not comfortable with that - but we didn’t mind :)"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Heather and Nathan’s place has such a cool combination of a private well-thought out place mixed with a garden of flowers and fruits trees and chickens and home - it is really a great find! It’s just on the edge of Ontario, yet town is just a few minutes away. The upstairs sitting porch was one of the many small surprises, which included very workable kitchen, roomy cozy bathroom, and separate sleeping quarters upstairs that gave a compartmental and private feel that I did not expect. Parking was easy. The room was so quiet, I could have slept forever! I highly recommend this AirBnB in Ontario, Washington - I am super impressed by this town and this place to stay. Thank you so much!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful home and great host would love to be back in such a wonderful home

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I failed to completely read the description and didn’t know that there are cameras inside the house. Had I known that, I would not have stayed here. However, the house was clean, comfortable, conveniently located, and well stocked. The hosts were also responsive and very nice. This is a great place for a large family or a small group of people. The neighborhood is also very quiet. With all of that being said, it gets five stars and despite the indoor cameras, I would consider staying here again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful hosts and very helpful. Will definitely stay again next time we are in the area.
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place
2023-10-01,3.0,Group trip,"The home was big and accommodated our group of 7. The low ceilings in the bottom floor were a little inconvenient for our taller family members. The ceilings on the main floor were tall, which made the rooms feel bigger. All beds only had a fitted sheet, folded blanket and pillow. 1 of the rooms had a top sheet, which we used to make the bed. Three of the fitted sheets on the beds had oil stains on them. When we reached out for top sheets and clean fitted sheets, the hosts promptly provided what we requested. The bathmat in the upstairs bathroom was dirty and had some hair on it from previous guests. Overall, our stay was ok. Despite these inconveniences, the home was conveniently located and the hosts were very communicative, kind and helpful."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing hosts, went above and beyond for us!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"The LITTLE BIG HOUSE is absolutely PERFECT! We needed this house for a MAV TV film crew and the owners knocked it out of the park! So kind, professional & accommodating! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"LOVE Little Big House! Will definitely be back!
Ontario is a cool, little town near the Snake River & Hells Canyon. Nice people & good food - We all especially enjoyed Cowboy’s Bar & Grill & Fiesta Guadalajara.
The owners & the home were exceptional!
Thank you,

2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Heather and Nathan‘s place served us well. There were five couples stayed there for a family reunion. It is a comfortable place with 4 private bedrooms. Overall, it was a great experience. This place is clean, with no issues there. Would recommend."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Well appointed, easy check in, good location for the events we needed to go to. Great wifi, very impressive TV!😀
Barking neighborhood dogs, clearly not Hosts fault."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great house for our large family. Clean and maintained, super cute."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The home was cute and I appreciated the communication from the host.
However out of the home we felt very uneasy and wouldn’t have stayed here had we known there’s was homeless wandering around all hours of the day and night and the side of town the home is on is not the best!
There are cameras which helped bring some security but we couldn’t understand why there was a camera in the living room. That was a bit strange."
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Would highly recommend this home as a great place to stay. We had a group of 8 stay and it was great to spread out.
I would say the only awkward part was that the single twin downstairs required you to walk through the room with 4 beds every time. Loved the comfort, full kitchen, ease at the place. The hosts were very responsive and helpful. Will definitely stay again."
2023-03-01,2.0,Stayed with kids,Extremely strict and they have camera watching inside and we never felt welcome or comfortable.
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Lovely home. Plenty of room and space for family. Enjoyed the stay while we were there. Would recommend this home to anyone looking for a nice relaxing space to stay while in the area.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Located right in the middle of town, all of my meetings and meals were easy to access."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were so grateful that Heather and Nathan's ""Little Big House"" available when our children and grandchildren announced they could join us for Christmas near there. They were kind enough to allow an extension of our rental when one family surprised us by arriving a day early. They noticed that snow was predicted the next day and went over to put deicer on the driveway before that early check-in. We can highly recommend this home for families with several children who want to be together in a homey atmosphere rather than split up in multiple motel rooms. It was in a convenient location for us to get to nearby winter activities such as Caldwell's Winter Wonderland light display and Boise's World Center for Birds of Prey. Thank you, Heather and Nathan!"

We would definitely stay again in a heartbeat. Heather made sure we had everything we needed and was minutes away if we needed anything. We were visiting the area because My daughter was graduating college and she was so sweet and brought her a gift seriously best host ever!!!
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"A really cosey cabin. A lovely sitting room with TV for movie nights. A well equipped kitchen and utility room. Well situated for walking or driving into Ontario. Heather and Nathan were very responsive when we needed to get in touch, and they were flexible on check-in and check-out which was ideal."
2022-05-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was odd having cameras in the living room and kitchen with what seemed like Alexa’s in the rooms. Otherwise the house was fine, clean, bedding was interesting (didn’t have a top sheet and limited pillows) overall it was okay."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"my stay here was quiet, and the home has everything you can need for home away from home.perfect location ,great restaurants right in the area."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a great experience, all the amenities and more. Clean and welcoming, much attention to detail. Our hosts were available for any needs or problems of which there were none.
We came to town to visit the grandson who stayed with us, it was perfect. We had much fun making smores each night and since our hosts knew it was his birthday they even put up a banner, what a thoughtful touch.
We hope to stay here the next visit, who knows, could become a habit.
Highly recommend!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,When above and beyond to make the stay pleasant
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Heather and Nathan's house was great.. Their hospitality was even better . Lots of extra touches and plenty of room for our party of seven. We would stay here again, for sure."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I can’t say enough! Heather, Nathan & their beautiful children are fabulous Air B&B hosts; they were so graciously accommodating with my special circumstances and needs. Communication was immediate and always friendly. The house is comfortable, clean, bright & airy, and very well appointed. The location is perfect.. easy access to everything & everywhere!! I would recommend this Air B&B, Heather & Nathan without hesitation!!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family and I traveled to Ontario for a wedding and needed a big enough place for 7 people that were in our group. Nathan and his wife’s house was big enough to accommodate all of us and then some. The house was clean and stocked with extra goodies for the entire family. I mainly spoke to his wife the entire weekend. She is such a helpful host making sure we had everything we needed as well as making some great suggestions on things to do and were to eat. We all enjoyed staying at this little big house. Thank you guys for everything. Hope to be back soon!!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little house. Very clean. Would definitely come back!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very helpful and responsive.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Will be returning, nice and quiet place."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,I greatly enjoyed my stay while looking around the area to move. Would recommend staying here to others.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"the floors were beautiful, the beds comfortable...
might not be a good location when fairgrounds in use due to dust etc.
Also, was a bit uncertain about some of the activities on the street after dark ..."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This home is private, clean, minutes away from anything, and exactly what we needed for our stay in Ontario."
2024-02-01,4.0,Group trip,"Beds were comfy, place was quiet, easy to get in, nice tv with access to Netflix, quiet neighborhood, close to stores & restaurants, kitchen mostly stocked. Had to buy a pizza pan to cook pizza, no hot pads or kitchen towels or dish washing utensils. Could use a bit more cleaning. Coffeemaker & oven were dirty, a few dishes left in the dishwasher, some dead flies stuck on the living room blinds. Met our needs mostly."
2023-12-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"It is winter so of course landscaping is not going to be at its best, however, basic maintenance is lacking and there were some holes in the lawn and debris that were a little dangerous and unsightly. Bed in small bedroom had a broken frame hidden so I stubbed my toe. Kitchen was ok but the counter top was coffee stained and the dishwasher was still full. My biggest complaint is the liv room furniture, old and not comfortable. This seems to be common among airbnbs that I have used. I will say that the shower is awesome! Best I’ve had in some time. Overall it was ok, and priced fairly, just that a little more attention would really help and make for a more enjoyable stay."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very responsive. And comfortable beds. Thanks for the stay!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great stay! Very clean and easy to get into with the keypad. Maps had no trouble finding the location. Jocelyn responsed quickly and was extremely friendly!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We all had a great time. place was spotless. The TV didn't work. she went right out and bought another one. Delivered, set it up. Very nice to talk to. There are cute lamps on bed that let you plug your phone in. Big bathtub. Quiet area."
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay, very convenient and comfortable! We would come back to stay again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The whole experience went very well. Jocelyn was flexible with check in time, the neighborhood was very quiet and the home was very well kept. My only regret is that we didn't get to stay longer. Overall we had a great time during our stay."
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Thank you
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jocelyn’s place felt just like home. No clutter. Decorated nice but not too over the top or expensive, that’s amazing for me since we had little ones with us. She was quick to respond with everything."
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable place, nice location and fairly quiet. Close to the area we were looking for to visit family. We would consider staying again, when we are in the area."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for a wonderful stay! Cozy place that fit my needs perfectly!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This stay was exactly what my mom and I were looking for as we were driving through town to see family. My main priority for a good place to stay is cleanliness. Overall, it was clean but also quiet. Having the TV with loads of entertainment options to choose from was a plus! Mom and I had a fun night!"
2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed here July 8 and again Sept 1. While this unit is inexpensive, other rentals are nicer and a better value so we won't stay here again. A few insights:
(a) The lack of privacy is unsettling. The back of the unit faces the parking lot for Malheur County Fairgrounds. The window blinds are broken for the sliding glass door in the back allowing anyone in the parking lot to see inside the unit.
(b) We notified Jocelyn the window blinds were broken July 8. We expected they would be fixed for our 2nd stay but they are still broken as of Sept 1.
(c) Online instructions need to be updated; examples include: The door lock has been replaced so the online instructions for entry are obsolete. Both interior and exterior pictures are outdated.
On the plus side: While yard weeds desperately need to be cut, the unit was exceptionally clean on the inside both visits. The water filter on the kitchen sink is a nice touch. The bed is very comfortable."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay, amazing water pressure!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,thank you for the clean stay ! it was perfect for a good night sleep during our trip.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,place was clean. felt right at home during our stay
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was cozy, and the location was peaceful. The owner was quick to respond to messages."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One of the friendlier people I've communicated with. Very affordable, peaceful, great work space."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nice place, love king bed & comfy bedding 👍"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a great stopping place for our trip to Idaho. Very clean and would totally stay again.
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed one night,We were just passing through Ontario so it was fine for what we needed. Host was very responsive and helpful.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay. No, neighbors in back, so very quiet. Overlooking the fairgrounds. Convenient place to stay if you have animals in the fair. You could park your trailer right behind the duplex on the fairgrounds and easy to get to barns as the entrance is very short walk. Within a few miles of shopping and restaurants. Layout of duplex was also amazing and quiet inside."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This rental was very clean -- we'd say it was spotless! Lots of nice touches: my wife recently had back surgery and said the bed was perfect, the bedroom had black-out shades, the kitchen faucet had filtered water, the TV offered a wide variety of platforms (Youtube, Netflix, etc.). The property has zero 'curb appeal' but the interior was nice and incredibly clean. The pictures posted online need to be updated to more accurately reflect the property and furnishings. The property backs up to the Desert Sage Event Center. There was a large event the night we stayed but the noise was muted and not intrusive - we slept soundly without any problem. The only concern we had was that the broken blinds for the back door provided no privacy, allowing those using the Event Center parking lot to easily see into the unit. The neighborhood looks a little rough but the neighbors we met were friendly and welcoming. Finally, Jocelyn was a great host! Overall, we had a 4.9-star experience!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at this lovely Airbnb house, and I couldn't have asked for a better experience. From the moment I entered the property, I was captivated by its charm and impeccable attention to detail.
First and foremost, the house was spotlessly clean and well-maintained. Jocelyn takes pride in providing a comfortable and welcoming environment for guests. The rooms were spacious, beautifully decorated, and equipped with all the essentials one might need during their stay. The beds were incredibly comfortable, ensuring a restful night's sleep.
The kitchen was fully stocked with high-quality appliances and utensils, making it a joy to cook and prepare meals. The living area was cozy and inviting. Moreover, the complimentary Wi-Fi worked flawlessly throughout my stay. The location of the house was also fantastic.
Lastly, I must commend Jocelyn for her outstanding hospitality.
In conclusion, my stay at this Airbnb house was nothing short of exceptional."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place. Perfect for our group.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jocelyn is a very gracious and accommodating host. I requested a last minute additional night and she made it happen quickly! I enjoyed having a home away from home experience in a very quiet neighborhood. It was a wonderful stay. Thank you Jocelyn!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very helpful! Clean and welcoming!
My family and I loved it and would recommend!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jocelyn was very responsive and quick to answer when contacted. The duplex is comfortable, the master bed was very restful to sleep in. The home is a hodgepodge of decorations and furnishings, far from “ and oasis “ as described. Clearly needed some maintenance and extra cleaning. The patio shades were missing half of its slats, and some wall art missing with the hangers still on the wall. There was a couple lightbulbs missing. When I contacted her, she quickly responded that she would send housekeeping over if needed. Much appreciated her quick response."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Stayed one night on driving trip from Corvallis to Salt Lake. Nice place to stay in the middle of the trip. No issues. The place was clean and about 5 min from freeway so easy to stop off and get back going in the morning.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Would definitely stay again! Beds were so comfortable! The place was well located!
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,The beds were comfy! Water pressure was great! Had a lock issue at arrival but Jocelyn was super responsive and made it right. She’s super friendly. No issues with the place after that. Simple short stop our way from CA to Idaho.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"great place and great hosts, we'll be back!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great location to stay at for an event we attended at the fairgrounds. Within walking distance.
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Basic accommodations, liked the price for traveling through, but probably would not plan an extended stay here. It was clean. There were a couple burnt out light bulbs and the body wash/shampoo/conditioner dispenser in the shower was out of body wash and conditioner. Also, no instruction booklet."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Exactly as described. Jocelyn was easy to communicate with and super helpful in making sure we had a pleasant stay. Would definitely stay here again if in the area. Thanks so much for sharing your home.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,So glad there are Airbnb’s in Ontario now! This place was perfect. Great location near to where we were spending out time. Perfect amount of space. Very clean. Will definitely stay here again when we visit Ontario in the future.
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,all was clean and neat
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always a great stay at Jocelyn’s Airbnb
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our visit had a rough start but Jocelyn responded quickly when I messaged her about problems (for example, the cleaner hadn't run the dishwasher so there was no clean silverware and the microwave was dirty). Jocelyn got the cleaner back and sent supplies we needed , and when we got home she followed through on her offer of a discount for the inconveniences during our 5-night stay. We travel with our cat and appreciate that her ""pet-friendly"" policy includes more than just dogs!
Jocelyn's place is comfortable and in a quiet neighborhood. The duplex is in a great location for walking to the 4 Rivers Cultural Center and its Japanese Garden, to old downtown, to shops and coffee, and for groceries. Close to the fairgrounds if you're coming to an event there."
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Quiet spot, convenient to our event venue at a great price, and our dog was welcome. Joselyn was super responsive. We would definitely stay again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great place and location to visit family nearby, clean and fit our needs very well. Would 100% use it again."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Simple stay. Easy access to north end of town.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"GET THIS AIRBNB, yes YOU (: you won’t be disappointed. Amazing host & My family were guests and we LOVED this place. We all felt so at home and it was close to absolutely everything. Will def rent again!
Thank you so much Jocelyn!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great little stay while road-tripping through the state. The place was really easy to find, the beds were exceptionally comfortable & her local coffee recommendation was one of our favorite places to date."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Awesome place
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect place for driving though.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good stay, great host."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Liked it.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great little place, made a comfortable spot for us to stay and visit family. 3 great parks within east walking distance for dogs. Not even 2 miles to all of the grocery stores and restaurants. Plenty of street parking and the neighborhood felt very safe. Water pressure in the shower was wonderful, which is a nice change compared to a lot of AirBandB . Jocelyn was great with communication."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"it's a very beautiful house, thank you for giving us back, glad to have you back"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Really straight forward and easy booking. And the space was very family friendly
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay at Jocelyn's. This is a well-located place not far from Beck Park where you can take a brisk walk with your doggie in the morning - we appreciated that! Nice, big and very clean place to stay with Netflix to watch, good WIFI. Comfortable beds and a quiet sleeping experience. A very well-equipped kitchen with everything a cook could want, in my view."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Beautiful home!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Enjoyed our stay😎
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jocelyn was a great host, her place was quite, clean and homey!!
We enjoyed it! :)"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Clean and comfortable. The host was responsive and easy to deal with. I would use this location again.
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place was very easy to find and was very comfortable. We only stayed one night, passing through, and it suited us perfectly. It was very clean and tidy and I loved all the extra blankets around as the weather turned a bit chilly in the evening. So cozy!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great stay. Exactly as advertised.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very appreciative of Jozelyn’s cozy house.. upon arrival the AC was quite welcoming on a very hot day! We enjoyed the comfortable furniture and TV after a long day, and the beds were perfect for a good nights rest. Communication was quick and helpful.. hope to stay again.. thanks Jocelyn!!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We love staying here to break up our drive while traveling. Cute spot! Comfortable bed and living room!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a nice, clean and convenient place. We are moving across the country and Jocelyn’s place really did the trick for weary travelers!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a great place easy to find I really enjoyed my stay
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Clean and quite stay for the night traveling from Salt Lake City to Eugene. Had our dog with us and it worked well for her too. The yard needs some work and we had problems entering the house with the code lock on door but otherwise it was a perfect stay.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Jocelyn was very hospitable! Our group ended up being a lot larger than what was posted for the capacity and she took us in anyway. There was a few questions I had for her that evening upon arrival and she was very quick to return an answer to my questions. The home is very much worth it’s value and she was very kind!
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Good place to stay... The area smells weird, not the house the town but the place is cute."
2022-08-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Great location, yard needs some maintenance and could use a bit better cleaning. Queen bed is worn out and sags to the middle.
it is a very good location and is a nice place though! just needs a little TLC and it will be the perfect stay!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"great stay, fit my family of 5 comfortably!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I absolutely loved the home, Jocelyn was a great host and replied very fast. The whole stay was amazing:)"
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Interior was just as described and seen in photos. However the exterior landscaping has been overrun with weeds and is very unappealing to the eye along the driveway and walkway to the door.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, clean place. Plenty of space for a great price. Good location. Even a few surprise amenities such as options of tea, coffee, and a few breakfast goods. Easy check in and check out. Zero issues and would definitely stay again if visiting the area again!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Clean, comfortable and great location"
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Two bedrooms and lots of space. Good kitchen plenty of seating and everything inside worked as it should. Not fancy, but at this price it was better than most I’ve seen.
The yard needs help. When we pulled up it was uncapped and overgrown with weeds and plants that hadn’t been tended. Interior was a five star. Exterior would barely make a three. If you can get past the front yard and the walkway, this is a good space especially considering the price point."
2022-07-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"On my way back home from a trip this air bnb served as a nice pit stop. It was safe, clean, close to the freeway, and had a lovely homey atmosphere. The lock on the door gave me some difficulty once, but perhaps that was user error. The internet was a bit on the slow side, but hey it is good to practice patience and get away from a screen sometimes. The TV did have several options for watching television, and I enjoyed watching grey's anatomy while lounging on the furniture. Between some episodes I enjoyed the large bath tub, and then was off to bed in a cozy king size bed. Would recommend to anyone needing a place to spend the night in the area!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very clean and well taken care of. Was great for a stop off the interstate. Jocelyn was great communicator.
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,The stay was great! Plenty of room to move around. The only downside was there were some cobwebs and dusty corners here and there but other than that a great stay.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved our stay here. Beds were comfortable and it’s conveniently near the highway but in a safe neighborhood. We rode our motorcycle’ here and both Jocelyn and her Airbnb cleaner person told us where to park our motorcycles to help keep them safe, not that they were messed with while parked in the driveway. They have security cameras and that made the place feel that much more safe. I’d stay here again if I’m passing by the area and need a comfortable place to rest."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay in the area. Perfect for my family, quiet, clean, and great value."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a wonderful place to stay. Was our second time staying here and will definitely be staying here again next time!
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,It was a great home away from home for a night for our family of 5.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Jocelyn's place was such a cute little place. You are close to everything and easy access to freeways. It is so comfy that you don't feel like your away from home.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was perfect for our needs. Super easy to get in and out without needing a key to the house. Coffee and coffee pot included was a big plus! Chairs in L. R. were comfortable. The kitchen was fully stocked for cooking including salt, pepper, and spices! That was a nice surprise. Shower head was super tall in the bathtub for any of you tall people! Roomy and cute place. A park was in walking distance. The AC was amazing!!! At 103 degrees outside it was awesome! Thank you for a wonderful stay."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Clean, beautifully decorated, comfy beds, plenty of room for everybody."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect spot for us. Great location, restful sleep, quiet and excellent communication with host."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was perfectly clean and in order. Exactly as described. Due to a mixup on my part about getting the door code, I needed some extra help to get in to the house. Jocelyn helped me with that immediately and it was much appreciated."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A perfect spot! Really close to all the restaurants and stores, and well-cleaned. Everything works and I have no complaints at all! I highly recommend staying here."
2022-06-01,3.0,Stayed one night,This house did not live up to the “oasis” it says it is. The queen bed dips to the middle and the living room chairs weren’t very comfortable. On a good note the kitchen and bathroom were clean and the shower was great.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely place to stay for a quick stop or with the family; easy to check-in and find.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jocelyn's place is a great stay, with plenty of little amenities. The beds are comfortable and the living room and dining areas are warm and cozy. We enjoyed being able to sit outside on a little patio overlooking the fairgrounds and some nearby ranches. There was even a family of horses up the road that we walked to and visited. Parking and front door access are easy. We would definitely recommend it."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Is in a great location. great accommodations. place was clean and quiet so you can relax & sleep well at night.
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Jocelyn was very accommodating with getting us an early check in and fast communication, it was wonderful! The place was clean and easy to get to. I would recommend it to other airbnb'ers as well! Thanks again!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place, very clean, nicely decorated, and good communication with the host. Would definitely stay again."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Jocelyn kept in communication during our stay and even accommodated us due to some unexpected issues in the other unit. Both units were very clean and we were able relax at the end of the day.
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable stay with good parking. On the downside the house had an unpleasant odor, the hot water in the bathroom faucet wasn’t working, and WiFi was slow. Would definitely recommend if these issues were addressed!"
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean with great location. We would stay here again.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay, convenient location, affordable and pet friendly."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Just as expected from the photos! After driving 9 hours from the Brookings, Oregon to Ontario (on the way to Hailey, Idaho) - I was so happy upon arrival that getting in was easy as I was tired and ready to rest. I will rebook in the future if I am traveling that same route again. Thank you for allowing pets too! It is appreciated greatly!"
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,good location
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, well furnished, comfortable beds and priced right. It is a duplex, so shared walls. No problem for us. Host very responsive. Will stay again."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Perfectly suited to our needs. We are relocating from the PNW to Arizona, and this was a great first stop since we weren't able to leave Seattle until about noon. Easy to find, clear directions, easy access, very clean, and very quiet.
Others have commented that the location wasn't the best but we didn't have any issue. We weren't asking for much though, since it was just spend the night and head out in the morning. Easy freeway access which was nice too. I'd recommend.
One thing to note, since we are travelling with dogs: it does have a fenced yard but it's open at the front end of the house (yard goes along one side of the house but the fence doesn't close it off at that end. It wasn't a problem for us since our dogs don't run off, but just something for other dog owners to keep in mind."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great rest! Nice home! Shower had amazing pressure and beds were super comfortable. Easy access good coffee! Thank you Jocelyn!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Jocelyn's property was great: easy to find via google maps, checking in was super easy, pets allowed, very quiet, and the property was extremely clean. Will stay again if in the area!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great quite neighborhood. This is our second stay at this property and will be back.
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Good little pit stop for us from Salt Lake to Seattle. King size bed is very comfortable.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here while meeting a future puppy that was nearby in Idaho, so although it was a nice neighborhood we didn't really spend any time locally and just jumped on the freeway to Idaho (it is conveniently about 3 minutes to the freeway). The place was clean and the photos were accurate. We did have an issue with the entry (the lock was broken). Luckily, we were able to get in. Jocelyn, the Host, did respond a bit later (she was traveling and had some wi-fi access issues on her end). We explained to situation and ended up sending over a handyman the next day, as we were afraid we would be locked out. He was nice and in fact, acknowledged it was broken and removed that part of the lock (the door was still secured). Overall, the space was clean, spacious and accommodating and we would likely stay there again, if in the area."
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great location, pics are exactly what you find, quiet neighborhood, great as a stop in our trek between Seattle and Salt Lake City with our dogs. Thanks!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nicely appointed. Very comfortable beds
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Second time staying and would stay again, though neighbor noise at night was a bit of a problem. Wasn't a problem before, so I'm assuming it was a one time issue."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was very clean and comfortable. Location is a little suspect, but overall my stay was great and I'd stay again."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Jocelyn’s place was the perfect place for our stay. It was clean, we loved the decor, and had everything we needed. This will be the place we stay when in Ontario."

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Jocelyn was a great host.The place was very clean and it was a great place to stay.
2021-12-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"We needed a place to stay for the night on a long road trip & at first this place seemed to meet all the criteria—it was clean, the beds were comfortable, and it had everything we needed. As we were going to bed, we noticed that the walls between the duplex units were very thin—we could hear the neighbor’s TV through the wall & could hear them coughing in the bathroom. But it didn’t seem like a big deal until shortly after midnight, when the neighbor started playing music so loudly we could recognize the songs and song lyrics through the wall. It was so loud it was impossible to sleep even with earplugs & a pillow over my head, and the music didn’t stop until 4:45am. We were then able to sleep for a couple hours before we had to get up & get on the road. It’s obviously not the host’s fault that the guest/tenant on the other side played the music so loudly, but I left feeling like I needed to warn any light sleepers (or anyone who enjoys sleeping between midnight and 5am) that this might not be the place for you."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very Nice place 2 large bedrooms nice kichen
If there was any problem it would be could not see the house number in the dark. But it could be my old eyes"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We stayed one night on our way to Utah. The place is just as described. Owner is friendly. Will stay here again.

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was just as expected. Thank you very much
2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice, clean place to stay."
2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The Airbnb is quite attractive with a Parisian themed bedroom and basic items in the kitchen. The house is a duplex and in a somewhat run down area of high density housing. Would not stay again because of the location, but the Airbnb itself was nice. No communication from the host, but none was really needed. The smartlock was a little hard to read in the dark but carefully reading the hosts instructions helped me figure it out."
2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,clean and comfortable. thanks!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great stay really comfy.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a great little place! Jocelyn has created an airbnb that is designed for the customer's comfort and convenience, not the owners. There is a trend with airbnb hosts where they are becoming host-centric and not customer-centric. Not so with Jocelyn! Not at all! The overarching theme of her house rules are about your comfort and enjoyment while you are hosted by her. Thanks for a great stay, Jocelyn!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay and close to town.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little place. Had everything you need for a short or long stay. House is well insulated and you don't hear much outside noice at all. Good water pressure in the shower, and clean. Great central location for hunting or rockhounding."

2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great weekend stay it accommodated all our needs for our family trip!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My daughter was driving from Seattle to Boulder and needed a place to stop and rest along the way. She called me and I looked up the next city she would be near and it was Ontario. We had no idea if we could find something nice. This was an unexpected perfect place. Highly recommended! Jocelyn was awesome and great to communicate with! Thanks!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wouldn’t hesitate to book again…I’m picky and I travel with a dog.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean & spacious home at a great value! Communication from the host was prompt (even considering it was a last minute booking) and instructions were clear. Pet friendly and so much better than a hotel room.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay in the area over a hotel room. Bigger than one also! Private and easy to find. It had everything we needed.

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stay at Jocelyn's several times a year when visiting family, it is always the right spot to come 'back to' after being out all day. Warm in the winter and cool in the summer. Nice"

2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Nice little get away! Very clean, the extra bed is a pull out couch in the master room."
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This was a very nice alternative to a hotel/motel. It was roomy enough for moving around and the two chairs and couch were comfy. Though we barely watched TV, it was nice to know that Netflix was available on the Roku. The flies were bad and more came in when a door was opened to the outside. It also smelled like dog, but we were forewarned that it was a pet-friendly place. It was clean; it had less kitchen supplies than we expected, but it worked for the food we prepared. I would chose it again over a hotel."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved staying here! Had everything you need plus more! Super quiet little area of Oregon. Definitely would recommend staying here! :)
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay on yhe way from here to there. Jocelyn left the a/c running for us so when we arrived on a very hot day we were greeting with cool welcoming air - an excellent start!
We were five people so the place was a bit small but it searved its purpose with great value for money.
The beds were very comfortable, the sofa was okay, I wouldn't suggest relying on the single fold out couch (very thin mattress with bumpy springs) so if you have extra people then the extra queen matress is probably a better choice.
The hot water wasn't enough for five showers but we didn’t have to wait too long before the water was hot again, so all in all pretty good (and very good if you're only about 3-4 people)"

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Such a great place to stay. Close to everything.
,,,I opted for this place because it was so close to SRCI. The house had an immediate and terrible odor the whole weekend I stayed. Inside the Friday I found an old pizza box’s and beer andThe dishes were dirty. The back yard was being renovated which warranted a ton of cause tape areas. Saturday night we come back and the bbq is at the other units patio. Unaware this was a shared bbq. But the worst part was the sliding back door was off its hinges. Like someone had tried to or did open it. All our items were accounted for aside for a vape pen. I would not stay again.
,,,"The experience left much to be desired. From the moment we arrived, it was clear that the cleanliness of the place was severely lacking. The state of the accommodations was simply gross.
There was an overall lack of cleanliness. The floors were dirty and sticky, beds were slept in, trash inside was built up and dog food every where. It seemed like the property had not been properly cleaned in a long time. There was a a green trash bin overflowing in the front and reeked, making us feel uncomfortable from the start. Plus a room inside was locked which made us feel very vulnerable.
Adding to our disappointment was the host's complete lack of communication. Despite sending several messages and inquiries, we received no response from them throughout our stay. It's essential for a host to be reachable and responsive, and their negligence in this aspect only added to our frustration. We ultimately decided to leave after 2 hours of nothing from her and decided to go to a hotel instead."
,,,"I would not book this place if you haven't spoke with her First she never answered our calls or messages and self check in code didn't work, it was the worse experience of our trip"
