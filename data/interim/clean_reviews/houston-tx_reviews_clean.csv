2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"She had everything from laundry, to coffee, to enough towel for 6 people (more than enough) it was like at my own home! 1000000% recommend to stay with her."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We were displaced due to the Houston storm so stayed at Kelli’s place for 4 nights. We are in love with this Airbnb! I had the chance to meet Kelli at check-in and she’s a fabulous host. The house is super clean, updated and well-stocked. We have two small dogs so the secure backyard was very helpful. I highly recommend Kelli’s place!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed my stay at Kelli's bungalow. Comfortable space, good A/C, great shower. The location is quiet but also central to downtown and shopping/restaurants. I would stay here again if I'm back in Houston. Thanks Kelli!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My business partner and I stayed at Kelli's to get some work done--unfortunately, we were too busy to enjoy any of Houston's many attractions or restaurants, but we did appreciate the nice view of the skyline from the front porch where there are comfortable chairs to relax. The place was perfect for our needs--clean and comfortable, with a large TV screen and table that we needed for our work. The place is nicely furnished with simple decor. The beds were comfortable, great shower, and the kitchen was well-equipped. Nice coffee maker and lots of pods. It was everything we needed for our work meeting and we would love to return next time we meet."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Exceptional Host! Kelli Goes Above and Beyond.
I recently had the pleasure of staying at Kelli's Airbnb, and I can't say enough positive things about my experience. From the moment I booked until the day I checked out, Kelli was an absolute gem of a host.
First and foremost, Kelli's hospitality was unparalleled. She went out of her way to ensure that my stay was comfortable and enjoyable. From providing detailed instructions for check-in to offering excellent local recommendations, Kelli truly went above and beyond to make me feel welcome.
One aspect that truly stood out was Kelli's flexibility with the check-out time, Kelli was incredibly understanding and accommodating, allowing me to check out later than usual without any hassle. This flexibility made my departure stress-free and allowed me to fully enjoy my last day in the area. If you're looking for a fantastic host who truly cares about their guests' experience look no further than Kelli."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great location, quiet and spacious."
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great location and updated place. the layout is a little interesting since one of the bedrooms is between the other bedroom and the bathroom so you choose between being sandwiched between the bedroom and the attached bathroom or walking around through the kitchen to avoid walking through the other bedroom to get to the bathroom.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Nice clean bungalow, everything as described. We were not there long but the beds were comfortable and it was very clean. There are a few trains but not any loud whistles."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect house for us!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay at Kelli's place. Was in Houston visiting friends that live a few blocks away so had significant local help, but there's a bunch of good food/drink spots within walking distance, and easy to get elsewhere in the city.
The house was clean and in great condition, and Kelli was responsive and helpful!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We went to visit our new granddaughter who lives on Shearn Street which is a very short distance from the Air Bnb. We walked over each morning and stayed until late each evening. The Air Bnb is in a safe neighborhood and we felt secure while walking. There was parking at the front door, with additional parking across the street. It was nice to have washing detergent available as we needed to wash clothes while visiting. We hope to return to visit this spring and will definitely try to book again at this location."

Her neighborhood is quiet. The train does comes by regularly but isn't obnoxiously loud or disruptive. In fact, it adds to the charm of the neighborhood. I met Kelli upon my arrival. She is very hospitable and made me feel right at home! We highly recommend booking at Kelli's Awesome Bungalow!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kelli is a great host! Very responsive and attentive to any needs with quick replies. We were low on towels for the amount of guests we were bringing and she brought them over quickly within the half hour of contacting her and it was even midnight!
Great location, walkable brewery a block away and close to downtown and a lot of food and restaurants in the area. The house was a little quirky, You can definitely tell it was updated a little bit compared to the neighbors and the building must have been here a long time. The house was not as great insulated, we came here for Thanksgiving and the weather was great. Not too hot not too cold, definitely got chilly at night so we had to run the heater. In one of the rooms where the heaters are placed a little awkwardly, the heat blows down on you directly in the bed and right in your face. We had to adjust a little bit with the heat and how the house held the heat. Only super bummer at this location is only one bathroom to share and use."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was situated at a convenient location. The space was just right and Kelly was a very responsive and helpful host!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great spot! The train comes by frequently but doesn’t blow its horn (for light sleepers to know).

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It turned out that this ""awesome bungalow"" was better than awesome. Being familiar with the Houston area I can testify that this place is a ""slice of heaven"". Despite the fact that it was raining and overcast the entire three days that we were there, this place made our visit exceptional. The bungalow felt like home. Everything about it was first class. The location could not be better as far as convenience but even the neighborhood was super quiet and chill. A highlight of our stay was the epic view of the city skyline while relaxing on the front porch. Kelli was the perfect host. This was our first Airbnb experience. We will never stay in a hotel again."

2022-12-01,3,Stayed about a week,Houston had unprecedented 20• weather which is not something Kelli can control but when the furnace couldn’t keep up with the temperatures and the space was only 57• she should have offered a space heater or two.

2020-03-01,4,Stayed one night,It's a nice place to crash for the night but check if the nextdoor construction is still happening. Not a place to sleep in with that outside of the bedroom windows.

As others have mentioned the one bathroom can only be accessed by entering a bedroom, which was not an issue during my stay."
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is in a very safe area of Houston. I live in Houston and was doing a StayCation with friends. This is 5 minutes from Downtown and Washington Street - where lots of nightlife happens.
Place is great but just know there is only 1 bathroom in the master room. Not a problem for 4 guys and the couches are very comfy and easily sleep 2 people plus there is an air mattress for a 5th.

2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location for events at the Astorian.

Light sleepers might have an issue as trains occasionally pass close to the house, but otherwise it was fantastic!"
2019-12-01,4,Stayed one night,"We were in Houston for a concert and Kelli’s bungalow is a quick, easy drive to downtown Houston. The house was perfect for our one night stay.

2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great experience all the way around. Easy DIY check-in with keypad, parking right in front, diagonally across the street from a new brewery (but not so close there's any noise or riffraff), and very clean. Only consideration: it's a 2BR, 1 Bathroom, and the single bathroom is only accessible by walking through one of the two bedrooms. Wasn't an issue for us, but just so you know.
Extra amenity: host has a computer in the living room for use. We didn't need it, but very cool to have it.
Also great to have nice, big TV with Roku, including Hulu Premium. Perfect for our hanging-out-in-Houston weekend."

2019-10-01,5,Group trip,"Our check in process to Kelli’s home was quick and simple and worked for this specific trip. It was a quick $5 Uber ride to White Oak Music Hall.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this place, not only was it affordable but not far from all the places we needed to go to. Very nice location, very friendly host and not to mention they had the cutest dog. My favorite thing was how close everything was but it was still far away from the city where there wasn’t a lot of traffic or noise."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The host was very responsive. The tiny house was perfect for my needs. There was a very friendly and welcoming dog when coming and going. I would stay there again if I was in the area.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I really enjoyed my experience at the Urban Barn. Upon arrival I was greeted with fun music and a personalized note on the coffee table. The entire time Leo was very accommodating and was available for anything I needed. The cute steps that lead to the loft style bedroom reminded me of being a kid again. It was so peaceful and I slept like a baby each night.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great 3 night stay for 2 people. Comfortable and perfect amount of space for us. For our activities centered around Cypress, TX and downtown Houston this was the perfect central location. Leo was responsive and helpful!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at the urban barn! Located in a beautiful neighborhood and close to many restaurants/amenities. The home had everything you could possibly need and more including kitchen ware, iron, blow dryer, and bathroom essentials. It was beautifully decorated and wifi worked great.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here for a weekend w my teen son. I knew he’d love the loft area & it didn’t disappoint. It was super quiet, easy to find w a good parking space right out front.
Comfy bed in the loft & the couch folds out into a bed. Smart tv, cute fridge & little cooktop that boils water in like two seconds!! Induction.
Loved the bathroom. Stayed super cool in the summer heat. Great decor & design. Comfy porch in the morning for coffee. Loved it.
Wal Mart 7 minutes. Dutch Bros 12 minutes.
We’ll be back soon!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute little tiny home with everything you would expect.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriend and I had a wonderful time staying at the Urban Farm! This was our first time visiting Texas and staying in a mini home. I really enjoyed the little book provided by the TV stand that explained the process of building the mini home and the love that Jenny poured into creating the Urban Farm. In other words, this Airbnb was a 10/10 and I’d book it again!
A super huge bonus was seeing their beloved dog Rom. My girlfriend absolutely loved him and found him to be the cherry on the top for this stay."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a wonderful stay. I loved everything about it and staying in the tiny house was a great experience for me. I hope to build and live in one in the near future. This one gave me the opportunity to see what it’s like. I loved it!!! 5 stars all the way and will be back when I come back to Houston.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely wonderful hosts!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect location in Houston 20-30 mins away for all the places we went. Leo thank you for your hospitality! I definitely felt the love ❤️ tell your mom I said Hi

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed staying at this beautiful home! Leo was very responsive and made sure to make things clear. I felt I had privacy and even got ideas for my own tiny home in the future! Would definitely stay again.
2023-07-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Usually I have a great experience at my airbnbs and I’ve gone to a couple. But I can’t lie I just didn’t enjoy this airbnb at all. For starters if I wouldve seen the front of the literal shack not tiny home but shack we were staying in, I honestly wouldn’t have booked the stay with them. No pictures of the outside of the “tiny home” were in the listing at all. The pictures they have listed make the place look pretty decently sized but upon arrival it’s honestly not how I imagined. They used wide angle pictures and those are very deceiving , and definitely not accurate. Would say the shed was clean but we found some roaches, underneath the stairs and in the shower was a dead roach. As well as one of the pillows had blood stains on it and idk where that came from so we were not wanting to use the pillows they had provided us. Shower lasted about 5-6 minutes before it got super cold. So take a pretty quick shower. The bed was so uncomfortable we had to stay with family members elsewhere."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a nice place to stay at, I would recommend staying here."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best place to stay! More for couples or friends! The most homey and comfortable air bnb ive ever stayed at! Directions were very clear and Leo was great at responding. We did not want to leave.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,what a wonderful place to stay! The hosts did a great job providing a cozy and comfortable place to stay. And in such a beautiful neighborhood. Romantic was such a friendly face when we are so far from our own fur babies!! Thank you so much for having us
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"this was my first time using Airbnb, so I was kinda expecting a low quality due to many stories of the app. Completely blown away, the Urban Barn was the best thing we could've asked for, a terrific host, a beautiful quiet place to get away, and Rome was highlight of stay, we will be staying again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Leo and Jenny were great hosts! And the place was just what I needed as I was in town for a conference. The power unfortunately went out due to a severe storm that came through but they kept me informed and asked if I needed anything. Would stay again if I’m ever in Houston!

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great experience at this tiny home. It was so clean and cute. I will definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to stay here. Leo and Jenny were very quick to respond to any questions I had. The check in instructions were clear and it was easy to access the home.
My only suggestion would be to possibly add more lighting to the outside of the tiny home. I found myself having to use my phone flash light to put in the code to the door.
Also, be very careful leaving out of the driveway it is very narrow & dark at night.
Overall I had a great experience and I will be back! I would totally recommend.
Thank you!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,Leo and Jenny’s air b&b was great and very cozy and comfortable! We loved the tiny home and we loved running into the adorable dog Rom keeping the place safe. An amazing place to stay at by amazing and responsive hosts!!!

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a wonderful place to stay! Super clean, easy to find, and in a safe neighborhood. My daughter and I found this space very comfortable - the mattress was a little soft for me, so I ended up sleeping on the futon, and even that was very comfortable. We enjoyed the pup's company, so Leo was so kind when we bumped into him in passing. Incredible value - we'll definitely try to book with Leo again next time we're in Houston."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a nice cozy stay and quiet neighborhood, we definitely enjoyed it."

Leo was very responsive and flexible with the changes I requested. Their dog is SUPER friendly and just wants to snuggle. A boil water notice was called for the city while I was there so the kettle in the kitchen came in very handy. I hadn’t realized there’s an induction cooktop in the kitchen so that was a nice surprise. My only advice when going up the stairs is watch the third step, my best friend and I had to make an effort to remember that one is just a bit higher than the rest 😅."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I'll just say, whenever you're ready and the spot is available book it you won't be disappointed. Our stay was short, sweet and cozy. Nothing we couldn't do at home but we wanted a short getaway and double with the experience of Tiny house living and that we did. So cheers to some good host.
Leo, Jenny and Rom."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tiny barn has everything you need for a comfortable stay. Doesn’t feel cramped and works well for 2 people. In a quiet neighborhood with coffee shops close by and has an easy drive into downtown Houston. Excellent value if visiting Houston.

We had another tiny home booked and when the address was given, G**gle maps made it obvious we DID NOT want to stay there but the area here was GREAT! Rom was sweet and our little 8 month old just loved him. Check in was super easy! It didn’t smell great when we first walked in but once we turned the ac on, it was fine. It wouldn’t prevent us from booking again. Cute cute place! Would stay here again!!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had an amazing weekend at Leo’s listing. Very calmed and relaxing place. Got to do exactly what I wanted… sleep!

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute little place, off a main road. Felt secure there."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very cute little spot for two people. They have everything we need, and the gentle giant dog. I was scared of him when I first saw how big he is but he is very friendly and gentle. The location can be a bit out there if you plan to go to downtown of Chinatown, but nothing too bad for a typical Houston drive. In the morning you can hear the birds chirping. Staying in someone’s backyard can be a little bit awkward but the host did a great job of giving us privacy. If I do a solo getaway I would consider this place as well because it has everything you need to just relax and chill."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute spot in a great location. Everything you need for a short stay is provided. It quickly warmed up, the water was hot and the dog is extremely cute and friendly. Thank you!"

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jenny and Leo have created such a cute tiny house experience! They really thought of everything too...from the toaster oven to the dehumidifier...the amenities were very thoughtful! We loved sitting out on the porch and having lunch under the trees. And we loved getting to meet Rom, the fluffy fur baby of the property!"
2022-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to stay at for two people!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a perfect place! Near so many great amenities and they even let us park under their garage hutch!
2022-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Would come back
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was amazing from the time we got here up until we left!!!!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This urban barn is truly perfect. My girlfriend and i were so comfortable throughout our whole stay. No complaints at all about this tiny home. It’s Quiet, peaceful and over all the hosts were extremely welcoming. Would definitely stay here again!! Thank you Jenny & Leo"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This space is fun, kind of like a treehouse. Climbing to the loft, reminded me of my bunk bed as a child. I was able to manage fine because I'm short and nimble, but I can imagine for tall people it will be tricky and not comfortable. The availability of shows and movies (Netflix and Prime) on the TV was nice. The street was quiet and safe, I enjoy driving through the neighborhood, with lots of trees and big houses around. Leo was super friendly and accomodating. There is a big dog that will greet you when you park in the driveway, don't let his size intimidate you, it is super sweet and friendly."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, reasonably priced and quiet"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, quiet and centrally located, exacting what I was in need of. Leo is very transparent and attentive to your requirements.
Pleasant experience."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed the stay, would book again.. Thanks it was very cozy"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Leo & Jenny made our stay so comfortable & relaxing! If you’re looking for a place to stay in Houston with a unique experience this is it! Their tiny home is decorated beautifully to make it feel like a home away from home. We can honestly say it was a highlight to our time in Houston. Their dog Rom is so kind & made the stay that much better- we miss him already!! We will definitely be back if we find ourselves in Houston again!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place is nice and very clean! Favorite part of the house was the bathroom. Leo and his mom was very nice too! Their dog was very friendly :))
We recommend this tiny house!!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home. Would definitely stay again if I come back to Texas!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you so much Leo for a great stay.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Urban Barn is a great place to rest & relax in peace & quiet which is exactly what we needed! Unless as a guest you're fit enough & in the mood to walk long distances (which I was & did), a car is highly recommended to access night life, restaurants or whatever."
2021-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"It was a nice place with nice welcome gift. My only issue was every time I left the house a lady walked outside the front door and stared at me until I left, who does that? It was creepy."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"great stay, you get the comfort of home and freedom to go in and out easily unlike a hotel, and the price is amazing, hotel prices get expensive real quick. i loved it here"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful neighborhood! Great hosts and a fun place to stay😊
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay! It was awesome and we enjoyed being in Houston, will definitely be back! Only downside is it’s a little far from things but at least we got to see a lot of Houston along the way loll"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second time staying here at Leo & Jenny’s and it has been top notch both times! Quiet hideaway in a nice neighborhood and perfect for quick trips!
Thanks again!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay in the little barn and we would stay again. The hosts were helpful, and the place had everything we needed. It was a relaxing place to stay."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Urban Barn was one of my favorite stays! It was quaint and cozy for my boyfriend and I. Located in north Houston, and about 35 minutes from downtown! The AC kept the place cool, the bed was comfy, and the shower was fantastic! Definitely recommend this spot for travelers!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed here for a week and didn’t want to leave! Very clean, quiet, and safe! Communicate was excellent!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,my boyfriend and i came to houston for our anniversary and we couldn’t be more pleased with this stay!! it was perfect for the two of us and really wasn’t that far of a drive from downtown. i will definitely be returning
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at the Urban Barn was amazing! Leo and Jenny were awesome with communication and their dog was super sweet!

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great tiny home! Really close to Houston and its in a very nice/quiet neighborhood. Has all the amenities you need. I'm i Houston often and I'll be staying here again!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,When I first drove up I was a little worried about the size but once we walked in there was a lot more room than expected. It was perfect for two people and such a cute little air bnb. The only thing was the bed mattress is really firm and in the thinner side so beware. Rom was so cute and sweet wished we would of gotten to see him more 😂. Overall great stay!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute little place and makes exploring Houston easy. Definitely for the able-bodied only with the stairs up to the loft. If you’re a tall person I’d say it would probably be difficult to maneuver around. Felt cozy and the little personal touches were nice. Decor and feel were awesome.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing !
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at the barn! Every detail was thought of and we loved spending time with their dog, Rom, while we were missing our own dogs at home. Thank you for a great stay!!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Urban Barn was super cute. So quiet and clean!!! In a very pretty neighborhood with beautiful trees!!! The pictures are true to the actual barn.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our first time in a tiny house and was a pleasant experience. Was just enough space for a couple. The decor is charming and welcoming. Bed can be a challenge if not used to climbing. But there dog was so friendly and won my husband over. It is a quiet safe neighborhood away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Would recommend it to any individualand couple wanting some peace.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a good time for a two night stay in the NW houston area, amazing creativity and all the amenities anyone would need. Good wifi, good tv, I have no real complaints, would stay again."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the place. Without a doubt the best Airbnb I have ever stayed at. It is so cozy and every detail was taken care of! Will stay again!!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,For anyone traveling through Houston my husband and I highly recommend this place! They were so accommodating and very responsive when messaging. Staying here made our trip it was amazing!

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful space that was well-suited to our needs. Close to the highway, quiet and private. More shops and restaurants than you would think are nearby, including Bluewater Seafood (amazing seafood boils), Cheerz (great drinks) & even Target for last minute items (I forgot my SD card reader for pics while on vacation & was able to easily run right out and get one). Highly recommend The Urban Barn!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little place is so cozy, we have no complaints and enjoyed our stay!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice stay and we loved Rom

2021-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The urban barn is a cute place to stay and it’s private, however, the mattress is not very comfortable. If you sleep best in soft and thick mattress’s maybe bring some extra padding or find a place with a better bed. It’s super nice to experience and has all the essentials for you to use."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Urban Barn was clean, comfortable, convenient, and in a safe neighborhood. We really enjoyed our stay. Communication was great and check-in was easy. We appreciated the covered parking too! I highly recommend the Urban Barn and will definitely stay here again when visiting Houston."

Manny Cano"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place, had a great time staying there."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,It's exactly what you expect and the price is going for being within walking distance between what both Midtown and Montrose has to offer!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Outstanding!! This is an entire one bedroom one bath apartment with a full kitchen! The location in midtown is perfect. This is a truly great place.
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is a cute older unit with ample space for 2 people. We stayed 3 nights. We didn’t use the kitchen, but it seemed well-equipped. The bed was firm and comfortable. The bathroom had everything we needed but could do with more towel bars/hooks. The unit was missing a hair dryer, but the host team dropped one off. You can park your car right in front of the unit, and there is a security gate in front of the entry door. The neighborhood was nice and felt safe. There were restaurants within walking distance. There was a little noise from upstairs and the street, but overall, it was quiet. The unit was fairly clean with only a few areas that could have been cleaned better. This is an older unit, and it is in need of repairs/renovation. The host team is proactive and seems to be receptive to guest suggestions and eager to address identified concerns."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is definitely my GO-2!!! Good People, Good Communication, Perfect size!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,My friend and I stayed to see a show close by and we loved it! Would recommend.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Max was a great host - very responsive. I had a wonderful stay at his place and will be back again.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a beautiful! The bathroom was my favorite part. The shower and tub were gorgeous as well are the cabinets. I liked a lot that there was a washer and dryer. It came in handy when I needed to wash my clothes. The bedding was comfortable as well. The kitchen is absolutely gorgeous!!! Well designed and the appliances are great quality. I got inspo for my future kitchen haha. Overall I would definitely stay here again. I do like how it’s like 5-10mins away from downtown as well!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful place to stay and a good distance from different areas of Houston. I want to shout out the host who was amazing. A terrible storm came through when we were there and he immediately reached out, brought us emergency supplies, and helped us coordinate with Airbnb support."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Decided to splurge and stay at Nathan’s place for a conference to avoid driving and boy am I glad we did! Everything you could need for a multiple night stay is accounted for and Nathan is a wonderful host. Walking distance to a few delicious spots to eat and you never have to worry about neighborhood ruckus disrupting your peaceful evening in the hammock after a long day. May very well be repeating this spot next year!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nathan’s casita was perfect for our quick Houston stay. There was an amazing Korean restaurant called Mapojeong and a cvs less than 7 min from the house. The bathroom is as perfect as the pictures. Overall, great place."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"By far, the best kept secret in The Heights! I loved this place, especially the shower/bathroom! I felt the shower was better than any of the best hotels in Houston and I felt so pampered! The oversized tvs and kitchen were just wonderful! Equally inviting were the two private patios - just so well organized and decorated!
I got to witness the 2024 eclipse in totality and the experience was spectacular, but Nathan’s La Casita was right up there in feeling spectacular! I can’t wait to visit again.
Lastly, I felt the ambience and quality of the place relative to the price paid was not proportionate, so I felt compelled to leave Nathan an extra tip! This place deserves 20 stars out of 10, in my opinion"

The shower and tub are out of a magazine. As for the bed, it is the most comfortable mattress I have slept on in an Airbnb and that means a lot coming from me. Might be better than my own. 🤔
Sheets, comforter, and pillows are all high quality. Truly zen aesthetic. Nathan communicates quickly and kindly. There are delicious snacks and FIJI water waiting for you when you arrive. I rate this place a 10000/10. I highly recommend staying here. 🙃"

Everything was so clean, new, and cozy, and his communication was spot on. I took advantage of the beautiful tub to read a book and relax.
He even had some Ferrero Rocher waiting on each pillow of the bed (my favorite chocolates).
It was exactly what I needed and I'm so glad I found this place for my trip. I recommend his place to anyone staying in Houston.
Thank you, Nathan, for everything."

This is the spot especially if you like being outdoors with 2 awesome spaces to work, have a glass of wine, relax, etc. By far the cleanest I have stayed in! Crisp white features with awesome design interior and exterior. Extremely cozy for 2 people. Amazing shower and tub (will try next time). Lots of unique goodies to comfort your stay (water, Cliff bars, chocolates, shampoo, conditioner, etc). Comfortable bed with extra pillows. Owners are close by if you need anything too.

Nathan was incredibly friendly and helpful, checking in throughout my stay. Secure parking, a seamless check-in process, and cozy, photogenic rooms made me want to live here! (lol) The comfy bed, plush linens, and spacious walk-in closet exceeded expectations. The well-equipped kitchen facilitated easy breakfast cooking, and I had everything I needed.
The divine bathroom had an amazing waterfall shower and an incredible deep soak bathtub with a private view of plants, and I even saw little squirrels playing and a neighborhood cat tiptoeing across the fence during my morning bubble bath.
On my last morning, I enjoyed soaking up the sun while lounging in the hammock on the porch, reading a book. Nathan is one of the best Airbnb hosts I've had and the space perfectly matched the photos. Without hesitation, I’d stay here again; the thoughtful design and comfort were evident throughout.
Thanks again for an amazing stay!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nathan’s place is officially my favorite listing. Pristine, private property that was beautifully decorated. Fresh plants in every corner, beautiful modern kitchen, and the bathroom was truly my favorite part with the built in soaking tub in the wet room. Nathan is such an intentional host and it shows — from the safety features for the sliding doors, the easy pull down blinds, the lovely bubble bath provided for the tub, and the super comfortable bedding that smelled oh so fresh. Also he was super friendly and always responded in a timely manner. This is my new go-to spot whenever I’m traveling to Houston and I would highly recommend this listing to other guests."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything was exactly as pictured and the bathroom was luxurious and rejuvenating. Definitely look forward to staying again.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is spotless and so private! We will definitely come back.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a terrific stay at La Casita. It's centrally located, which made it easy to access downtown attractions, shopping, and restaurants. And yet it's in a quiet residential neighborhood, which made it great for relaxing on the couch, working, hanging out in the outdoor areas, or just getting a good night's sleep. The fast internet and amazing spa-like bathroom were also highlights.
Nathan was a very accommodating host and made sure we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. We highly recommend La Casita!"

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place if you’re visiting Houston and you don’t want to stay in downtown. Airbnb is right by a host of food and shopping centers.

2021-03-01,4,Stayed over a week,"It was ok. I needed to check in earlier and thankfully Toni let me. Only thing is I got there and it was a mess. The prior person that stayed there left it a complete mess and thankfully I brought my own toilet paper and towels because there wasn’t any. Other than that, Toni responds to your messages quick and it’s in the middle of a lot of nearby stores and restaurants."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Toni’s place is very peaceful and quiet. Checkout was smooth, place sparkling clean. Internet fast, view is amazing. Toni is a very responsive host.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I've stayed in numerous airbnb rentals in Houston and this one is by far the best. The house is tastefully furnished and has everything you need for your stay. It has a beautiful backyard that backs up to a greenway. The bed is extra comfy with great linens. The hosts are incredibly responsive to any questions. Highly recommend.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,To say the house is beautiful is a understatement thank you
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Vivian was an absolute wonderful host very responsive!!! This home is beautiful inside and out, the walking path is such a peaceful experience. You’re in the city and yet don’t feel like it . Perfct after coming home from a long day. The house is exactly how the pictures and descriptions describe it. We will definitely be returning when we come back to Texas."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Property was a little smaller than expected (photographs very well), but as-advertised. Wonderful, convenient, and peaceful setting best describes. Back patio overlooks park with walking/biking trail. Passer-bys are frequent during the day, but far enough away that they were not intrusive."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home and helpful host. We enjoyed our stay!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Vivian was such a gracious host. We felt right at home and would return again at a drop!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in this house while a patient at MD Anderson Hospital. The house was great. Three outside sitting areas and a walking path just steps away from the back door. The kitchen was well equipped and we used it a lot. The beds were comfortable and both baths had a tub.
You will be a lucky guest if this house is available when you are looking in Houston. My sister thought this was the best Airbnb she’d ever stayed in."
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,We are very happy with the place. We will stay here again. ￼
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family stayed in Vivian's beautiful home in order to be closer to the wedding venue where my son and daughter-in-law got married. The home is spacious and beautifully decorated. There were so many amenities and special touches like a basket of snacks, water bottles, stocked coffee bar, laundry room with plenty of laundry soap and dryer sheets, a ping pong table in the garage, multiple bicycles, exercise equipment with weights, a pack and play, high chair, portable fans, fully stocked bathrooms with lots of toiletries. The primary suite is very roomy with a beautiful ensuite bathroom and walk-in closet. The outdoor patio has multiple seating areas and a wall with greenery that can serve as a backdrop to take photos. There are walking trails right behind the house and a park nearby too.
As a host, Vivian was very professional and with her communications, instructions, and always prompt with her responses.
Highly recommend!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Vivian’s place was absolutely beautiful! We brought Christmas to Houston, and her place was perfect for the occasion. Vivian was attentive and very responsive. She went above and beyond to ensure our stay was perfect. Prior to our arrival, Vivian even installed a tv in one of the bedrooms upon our request and added a ping pong table in the garage. We had a great time making new memories with our family. If you’re considering Vivian’s place, just book it!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Vivian was very responsive and gave clear instructions on how to access the house. The house was nice and fully stocked with all the essentials. We would stay here again!

2024-03-01,4,Stayed about a week,"The apartment is well suited for long stays. We loved the gated parking and the privacy. The only issue was that there was an awful smell in the room, I guess the carpet, the first night. But that went away after we bought and applied a heavy duty odor fighter. Would have definitely stayed for a month, but I couldn’t work with my multiple screens on the study as the monitors could not fit."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,always love coming to relux it's quiet and clean
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying at the Relux. Once again, we will definitely be staying without a doubt when we are in Houston.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,Everything was as described on the Air BnB page. Great location with lots of restaurants and supermarket close by. Apartment and common areas are kept very clean. Long-term residents here are mainly older Asians so it’s a peaceful environment. Front desk staff always helpful and maintenance requests are handled usually in the same day. Gated parking adds to the allure of this place! Highly recommend!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I loved it!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Though I did not stay that lond buy host was very flexible and was swift in communication. Will definitely recommend
2024-02-01,4,Stayed over a week,"Alex's place is convenience and safe. The instruction to check-in wasn't clear. It said to check in between 4pm to 10pm to aviod extra charge at the front desk. I got there before 10pm but the front desk was closed. Find out that the front desk was closed at 7pm. I contact Alex and she responsed right away and send self check in instruction which is easy. You just need to go through the parking gate (code provided) and get a key from the lockbox. So far i really like the place. I stay there for two weeks for business. There is gym and laundry there. The room has kitchen, fridge and Microwave. The place is closed to all kinds of restaurants. I recommend to stay."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very good place to stay very nicely located, private, very nice."

The location felt safe with a gated well lit parking lot. The staff was helpful and friendly. And we loved how close we were to all the amazing restaurants along Bellaire.
2023-11-01,4,Stayed over a week,"The place was not cleaned at all when we first came which is unacceptable and I hope they do better in the future. After you host Airbnb for a while you get lazy, so please for future guest , clean your rooms, they had broken dishes and dirty silverware. Besides that it was exactly like pictures and the host responded fairly quickly, they seemed robotic like , maybe in the future have more realistic compassion. And the host also blamed nose complaints on me and my husband , I’m pregnant and he works a lot we are quiet people. The place had a lot of smokers and was very stinky at times, the room itself had a nice tv and everything worked well inside the unit. Overall it’s very over priced but that’s the economy."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Very good human treatment.
Excellent place and fair price."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice stay.
2023-11-01,4,Stayed about a week,Starting our visit had some minor cleaning issues but the host cared for it immediately and compensated us for it. Alex was a great host and would come back again for sure!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was very welcoming. It has all the comforts to spend a few very quiet days. The kitchen was very complete, the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom too. Parking was very important to me because we rented a car, and there was a free and very safe parking spot on site. I highly recommend this place and would stay here again if I go back to Houston."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Awesome place and a great deal! Nice location, safe, the room felt as if we were in a hotel. Everything awesome overall , no complaints."

2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"It was okay. The please is clean and nice. The only issue I had with them is the time. You can’t check in until 4 pm and I was told if I want to check in early, I would have to pay $35. I wish they would update that in the description so people can decide. By the time I was told about the time, I have already made the payment which means if I change my mind, I wouldn’t get my money back until 7 to 14 days after. And I need something asap. That’s the only thing."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Nice place

Being able to come back and cool off and relax in the pool was a highlight for my son. By the way, the pool hours are exactly until 10 pm. I enjoyed my stay, and the rate of pay charged for this rental space is excellent."

Just be sure to be there before 10pm if you are using the Sofa bed to ask for the blankets in the reception.
We came after that time and even though the instructions for checking in were very clear, there was no blankets for the Sofa bed."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great stay.
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"From both arrival and departure: the location of the listing was both peaceful and private. I never had issues with the tenants or the level of noise outside. For those significantly older, the close proximity of the vehicles exiting to the main highway may find this troublesome (I sleep like a log). To accommodate for the high temperatures, the room is cooled to close to a freezing temperature. I am used to hot weather but I did not pay too much attention to the room temperature. I did decide to do one load of laundry before my flight only to realize the front desk provides laundry detergent but not the dryer sheets. Overall, I had a pleasant stay and I would not mind traveling back to stay at this listing as the peace of mind of my rental vehicle behind a gated enclosure was great."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and a lot of restaurants nearby, would definitely recommend"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying here! It had the charm of an apartment but the feel of a small luxury hotel.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I stayed here for a month It's a really nice place, clean, comfortable and well equipped. Flawless email communication with the host. I managed to lock myself out the room one night but lucky they had security on duty to help me out to get access to the room… it’s definitely in a great location as well
We’ll be booking again thanks Alex!!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had a great stay! The hosts were so friendly. The surroundings were very peaceful and check in was extremely easy. The process to check in/check out were well communicated and the hosts were very responsive. This location is only 15 minutes away from city walk and 25 minutes away from downtown.
2023-03-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Good place. Easy to check in.
There should have been some coffee and water when I arrived though. And maybe a small welcome snack?
Else, no real complains. Good price, good place."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If I could give 6 stars… it was a wonderful experience, seamless check in and priced just right for the amenities provided. We also rented an EV and it was so helpful to have a charger so we were always ready to tour the city. Definitely would make Alex’s our home every time where in Texas."
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Alex was responsive and accommodating. Room was clean and bed was comfortable. Probably one step down then what you would find at a hotel. Also, wish we could’ve had more towel and bigger trash bin"
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Place is good only issue that i had was the cook top was not working but I let the host know and hopefully it will be fixed soon
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"overall the place was just like the pictures and very quiet and peaceful. the price was great for the location. the only thing I'd suggest is at least giving two sets of towels per guest because we had two in our party for 2 nights but only 1 set of towels and nothing in instructions about bringing them. Lastly, the sofa bed had no linens to put on. the ease of check in was great and communications from owner was great."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Totally enjoyed my stay
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Hosts were very welcoming and helped with our every need. Will definetly be coming back soon.

The entire hotel was kept super clean. Air conditioning worked. Bed was super comfy too
Cons the shower water pressure was SUPER low which didn’t make for a good shower, and one night I didn’t have my swipe key with me there was no after hours support I drove back to my work and got my key. Other than those two things it was really nice."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great place
2023-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Great place - looks exactly like the pictures. Super clean

2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"My stay in this property was great until some family rented room next to me, and it became a bad experience. It was not the fault of the renting place but more likely the family who stayed next to me. The family next to me didn't respect the rules of quiet hours, and they were lough till midnight. I wish there would be someone in the office if something like that happens—otherwise, one of the great stays in Houston, texas."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gated parking, room was clean and just as described. I recommend staying here."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I stayed for 9 nights. It is a very convenient location with many restaurants and easy access to highway. It is ideal for a short stay. It will be better if there is a room cleaning every 3-4 days for a long stay, like more than 5 days."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,Alex was very responsive. Staff was very nice. Only complaint is roaches in kitchen. I saw that they bombed my room before I arrive but it didnt help

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This AirBNB was exactly as listed. My flight had been cancelled & needed a place to stay ASAP.

I truly recommend this place for anyone who wants comfort at a reasonable price. Would definitely book again!"
2022-12-01,3,Stayed about a week,"The place was not expect front desk seem hesitant opening the door,, and secondly hotel was clean and nice but don’t expect your liens and bedsheets and as well as room service you don’t see nor do they change anything unless you request it yourself and no there’s not a phone in the hotel room so you’ll have to call on your phone. But overall it was quite and relaxing plus free laundry was plus."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The place was an amazing bang for you buck experience. I was in Alex’s place for nearly 2 months and it felt very cozy, safe and private.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to hang your hat. My stay was for business. But, I noticed the other guest were active & interacted & would hang out together in the awesome lobby areas & outside! There was obviously no loitering going on. Just people taking peaceful strolls around the outside of the building. Friendly atmosphere. Nice, clean, peaceful & quiet rooms!"
2022-12-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"I thought it’s an accident they didn’t lay a sheet under the quilt when I first time stayed there last month.

The space was quiet (I never heard the folks below), private, and in a great neighborhood. The living room chairs were a bit stained and the outside of the apartment and stairs needs a good pressure wash and some paint, and a dehumidifier might be good. But this place is an amazing deal for the price and I would stay again!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were very happy to stay at Lamar's Bungalow. The location was perfect for us as we were in town for a concert at the Heights Theater. Restaurants, gift shops, bars, and coffee shops were all an easy 10-20 min walk away and the neighborhood itself was beautiful. The apartment was clean and well-furnished for the two of us. The only note I want to make is that there is a downstairs apartment below this one that was occupied while we were there. The tenant seemed nice and wasn't disruptive, but we could sometimes hear talking or coughing from below and I was worried at times we might be too loud just walking around. That said, it didn't pose much of an issue for us and we would gladly book again."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great place, great location"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place is exactly as described spotless and the bedding was extremely comfortable with clean & fresh sheets. I really enjoyed soaking in an old fashioned tub. The place was originally built in 1922 but has been completely renovated with a vintage look & feel. There is a tenant staying on the first floor and the large house in front is also Airbnb so your not completely alone. The lock box was a little tricky to close. I would definitely stay here again.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved staying here! My boyfriend and I were tired of hotels for our trips together and Lamar’s bnb was perfect! Very clean, comfortable, in a beautiful part of town and was wonderful for just the two of us to get away. 10/10, would give more stars if i could!!"

2022-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This was a cute spot that had a lot of good features. When we had a problem with the shower Lamar was quick to respond and get it fixed right away!
One thing to note is that this place is on a property with other guests in other airbnbs, just a little heads up. Also, there is bare essentials in the kitchen and no filter in the Brita or otherwise filtered water.
Overall, it was a good place to visit and we appreciate Lamar’s hospitality very much!"

They loved the historic space with modern updates, and the owner was very communicative and responsive. As a bonus, when my son-in-law left his wedding ring above the sink when they checked out, the owner contacted me right away and made it very simple to retrieve it. Highly recommend."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little place for a relaxing stay in the heart of the Houston Heights! Owner was very responsive to an unusual situation that was not their fault - we arrived to find a raccoon sleeping in front of the door. We didn't want to approach it because raccoons potentially spread rabies, so we called the owner. Within less than 10 minutes, a representative showed up and humanely encouraged the raccoon to move along. Very responsive and effective response to an unusual situation, which we very much appreciated."

We will be staying here on a regular basis when we visit Houston."
2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The place was clean and had everything you would need for a week's stay. It was perfect for me because it was reasonably priced and close to my daughter's house.

2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I genuinely enjoyed this Airbnb as it was very cute and quaint. There is some cobwebs here and there, but I do like how this house was able to find a way to renovate it into the cute little place that it is. Everything an average traveller needed was already ready and within reach (i.e. extra pillows, some toiletries, plates and silverware, etc). Plus, the check-in/check out process was super easy and simple, & I loved the bed!!
Overall, I enjoyed my mini-vacation out there and would recommend it to anyone looking for a cozy place like this. :)"

This place is so pleasantly clean but has all the charm of a place from a different time. It is quiet. Comfy bed. Fresh, not tired linens. The small kitchen, which we prepped several breakfasts in before walking the Heights had any equipment we needed to cook. Easy to work in in spite of being small. Will come again for all these reasons. Lamar is communicative, helpful and made this anotger smooth stay for us."

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I typically reserve a hotel because I like knowing what to expect. I had no familiarity with Houston whatsoever, but I chose this place because it was cheaper and had good reviews. It was beyond good, and the neighborhood is quite ritzy. My favorite part was the dining nook-or, maybe the comfortable bed. Stay here!! You won’t regret it."

2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I were back in Houston to visit a nearby family member in the heights. We have stayed in a different house under the same host. Were very happy that time so we were comfortable booking one of her properties again. This place so beats any hotel you could stay in. Clean as a whistle top to bottom. It feels like home. It is basically a quaint small house with all you can want. A cozy living room for a morning coffee. A well appointed lovely small kitchen and attached dining area. The bed was comply and sheets as fresh as can be. We love that the place was nested at the back of a driveway making it feel private and quiet. The Heights is a charming residential neighborhood. We hope this awesome living space is free for us to reserve the next time we come back. It would be our first pick.

2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as described with sweet extras like salt, pepper, great coffee. Much care was taken in the restoration of this 1922 bungalow"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I typically take a moment to review all of the stays taken; this visit is no different. Not having been to Houston in the past, I spent significant time searching for a place to stay. I was travelling with my girlfriend and was happy with the choice to stay at Lamar's place. My daughter recently moved to Houston and my first visit with her was pleasant. The ""Heights"" offers a number of restaurants and bars and the neighborhood is ideal for a morning or evening walk. There are a number of options within walking distance to grab a morning coffee. Regarding the unit itself, I found it as advertised. Being from New England, we began to refer to it as the ""cabin"" given its resemblance to a Maine lakefront cabin we would often frequent. The unit itself is ideal for a couple or single and for shorter stays. We spent little time in the unit, having spent most of our time outside or with my daughter at her home. We never used the stove but it is dated. My girlfriend has some physical limitations which created somewhat of a challenge in the small bathroom and accessing the tub/shower. She also needed time to climb the stairs to enter the unit. The TV was difficult as well, not having your typical cable hookup like we are accustomed to. Thankfully the weather was ideal so TV was not a priority but evenings were focused on Netflix rather than ESPN (no college football or golf). Parking was not an issue. There were others staying in the home and it was very quiet. Overall, I would stay here again."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lamar’s place was awesome! History on the restoration of this apartment was very interesting and informative. The information made us appreciate this quaint apartment even more than expected. Restoration is beautiful and the amenities, such as the thick towels and comfortable bed made our stay perfect. I loved having off-street parking. Close proximity to great restaurants and the neighborhood was beautiful! Lamar was very responsive and even provided some great suggestions for restaurants. I’d definitely stay here again!"

2020-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We absolutely LOVED our stay at Lamar’s place. In covid times, we really appreciated the extra cleaning steps taken to ensure our safety during our stay.

Kitchen had all the amenities for staying in for dinner. Washer & dryer worked great. Also, location was amazing. So close to freeways and great Heights spots. Lamar was great with communication as well. Couldn’t have asked for a better experience! Highly recommend!"

Chirp app took a bit to get used to but once i got the hang of it it was a breeze. (Just don’t let your phone die like me I had to get someone to buzz me up lol). Only little thing is not a lot of dishes but that’s an easy fix and overall 5/5 experience. Will book again if back in Houston.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This was my first time renting out an airbnb and our host Nineteen was very quick to respond and always there for us anytime we had any questions! The view was outstanding and it was the reset me and my partner needed for a stay-cation. Thank you for being my final trip before departing to the military.
2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,Nineteen was very helpful with directions. Quick responses to questions and very friendly. Only reason why I don’t leave 5 stars is because we did not have toilet paper on the bathroom nor hand soap. Rather than that the place was beautiful with an awesome view.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome place. Great location. Great view. Definitely 100% recommended.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you Nineteen for being hospitable during my stay. I was in town for a concert that was right across the street which was bad ass. You didn’t have to worry about taking an Uber or parking in a different space.
The location is super secure with locks at every door/elevator/garage. I did have a bit of trouble using the app to access the exterior doors but Nineteen was more than receptive and was able to help remotely. The space was more than accommodating for 2 people.
I wish I could’ve stayed longer!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was my first time using an AirBNB so I was skeptical, but the host was very responsive and hospitable . The space is much larger than what the pictures show and the view is incredible ! . 10/10 recommendation and I will definitely be back in the future !"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect place to stay after watch the rocket play. Beautiful view of downtown Houston!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! The building staff and neighbors are some of the friendliest people we have ever met. It’s confusing to get around the building but everybody is happy to help out and show you how or where to go. Front desk gave us waters and opened door for us to enter/exit. Beautiful view from apartment balcony. Location couldn’t be better for anybody visiting for a downtown convention. Just bring anything you need because it’s bare cabinets, drawers, and fridge but that doesn’t reduce the overall value of the stay at all in my opinion. I’d love to stay there again."

Host was very responsive and helpful, the place was clean and smelled great and overall had a really sleek modern vibe to it with the mood lighting and everything plus the bed comforter was very comfortable, I got a good nights sleep. It’s the perfect spot for a weekend get away with your significant other and is right in the heart of downtown with plenty of things to do around you within walking distance or a quick 5 min drive/Uber. I love that there was a balcony so you can get a nice look at the beautiful skyline view the place had to offer. I definitely will book with this Host again when I come to town.

High ceilings, very clean, plenty of seating in the living room and huge TV. King sized bed was comfortable with a memory foam mattress pad for added comfort. The entrance was not obvious, but the host provided clear proactive instructions to find the way at check in. There was a fully functional kitchenette for some cooking or managing leftovers, which was convenient! Super happy with the value and quality."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was very nice and clean. I loved it ! Amazing host too.
2023-09-01,2,Stayed a few nights,Happy that the unit matched the pictures. Was situated relatively close to highway and restaurants. Directions to unit and entry were easy to follow. Parallel parking against fence was tight and maneuvering to get out was challenging given where other cars parked and we had an SUV. The main issue we had was that there was visible black mold in the bathroom. This is a health hazard and clearly been present for some time. We vacated the unit. Thomas offered to move us to another of his properties but that unit was more expensive. We were already being inconvenienced and he wanted to charge us more money to move to another of his units that was currently unrented. This unit should not have been available to rent in that condition. We are certain that Thomas wouldn't live with black mold in his own residence. He argued that it wasn't mold but I sent pictures to him and Airbnb; the latter agreed with our assessment. It was unfortunate since it was otherwise a nice unit.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Unit was very clean and exactly as described.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful stay and I appreciated your quick response to my questions and requests.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I had a pleasant stay at Thomas' place, finding it both clean and true to its listing description. The cozy atmosphere was definitely a highlight. While the parking situation proved a bit tricky due to a narrow entrance and tight spaces, with some adjustments, it was manageable. Additionally, the toilet presented some flushing issues, but Thomas was incredibly responsive and made earnest attempts to address the matter promptly. Despite the persistence of the issue, Thomas' attentiveness and willingness to help were commendable. Overall, the stay was enjoyable, with only minor parking and toilet hiccups that didn't overshadow the positive experience."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Thomas’ apartment was the perfect setting for a getaway. Beautifully decorated, clean, and great location. Next time I go to Houston this will be the place I look to stay at."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Solid stay for a quick visit
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I have been needing a getaway for some time. This was our second time renting an Airbnb, and it was such a lovely experience! Such a beautiful suite and we enjoyed that it was a private, peaceful setting. It was spacious floor layout with a gorgeous design, strong A/C system especially in this 100 degree weather, awesome TV, and the design of the shower area was remarkable.
We truly were able to enjoy ourselves and the host, Thomas, is responsive to all needs. I would recommend this suite for anyone trying to go on their own getaway or traveling into Houston!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Thomas’s place is absolutely stunning! My friend and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely stay.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The Bonaparte Suite was beautiful and looked just like the pictures. My husband and I were there for his cancer treatments so we stayed for 7 nights. There was great water pressure in the shower and the bed was quite comfortable. The only drawbacks for us were the lack of spare anything. We needed more than one dish towel, more than one hand towel and more than two facecloths. I feel sure if we had seen them, our hosts would’ve been happy to give them to us, but we never saw them. That in itself could be a very good thing as they gave us plenty of privacy. However, I didnt feel comfortable going to their door. No washer had been mentioned in the amenities but I didn’t see it mentioned that there was no dishwasher. I don’t mind washing dishes by hand but i need somewhere to dry them or a drain board. Overalll, it was a nice place and a good value"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay only problem is the parking as I’m sure they hear all the time.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,good place
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,The place is as described. The only problem was parking.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great experience with our stay! One thing to note is the parking is parallel parking in a reserved spot so can be tricky to get in and out but would definitely stay again!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic quiet place
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thomas was a very responsive host! Whenever we needed something he was able to help out. Place looked like photos and in a quiet neighborhood with a reserved parking spot- a gem. Would definitely book again!

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The most important thing I needed was quite! This location is in the middle of everything and you do not feel like you are in the city! Perfect, for one or 2 people and near everything! Host was soooo accommodating due to my situation with my first 2 bookings not going so well! Bed was comfortable and I loved the lighting and style"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"I am so very thankful for the beautiful, clean and wonderful and quiet night stay. In America's 4th largest city, Houston, I would never have believed I would have such a quiet and comfortable stay near/in River Oaks/ Upper Kirby district."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thrilled with the accommodations: beautiful, quiet and private. Tucked away in a bustling area, not far from anything fun.

We did find it to be lacking a lot of basic amenities like toiletries in the shower and items in the kitchen. My biggest issue with the apartment is the location and access. If you plan on having a lot of things delivered or calling a lot of Ubers, expect to have to walk to meet them or to have to pick things up off a neighbor’s porch. The entry to the house is in a back alley that no one can ever find, which was an issue given all the storms. We really struggled to get people to find our “front door”."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great Stay! Super close to everything, super accessible, and genuinely so cute! Definitely will stay here again on our next trip to Houston!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay here in Dallas. The house is located in a quiet neighborhood, and the is very private. It was very clean and cozy. Laura was very responsive, helpful and kind. We will definitely stay here again!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, not usually an early bird but place is full of jogging areas and restaurants and coffee shops that I had to wake up early to go enjoy all that stuff, Safe neighborhood with plenty to do and right off the freeway if you need to travel anywhere, the place itself is clean and described perfectly. Will definitely be booking again when I visit."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very well located apartment, in a residential area. Very clean apartment, which we greatly appreciated."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay at Laura’s place! This apartment looks just like the pictures! It is spacious and light, but shades protect against the sometimes too much Houston summer sun. It is spotlessly clean and beautifully furnished, but also comfortable and relaxing. Everything worked perfectly, especially the AC, which, sorry, is important during these 100 degree days. Having 2 bathrooms was a real luxury as was the really cool walk-in shower. It is located in a quieter, walkable part of Houston’s vibrant Heights neighborhood with a mixture of lovely historic homes and gorgeous new ones, close to great restaurants, parks and all amenities. We weren’t tourists, but if you are, there is no better location for easy access to the museum district, fabulous zoo, shopping, medical center, and downtown. In my mind, this is the “Goldilocks” place, where everything is just right! Can’t wait to stay at Laura’s again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My daughter did a two week Summer intensive at Houston Ballet and this Airbnb was the perfect location for us! It was super close to downtown but also in a really hip area. We LOVED the location! There was an awesome walkable park called Donovan Park that we took our kids to a lot! There was a ton of local restaurants, coffee and shopping in the neighborhood as well.
If you’re looking for a hip and safe neighborhood to stay in when you’re in Houston, then I recommend this super cute Airbnb!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were in town for a gymnastics camp, and could not have picked a better place to stay. We loved this Air bnb! It was so clean, well decorated with great bathrooms, and spacious enough for our two girls to hang out and place their things. It sits in a quaint side of town with everything you need close by, including quick access to downtown and the local aquarium. There are great walking/running paths and a play area close by. We were able to find a community pool for the kids as well. There are so many yummy ice cream shops nearby to choose from. While our teammates stayed at the Omni and pretty much stayed in, we enjoyed the local area and came back to the comfort of our home away from home. We will definitely be back next year or anytime we visit. I highly recommend this adorable home!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Airbnb was super comfortable and spacious for four people. We stayed for almost a week and we were able to work, cook, and relax comfortably. Laura was super responsive and very proactive in making sure we had everything we needed. The neighborhood was very safe and quiet. I would definitely stay here again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Laura's place was spot on for what we were looking for. Went to Houston for a nephew's wedding at the Heights Theater. The location was perfect. It was a very walkable neighborhood. I was very disappointed that the temperature was 100+ every day, so did not walk the neighborhood. I can't say enough about how nice the neighborhood was - very nice and I felt very safe. Laura's place was exceptionally clean and the place looked exactly like the pictures.
Would definitely recommend this place and would stay here again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a perfect place for our family with two small children. The shower in the master bedroom was perfect after a day of traveling. The host was very responsive to messages.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was very clean, well put together and had everything we neeeded. We have stayed in the Heights many times and this area was quiet which is not always the case. The hosts were very responsive and anticipated a challenge with some unexpected driveway maintenance work going on by communicating prior to our arrival about the issue and directed us where to park. The apartment was well furnished and supplied an had nice finishes. Everything you could possible need was no more than 10 minutes away. The apartment was just a few blocks from Heights Blvd. which has a well-manicured walking path past some amazing historical homes. We had a very comfortable stay and would definitely consider staying here for our next visit."

The apartment is accessed from an alley behind the house and parking is out on the street. There was construction going on next door but despite this the apartment was very quiet and we were still able to find parking close by. Highly recommend if looking to stay in the Heights!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Booked this place last minute. Rebeca responded right away and gave clear instructions. The place was clean and cute. I also really loved the shower. Thank you
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Exactly as described and photographed very quick and easy to get to from the airport and just what we needed. We will definitely stay again if we ever see ourselves in Houston.
2024-06-01,4,Stayed one night,very nice placeee

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was terrific in the area and so convenient because it’s so close to the airport! Not to mention how professional and loving place that was left for me for one night! I would totally book here again!
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Relatively small so no space/placement to put clothes. She’s very responsive and helpful. Cute overall!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fun little tiny house, definitely worth experiencing at least once. super cute decorations and cozy atmosphere."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great time staying! Nice neighborhood and super cute house
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cute place to stay!! Despite being connected to another air bnb, we felt that it was plenty private. The space was perfect for a 2 people staycation, and so comfy! We had no problems feeling at home. Rebeca was incredibly helpful, polite and very on top of things! I truly appreciated her professionalism and kindness. Would definitely consider booking again in the future!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The space is small but utilized very well! It’s super cute and comfortable. Had everything we needed and conveniently located near Bush International. The bed was comfortable and we appreciated the a/c unit in the bedroom. Would absolutely recommend and stay again!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for a short stay! Stairs are definitely steep but manageable as long as you’re careful.
2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,Had a miscellaneous question the night prior that could have easily been able to be answered with a yes or no answer. Was able to check in 4 hours early for an additional $15. The amount should have been charged before hand. Had some issues trying to pay for it after check out. Place is well decorated and clean and feels really private and was really quiet which we loved. Stairs are quite steep to reach the second floor as well as to step down into the bathroom but the shower is amazing. Host makes you take out your own trash and clean dishes before check out even though there is a $40 cleaning fee.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rebeca's place is perfect if you are needing to catch a flight. It's very close to the airport. It's located in a beautiful, safe neighborhood. It was very clean and we loved the shower!"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"We just needed a place to stay the night before catching a flight out of IAH, and this place fit the bill. The place was as described, but it just didn’t register from the photo that there are 2 pretty steep stairs into the bathroom, which made me a little uneasy if I needed to get up in the middle of the night."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The location was very convenient to the IAH airport!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,A great place to stay in Houston.

2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,All in all a great cozy space for a weekend trip. Be prepared to climb steps to get to the restroom lol. The bed was clean and comfortable. The towels were easily accessible and in plain view. The bathroom was very clean and well thought out. It's very cute just be mindful if you are on the taller side you might have to duck. It was a very cool space we really enjoyed our time there.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,10/10 definitely recommend!!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This house was beautiful. Minus a few small mishaps (nothing super major at all) (nothing & no one is perfect) we had a very good stay. We (my fiancé & I) were comfortable like it was home. I would definitely stay here again. The host was very responsive & also checked on us mid stay to make sure we had everything that we needed.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great tiny home, worth the price! Just watch out for the very steep stairs."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The tiny house was very clean and cozy. The staircase is a bit too tight to carry suitcases up to the bedroom but overall the space is enough for 2 people. I really enjoyed my stay and the responsiveness of the host!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Rebecca was an amazing host. This place is in close proximity to IAH, which was great. It was clean and to be honest it is perfect for a solo trip. I will definitely book again when I come back to the area. Completely recommend."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We stayed for just a short stay at this adorable tiny home! It was only about 10 minutes from the airport so made for a perfect spot before a morning flight. The stairs to get to the bedroom are steep but the character it provides is well worth it. On street parking with easy pictured instructions.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,super close to the airport. nice clean space
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a very comfortable place to stay! Easy to use and very clean.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Very convenient and super communicative!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a lovely Hideout. The home was decorated just as pictured. Rebecca responded quickly. It's a quick drive to IAH.
THIS WAS A BIG BLESSING. WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and I really enjoyed staying here. Made us want a tiny house of our own! Lol.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice unique place. The ladder stairs are truly quite steep, which was a bit frustrating if you were upstairs and forgot something downstairs or vise versa. You basically are living out of your suitcase, although there were a few hangers for clothes in the bathroom. The place was clean and had basic necessities stocked."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great spot
Very close to airport
Tiny home indeed, but has all the basic needs (only thing to be careful with is the stairs, as stated in listing)"
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,Thank you Rebeca
2023-09-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Very dangerous staircase to go to the bed space. People a bit oversized or old, better avoid."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was an easy going stay. Great place for a weekend get away with a friend :)

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, what an amazing little place! Space wise, it was economical, but never cramped, with a comfortable bed and in a very quiet, peaceful area (epescially considering how conveniently close to the airport it was). Bathroom was very nice, the standout being the shower, which consisted of a broad rainfall overhead shower head, in-wall sprayers, and an adjustable head, which could all be easily switched between. The shower was incredibly roomy, easily big enough for 2 people. Kitchen well furnished.
Our host and her partner were both incredibly responsive to our needs. We notified them of a very minor issue, and even then, they responded promply and arrived in person to address and fix it less than 15 minutes later.
In short: A very cozy stay, with an amazing price for the airbnb and its location (around 15 min from IAH). In addition, the hosts are incredibly friendly, responsive, and considerate. I'd highly recommend this location, doubly so for anyone who needs to be close to IAH!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rebecca’s place was just as described! It was very clean, great distance for things to do and a quite peaceful neighborhood! Would definitely stay here again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The stay was great. I enjoy everything about the airbnb. Most definitely worth booking.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super cute and cozy house! Host communicated well and was very accommodating.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was really cozy. loved the tiny living. everything was so quaint. Downstairs gets a lil hot but upstairs makes up for it with an AC. Also when we first got there one of the remotes battery was dead and the host went and got a new battery that same night which was pretty cool. There wasn't any kind of closet or spot to put our clothes which kinda sucked but we made it work. overall realy enjoyed our stay!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great little place to spend the weekend.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,i loved this airbnb! the tiny home was really cozy. my favorite part woukd probably be the shower! lol
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,The place was really clean. And it was very private. The host communicated everything with me. Would stay again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was an all around great stay and perfect getaway
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing stay! Host responded promptly and was very nice! Space was perfect for 2
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed my stay here, it was small and a great location right next to the airport. The lawn was not mowed and at night the neighbors played loud music. I didn’t feel the safest since there was only one deadbolt. Also wish this was listed as a separated room since there seems to be 3 different Airbnb stays in this one house. Didn’t have any main issues other than the trash can in the kitchen is super small and out grew it on the second day. Also the downstairs was super hot and stuffy compared to the bedroom. Very cool when I slept but any meal making or watching tv downstairs was uncomfortable. There was a slight slip up with me finding a dirty knife with crusty white stuff on it inside the drawer. Witch seems like a total accident and understandable since there is a lot to take account for with having a listing. There were only white bath towels… I was so worried I would stain one! Definitely a tight space but gets the job done for a good price!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice and cozy-easy stay

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I loved my stay here! It was the most adorable Airbnb I’ve stayed at in Houston. The shower was amazing and there was plenty of amenities.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"great stay ☆☆☆☆☆ tiny hideaway was so cute, comfy, private, and safe. we will be back for sure, thanks Rebeca!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a great stay for myself and my wife for a couple of nights. A tiny place that’s ideal for couples and have to be mindful when using the stairs as mentioned by other guests in their reviews. Rebeca was very responsive prior to the check-in and throughout the stay.
2023-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,It was an amazing experience. Definitely one for the books!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was perfect, my girlfriend was astonished the moment we walked in and fell in love with it instantly."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was so cute! It's almost like it was the perfect size for me. I'm a little short and didn't even have to duck on the stairs. It was in a quiet neighborhood not far from everything. Would definitely stay here again.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was such a cute place to stay! Very cozy and Rebecca is a very good host that responds to questions very quickly!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As described, a very nice unique style tiny home. It was close to everything we had planned. I would definitely come back here the next time I am in town!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a nice place to stay, looks like the pictures. Clean. Responsive hosts. Thank you!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little place to stay. This was extra clean and was a good little get away from busy life.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Rebeca’s place! It was clean, comfy, easy to find and in a great area. She was very responsive and made sure any questions I had were answered. I will stay here again when I come to town."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cute little house in a neighborhood where we felt safe.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,All together a beautiful tiny house! Very comfortable and she was quickly responsive when I had questions during my stay
2023-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"I had a great time. Rebecca was very responsive to any questions or concerns I had and was wonderful. The space was like the pictures but dated. Downstairs level could definitely use some tlc as the rug, ottoman, and couch were worn down. Loved the upstairs space."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Just like the name it’s a cute “tiny” house. It’s a great stay and we had a wonderful time!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,The house is really nice
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This place has the unique factor dialed to a 10! It definitely should be noted that it is a MICRO living space. Like New York small, the kitchen was well equipped for the size and the bed was very comfortable, it also has the best looking shower I’ve seen in a AirBnB so far.
The location is about 20ish min north of downtown which was a little far for me, but not horrible. There is not a dresser or chest for clothes so you will be living out of your suitcase during the stay and it’s not made for people that are vertically blessed #tallpeopleproblems.
Overall I think it’s a great bargain and would recommend this place for a quick trip to H-Town."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks so much Rebeca! We really enjoyed our stay. Your tiny hideout was beautiful and matched the pictures exactly! My husband and I especially loved all your decorative pieces! If we ever come to Houston again, we’d love to stay at your place again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute little place lived the shower! Also the patio was nice!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful home. We very much enjoyed our peaceful weekend at the tiny house. Very quiet and easy check in. Loved it.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. Awesome host
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a great cozy tiny house stay! I felt right at home. Definitely recommend!
2023-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"Overall the tiny home was very nice. The decor was really cute. The shower is nice and huge too. I rated this place a 4 because there were a couple of inconveniences, being a Houston local I was looking forward to cooking here but the stove tops didn’t work but there was a portable single burner to use , it just took me 2 1/2 hours to make something that takes 30min. The other hiccup was that you had to log in and out of your different Netflix , Disney + etc .. accounts because there wasn’t an account provided."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great space! Super cute and clean… very close to the airport. We had an early flight and this was the perfect spot after a day of exploring the city. It was less than 10 min to get to the airport for our 5am flight. We ventured out for a snack and there was no shortage of delicious tacos near by!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice place
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Rebeca’s tiny house is super cute! The perfect place to stay if you’re travelling through Houston. I cannot recommend it enough. Everything was thoughtfully laid out and super clean. The neighborhood was very residential and quiet. Parking is easy, and I found the location very easily even at night. The stairs are indeed steep! But there are several bannisters, lots of good lighting, and it adds to a unique layout that I’ve never experienced before but very much enjoyed! I will definitely be booking with Rebeca again the next time I pass through. Just took all the anxiety out of travelling!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I stayed at Rebecca's house for the second time because I had a great time the first time. I confirm that I would be back
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is an adorable little spot, perfect for an evening stop before a morning flight. Very convenient to get to lots of dining options as well as the airport."
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The “tiny home” was a great experience. We loved the decor and the amenities, other than the shower, as the water kept going hot and cold on us as we tried to shower each and every time. Other than that, our stay was great and they had everything we needed!!
As they say though… beware of the stairs!! Lots of ducking, banging of heads, attention to where and how you step, and not walking up and down them in the dark!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay that matches the description. Clean, tidy, and well-heated. Very clear information for everything"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolute great space for the price, unique tiny home-esque environment. Comfortable space with check-in ready amenities. Would book again!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"The only part about this stay that upset me was the fact that I couldn’t stay longer. In the one night I stayed here, I managed to feel more at home than I did anywhere else during my trip to Houston. I loved how cute this place was, the bed was super comfortable and the shower was a perfect end to a long and stressful day. Highly recommend!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rebeca was very attentive and was pretty quick at responding to messages.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place ❤️
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had a nice time here. Bed was super comfortable, and the whole place felt very homey. Note that if you do book here make sure you either bring a small heater or warm clothes because the first floor is absolutely freezing, especially this time of year. Also note that the staircase is basically a ladder, it's extremely steep. Overall, would book again!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was quaint and cozy as pictured in the listing. It was very home-y and comfortable. Just the perfect spot for my staycation!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Where to begin…. This tiny house was our favorite place to stay while visiting Texas. It was full of character and beautifully decorated. The shower alone was worth every penny. The steps going up to the bedroom were fun and always made me smile while going up or down them. Loved this place and would recommend to anyone.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely a cute and exotic getaway, the stairs are not for the clumsy though: BEWARE.
Loved the shower, and the humidifiers that were out for me. Would recommend"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rebecca was super nice and helpful during our stay!! Nice little place with everything you could need.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We booked this place after we had some flight issues at the last min. Rebeca responded immediately and was very helpful and considerate. The place is really great very clean and comfortable. Not much around and as in the description smaller. Which we actually found really lovely. Close to the airport if you’re in transit. All in all Rebeca is a great host and I would highly recommend this place.
2022-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice place and for a pretty good price

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was perfect for two people. It was clean and neat. The neighborhood was beautiful and everything was pretty close to the stores.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,I tried searching for the entrance of this beautiful tiny home when it was already dark. I was unable to locate it and Rebecca was extremely helpful.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,A perfect spot to rest before the long trip.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a cute little place with a treehouse feel. The stairs going up to the bedroom are nearly vertical, so beware if you have trouble climbing regular stairs, as these are very steep. We thought it was fun! The decor is really lovely. The kitchen was well equipped and even had coffee and tea selections available. The shower has several different sprayers, which made it feel like a luxury hotel. The instructions on how to access the place were very clear and we appreciated that we could check in late."
2022-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The place is ok. Very tiny as described. Will do for no more than two. Has everything needed in the kitchen if you plan to cook.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"great stay! place as pictured; bed is super cozy and shower/restroom are very spacious. only critique would be that it’s a bit tricky to get up and down the stairs, especially when it’s been raining out and it’s more slippery. but other than that, enjoyed the stay! have stayed at a few of this host’s properties, and would love to stay again"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,First time trying an air bnb and ill definitely be booking again.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"beautiful stay, nice and cozy, friendly area!"
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The house was cute and cozy. It was like walking into tj maxx. The stairs were kinda scary! A lot of bible verses used as decoration. To each their own.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This is the perfect spot to stay before catching a flight. We will certainly stay again.
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,My friend and I had a great stay here! We were seeing a concert at the Toyota Center. The drive was about 30-40 min during heavy traffic times. The area was residential and quiet so it felt safe. Thank you to Rebeca for the clear communication and comfortable stay!
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,I was in Houston for a conference and this veryncute tiny house was the perfect place. The place is very nicely decorated and the atmosphere was pleasantly peaceful. Rebecca was very responsive to my needs and even checked on me to make sure I was ok. My favorite part of my stay was the shower. It was heavenly! I absolutely loved it. It is a tiny house and you will need to be able to climb ladder-like stairs to the bedroom and bath. I would definitely recommend it. It was a very uniquely fun place to stay. I am very glad I did.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect stay! Comfortable and great value!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great home, great host. Had an excellent stay!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The airbnb was very nice & clean! However, there was a strong smell when I came into the airbnb that you do have to get used to. It was just as advertised and the pictures are very accurate. The best part was definitely the showers, with three different shower head types. It was a very relaxing stay."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very unique and fun to experience. Bathroom is very nice!

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great spot for a great price!!! Privacy was great even with other Airbnb’s in the same location. Host made sure to give enough privacy to each guest! Very adorable touches to the house! I loved it!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rebecca’s tiny home is adorable. Parking is easy and it’s a great value. The lofted bedroom is cozy and it feels like an adventure to get up there. We were glad we’re relatively young and fit as the stairwell up there is narrow and steep. I would recommend staying here!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This was exactly what I need for my trip
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely cute and cozy place and I’ll definitely stay again when I’m in Houston!

2022-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"Cute space! TV was a smart one, comfy couch. I do warn you that the stairs are a bit scary but the railings make it a lot easier (just go slow and you’ll be fine). Also free street parking!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome! Amazing! Quiet and peaceful. Out of the noise from downtown but not TOO far if you want to go hang out down there. Had an amazing weekend and wish I would have booked for longer! Especially considering the price CANT BEAT IT

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a great tiny space! It was perfect in every way. Rebeca was amazing and quickly responded to any questions we had. The house has three separate living spaces that were also occupied but we never heard a sound from anyone. The bed was very comfortable and we lounged in it too long. We hope to stay there again soon.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This tiny house was one of the best accommodations we had on our road trip through Texas. Rebeca is a really good host and fulfilled all our wishes. The tiny house had everything we needed. The interior design was absolutely beautiful. We enjoyed our stay very much!!! Highly recommended!!!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great host !
2022-05-01,4,Stayed one night,Very cute and clean house! Very friendly host. Needs better explanation of proximity to things around its location.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was wonderful about our stay at The Hideout. We had everything we needed. Despite a last minute unexpected plumbing emergency in our unit, Rebecca provided us with an alternative on the same property."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This beautiful home was perfect for my weekend stay. The bed was comfortable and the entire place very clean. We had no issues checking in/out and any issues that we did have were very minor and Rebeca responded immediately. Will stay again, 10/10 do recommend."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"a perfect hideaway, I'll definitely be rebooking : )"
2022-05-01,4,Stayed one night,"I really enjoyed our stay! It was very well decorated and a great layout of the space. I do think it was a great value but there were a few things that disappointed me about this listing:
1) the house was a new build in a calm neighborhood of old brick ranches and it stuck out like a sore thumb
2) we were hoping to doordash some food to the airbnb while we got ready for our event and there were no restaurants around us (just fast-food and gas stations)
3) there was a smell in the space that they were attempting to remedy with air purifiers and air fragrances. We got used to it once inside but upon first entering, it was off-putting.
All in all, it is a good space but i thought it might be helpful to know the negatives so you can decide if those are important to you."
