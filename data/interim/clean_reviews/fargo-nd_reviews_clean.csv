2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We traveled from Connecticut with just carry on bags and the house was fully stocked with anything you could possibly need.
We were very comfortable in the house."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jessica's ""Blue Tub"" home was a wonderful stay for my wife and I during our visit to Fargo. The check in was seamless and the home was clean with lots of fun little extras. We are very fortunate to have such a great location to stay in Fargo and would gladly recommend this Airbnb to others."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Highly recommend staying at Jessica’s place! Very clean! And it was nice to have some snacks and water provided. Would definitely stay here again!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"the place was great, confortable and clean.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jessica is a great host. The house presents as listed. The house is well stocked and tidy.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great little house in North Fargo. Nice complementary local candies and snacks were available. Close to the airport, in quiet leafy street. Exactly what I needed to stay while I visited my niece for a couple of days."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, kind host, and there were great touches around the space. So glad there was a hair dryer and some toiletries that we forgot!!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jessica is a wonderful host. Very accommodating and has a quick response time. The location is perfect if you’re looking for something close to downtown and FargoDome. Jessica thought of every detail and the home is so cozy and cute!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying here on a trip to Fargo for a Bison football game. The house was clean and the neighborhood was quiet - despite being close to campus and following a big win from the football team. Jessica left a full assortment of amenities (which came in handy for my severe last minute underpacking). We can’t wait to stay again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home, comfortable and clean and Jessica is someone who makes you feel very good!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a very nice stay here in Fargo. Jessica provided every amenity one could hope for, and more than I've ever seen in an Airbnb. Her place is very comfortable and close to both NDSU and downtown!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time in Fargo and Jessica's place made our time even better! We traveled with our 8 month old baby and Jessica didn't leave her out of the accommodations. When we got to the Airbnb, there was a pack and play set up, baby treats, a baby gate and even baby supplies waiting! Jessica is a fantastic host. Thank you!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you, Jessica, for an amazing stay, We loved everything about your home. We can't wait to come back!! We 🩵 the bluetub!!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place with a convenient location! Thanks for letting us stay!
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Fit our needs, could use some paint and a little extra TLC on details but overall was clean and the neighborhood was good and safe. Close to campus and the Fargodome."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was everything think the pictures showed I love the vintage theme very cool space and it was quite in the area and not to far from downtown
2024-05-01,4,Stayed over a week,The accommodations were eceptible. The only draw back was first the washing machine was out of order. Replaced that and then the dryer didn't work and still doesn't.
2024-04-01,3,Stayed with kids,The apartment was cute and clean and looked like the pictures. The building is a little run down and sometimes you could hear the neighbors. Noah responded quickly to questions.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Noah was a great host! He was always responsive, helpful, and communicated with us when anything came up."
2023-12-01,3,Stayed about a week,A average quite place
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Noah's place served our needs well; we were not disappointed.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,it's a great place at a walkable distance from the NDSU. It's worth the money 💰 highly recommended.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,AMAZING
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks Noah! We had a great time!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Noah’s is great host!!!
Definitely we will come back, the property is beautiful and close for anything!!"
2023-10-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"I selected my original apartment so I could cook but while on route I was notified I would be checked into a different apartment. Upon arrival I was displeased instantly and no kitchen table. It was not cozy at all. Decorated somewhat nice, but I would never have selected this unit for me and my family. Noah did acknowledge my concern and compensated some, but it just did not fit my needs."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Noah is great hosting, definitely the best!!!"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Generally, old but nice and clean. Due to the aircon in the open windows it was a bit loud and the rooms where due to the wheather change quite cold (aircon in the windows - and so the cold air came inside)."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I have had pleasant experiences but Noah's attention was great, without a doubt he is a super host, the property is beautiful and has everything you need, we really enjoyed our stay, we will definitely return. He was always attentive, proactive and helpful."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Noah’s listing was perfect for our week long work trip. Had everything we needed to be comfortable. Very relaxing and in an area surrounded by restaurants.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very neat place. My favorite thing about the apartment was the record player. Very excited about that and did use it as well. Other thing I loved was the books in all the rooms, added a very nice touch to the place"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Would definitely stay again.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed about a week,Comfortable and convenient to downtown and ndsu
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Noah’s apartment is a nice space, and I would definitely stay again!
There were lots of really thoughtful touches, like pre-filled ice cube trays and extra blankets. The space was clean and charming, and the bed was comfortable. Noah was very responsive and a great host! It was also close to downtown, which was very nice.
There were limited parking spots one night, but we were able to find one. The other days, parking was no issue at all. We could occasionally hear neighbors (especially those upstairs at night, as well as some outside the window during the day), but that wasn’t a big deal.
Overall a great stay, thank you Noah!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Everything worked, had everything we needed, no complaints."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,It’s a great place
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great cozy apartment. Staying for work so not there much but it fit what I was looking for.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, easy to find and plenty of parking. Close to the college and downtown. Noah responds quickly and is really nice."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Last minute booking followed by quick and clear and friendly communication. Easy checkin. Thanks!
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment on the outside was pretty old looking, but the inside was very cute and comfortable. Only complaint was that there was no air conditioning installed and it was pretty hot. I think that could have been checked before, but the host responded promptly to fix the issue, however I will admit it was inconvenient for maintenance to come in and install it. I would recommend this place for the value, price and comfort."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As described, Noah is spot on with the communication. Walking distance to NDSU, this place is all about location. It’s clean and comfortable, definitely older building but everything works just fine and it’s easy in and out."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Thanks Noah for a peaceful place
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Noah thanks for hosting us. The locations was perfect for access to downtown Fargo. Your communication was great.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The place was great and cozy. Would recommend for anyone, great location near downtown and quiet building. 10/10 recommend."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Was definitely adorable place
Felt like coming home and didn’t want to leave
Definitely is better than a hotel as it’s more comfortable and cozy and warm compared to the commercial feel of renting a hotel room
Would definitely do that again
So reasonable
I love the decor
Parking was a slight issue but the cute cozy home vibe made it so worth it
Thank you for a great experience
I don’t want to rent a hotel again since I experienced the coziness of this !!
Thank you again"
2023-02-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The whole building runs on one heating unit in the basement of the building for all 4(?) units… if one apartment chooses HOT youre HOT and nice versa with not enough heat… however… no matter how hot the rest of the apartment would get, the back bedroom kicked our cold air all day… our first 2 days there was -35 with windchill outside, so the first night we couldn’t sleep in back bedroom and then the 2nd night we did but froze with temps in the 30’s to 40’s in back bedroom…
The door to enter the apartment from the back parking lot does not latch properly and other times jams… we left for work one day, shut door, turned key to lock and then twisted and pulled on handle to make sure shut, we then came home that night to the back door hanging wide open(-35 outside) so all of our belongings were wide open for anyone to come in and take and COLD air came in all day… the house had charm and Noah did respond but always with a “thanks we will look into it” rather than a solution"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, comfortable home and Noah is a very nice and responsive host. I would stay there again for sure."
2023-02-01,3,Stayed with kids,Cute touches like a record player but very cold bedrooms and smelly carpet.
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious, quaint and charming old style 2 bedroom apartment. Perfect for our needs. Lots of parking options. Love the two separate entrances. Will stay there again if in the area!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Good location. Cant beat the price!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great
2023-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,Cute vintage decor and we felt right at home! Was the perfect solution for my family of four!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I loved our stay here. There were so many little comforts that made our stay fantastic, i.e.: ice cube trays filled, soft throws in all the rooms, soft lighting in addition to bright overhead lighting. We were so comfortable, we barely left the apartment. Noah was so responsive and helpful. I would highly recommend this property and this host."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was as advertised. Great comfortable stay
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very communicative and easy to coordinate with. Thanks, Noah!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice place, quiet, clean and as described. Thanks for hosting us :)"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Was a good stay, Noah was very quick responding and quick to solve our issues as well. Very good host!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Noah’s! He was extremely responsive and accommodating. We had a small issue and he helped resolve it right away!
The only downside of the place is it’s an old apartment building so you can hear people talking and moving around in the other units. Otherwise it’s a great apartment for the price and location!"
2022-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,very nice I was put in a nicer place than I paid for
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Cold heat doesn't do anything
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Pictures matched the actual space. Full set of amenities.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host! Everything went smooth! Would definitely stay here again!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,great spot. wonderful communication
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,our stay went good. the place was clean n beautiful! we would definitely stay again
2022-09-01,4,Stayed one night,Nice Location and easy to find. Perfect instructions
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little two bedroom apartment. Reminds me of home.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and a very cute apartment. Was clean and comfortable .
2022-08-01,3,Stayed one night,"I’m going to start by saying we ended up having a good stay. The situation/price could have been better. You can hear people talking through the walls in adjoining apartments. Outside our bedroom window we heard loud talking in Spanish until a little after midnight and obviously noise that was coming from something being moved around on metal…At one point, I opened the curtain and was very surprised to see two guys sitting in the back of a pickup less than 2 feet from bedroom window and one of them looking directly at me. This was about a half hour before they finally went inside. It didn’t seem to bother them at all that they were obviously keeping us up. This isn’t Noah’s fault, but it was a bit creepy. The other thing is that the total cost was I think slightly over $150, which would have given me a very nice hotel chain type room that’s up to date instead of a dated house that I could hear everyone around me through the walls. By the time you get service fees, cleaning fees, Air bnb fees, etc, the price exceeds the value at $150+
The pros? Noah is very responsive and great at communicating to let you know where the place is and how to get in, where to park. The place was clean, and did not smell. You had everything you need and a full size fridge and bathroom supplies. Noah doesn’t control how much Air bnb takes and he has to make a living as well. Location was good and parking was convenient."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great apartment! We enjoyed our stay in Fargo!
2022-08-01,4,Stayed one night,Nice place older building but clean. Location good & communication good. Extra side door nice to have. One bed really really hard.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay here! We felt the amenities and condition of the home matched the price well. We ran into one minor issue with check in and Noah was prompt at responding. We would stay again.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay and great location by campus and fargo dome. Walking distance
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Charming small but spacious home 😍
2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice and convenient with private parking
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a great spot for our family to stay over for one night. Noah is an excellent communicator and a wonderful host. He responded to my short-notice request in record time and was so kind & accommodating.
The apartment building is a bit dingy, but don’t be put-off as the apartment itself is welcoming, very clean, and super cute."
2022-06-01,3,Stayed one night,"Pros:
-beds were very comfy
-cute decor
-host responded in a timely way
-good location
Cons:
-shower & dishes + more minor things not clean
-pictures of space were misleading (cleanliness, quality)
-minor amenities not accurate
There were some significant cleanliness issues we didn’t see until the morning. Noah was quick to respond and offer solutions. However, with our time frame we didn’t want to wait around for the cleaning people and decided it was better for us to check out a day early."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,great apartment...near ndsu.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,I loved this bnb! All the basics were supplied so I didn't have to worry. The rooms were very comfortable and the wifi worked great! I would recommend this bnb for any stay in the area!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very convenient location…free laundry
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"beautiful, stylish, and very function. perfect place for a long stay."
2022-04-01,4,Stayed about a week,Easy check in with lockbox…not sure what brand mattress they have on the beds but I slept very comfortably the whole night. It was convenient to where I was working. Smart TVs in all the rooms!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,He is awesome
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Overall great experience! The apartment was so cute and clean. Noah was a great communicator the entire time.
2021-11-01,4,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. Pretty vintage apartment but is nice and spacious for a few guests.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place!! Everything is as described. Would stay again.
2021-11-01,3,Stayed about a week,Exceptional location and a good value for what you get.
2021-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We arrived in a snow storm and the place was homey and warm! 😊
2021-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,This is a super cozy little spot!
2021-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"As advertised. Needed to request lockbox code day of check in. Also, please note, there is a back door to enter as well. Please make sure BOTH doors are locked."
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Cute place that’s kept tidy and stocked! Close parking, which isn’t always so in a city. We had a pleasant/comfortable stay and definitely recommend."
2021-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"Decor was very pretty, overall condition of the place was pretty 'meh'. Never received check-in, or check-out instructions, but the host gave them to me after a couple phone calls. We had a good stay, seems like a lot of young folks living there and it was homecoming, so pretty roudy, but all in all, a fine stay."
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The home is overall cozy and warm. There was no AC even tho the listing said there was, I didn’t receive instructions about how to get in or about the Wi-Fi password so I had to reach out about multiple issues, but as long as it’s not the middle of summer this is a quaint little apartment. Thank you."
2021-10-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Noah was great, quick to communicate and answer my questions. The place had what you could want (kitchen gadgets, toiletries, Amazon prime etc). Really cute vintage decor/vibe."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Noah's place is really warm and comfortable. There was a minor issue at check-in, but he communicated well and got it sorted out quickly."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We absolutely loved staying here. We felt right at home and hope to stay again sometime soon.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cons first: one bedroom doesn't buffer traffic noises well, the AC turns on quite loud, some minor cleanliness issues like stains on couches, dust, mold stains, peeling paint, and appliances having bits of food residue.
That being said we would happily stay there again since the Pros outweighed the Cons. This is a lovely small home with tons of natural sunlight. Pull down blinds still give the option for total privacy. The fenced-in yard was perfumed with their blossoming trees and had a fire pit and lighted outdoor dining area. The arcade machine with over 1000 games was a huge hit with our young son. Though small the interior is styled very well with many separate places to spend time either alone or as a family. A game cupboard was stocked with several puzzles and card games. We all had a great night's sleep in the comfy bed! 9.5/10 overall"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very tidy and lovely home in a great location. Callie is a great host and provides everything one could possibly need for comfortable stay. She included a wonderful guide of local favorites which is always appreciated. We had a great stay and would recommend it to anyone!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cozy and beautiful home with well thought out features and amenities. The backyard is a gem and was great for our kids. We will definitely have this spot on the top of our list next time we are in the area!
2024-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Overall great place, beautiful interior and amenities! The location was close to the places we wanted to go, but it is beside a busy street and we heard a lot of traffic noise."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Great accommodations.
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,"I was able to rent this Airbnb for my sister’s bachelorette party! It was a beautiful home, great location, and had a great backyard! The host was welcoming, responsive, and so helpful! We had s’mores and even went to some of the suggested locations the host provided! It was a central locations for many cute boutiques, restaurants, and coffee shops! I definitely recommend!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The Bungalow was great all around!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful home, nice fenced in yard. Was perfect for my family weekend away in Fargo for a wedding! The hosts were extremely welcoming and responsive. There recommendations were on point and the house was super adorable."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Description was spot on, instructions for check in were crystal clear! Home was super clean & tidy. Location is excellent for getting to area restaurants, night spots, NDSU area & downtown Fargo/Moorhead. We needed a pet friendly place & this fit the bill excellently. Will keep this on our list for future trips to Fargo/Moorhead."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I wish I had an Olive of my own! This house was so beautifully renovated. We felt right at home, beds and blankets and pillows were wonderful and created a peaceful nights rest! Kitchen had everything we needed to make home cooked meals for our daughter who attends NDSU. We enjoyed playing all the games and playing in the private fenced in backyard with our puppies ￼! We look forward to staying here again, and again, and again ￼!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We met in Fargo to have family time and a homey atmosphere was much better than trying to be comfortable in a hotel.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay here! When we arrived a smoke detector was beeping low battery and hosts were quick to bring us a new battery. Basement ceilings are low, but our kids loved being down there!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome location and beautiful house! It was a great place to stay!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Convenient and cute, especially easy for pets."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Cute little bungalow that met all of our needs for a long weekend.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed the night with our 4 year old, 6 year old and 5 month old. We felt right at home and appreciated how incredibly clean and organized it was! The space was so cozy and I told my husband I could spend an entire day drinking tea and reading books on the green couch! Our kids loved the arcade games and it was nice to be able to access our streaming service as well. We also appreciated the recommendation to KidsCo! We went there and it was a great experience! We have stayed at a lot of airbnbs and this was by far my best experience!"

2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"We had a terrific stay at Olive Bungalow! It was just as pictured and described with everything the 5 of us needed for our weekend visit to Fargo for our daughter’s graduation. We especially appreciate Callie’s quick response to questions, the delicious and local coffee we were able to make fresh each morning, and the space we had for spending time together! Thank you to our hosts!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Felt right at home and enjoyed my time here. Great layout and very accommodating

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is our home away home right now and it has been a favorite with my family!
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"We rented this house to have a family Thanksgiving and it was amazing! It was clean, cozy, and very well stocked. We had a couple questions, and the hosts were friendly, communicative, and very fast to respond. The can-opener was missing (which they were unaware of), and they had a new one to us so quickly, which was unbelievable!
We could not have asked for a better weekend! I would highly recommend this house to anyone looking to stay in the area. If we do this again, we will definitely be coming back!"
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"This is the place!! Callie’s place was clean, convenient, and cozy. There were through full amenities in every corner and attention to detail was 11/10.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay in fargo at Callie’s property, we would definitely stay again if we were in the area! We loved the backyard for our furry friend and was a great space for multiple couples!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I have stayed at a lot of AirBnbs over the years, and this was a favorite! It was comfortable and had enough space for three people to have some privacy if they wanted. Very stylishly decorated with many thoughtful touches! We were just passing through for the night, but we all wished we had planned an extra day in Fargo just so we could stay here another night!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Older home that was beautifully renovated. Cute home with everything you need. The only complaint we had was that there was a lot of traffic noice at night right outside the bedroom. It didn’t bother my husband or son but woke me up a few times.
Otherwise the place was great for what we were looking for."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful place to call home for a few days! Wonderful inside and out! Enough space to spread out to allow for privacy. Really enjoyed having a second bathroom and a second living room in the basement. Loved the private fenced in backyard with a fire pit and decorative lights! So many thoughtful touches! Will definitely rent again for future trips to Fargo/Moorhead!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My friends and I absolutely loved our time at this beautiful home. We came back for Concordia homecoming and found the location perfect for getting to campus and for visiting downtown Fargo. The house was clean and beautifully decorated.

We created great memories sitting out on the front porch with the string lights and watching movies in the comfortable living room. The kitchen had everything we needed to make quick and easy meals at home. The neighborhood is very quaint and was in a great location for getting to downtown Fargo. I hope we get the chance to come and stay at this rental again the next time we visit the FM area."

The kitchen had plenty of dishes and cooking utensils so it was easy to make food there rather than having to eat out or bring our own stuff. We would love to stay here again in the future."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Went to fargo for Dune 2 release and never liked staying at hotels although this looked far away interstate made drive 10mins to theater. And the place itself was very cozy and being on gold corse and a full moon that night made it feel like I wasn’t in a city

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Reina’s house was perfect. We had 3 families from out of town (7 people) who stayed. Then we served Thanksgiving dinner for 17 people.

It really made my day and this is a remarkable selling point. It was so nice to be able to book this at the last minute, and get rest from the highway. I can't say enough about this. THIS - An unprecedented positive & hospitality-supported check-in experience at AirBNB so I am revelling in it because it meant that much to me at the time which was the midnight hour. I so appreciate it! I wish more hosts did a flexible check-in, and also handle it with maturity and grace & hospitality. It was EXACTLY what I needed. Perfect."

Peaceful backyard overlooking a golf course with a small lake. About a five minute drive from restaurants where we could pick up takeout after a long drive from Wisconsin.
Reina was responsive and kind— she even had the carpets deep cleaned right before we got there because I was worried about my son’s allergies. We also appreciated being able to park our car in the garage. We really were only there overnight and left early the next morning, but I would stay there again—-"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a great place and a great value for a small extended family stay. We stayed for one night, so we didn't really use the kitchen much, but everything was clean, comfortable, and easy to use. It was a very nice perk that there were no complicated checkout instructions to read or follow - just lock the door and check out!
There were a couple minor things we were wishing for (sweetener for the coffee, or a deck of cards to play a game), but overall we were grateful for all that was provided! Now, the oven did start the bottom of our take-and-bake pizza on fire somehow... we've never had that happen before, but it was an adventure - worked out okay. Not sure if it was the oven, or if we somehow did something wrong - just bake carefully!
Reina was very responsive, and accommodating - thank you! :)"

2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"Great place to stay, beds are super comfy. Not a lot of seating to relax but if you aren’t hanging out there you won’t even notice. Despite the seating I would still highly recommend, awesome place to get a quiet, great nights sleep!!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Reina was a great host and the place worked out perfectly for our stay!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was wonderful. The house was exactly as the photos showed and described. Plenty of space for a family of 6 to spread out and relax after a day out and about. Reina was very responsive to any questions I had leading up to the stay and while there. Will definitely be staying again the next time I am in the area. Highly recommend.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved staying here! A wonderful house, in a great neighborhood, and very convenient to everything we needed in the Fargo-Moorhead area. We were just up for a short stay, but will definitely look to stay here again next time we are back! Reina was very helpful and quick to get in touch with us."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Was so nice home very quiet
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful. That is the best word to describe our stay! Everything was as described and more. The house is in a very nice, quiet neighborhood. We’re just sorry we weren’t able to enjoy the yard due to the amount of snow! Will definitely stay again, and highly recommend."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful place! So fresh and clean! Comfortable beds!
2023-03-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Reina’s place was clean and nice. The house is in a neighborhood just off the main highways which makes it convenient to local restaurants and necessities. The only negative thing I would have to say is that the security camera that is stated “at entrance” is actually inside of the home by the entrance doors.
We did contact our host about this and she was very responsive in explaining that it’s for security purposes of people entering in the home but it did make us feel slightly uncomfortable that it was physically inside of the house. Other than that, the house/ stay was great for my family and I."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Reina’s place is awesome! Very clean and comfortable and nice neighborhood. Felt right at home the minute we walked in and definitely will come back to stay.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"we ended staying during a blizzard! Reina took great care us by clearing snow and making sure we could get out if we needed. she was also understanding and accommodating with a late check out since the bad weather lasted into the day we were supposed to leave.
The only thing I didn't pay attention to in the listing is that the TV isn't included. so be sure to bring a book or play games. Beds were comfortable. A great house for a decent price."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay as well as an excellent host! I highly recommend this place to anyone coming to the area!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you Reina for a comfortable stay and your willing to help with anything we needed!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Reina’s place is the perfect resting spot. Away from the hustle and bustle of the city, but just blocks away from anything you need. Her decor is welcoming and the linens and beds are SO comfortable! The kids toys, fan, and space heater were a welcomed addition we aren’t used to in most Airbnb’s. Having the closest sleep to home always requires a fan!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing home, perfect for a little get away, great value, good location, very comfortable"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Reina’s place was such a great value! The home was more than enough for one person. It was very clean and had everything I needed. I slept in one of the rooms downstairs - it got a little chilly at night, but I just grabbed an extra blanket and that solved the problem. Reina was very responsive. If I were to ever visit Moorhead again, I would definitely stay again."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect space, and amenities as described. Heat worked really well, which was great for the cold Minnesota winter. The bed was comfortable. The water pressure was perfect. Clean. Comfortable."
2023-02-01,3,Stayed with kids,Renia’s place was clean but not very comfortable. There were not enough places to sit and did not have a comfortable feel. There were too many air fresheners around the home and made it hard to breathe. Also the heat did not work properly as the basement was too cold and the upstairs level was too hot. Would not stay here again.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Cozy and clean house in a quiet neighborhood. Great place to stay.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great house with a lot of room. Pet friendly which is a must for us.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a beautiful and welcoming home! Exceptionally clean and we loved the layout! I’m really jealous of the kitchen cabinets. :) It is located in a really quiet neighborhood but a quick drive to businesses.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had such an amazing Thanksgiving weekend at Patrick’s homes, four families came together from 3 states and there was awesome space to spread out. We loved utilizing the garage for older kids with the games, and there were plenty of toys appropriate for all ages- and we had them newborn- to 18, even the adults were taking part in basketball challenges! Everything was clean, well maintained, and thoughtfully decorated. We would definitely book it again if the opportunity arises! Thank you for your speedy response time to all our questions- and providing a beautiful space for our families to make memories!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We very much enjoyed our stay. We had a wide range of ages 7 months to 88yrs and the accommodations worked for all. From start to finish everything went smoothly. Patrick made sure we were well taken care of.

We were able to have a quiet side in the evenings when the kids went to bed while card games kept going on the opposite side. In the morning we flip flopped so the kids could have fun while the later risers slept in. The kitchens were perfect for preparing and serving food - we had everything we needed for simple food prep.
The patio and deck areas were awesome for hanging out, too.
Patrick was super pleasant and we throughly enjoyed our stay."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Patrick is the most thoughtful, gracious host! And we are very happy his property Ultimate Gathering Pad. Massive 8 bdrm, 6 bath! was available for a whole week, which is a rare luck!
Our team of 15 yo boys, ice-hockey players, who came to Fargo for 4 weeks to practice their skills at the camp, had a fantastic time at Patrick's house! It is very convenient and comfortable, boys spent time in one half of the house and adults could enjoy some peace and rest in the other. The kitchen is very well equipped and stocked and had everything for daily cooking for 12-14 people - it was very important for us. We hope our next time trip to Fargo won't be in the same dates with Wrestling tournament and we'll be able to reserve Patrick's house for the whole period of our stay. Thank you!
P.S. Playstation was a great idea, so we had to buy one when we moved to a different property ))"

Great hot water situation throughout the property.
Love the coffee and tea selections!
Love their inspirational wall decor. Thermostat was locked for temp adjustment. Maybe request for host to unlock while guests are there?
Overall both sides were very nice. Loved the deck and sitting outside Sunday morning for a bit. The ramps on both sides are helpful for post-marathon runners. Great location - everything was a short drive from the house. Neighborhood was nice and quiet as well."

2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"The hosts were exceptional! I had asked if I could use the BBQ grill. Apparently, there wasn't one, BUT they immediately offered to purchase one and it was available for use. This was such a nice add for the many meals we prepared at the location.

There is every convenience in the home that you would need. The hot tub was wonderful. If Brittons home is available the next time we are in town, I would definitely stay again!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The space is a fun and unique loft-like experience in the heart of Fargo. Enjoyed good food and drinks close by. Parked in the ramp to avoid street parking pitfalls, but streets could have been just as easy. Space was spotless and well appointed. Clean bathroom, linens, and kitchen. Ambience was great - nice vibe for downtown Fargo. Got a bit noisy on the street below, but that's to be expected on a Friday night!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you’re looking for a downtown location, you can’t get a better spot than this. The suite was comfortable, nicely decorated, and clean. I didn’t have any problem with street noise, other than a few exceptionally loud vehicles. I spent a Monday night and the weather was such that the windows were closed, so I can’t state what a weekend experience might"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Very accommodating and convenient
2024-03-01,3,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was very neat and clean how ever it’s very noisy from traffic on broadway and people bar hopping into the night

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at this location was EXCEPTIONAL!!!
Hosts are EXTREMELY responsive and answer any and all questions that you may have.
Location is STUNNING, easy to access and right down town! Tons of restaurants and shops within walking distance.
Photos of location are accurate to real life and look exactly as pictured! The kitchen is VERY well stocked and has everything you may need.
Additionally, they included special touches such as ear plugs next to the bed, all the cleaning product you may need, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and body wash. All of which were greatly appreciated!
***One thing I do wanna note to future guests, which has nothing to do with the wonderful hosts… being this location is RIGHT downtown - know ahead of time that it will be very loud and noisy outside until the wee hours of the morning. Especially on Saturday evening.
I highly recommend this unit and the hosts!
10/10!"
2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely little apartment downtown Fargo. Close to coffee shops, restaurants, shopping."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second stay in Paige's place in Fargo. Last year when I checked out I knew I'd be back again this year for an annual event and I planned to book this place again. I love the size which is just right for 2 people. The location is perfect and walkable to anything that you need: restaurants of all kinds, coffee, theater across the street, etc. It's very clean and I love the style and feel.
It's easy in and easy out. Parking is simple if you look at the signs. Paige provides plenty of info on the area if you need it. Love the downtown feel."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Walkable to restaurants good scenery nice windows to look out of. Cozy neat place

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,The stay was great. The place was comfy and perfect for a weekend getaway. Everything was close And paige was A wonderful host who worked with me.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"this is a nice apartment
it was exactly like the photos, very clean, and hosts were extremely responsive"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Super nice place to stay. Cool downtown spot with literally at least a dozen restaurants within 100 yards.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,The noise level from the main strip was pretty loud until about 12-1am but other than that the stay was great. Just a heads up if you are a light sleeper!! Looks just like the pictures and is very centrally located. Fargo is such a fun town!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful apartment! Very clean and well managed.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Paige’s apartment in downtown Fargo was the perfect place to stay for a couple of nights while visiting from out of town.
Downtown Fargo has amazing shops and restaurants, all a short walk away.
Beyond Running/Outer Most Layer was a great find for shopping and my meal at Pounds was delicious!
Thank you the Paige for all the wonderfully helpful proactive communication. I will definitely stay again when I am back through Fargo!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Paige was really easy to work with. The place was clean and inviting. Great location right in the heart of downtown.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Paige’s unit was a perfect spot for our too-brief intro to Fargo. Comfortable, elegant, and functional, and literally in the center of historic downtown. Our only note for potential visitors (not really a complaint, since it’s the nature of the beast) is that Main Street is just outside the window, which can be a little noisy on busy evenings. This being the case, Paige helpfully provides earplugs in the bedroom :) Thanks again, Paige et al!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great downtown spot!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing! Views of Broadway, wonderful setting, and all the amenities you need. Staying here was an awesome experience. Can’t wait to come back!"

2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,Paige’s place is perfectly located in downtown Fargo. Great bars and restaurants. Keep in mind this comes with a little street noise along with some pop up musicians. Just plan to stay up and enjoy it.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved this place! Beautiful, clean, and right downtown. It was a little rowdy outside on the strip but I liked it. Loved the live music a block over at the pavilion area. I would definitely stay again!!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect Location for walking around and exploring. Because of the location, you will get street noise but that shouldn’t come as a surprise for a place where you can so easily just walk down a set of stairs and have coffee, food, drinks, and entertainment within feet of you.
The place itself is cozy but clean and nice and has just enough funky to be fun. Again, the windows are right out to Broadway so they are great for people watching with your morning coffee or a nightcap.
Self check-in had perfect instructions and the guidebook had QR codes for menus. We just Ubered in and we’re able to walk to everything. The price is perfectly reasonable. It was perfect for the trip we had planned."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a great little apartment in a perfect bustling area of downtown. Lots of cute shops and restaurants within a two block radius, as well as a wonderful movie theater. I loved the natural light from the big windows, the exposed brick, and the easy check-in/check out. Definitely recommend!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the location for people-watching, listening to street musicians, and walking to shops and restaurants. The furniture was comfortable and the space was attractive and cozy. Had some troubles with the lock, but was my fault. She sent someone within minutes to help. We'll definitely try to stay here again for a weekend away. Thanks again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for a short work visit to the area. Plenty of walkable restaurants and coffee shops. Safe, clean, and with a beautiful view of the Fargo Theatre."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Paige's space was excellent. We enjoyed the location in Fargo and the space is quite useful. There is enough in the kitchen if you wanted to cook your meals. There are many places to get a meal right outside the space. Downtown is noisy with people, but it quieted down at 10pm and we got a good night's sleep. Paige was great at communication. I would definitely stay here again when I visit Fargo."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a chic and comfortable apartment! I have seen it on Airbnb before while visiting Fargo, but never had the opportunity to stay here. I am so glad I finally did! Convenient to restaurants and coffee shops. Historic theater right across the street. Easy to find the apartment and clear instructions. Very responsive host. Comfy bed and pillows."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Another great visit to Fargo and a stay at Paige’s lovely place. We enjoyed exploring town and resting well on the really comfy bed. Honestly, we were not bothered by street noise. Great place to stay!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the 2nd apartment of Paiges’s we have stayed at and it was great and will be staying again. Super quick to respond and downtown is a neat place.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Paige’s place is conveniently located in the heart of downtown Fargo with great restaurants, coffee shops and Broadway Square only a short walk away. It’s a great stop while visiting NDSU or Concordia Moorehead. I enjoyed the charming, yet updated artsy vibe."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"we really liked it. it was clean, very close to everything. worth the money."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you want to be in the middle of it all in a trendy loft space, this is it! Perfect space for two with great views of downtown Fargo. Many walking options for coffee, food, shopping and drinks. It can get noisy in the evenings, but ear plugs are provided, and if you're a good sleeper it won't be a problem at all. Nothing within the host's control, but be aware there were several homeless people and many of them approached us or made comments as we passed. It was uncomfortable at times, but nothing that would stop us from staying here again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great Place! Ideal Host! So peaceful yet a ton of restaurants, coffeehouses and art-related things right out the door. If there is a better place to stay in Fargo I don’t know it, and I’ve stated there over a hundred nights over the course of 15 years. Can’t recommend this highly enough! Paige is a superb host that was excellent on all fronts! Book right away!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Overall awesome experience. Love that downtown feel!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the location of this apartment in downtown Fargo. Walking distance to lots of fabulous shops, cafes, bars, and restaurants. Pay attention to the parking information that is clearly spelled out by the host. I can see where this would be noisy on weekends but we were there Sunday through Tuesday nights and all was calm by 11:00 p.m. each night. Clear and helpful instructions provided by Paige and I would definitely book with her again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place at the center of town. Tons of activities nearby and all the basics inside. The street parking was highly time restricted, which meant frequently moving the car or paying for garage parking."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved it. Would stay again.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a great night at Paige's place in downtown Fargo. Slept very well in the comfy bed and didn't have to worry about where to park thanks to her clear instructions. Will stay again!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This loft is a real gem in the heart of downtown Fargo. It was easy to check in/out, and I loved being able to walk everywhere. The space is really beautiful - high ceilings, original wood, minimal aesthetic, Broadway view, plus lamps and string lights for dim lighting options.
Broadway can be loud late into the night which is certainly a consideration - I didn’t mind the noise personally, but know it could be a factor for some.
Overall - highly recommend for 1-2 people looking a nice spot in the city center."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place downtown Fargo. The Toasted toad restaurant right downstairs has great cocktails. Close to Brewhalla and Fargo brewing. Great shopping. Worth the stay if you’re in Fargo.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We stayed for just one night but loved every bit of it! Being downtown was our favorite part and the access to everything couldn’t have been better. we did feel a little weird about the noise detector but do understand why it’s there. overall we would stay here again! beautiful airbnb!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love the location downtown. Walkable to everything. Fast internet. Felt like I was staying in a loft in a big city. Fantastic vibe. Instructions were clear. I will definitely be staying here the next time I'm in town.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The location makes it worthwhile!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ideal place to stay in downtown Fargo.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This downtown Fargo Airbnb was fantastic!! The absolute BEST location and within walking distance to everything - including tons of great bars and restaurants (totally recommend the Toasted Frog next door and the Boiler Room located in Roberts Alley).
The place was immaculate and completely as described. It was super easy to find and to get in. The apartment itself is so charming! It’s spacious will tall ceiling, large windows overlooking Broadway (even a view of the Fargo Theatre from the bed!), and gorgeous brick walls. So gorgeous!!
Communication was wonderful, quick, and she had great recommendations.
Would 100% recommend and will definitely make a return trip and stay here again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super cute urban apartment was clean and comfortable. We enjoyed listening to the nightlife and walking downtown. Parking is a little confusing at first, but that was well communicated. Would definitely stay here again if passing through Fargo."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"If youre looking for a beautiful place to stay in Fargo, look no further than this room. Pretty much everything you need is within a 5 minute walk from the front door. Rent Paige's room. Do it!!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was awesome! We chose the location because it was near our mom’s apartment. It was very clean and the bed was so comfortable! Loved that not only did they name some nearby restaurants, but they had QR codes for their menus!!! They also provided the Fargo/Moorhead dining guide book. At the end of the day when we wanted to wind down by watching a little tv the channel selection was great. We had a great stay and will definitely recommend to others."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a great location. Right in the heart of the action. Beautiful apartment. I would live here.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome stay!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Exactly as advertised. Place matches the photos perfectly. Neighborhood is full of restaurants and is directly in the heart of the city. Check in and checkout instructions were very clear.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very nice place & the host was thorough & responsive. I would definitely stay with them again!
General thought (not specific to this host) - it would be nice if the listed price included cleaning fees. It’s misleading to start with a quoted price of $150 only to have another $50+ added on for cleaning. Hotels, etc don’t do this."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a comfy place to stay in the heart of downtown Fargo. Great restaurants and shops right out the front door. Everything was as described and clean. Paige was a great host and answered all my questions very promptly. Thanks for a great stay.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Paige was a wonderful host with a very great place to stay, especially for our first visit to Fargo.

We cannot wait to come back for another stay."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Paige’s place was super cute and conveniently located to what we had planned for the night - walking distance to drinks, food and event center. Would definitely stay here again!"

2023-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"The apt is nice and convenient and we found parking right away, even on a Saturday. It was extremely loud on the street below until about 3am with partying people and drag racing/loud cars (It seemed to be prom this weekend so there may have been more screaming adolescents than normal :-). Paige fully disclosed the possible noise from downtown. It was a great apt, maybe not for the light sleeper who can’t wear ear plugs."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic location and comfy bed!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute setup inside and super convenient location
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was my first experience with an air bnb, I hope they all go as great as this one did. Easy to book,prompt clear responses from Paige and the apartment was terrific. I will definitely book again."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Can’t beat the location and Paige was an excellent host!

Would definitely stay again!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying downtown Fargo! I have family that lives in Fargo that I visit often and we’ve outgrown their house. This was a great place to stay with tons of fun restaurants, bars, shops and Sandy’s doughnuts within walking distance. We will definitely stay here again!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a lovely stay! Place is clean and exactly as described. Loved the exposed brick and real wood floors. Bed was cozy! Couch wasn’t the best for snuggling but there were cozy blankets and pillows provided that were great :).
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location is why we picked this for a couple nights out. Complaints…NONE!!
Beware. We will return."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Host was super friendly and helpful!! Is located downtown fargo, so just be aware of potential noise in the evening—host provided ear plugs if needed! Overall, great experience!!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The condo waw comfortable, well equipped and clean. Paige was very helpful and quick to respond. Highly recommended."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Paige's place was beautiful and comfortable!! The apartment was super cool and exactly as described in the description and pictures. The bed was very comfortable and everything we needed was provided!!!
As stated in the listing, parking can be difficult, especially on the weekends. Be prepared to park a little ways away and walk to the apartment. Paige does provide this information and parking information in her emails.
Also it can be quite loud late at night on the weekends. We were prepared for this and Paige does thoughtfully provide ear plugs. I am pretty sure she discloses this information on her listing page.
Altogether we would highly recommend Paige's place and would definitely stay there again!! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a great stay! Very stylish and comfy home vibes. Would stay again!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything about this place is fabulous!!! You should definitely check it out if you are interested in the heart of Fargo - it’s a really cool neighbourhood and the place is great!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"The apartment was clean and well maintained. There was plenty of random kitchen items if you were interested in cooking. The street noise was noticeable, but not so offensive that we couldn't sleep. There are plenty of options for free parking especially on weekend. It was a great downtown lifestyle getaway."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely loved it. Convenient. Easy to access. Comfortable
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I’m so glad I decided to book an extra night because I loved this apartment! So cute and cozy with thoughtful touches; will totally book again in the future!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a fabulous quick stay in the eclectic Fargo downtown! This place is small & mighty being right where all the action is. Would definitely stay again!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is so cute and simple. It’s right near a lot of cool murals, restaurants, and cute little shops! It was very relaxing and cozy! I 10/10 recommend!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed my stay. Clean place and well stocked with everything you need. Excellent at communicating.
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great location and view of downtown. Was very cozy and very cute place. Great price for the location and space. Thanks!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The location of this unit couldn't get any better, you're within walking distance of everything you would need for the day, plenty of coffee shops for the morning, restaurants ranging from cheap dining to gourmet for lunch and dinner, there is a lovely ice cream parlor for desert, and a variety of bars and pubs for the nightlife.
Now about the unit itself, It was very clean, and very organized, not too many loose items which was great because my wife and I brought our daughter with and there wasn't a a bunch of loose items for her to get into. The area is more spacious than the pictures give credit, and everything was very easy to locate
There were a few small items that I think are fair to point out. Firstly parking can get a little challenging at peak hours of the day, secondly my wife and I weren't huge fans of the smell of the air freshener in the main stairwell, and thirdly the hot water takes a fair amount of time to heat up.
All that aside 10/10 would recommend."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"In town for an event at the Fargodome and chose Paige's place based on location, pictures then description.
Found parking easily on the south side of the building. Pay clear attention to the signs and no problem. Parking ramps nearby as well. Found the lock box easily thanks to the clear instructions and the help of Sammy's Pizza (we were hungry) and made our way inside.
Yes, there are stairs, it's on the second floor. No problem. They're carpeted and safe and led us right to the door. Entered easily with the help of the keypad and clear directions and made our way inside.
Inside was comfy for our arrival, but we warmed it up a little more. Not a chill in the air.
Yes, there is some street noise. It's downtown, not the plains - that's why we chose it.
Beautiful decor and touches. Extraordinarily clean. Comfortable bed and loved the chair.
We enjoyed the time we spent would love to have stayed an extra week to work had it not been the New Year holiday.
Will definitely be back."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"excellent place, couldn't say enough good things about this unit. Might be the best Airbnb for the value in all of Fargo"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location in the middle of downtown. Unit was clean, and matched listing photos/description."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time together in Fargo. Thanks for the wonderful space, Paige!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place for a short stay in Fargo. It's a cute apartment and the bed is comfortable! Lots of good food options in walking distance! We were there on a Saturday night so parking was more difficult than expected. There's a list of parking garage options in a booklet in be apartment, but it would be helpful to research this prior to arrival so you're better prepared on a weekend. We spent several minutes driving around the snow-covered block trying to find a place to unload the car; my husband ended up having to stay on the car with flashers in the street while I ran in and out to bring in our belongings. Pack light because there are stairs to climb to reach the apartment. This is shown in the listing pictures as well.
The windows are very thin so you can hear every conversation on the street outside. For it being a Saturday night, we could hear yelling and talking on the street until about 1:30am. The host provided disposable ear plugs, which was a nice touch."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Right across from Fargo Theater, and within a few steps of great food, drink, and shops. Perfect location to be downtown."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second apartment I’ve stayed in of Paige’s in downtown Fargo. It was a wonderful stay. Great location.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was perfect in every way! It was close to everything downtown, was clean, and had all the amenities we wanted"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing host! This airbnb is significantly under priced for the value you get. This is smack dab in the middle of the commerce area with an awesome view. I would have paid twice as much for this spot than I did! Highly recommend!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This spot was one of the best AirBnB experiences I’ve had! Paige is a great and quick communicator, the spot was super clean and an amazing location, and the bed was comfy. 10/10 would stay again"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Our stay at Paige’s place was perfect. It’s an incredible place in the heart of downtown Fargo that lets you truly take advantage of everything the city has to offer. The listing was exactly as described and it’s basically right across from the famous Fargo theater marquee!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a cute place to stay! Right down town by everything. Host is super sweet and flexible. Will be coming back again!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! The apartment was beautiful, and we only wish we could’ve stayed longer."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,Right in the heart of Downtown Fargo! Location is great and always alive! so many spots and restaurants to visit!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was very clean and updated. It has everything you need. If you love to stay downtown and have coffee, shopping and food within walking distance this is the place."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay right in downtown. The Airbnb was gorgeous and had everything you could possibly need. Will definitely be staying again.
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here! So comfy, cozy, and vibey. The location can’t be beat. It’s literally in the heart of downtown! The only reason we didn’t give it 5 stars is because the listing said “free parking on premises”. It’s actually free street parking (90 minutes outside the Bnb). It was unexpected having to pay to use the ramp when we couldn’t find parking. We’d still stay again, though, because it’s that charming!"
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This location is perfect! It’s a very clean, safe place to stay and I’ve stayed here multiple times!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,They were fast to respond to any questions I had and the space was exactly as described. I would definitely stay here again!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sophia's spot is centrally located to all that Fargo-Moorhead has to offer. It's quiet and clean. I was concerned about backing a car onto a major road, but it was much easier than I anticipated. I'd recommend Sophia's place to anyone!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute place to stay and within minutes of many places! It was super clean and had everything we needed!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Sophia’s place was absolutely beautiful. Very well thought out design. The place was clean, tidy, and so cute. I’d stay there again for sure. Plus the communication with Sophia was great! Thanks for the great stay!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Sophia was a wonderful hostess! The space she provided for my business trip was quiet at night, cozy for a rainier season than I am used to and it has plenty of couch space. The kitchen and single bathroom are exactly as advertised - clean, newer and inviting.
The added bonus for me was that the washer and dryer were as private as the bathroom was!
The price is modest if you’re spending a week or more and the location is off of a one way (Southbound) street and if you blink at the corner, you may miss this gem of a BnB the first time around.
Please note that the ceiling is under 6 1/2 feet in the main living room. Be mindful of that, taller travelers! It’s a finished and furnished basement dwelling, but you couldn’t ask for a nicer space while on the road for business.”"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely wonderful. Quiet, great location, plenty of room. Will be one of the first places I look for availability next time I am in Fargo."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I am beyond thankful that I found this beautiful basement last minute to spend my weekend while in Fargo. Gorgeous, unique decor and so cozy. Had everything we needed! Extremely clean and organized! Everything appeared brand new! The bed, blankets and couches were very comfy. It seemed like a lot of thought was put into making it an accommodating place! Had an amazing time and will definitely want to return again :) the best airbnb I’ve booked, plus a really good price"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Highly recommend Sophia’s place! I was just there for a night as I was passing through Fargo, and I would definitely book it again if I return. The unit was a lot more spacious than I expected, the furniture is very comfortable and it is decorated beautifully."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Devyn- was quickly accommodating when we were needing a place while a family member was in the ICU. He was empathetic to the situation and when it was unknown if we would need an additional night's stay, he graciously held the home for us so it couldn't be booked in the meantime. The home had some nice extras to make it extra homey. Will stay again if in the area."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,Devyn was great highly recommend.

Your feet turned black from walking on the dirty-floors,cob webs were hanging on light fixtures,dirty and torn up carpets,fingerprints all over tv and refrigerator, a kitchen drawer face is broken, no ice maker, oven so filthy I wouldn’t even think about cooking in it, the beds were hard as a rock,along with the upstairs one leaning towards your head and to the side, there was a sign in the front yard saying pesticides sprayed I did not let my dogs hang outside (they did not want to anyway cause the neighbour’s deck overlooks your yard and they were skittish about it) the short time they were one of my dogs had allergic reaction and needed vet treatment.

Met up with another family, so we had 4 kids (all 2 and under) and it was very kid-friendly- more so than any bnb I have stayed in. Great playroom with games and toys upstairs (steep staircase so May want to consider a baby gate if needed for littles). Close to the freeway but really no indoor freeway noise.

Beds were very comfortable and the play room was perfect for our littles. The house is decorated beautifully but needs some cosmetic work. Better lighting and a TV in the upstairs living room would of made our stay a bit more enjoyable. The stairs in the house are steep so they may not be friendly for people with mobility issues.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"i liked everything because everything was as the same as in the photos. Everything was the same. We found it the same. We spent a weekend, very father.

All of the beds and furniture in the house is so comfortable….even the bean bags upstairs. We would definitely stay here again. Thank you Michele and Jared for being great hosts!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The house is in such a peaceful and cute neighborhood! Super close to any store we may have needed and to restaurants. The house itself was spectacular!! It felt so inviting and cozy. The decor was perfect, not overdone or overwhelming for the space. The charm of the whole place is fantastic. Having the ability to wash clothes while enjoying a movie as a family in the lower level was so appreciated! I can't say enough good things about the home."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Clean and Tidy, helpful manual with local suggestions, appreciated the kids area upstairs"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a mini-family reunion, and the space was perfect for all ages (we had an infant, toddlers, and adults). Very clean, comfortable, and Michele was very responsive. Super cute stay - we’d stay again here if visiting Fargo again!"

2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Michele was so helpful and kind regarding my questions and gracious about our boiled over milk on the cooktop stove. Oops! Originally the listing was for 6 and we had 7, and she said that was fine. Then we had 8 and they had been working on another room and we were able to have 8 of us stay. I was amazed at the space and how well it worked for our party of 8 adults. There was a simple beauty about the furnishings, colors and decor. Very pleasant.
The firepit area was so inviting, but it was so hot this particular weekend, so that just wasn't going to happen. The basketball/hoop provided some great fun for our young adult kids.
We were also only 6 minutes from where Fargo Baptist Church/Master's Baptist College, which is where we were attending a wedding. So, for anyone needing a place to stay while visiting this church/college, this was so convenient."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here for Memorial Day weekend. The house was perfect. Great location, easy to get to, beautifully updated, and immaculately clean. Great spaces for both kids and adults. Kids especially loved the upstairs game room and the PacMan machine downstairs. The basketball hoop got quite a bit of use as well! There is a perfect backyard firepit area which unfortunately we didn't get to use due to time constraints and wind. Would definitely stay here again."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at Michele's house. She went out of her way to accommodate us whenever we needed anything. The Christmas trees were an added bonus! The lower level of the house is a perfect lounge space. I'd 10/10 recommend!

Bedrooms and bathrooms seem recently renovated. Would definitely stay again and highly recommend."

My walkway was always show shoveled so i didnt have to step into piles of snow. I had an issue with the lock but let ashley know right away and it was fixed asap. I had no problem with heating, hot water, nor wifi which was a relief. The cozy electric fireplace kept me warm in the freezing weather."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect little place to stay for a work trip! We will return
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I will be back
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place for a weekend getaway in Fargo.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was like exactly what I needed for the short stay that I had in Fargo.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We spent two nights here while we were out of town for a hockey tournament, the three of us were very happy with the room and loved the overall vibe of it!"
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"a nice place to stay, the patio can be very slippery"
2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was comfortable and quiet. Was a very nice place.
During the winter, just watch for thin ice on the patio, as it got very slippery on the sloping concrete walking to the gate."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a great experience! I booked this airbnb last minute for a family weekend. At first Ashley didn’t think it would work. I explained that we wouldn’t be checking in for another 5 hours (around 10pm). Ashley and her team sprung into action to be accommodating! That meant so much on such short notice! We loved the suite and will be using it again whenever we visit family in Fargo!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great during our stay. Perfect spot for a couple staying in Fargo. Everything was clean and Ashley was extremely responsive and helpful!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place. This is our 3rd time back! Hope gram can continue hosting this place for airbnb!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,The neighborhood was beautiful and the place was cozy! There was a stocked coffee bar and a few snacks for us on arrival. The place was big enough for me and my two kids for the 3 nights we stayed. We did walk the neighborhood a few times. It’s a great area and there was a school playground nearby that we stopped at in the evenings.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ashley’s place was great! It was so cute and spacious, had plenty of amenities, and was super clean. The bed was very comfortable and the fireplace was so nice. We would stay here again for sure."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, easy access, everything as described. Enjoyed our stay!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,In a lovely neighborhood with a nice outdoor space. The bathroom was amazing.!!! Quiet and Peaceful.
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Ashley’s place was clean and thoughtfully planned. The bed was very comfortable and the neighborhood was nice and safe. I would have given it five stars but our experience had a few bumps due to an unusual situation. However, Ashley was proactive and refunded us for part of our stay without us asking her to do so. I think this would normally be a good place to stay."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay from start to finish was above expectations, and everything was perfect! There were a few nice personal touches to welcome us and made our stay even better!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The pictures did not do the place justice! While true to appearance, the place was cozier than I expected. The location was great -- in a safe area, private, quiet and close to downtown/shopping/restaurants (~5mins drive).
The place also had a few small touches/amenities that I was not expecting. For instance, a few packages of ground coffee, a variety or sugar brands and sugar replacements, tea and spoons. There were also a few snacks out as a little welcome gift -- individual packets of oreos, popcorn, cheese its, etc.
Overall, a great place to stay for a great price. Ashley and the host were quick to respond and address any comments/questions/concerns. Checking in and out was a breeze. I would recommend staying here and would surely stay again the next time I find myself in Fargo!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Ashley’s place was a perfect location in Fargo, it had everything we needed. I would highly recommend Ashley’s place."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Was perfect for our needs, very clean & quiet. I would stay here again in the future if its available. Thank you!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Gramm's place was a lovely place to stay in Fargo the few days we were there. The gardens in front of the home were nice to see as we walked by.
Enjoyed the little treats and especially the water!
It has been mentioned by others and I agree that the sofa bed is not comfortable for an adult. Even with extra padding available it does noes not provide a good night's sleep.
The bed is comfortable though. If the comforter's are the same come winter time, you will be nice and toasty!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Our family really enjoyed our stay. The ability to have a washer and dryer available really helped us
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my and my partners first experience with airb&b and I don’t think we could have gotten any luckier. The place was beautiful and very cozy for the two of us. Private and nearly frictionless experience! The weather kept us from using the patio but it looked great and the extra snacks and amenities were above and beyond thoughtful. We will look for this listing again in the future!
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Overall the room was wonderful. The only thing was she didn't always respond to questions we had like what the wifi password was.
The room is beautiful. Nice and quiet location and centrally located. I would definitely stay again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ashley’s spot was magnificent. Was in town for a wedding and what a cozy place to rest my head at night. A little small for more than 2 people but would be an excellent place to stay for a couple, or couple with a child under 5! Very clean and very easy to get to! Would definitely stay again if I’m in the area for a few days!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable guest suite in a nice, quiet location. Easy street parking. Super comfortable bed and a very nice shower. Perfect place for 1-2 people near downtown. Would happily stay here again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place, very clean, even the blanket seems new."
2023-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"We were disappointed, we did not have access to the Wi-Fi code and there was no response to our email or calls. The tv remote had 2 remotes glued together (one for antenna (we assumed) and one for tv), no instructions as to how to use it, the next day we finally figured it out after much frustration. The patio had been pressure washed and tree seeds were stuck all over the fence, patio furniture and covered the outdoor carpeting which tracked in terrible (seeds had stopped falling days prior). There was no handrail for the uneven, carpeted stairs that led up to the bathroom. Turning down the bed linens in the evening there were blood stains on one pillowcase top and fitted sheets. (I left a suggestion on how they might get the 'set-in' stains out.) During the day and evening we could hear children and adult conversation coming from the next room. Other than that, it was cute, but will not stay there again."
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Excellent location
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Would defiantly stay again. The place was extremely clean and the bed/bedding was probably the best out of any Airbnb I've stayed at, so comfy!! The location was nice and quite but also so close to so many restaurants and things to do. Check in was a breeze and it was nice to not have to be rushed out with an early check out. 10/10 would stay again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was even better than the photos. Very clean, private and quiet! Ashley was welcoming and very responsive. I would stay again next time I’m in town."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful B&B with private entry. It was very comfortable and spotless. The neighborhood is lovely and safe for walking about in the early morning or evening. There is a microwave and refrigerator, but there is no kitchen, but then, I didn't need one. It is an easy walk to the downtown area for restaurants or just walking around. Parking is on the street, but again, it is a quiet residential neighborhood so there was no problem. I highly recommend it."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at Ashley’s cute Airbnb. It was to visit Fargo.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying here! Ashley was very responsive and accommodated my late check in! All of the amenities were perfect immaculate and I felt so at home here! Hope to stay again!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The amenities and pictures are accurate and the property is in a residential area near a church, a school, and a school playground. The playground is within walking distance. The sofa bed is not really appropriate for an adult to sleep on due to discomfort."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This large suite was perfect for our family with young kids. It was an incredible value, quiet, elegantly appointed, and we hope to stay again. Our host was super proactive about a minor issue and it posed no problem for us. Wouldn’t change a thing. Great choice for a corporate stay too."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was just as described. Everything was in perfect, working condition. It was very cold on the weekend we were in town and the fireplace along with the space heater kept the place perfectly warm."
2023-03-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Very much worth the money paid. Very well decorated and a great host!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice and cozy
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay and will definitely be back and highly recommend this place to others!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a charming, cozy, well-appointed with modern amenities place to stay in Fargo, you can't go wrong with Gramm's and Ashley. Second year in a row I've stayed here. Private, quiet, comfortable."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very beautiful clean she had everything that you need. Everything was well organized. She always return my messages I will definitely be booking again.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice, clean room and bathroom. Host responded in a timely manner to a couple of questions. Close to activities in Fargo and Moorhead. Only concern was the use of intense, plug-in scent. We have sensitivities to intense fragrances. Other people might, too. We just unplugged them, and the scent lessened by evening. Thanks for a nice stay."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,enjoyed Ashley's place again
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fabulous room. Cozy and super clean. The light snacks and bottle water was unexpected and came in handy. I am from Fargo and know the area and I could not have picked a more perfect place.

The flowers and decor were so cute and kept up.

We definitely will stay again!"

Museums, breweries, restaurants, etc. are easy to get to from here.
We recommend this place and will stay again when we return to Fargo!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,really cozy in winter!
2022-01-01,3,Stayed one night,"I have stayed here twice now, but this past time, I realized that the neighbor had come into the guest suite a few times, once during the night. Other than that, it was good! Cute little place for the price."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you want a wonderfully appointed, quiet, warm, fantastically decorated private space while in Fargo, you can't go wrong with Gramm's. Ashely is clearly the kind of host who has thought of everything."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great little place. Everything you'd need. Great host! Thanks!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is completely adorable! The bedroom was large with a small sectional/pullout that made the space a perfect place to relax after dinner.
