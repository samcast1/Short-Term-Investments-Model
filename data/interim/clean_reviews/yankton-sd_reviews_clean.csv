2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, comfortable beds & pillows, great communication & clear instructions. Close to lots of fun places."
2023-03-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Check in was easy and no parking inside the garage as it was locked by the host , but you can park right next to it. Apartment is very regular , you don’t get a feel of weekend getaway and it is not private , there are neighbors downstairs and it is not a good place to party , no music after 11:00 PM. There is no private bbq and not much to do outdoor at this location , I definitely feel price is too high for this property with 4 ppl max to sleep in , and for the rules they had , and with neighbors downstairs , nothing much to offer for the guest. Kitchen is not adequate , no dishwasher , no extra trash cans . Not sure what else we can do here if it is not summer. We paid for 3 nights but had to check out a day before out of boredom ."

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was well stocked and provided good space for our family. Michelle was a responsive host. Our big disappointment was with the advertised beach access within walking distance.

Especially considering the access was via a rickety old staircase that did not seem safe or intended for use."

2021-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very well kept and managed home away from home. You are 9 minutes away from a marina and sand beach. The house has an amazing fire pit and all the wood one could burn. You are sharing the outdoor space with the owners, however they are very friendly and extended an invitation to join their fire the first night we were there. You will hear doors slamming living over the garage and vehicles coming and going. However it wasn’t excessive or disruptive. You will also hear amazing sounds of nature, possibly see a family of deer, and have a fun conversation with the turkeys that seemed to neighbor us. All in all, this was an amazing stay and we would recommend highly."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for peace and quiet, but want to enjoy it in style and confort, this is your place. We enjoyed every minute we were able to just sit back and have some important family time. The river is visible just over the trees and you can stand on the deck, inhale fresh air and listen to absolutely nothing. The host, Michelle, is sweet, accomidating and on top of things. If you message her for something, she gets right back to you. Thank you for hosting our crazy family and for providing us a place that we could actually be together."

We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay at Oak Hill! The view of the lake from the cabin is amazing. Our kids really enjoyed the wildlife (deer and turkey) just right outside the cabin. Yankton has lots of outdoor activities (biking, beaches, fishing, ect) and it was nice to come back to such a beautiful place at the end of the day. Your staying at Oak Hill will not disappoint!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home in quiet location just a couple minutes drive to Lewis & Clark park. Very clean. Kids and adults loved the game area in basement. Spiral stairs were quirky and brought some fun character to the house.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great stay! Loved the location.. walked around the neighborhood and saw deer and turkeys daily which my kids loved.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved the deck and patio, and the place was very comfortable. We can’t recommend enough."
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was updated and spacious. Open floor plan helpful for large groups. Comfortable beds. Large bathrooms. Great deck. Great view. Very close to lake.
Negatives - Hard to get downstairs due to tight, open spiral staircase is the only access to basement. Stairs not handicap nor physical disability accessible. Small children need supervision due to no handrail/spindles. My 6'3"" son hit head using stairs.
Only usable outside space was on deck. Yard areas rocky and steep, not good for children to play."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The cabin was beautifully decorated and modern. The beds were so comfortable with lots of spare linens and towels. The game room downstairs was a lot of fun. Just one word of caution - the only way to access the downstairs space is either via a spiral staircase or slopped exterior path so I wouldn’t recommend the cabin for families with small children or people with mobility challenges.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The cabin was very spacious and comfortable. It had everything you could possibly need. We were very impressed and would stay again!! Close to the lake and only a few minutes from everything in town!!! The host was very nice and I had left a sentimental pillow in the bed and she mailed it to me♥️. This really made me give this place a 5 star review, not only because of the accommodations but because of her courtesy to my personal needs!!! Thanks Jade👍🏼♥️"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place! My small family of 3 needed a place to stay for a long weekend but this would be great for a larger family get together. If we are in the area again we would love to stay here again.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This house is HUGE. So much space to spread out. The kitchen area is amazing. There is a hidden bedroom. I loved everything about this house.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"These home is amazing !!!
This is the home to pick! It had all the convinces! It was modern and rustic. They were easy to communicate with and made sure we had everything. It was convenient to town but still got delivery!!
Can't say enough good things about this home!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely amazing home! 10/10 recommend. Cole was super easy to communicate with. Everything was clean and the house is beautiful! Even got to see some wildlife around the house. Close enough to town that you can do a quick run if you need anything but far enough away to have the peace of the countryside. Will definitely be booking again.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved our stay! It was peaceful, beautiful and very comfortable! We really enjoyed the game room and the hot tub! Beds and furniture were comfortable and the kitchen had everything we needed. Would highly recommend this place for a relaxing stay!"

From the view, location, amenities, etc. It was a 10/10! The house was equipped with everything we needed to have a comfortable stay.

2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Nice location
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Went smooth and easy!
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"It is as advertised. I would categorize this as a novelty property. There is ample commons space, The kitchen is minimally equipped. This place does sleep 8, however the formula of sleep areas may not be what you are looking for. Pay attention to the photos and how it is set up. The sleeping areas are more like cubicles, which is fine. They are visual private but not sound private. There are 3 queen beds, however two of them are a bunk bed, and one is by itself. The other sleeping area has single bunk beds. The bathroom is acceptable, and the shower had plenty of hot water. There are clothing hooks and a coat rack out front, but nothing to really hang up hang up type clothing. It would be nice to have a wardrobe or something there for that purpose. All and all it had what my family needed. A place to sleep, clean up and eat breakfast. It just isn't the type of property that fits into my family's personality. Plenty of parking close by."
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"It was a different experience working through Evolve. They actually stood in the way of communication. The communication with Ben, beginning on the day of check-in, was very good. He even got us a shower chair for my daughter.
The place was clean and very comfy and nice.
The location is great - near the river and a great walking bridge going over the river. We hiked below along the beach and on some paths. Autumn would be an even better time to stay here!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super cute place!! Great location! We loved the old soda shop vibe the place had! Great use of the space!
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Nice place! Would stay again.
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The rooms were very clean. The beds were hard for our comfort level and all were against a wall making it difficult to get out of. We had a problem with the dishwasher and the local host contact number did not respond to texts. Evolve did respond to messages via the Airbnb app. The kitchen had everything we needed along with basic spices and oils.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved our stay! Will definitely be repeats for future visits!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A quiet, although surrounding may be a bit loud. The pictures accurately describe the place. Please note - it has a central air conditioner (AC)."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay! Three adults and three kids fit comfortably. Even though it is technically one room, the way the sleeping areas are designed didn’t make it feel crowded at all.
We ran into one little hiccup while staying there, the hot water quit working one night but the host was quick to respond and had it back to working very fast!
We would definitely stay at this unique place if we end up back in the area again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful visit to Yankton staying at the The Abe Lincoln Airbnb. The accommodations are cute and fun. Downtown Yankton is full of shops, bars, restaurants and is very walkable.
Our host, Zach, was very responsive and communicative which we appreciated."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fantastic host and great place.
my car actually wouldn't start in the morning and sent him a message that I would be stuck until it could be towed. He responded right away and came out to give me a hand, even helped me call places to get it in for repairs.
An incredible guy who is always looking to help your experience be better."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had the best stay at Joshua’s. He was such a responsive and flexible host and I appreciated his generosity with check in and check out flexibility. The home itself smelled so clean upon entering and looked exactly like the photos. The bathroom was spacious and had many towels clean and ready to use. The bedroom was so cozy and the bed was extremely comfortable. The views from the back patio were lovely and I loved listening to the turkeys and watching the deer walk by in the morning. I recommend a stay here to anyone wanting a peaceful place to relax and feel at home in while staying in Yankton. I will definitely book here for my future Yankton trips whenever possible. Thank you, Joshua for being the best host!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was clean and check in/out was a breeze! Host was responsive and friendly when messaging prior to our stay. Towels were soft and the balcony had a pretty view 🙂 Joshua’s place is like a duplex so we could hear TV and apartment-type sounds at times. This was not an issue for us, but I think it’s beneficial for future stayers to know.🙂"

2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was perfect for our large family. Everyone (not only the kids) enjoyed the pool table and the ping pong table. Our grandson particularly loved the small cove under the stairs. He called it his ""office."" Contributing to our love of the house was the gorgeous view from so many of the rooms. Even though we came for our Thanksgiving celebration and weather was cool, the front deck was enjoyed by all. Thank you for the use of this spacious home and we will plan another visit soon."

We were so close to everything we wanted to do! Also enjoyed this beautiful, spacious home when we just wanted to hang out and relax. Kids loved having the ""magic playroom"" as they called it and checking out the books and games available. Adults enjoyed the pool table, ping pong, patio and deck, awesome coffee bar, the two grills and fire pit. We would definitely recommend this property and would return - hopefully soon!!"

2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was huge! We loved the dining room table, it was perfect to sit around and play games. There was plenty of seating everywhere for larger groups. Another hit was the pool table and ping pong table, they were the perfect thing to fill our spare time! The master bathroom’s shower and the tub are LUXURY!! I wish we would have planned a longer stay. Can’t wait to visit again."
2022-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place for a girls friends weekend! Enough space for each of us (6) to have our privacy and also had great gathering locations within the house to make memories! The view is amazing and the house is nicely decorated and welcoming!

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We celebrated Christmas here with 17 adults and 4 kids. Plenty of space for all. The hosts are very accommodating and great at communication.

They also added a ping pong table since our last stay which kept the kids entertained! Would highly recommend staying here!

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved this house! First of all, it was spotless when we checked in. You could tell that a great deal of care was taken by the cleaning crew, and that they take pride in a job well done. Most properties position the cameras such that the house looks bigger than it is. This house is actually bigger than what the pictures make it appear! We were there with 18 people (including two toddlers), and had plenty of room for meals, sleeping, etc. What helps is that the garage was also spotless, and there were folding chairs and tables in there if needed. The view from the back deck is fabulous! You look directly on to Lewis and Clark Lake. From the deck, you can hear birds, see deer, turkeys, and spectacular night skies. I absolutely would recommend this home to anyone considering a vacation rental.
A real bonus is that the house is a little less than a mile from the beach and boat docks. That was very convenient for us!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home that delivers even more than the pictures. Convenient location & wonderful views of the lake.

The kitchen was well stocked with almost everything you could think of. The fire pit was nice to sit out and do s’mores! The garage was huge with a ping pong table and beach items, etc. and we were able to pull our bikes inside. Every detail in the house was thought of. We can’t wait to return next year!!"

Hunter the dog will greet you and want lot's of attention 😃 The town of Crofton isn't that far away from this location and has a grocery store so you can purchase all of your food and snacks! There is a bigger town (Yankton) less than 30 minutes away that has more shopping and food options. Overall, this was a nice, quiet stay to get away from work and ""adulting"" 🙂"

I highly recommend this destination!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our weekend stay at Janita's cottage was everything we hoped it would be. We wanted to experience genuine Nebraska hospitality in a rural setting and this experience was second to none!
The farm is located approximately 1 mile off the highway, an approximate 5 minute drive for the town of Crofton. The cottage has been remodeled and has all the amenities of home including a full kitchen, large screen tv and AC. We enjoyed our coffee on the attached deck as we listened to the birds chirp. Janita and Kevin were friendly and helpful but not obtrusive. Our favorite part was the tour that Kevin gave us of the farm operation, including the meeting of 2 young calves. We highly encourage this Airbnb for special memories and the opportunity to gain a deeper appreciation for Nebraska farm life."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Janita thought of everything we could need for our stay. The cabin is so cozy, bright and clean. I would highly recommend this location and would absolutely stay again.
We were kindly greeted by Kevin and an excited 4 legged friend named Hunter. Their sweet dog made sure we were settled in and even lounged outside our door for awhile. We felt very protected and had a lovely stay."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jolynn's house was the perfect spot for our relaxing get-away. From the view of Lewis and Clark Lake from the front deck and patio, to the nearby Weigand marina, and then the completion of our stay with a round of golf at Lakeview golf course which was just around the corner and down the road from the house, we were able to enjoy the beautiful end of summer weather. But most of our contentment with this visit was spent at the house with good friends in the very comfortable atmosphere, with an easy to work in kitchen, cozy beds, and clean and well stocked bathrooms. Jolynn was quickly responsive to my pre-stay questions, so we felt welcome from the start. This trip was a get-away with old friends, and now I'm eager to return, bringing my family to enjoy this beautiful home and the surrounding area!"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I stayed here for a short weekend while visiting our grandmother in Yankton. You can’t beat the value and the hosts are very considerate with the amenities. The privacy of the cabin is lovely and we spent hours out on the screen porch. It was the perfect place for a morning coffee or an evening glass of wine. We did not cook, but the cabin has a toaster oven, regular oven and electric range, microwave and dishwasher. The bedrooms were clean and the beds were comfortable. The air conditioning was ample and we were very impressed by the size. It is bigger than you’d expect from the photographs. We definitely plan to stay here again the next time we’re in Yankton!"

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home was very clean, stocked with everything we could need. We traveled on our motorcycles and it was all paved for easy travel.
The only downfall was beds were not very comfortable and pillows were hard.
Decks and porch were great!! The wildlife was beautiful and its easy to get to everything."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a fantastic location!! Private and incrediblely peaceful and close to our intended area to visit. The nights were cool enough we were able to enjoy the deck while grilling. The first night was misting a bit, but we were able to enjoy being ""outside"" via the sreened in porch.
The hosts thought of everything!
I can honestly say the only downside were the mattresses, in all three rooms. One of my friends slept on the couch the second night hoping to sleep better.
Despite this, I would highly recommend this home when staying in Yankton."

I would rent it again if in the area."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This cabin is more spacious than the photos make it look. It is quite nicely situated at the top of a hill, making it seem more remote than it is (a good thing - it was just a few minutes to the nearest grocery store). One of the best things about this cabin was the sensory experience every time we went out on the deck - the scent of wildflowers, the sounds of birds chirping, the water view...it was all lovely and relaxing."

2020-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"We really enjoyed our stay. It was way more space than the outside makes it look. We enjoyed all the little extra spaces to hang out. We loved the extra touches that they seemed to give to their rental. We could tell that they were the hosts that wanted to add a little to our stay, not just get by with what they had to. Definitely enough towels and bedding etc. We can’t wait to get back there sometime soon! 😊"

The check-in instructions were very clear and the location was easy to find and close to the main roads to easily get to the river, dam, and restaurants.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was first my airbnb booking and I'm glad I chose this host! It was in a perfect location. The home and the room were amazing!

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our first stay at an Airbnb and it was great! The house was super clean, very comfortable beds, well equipped kitchen with lots of extra amenities. We have stayed at some 5star hotels that wouldn’t measure up. The only problem now is they have set the bar so high
that we decided to book another Airbnb as we continued our journey - our rating has gone from an A+ with Jamie to a C at the current one.
We highly recommend this beautiful place in Yankton, SD"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The room was very clean and spacious. The location was nice and close to restaurants and some shops. Across the street was an amazing huge pool so if you come in the summer be sure to bring your swim suit. I wish I would have brought mine. The only complaint I have was that the bathroom floor was a bit sticky from the cleaner not being rinsed enough. It was although very clean. In addition, the shower floor is super slick, so much that I slipped and almost fell. I laid an extra washcloth on the shower floor the second time I took a shower which helped.
All in all I would recommend this Airbnb. It is clean, spacious enough and convenient. The access to the home is simple and easy."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was wonderful!! It could not have been better! There is so much thoughtfulness that went into making our stay comfortable and ensuring we had everything we could need. They went above and beyond while letting us totally do our own thing. We are so grateful and hope we get to stay again sometime!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved staying here! Jamie has a beautiful home and she is so welcoming and friendly, along with her husband Merrick. The room and bathroom is beautiful, big and spacious, and she has a great espresso machine and coffee bar as well.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice home with good location next to a great water park. Will definitely stay again if we're in the area. Tnanks for the great accommodations!

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Stopped for a brief overnight to break up a long road trip. We arrived late at night and were out early the next day. Jamie’s home was very comfortable and clean. It was everything we could have asked for. We had our golden retriever with us and she was comfortable as well. There is a park across the street which was great for our dog to get some energy out before our car ride. Room is spacious and bed is comfortable! They’ve got this hosting system down! Will certainly stay again on our next road trip and would recommend to anyone. Thanks for allowing dogs!

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow, one word to describe our guest suite; immaculate! We had a wedding to go to in Yankton. Busy weekend, everything was booked. Took a chance on an AirBnb.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Jamie and Merrick are welcoming, flexible, accurate, price their very spacious and well-appointed home very fairly and will help you get your bearings whatever your reason is for visiting Yankton. Their hospitality, knowledge and advice assisted me in countless ways to enhance my experience both during my stay in their home and in my overall adaptation to a new state and community. I highly recommend them to travelers, but perhaps even more to anyone considering, as I was, the idea of relocating to the area. They are incredibly helpful and insightful on virtually every level concerning Yankton and perhaps a radius that spans hours beyond the Yankton community. I am very appreciative for their hospitality. Finally, I will say that Jamie does not simply give lip service to ‘enhanced cleaning’. She truly does it and her dedication to everyone’s mutual safety is beyond reproach. Many many thanks."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very clean and well kept space. Hosts were very welcoming!

Lovely neighborhood, and lovely home as well. We were very comfortable, and will definitely be returning if we are in the area again!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Second stay here ... and we'll definitely be back whenever we visit Yankton!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jamie and Merrick are great hosts. We would absolutely stay again.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"our hosts were fantastic!! Our space was clean and comfortable. if we are in Yankton again ,we'd gladly book again!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first time ever using AirBnB and the stay at Jamie and Merrick’s has set the bar super high for future AirBnB stays. Their home was clean, our hosts were so kind and generous, and they had many little touches that really made it apparent that they care about those who come through. I have already recommended their place to all of our friends and family who go through Yankton, and am looking forward to our next stay with them. 10/10 would recommend!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jamie and Merrick were wonderful hosts - welcoming and easy to communicate with.

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The best place to stay when you visit Yankton Sd. These guys are amazing!
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The hospitality and care shown is exceptionally humbling. I was here for work and I have to admit that the selflessness they showed put me in a great mood for the work day. It’s still amazing to me that I received so much GENUINE care from people like you and me just trying to live life, and more so spread love and joy. 100/10 would recommend!!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful first Airbnb experience. Would do it again and actually thinking about planning a weekend getaway with the grandkids when the water park opens in 2021! Thank you so much!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our second time staying here. Jamie and her husband are so friendly and inviting. Feels like a home away from home.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay! Highly recommend!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We travel 250+ days a year we have been at a lot of different hotels and Airbnbs and not one has been nearly as amazing as this one! Seriously everything about staying at this home was amazing. Sparkling clean, comfortable bed, very nice house and kitchen (they let you use the fridge, all the cooking stuff...) but the best part about this trip was that we gained two new friends and we felt like home the whole week. We are so thankful for the amazing hospitality and new friendship. We have events again in Yankton next year and we will definitely be staying here again. And for the people worried because you need to share the house with others it didn’t bother us at all. You can hangout if you want or you can do your thing. No one ever bothers you. And they also always make sure that the guests are respectful of each other. This is amazing place to stay. Actually the best place to stay! I wish everywhere we go we could stay at the places like this. We can’t recommend this place enough."

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jamie’s place was very hospitable and I can’t thank her enough for allowing my friend and I to stay here! It was SUPER clean (which in this time we’re in that matters the most). I hadn’t stayed in a private room before so I thought it would be a tad strange, however it wasn’t at all! I highly recommend stay here!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jamie was super welcoming and friendly. The space was exactly as described, very clean and comfortable. I will definitely be staying there again if I find myself in their neighborhood again."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This AIRBNB stay was all you can want and more. I can’t say enough about the hosts. So friendly, kind and accommodating. My room was clean and so comfortable. You can’t go wrong with Jamie and Merrik."

2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I have been a frequent visitor at Jamie’s Place. I can count on a consistently clean and extremely comfortable room. Jamie is so friendly and always makes my stay special in some way. The Highest compliment that I can pay is to say that I feel like it’s my home away from home.
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jamie’s place is a first class Airbnb. The rooms are very clean with nice amenities. The hosts are very welcoming and will provide you with anything you need. This time I needed a diffuser for congestion.You will feel secure and right at home. I am a frequent guest.
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our stay here. The place was very clean and welcoming. Hosts were also very accommodating of our early arrival and late departure. Would for sure stay here again.
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I stay at Jamie's place frequently and the quality of the experience never changes. My room is clean, comfortable and her home is a great place to spend time. Jamie is very welcoming and there are always some fun touches. This Christmas season her home and my room were decorated beautifully even down to the Santa shower curtain. I look forward to my visits."
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jamie’s place is an outstanding Airbnb. I stay there often and always feel welcome. This year I stayed before Thanksgiving and her home was all decorated for Christmas including my room.

2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I frequently stay at Jamie‘s place. I like everything about it. Mostly I like the easy check in with the keypad on the door. There’s a sign on the door with my name on it and I feel very welcome. I have become friends with the family and find their home delightful.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place and people
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice Airbnb!!
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I stay at Jamie’s often And it’s so much better than staying at a motel. I don’t have to go through a check in procedure but just use the keypad. I go up to my room and unpack. It’s like going into your own home where everything is convenient. You don’t have to wait for a room to be cleaned. Check out is the same. You just pack your belongings and exit the house just like you’re at home. The most Satisfying part about seeing aunt Jamie’s is that you are seeing in a home and it’s very clean and comfortable.
