2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Attended a graduation at Fort Leonard Wood. This home is PERFECT! We had a large group, 9 adults and 1 infant staying at the home. Never did we feel crowded. The home was very clean and spacious. Very close to Fort Leonard Wood, shops and restaurants. Beautiful neighborhood and friendly neighbors (while we sat on the front porch some waved as they passed). Shawn was extremely quick with responding to any questions or concerns I had. Perfect ""home base"" for anyone attending a graduation at Fort Leonard Wood. Our soldier was able to spend a few days with us and he really loved the home as well. We had multiple vehicles and we were able to utilize the garage, this was extremely helpful and appreciated. Mahalo Shawn for being such an amazing host. If weʻre ever in the area again, I will definitely see if this home is available."

We enjoyed coming back with our soldiers to watch movies make a home cooked meal/ grill steaks and enjoy family time . Our soldiers felt at ease here. Getting on and off base was quick and easy since the nearest entrance was free of all the visitor traffic. Katie was accommodating and had the place open for us as we arrived later than expected.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the surroundings and the country setting .. The place was very clean and the beds were comfortable and we loved the pillows , it was just like sleeping in my own bed at home.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The drive from Kansas took longer than expected but the drive was beautiful! We were within 20-25 minutes from Ft. Leonard Wood. The area was quiet, peaceful and relaxing. Katie provided a large storage ottoman filled with family games and puzzles for families who enjoy having family game nights.

Thank you so much for sharing your lovely home!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was my first time booking in AirBnB. We are from New York State and have never even crossed a time zone. We came down for my husband's basic training graduation and booked her Airbnb. Walking in, the place was amazing! so neat and clean. the view was breathtaking, and the house was really nice. On our way down, our car started threatening potential troubles, and we were ready to search for a mechanic. Her brother-in-law, I believe, Don greeted us with a kind smile and a big heart and made us feel so welcome, even helping my father check on our car and make sure we got home safe. Through storms, kitchen needs, and directions, they were ready and willing to help any way they could. I couldn't have asked for a better host and her family! Sweet, amazing people ready to help, a cute house, and a gorgeous, relaxing view. Give stars isn't enough to show how much I recommend them! We hit the jackpot for sure!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place! We booked very last minute, as we needed a place to sleep and shower after a long day on the road. Katie responded right away and generously hosted us. Highly recommended!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This had to be one of the homiest places we have stayed at. The little details made it comfortable. The beds had nice heavy and not so heavy bedding. There were both soft and harder pillows. Plenty of towels and linens. Plenty of utensils, plates, and cookware. And comfy recliners to relax in at the end of a busy day. The surroundings are beautiful and peaceful. My family got to enjoy downtime with my son before he shipped out for AIT. Very easy commute to the main gate."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Super clean and cozy! Felt like home. Would definitely book again (:
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Love the place will choice this again the best air bnb ever

2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"Host was very kind, welcoming and responsive. Home was cozy and VERY clean. Just as described in the narrative as well as in the photos. Had all of the amenities of home!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Katie is an amazing host! The place was super clean, very comfortable, and well equipped. Katie left drinks and candy that my children loved! Watching the sunrise with the birds chirping was peaceful. We will absolutely be booking again with Katie when we come back to visit family."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a short overnight stay here in between traveling. The home was clean, and the king bed in the primary bedroom was comfortable. We were traveling with our dogs so I was looking for a place for them to be able to stretch their legs. This worked out well! The main living area/kitchen is spacious and open so there was plenty of room for us and the dogs. Overall, we had a comfortable stay!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Nice quiet space. Very clean. Katie was super friendly. Great stay!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing hosts! Katie is amazing and took time out of her day to take us to print something important out.
The property is very clean and the house has everything you can think off. She says she loves to add things based on recommendations which is amazing because that shows that she truly cares about her guests feeling at home with what the house provides."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My nephew was graduating from the army in Fort Lenord Wood, and we were looking for Air B&B. I read one review from Katie's space, and I chose the spot, and I didn't regret it.
What stood out to us was that when we checked in, the ambiance was amazing. There was juice and water in the fridge, fruits were out in a basket and and a welcome note from Kate, I was blown away.
The space was very clean, cozy, and spacious to accommodate my family.
I would recommend anyone who is visiting the Missouri/Richland area. Katie's place is the space, great rural area, peaceful, quiet when the morning sun comes up it gives you tranquility, then you relax in the jacuzzi tub.
I got a chance to meet her and her husband and what great people they are , thank you Katie, I will definitely be back."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to stay if you’re visiting a soldier at Fort Leonard Wood. The place was very clean and Katie was very considerate in stocking us up on coffee and even had drinks in the fridge for us. There wasn’t anything we needed. She thought of everything. It was a pleasure meeting her and her husband. They are very gracious and sweet people. Praying our soldier doesn’t get stationed up there, but if he does we will definitely be contacting Katie!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second stay with Katie, we loved our first stay and decided to stop for the night on our way back to IL. We all felt like it was home, it just came naturally to stay here a second time.
Everything about our stay was great, the house was exceptionally clean and comfortable. We got to see a few deer on our way in. This place is so peaceful, it makes you not want to leave. We already know we will stay here in future travels. Our host was great, she left chocolates and a fridge stocked with drinks, everyone in our group talked about how great coffee was.
Katie, thank you for hosting our group! We will be back!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,She was very responsive and the home was cozy and clean. Their property is beautiful especially with the fall colors!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Katie’s place was just as described. We took an exit that later turned out to be a gravel road and it took us to our peaceful and safe destination. Upon arrival at 1:30am we noticed the house and surrounding area had great lighting. Check in was a breeze with code. The house was very clean. Katie left a sweet note and even had sodas, water bottles and coffee for us. Beds were comfortable and everyone kept commenting on how spacious and cute it was. Living room & master bedroom had fans. The pups enjoyed the large open yard. There is an area for a fire pit, and also an area with a big grill. There is plenty of parking for multiple larger vehicles. Heads-up, if you’re allergic/sensitive to plug-in scent diffusers let Katie know, there is a few throughout the house
Overall we would recommend anyone to stay here, it sleeps 6 comfortably but if you wanted to bring an extra person, you could. Couch is big enough. If we ever need to rest on our way to Texas. We will surely stay here again!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a short but very peaceful stay! We enjoyed the quiet county area! A very pretty area and lovely HOME! We couldn’t have ask for more!! A nice HOT bath and great night sleep!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a beautiful cozy place to stay. It was everything we had hoped for. Katie was so help and responsive. She went above and beyond to make us feel welcomed. The home was extremely clean and we felt so comfortable during our stay. We stayed during our son’s graduation. What Katie didn’t know is that we had actually booked with another AirBnB before booking with her. That host called with less than a week’s notice to say that her listing was all wrong. She requested more money and that we cancel our reservations with her. This left me feeling frantic to say the least. After following up with AirBnB customer service, we went back to available listings and found Katie’s location. She made booking with her so easy. She turned what had been a horrible situation into a positive and joyous experience. I’m so grateful for her hospitality and kindness. We were able to celebrate our son’s important moment, without stress or concern about staying somewhere safe."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Katie was such a sweetheart. No matter how many times I bothered her 😂 when I walked through the door, the smell of a nice and clean house hit me in the face. Everything was spotless. She even left us sodas, waters and coffee! The bed was nice and comfortable with the most comfortable pillows! The back porch space was so peaceful and relaxing! We stopped and got our own toiletries but when we got there she already had some there! I literally only had to bring myself and food! We loved our stay! I would definitely recommend!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect for my son’s graduation. It was a close easy drive to the base.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Tashas place was exactly as she described. The house was beautiful, clean, in a nice quiet area, and truly felt like a home away from home.
Tasha is very kind and responds quickly, even took a moment during our stay to send a message and make sure we had all we needed. House rules/instructions were clear and easy making check-out a breeze.
If we are in the area again we will definitely be checking for this place first."

2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"This house worked great for myself and my family. We were in town for my uncle's retirement from. His family lives in St. Robert, so this location was great. It was 10 min to his house and 10 min or less to get on base. The property management company was great with detailed instructions and responsive to any questions I had. There was lots of room for all 5 of us to spread out and gather together. The downstairs was great for hanging out and the pool table was an added bonus. It was comfortable and well maintained. Loved the quiet neighborhood."

The house was big enough/comfortable enough for our family of 9. The pool table was an added bonus for entertaining. Overall the house was great and we didn’t have any major concerns. Some minor concerns were the master bed being too squeaky, also the master bedroom does not have an available closet, more attention to detail for cleanliness, more kitchen items and more cleaning products. We did have to purchase a lot of items in order to cook/clean. Concerns were addressed with the host and they’ve taken them into consideration. Overall we had a great stay and I would recommend this property. Host was very kind and responsive to concerns and responded quickly to messages. Check in/out process was very simple.

My favorite part was the hand written note! I really loved that! It felt personalized just for me and my family.
Our family spent a lot of time equally in the home. We spent it playing pool and then in the back yard since the weather was lovely. We cooked and ate and it was just the best intimate family gathering we’ve had in a while. There was no reason to leave. Board games were also available which we loved!
Thanks for having us! And I look forward to booking with you all again soon!"

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Property was wonderful and owner's were great with allowing the early check in due to our early arrival. The place was very clean and the rooms even had waters in them.

There was even a congratulations welcome note for us and him which was a nice touch. Thank you for everything! Would definitely stay here again if we were to come back.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was amazing! We were visiting for our soldier at fort Leonard wood military base! For starters the house is beautiful, clean, and in a great area! We were close to the military base and close to everything else we needed Walmart, things to do, food, etc. The basement was the perfect hangout for the adults, teens, and little ones (3&4). The open kitchen and dining area was great for hanging out, talking, and playing games while cooking! The hosts answered any questions we had and made us feel very welcomed! I would totally recommend this place!!"

2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"We stayed Sunday through Saturday, and I couldn't recommend a better place to stay. The house felt like you were staying in your own home. There was a welcome note on the table waiting for us. There was something we needed that the house didn't have, but when I contacted them and told them, not only did they respond right away, but they door dashed it. Along with the item, they included some candies. (which was a big hit). The house has a lot of amenities, you won't have to worry about any type of kitchenware, towels, soaps they basically have what you would already have in your own house. There are games for everyone, kids to adults, a pool table, and arcade machine (which was another hit) with everybody in my family. The only thing you will need to be aware of are the steps are narrow, but honestly, it was not a big deal to us. The neighborhood is in a very quiet neighborhood, and stores and restaurants are very close. We would stay here again if we were to come back."

The personalized note congratulating my son on his graduation really took it to 10 stars. You can tell there has been a lot of thought behind putting together. We had young adults traveling with us, 19 & 20 and the floor plan was PERFECT. They enjoyed the game room and bedroom being downstairs away from me and my husband. Thank y’all making this trip even more special. Literally the only thing I had to buy was food which is not usual. The body wash was even top quality. The mattress gave me some of the best sleep. I could go on and on but you get the point. Just book it!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My family and I stayed at this property because we were in town for my son’s basic training graduation. We loved everything about our stay. We chose this property because it had plenty of room to spread out, and it’s conveniently located to the base. We were totally blown away about the thoughtfulness of the owners, and how accommodating they were. They even left us a gift basket full of goodies, along with a note congratulating my son.

The arcade game, pool table, and flag mural in the basement were awesome!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I simply can’t say enough good things about this home. We walked in and immediately felt relaxed and comfortable. After a crappy day of traveling, it was exactly what we needed. It was warm, inviting, and cozy just like a “home”. Such a cute house. Wonderful experience!
The kitchen had 3 different ways to make coffee. Full size refrigerator with ice and water. Dishwasher barely made any noise whatsoever. I went back to double check that I actually started it.
The spacious bathroom had plenty of towels. 3 of us took showers in the mornings all back to back and didn’t run out of hot water.
The bedrooms were nice sizes and the beds were comfortable. Loved that I could plug my devices into the lamp and didn’t have to hunt for a plug or pray one was close to the night stand.
Julie was very responsive and let me know the weather could possibly be bad so I could come up with Plan B for food since we originally planned to grill. Gave me suggestions for food options too!
20 mins to FLW"

2023-10-01,4,Group trip,"We needed 5 beds and that was perfect! Light colored carpet was really stained everywhere. All upstairs along the walls had a dark line and behind the doors was same way. It was dust buildup that’s been there for a very long time based on the dark color.
This was a very nice place and all the information was great. I can see why he is a super host with the exception of the carpet upstairs. Could be rectified easily with a stiff broom and a vacuum. (And possibly a different cleaning service)
Cheap ceiling fans would be nice in each bedroom for those of us who use them.
I would highly recommend if cleaned better!"

We were unaware it was a duplex at the start however even with a dog and child we could not hear the neighbors. Everything we needed was provided in the house.

The home was exactly as pictured. It was beautifully furnished, clean, and very welcoming! Wifi was great for my teens. The kitchen had everything needed to cook an entire meal. There were 2.5 bathrooms and 3 spacious bedrooms. The views from the two bedrooms were absolutely breathtaking!
Check in and check out was very easy. I will definitely be requesting his space again when we return to FLW for AIT Graduation.
Thank you, Jayson! Your home and hospitality is appreciated!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was warm and welcoming from the moment we pulled in the driveway. There was 4 of us and we all enjoyed the house. It’s was very beautiful and had more then expected. We never reached out to Jayson because everything was very clear and well laid out.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My family and I felt as if we were at home. They even had my brand of coffee 🤗. Overall it was the perfect place for what we were there for. Thanks Jayson for your hospitality.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,What a great place to stay! The house was comfortable with plenty of space and we loved the thoroughness of the host. They left great directions and recommendations and clear directions. It worked perfectly for travel back and forth to post.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very clean, comfortable, and roomy. Close to Fort Leonard Wood and provided a great place to stay and bring our soldier for a good meal and visit on Family Day before his graduation."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"This was a perfect place for us. We visited for our son's graduation at Fort Leonard Wood. The location was very convenient and it was very quiet. The place was really spacious for us with 6 people. Everything we needed was provided, and we especially enjoyed the boardgames and little sundry basket, that was a thoughtful touch."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great and clean place to stay!
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"It was the perfect size for the 6 of us to stay. We were there for our daughters Army graduation, so it was prefect distance and easy drive to the main entrance.
The instructions for our stay were clear and precise.
Overall it was a very pleasant, comfortable stay."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,The place was very nice and cozy… If you ever just want to get away to clear your mind.. This will be a nice place to rent.. Jayson has ALWAYS communicated with me when I needed him to as well for any questions…I hope they pleased for the way we left it as well…
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,B&B was exactly what we needed/expected
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"We originally came to attend a military basic training graduation. Where do I start? Everything was close by including Walmart and other convenience stores. Our soldier felt comfortable and we all had a nice dinner. We spent the majority of time in the house so we can say by fact that the house felt very homey.
Jayson is very responsive and was even flexible in terms of the check in time. It was without a doubt a 5 star experience."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,this was last minute and happy with the price and availability. reasonable cleaning rates help make the decision.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Very nice place to stay. Plenty of room, plenty of dishes and pans, etc. Beds were comfy, couch was plenty big. I enjoyed the stay. It was a quick drive to the gate of Ft. Leonardwood. I recommend this place to any family coming for a graduation or any reason."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice place to stay while visiting my nephew at FLW. Great place for a big family or group. Close to base entrance. Was great to park in the garage! We stayed in and cooked pizza from scratch in the kitchen. Had just about everything we needed minus the ingredients. Jayson was very responsive and helpful. The pack n play worked great for our 1 year old and was awesome it was there so we didn’t have to take ours.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Jayson is a great host and I highly recommend his place and we felt right at home. Thanks Jayson!
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Easy to get to and very accommodating.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house was a great pick, especially if your in town for the graduation at fort Leonard. It was comfortable, felt like home away from home. It was big enough to fit our family and we enjoyed the stay!
I would suggest bringing a kettle if you aren’t a coffee person like myself. Also the stove smokes a lot so beware. Other than that EVERYTHING WAS GREAT !! I would stay here again if I’m ever In the neighborhood.
Thanks again Jayson!!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I really enjoyed Jayson’s home. Moving can be stressful as it is, but we felt right at home and comfortable. The home was very spacious and accommodating for my big family. Jayson was very quick to respond any questions I had. Would definitely recommend 10/10!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We came to Saint Robert's to watch my husband graduation basic training/AIT in Fort Leonardwood. The location was perfect distance to the base. The house was extremely clean and was kid friendly. We felt right at home and very safe. I highly recommend this Jason and his Airbnb.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"-First of all, Mr Jayson is very proactive and welcoming. Always available for communications exchanges.
-Secondly the Native beauty of the house, the peaceful and awesome environment that surrounds it. We will not hesitate if we have to go back there again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very nice, would stay here again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This location was convenient for what we needed. We went to my son's graduation at Ft. Leonard Wood, we had a rental car so it was easy for us to get around. Not much walking distance though. We loved that they had a garage. We loved that the house did not have a lot of ""decor"" on the walls / shelves. It felt clean and not as cluttered. It is a townhome duplex located in what appeared to be an apartment complex or or condos maybe. It was quiet and easy navigate. The overall grounds could use some clean up , but that is not the hosts job. Overall a 5.
Jayson responded quickly to a couple of emails we exchanged prior."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, closet full of games was perfect. loved our stay here. would stay again if I am back in the area."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This listing is just as described. Worked out great for our family since we were there to visit for sons graduations at fort Leonardwood. Great location close to base. Jayson was more than helpful to answer questions we had and was responsive to our needs.
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"We stayed one night in the condo. It was nice, clean, and spacious. It had all the amenities we needed. Host sent very clear instructions to ensure easy check in and out process. Will rent again in the future."
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"My husband and I's family stayed because my husband was graduating from there. We put the place , very comfortable, clean and spacious .
If we go back to Missouri, we'll stay again."
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"We were visiting from Illinois and we were staying at Jaysons home for 3 days. My youngest son was graduating from Fort Leonard Wood. The house was very beautiful and clean. Jayson communicated very well with me over the app and thankfully we had no issues that would have required us to reach out. All of my family members enjoyed the stay. The location is close to a lot of restaurants , groceries like Walmart and other stores. If we ever have to come back to Missouri, we know where to stay moving forward. Thank you for hosting us."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Had a great time at this airbnb. I have three small children and it felt like a home away from home. Lots of space for the kids to roam and not be contained in one small area.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was clean and very nice. It looks just like the photos, so very accurate. Their was a ""in case you forgot"" basket with items which we thought was nice. It was fully stocked with all kitchen essentials. Their was also spices, butter, and a waffle maker which my children enjoyed. However the only thing I would recommend is Jason adding a shade or curtain on the window near the front door for privacy. The window is very clear and anyone can look inside."
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,Listing was as advertised. Clean and well kept house. Close to Fort Leonard Wood for our son's graduation. Host suggested the Maramec Spring Park. It was a beautiful place and one of the best things we did on our trip. We would highly recommend the host and the airbnb.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cozy and clean! The description of the location was spot on in a very quiet neighborhood. Will definitely stay there again in the future!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,We drove up for our daughters graduation from Tampa Florida and we were pleasantly surprised with the town house. It was clean and cozy. Everything from the beds and linens were amazing and smelled freshly cleaned. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook a decent meal for our soldier. There was also plenty of menu options to order take out. I would definitely recommend to anyone who needs to visit especially that the Army base is literally a 15 min drive. The area had enough variety as far as things to do but since we were in town for only 3 days could not take full advantage. I love that we could put our vehicle right into the garage and go in from in there. It was freezing and having that remote control for the garage door made a big difference. The unit also has a washer and dryer which for me is heaven. Traveling with two children under 10 and eating in the vehicle let’s just say there were more than one food disaster. Welcoming /instructions binder was a nice tough.😁
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Awesome host and the home was lovely!
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Jayson's place is a clean, tidy, duplex in a safe neighborhood. It was perfect for our son's family day/graduation from the Army. All the most important items were there for us including a few trial sizes items just in case we forgot something. Comfortable beds, cozy duvets, good pots/pans."
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"So many added touches...games, books, crayons! Don't look any further, book now!"
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,Loved the stay in this house. Was as describe and Jason answered all my questions and he was very helpful.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The larger bed in the second bedroom was awful but when i mentioned it, he brought a mattress pad over. We ran low on toilet paper, 4 girls in one place for a week uses a lot of paper but as soon as i mentioned it, he came and got us some more. He was very nice about it. Quite place, wonderful puzzles and great base access."

2022-09-01,4,Group trip,"Great location for visiting especially when visiting those at Fort Leonard Wood. We loved that there were 3 bedrooms with separate beds. They had pamphlets of things to do locally and within driving distance, restaurant menus and a binder with all the details regarding the rental as well as qr codes for easy access to wifi and their lists. They also had a did you forget basket which was a nice touch!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very comfortable staying here. One exit away from Fort Leonard Wood. Host was responsive to my requests to extend (due to my wife being under the weather) which was greatly appreciated. Would definitely stay here if we visit MO again.

2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay!!!
2024-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,"It’s a great place located close to fort Leonard wood. Grocery shopping close. Uranus fudge factory close. Dominos close. Does not have a washer and dryer. Be sure to pack enough clothing for duration of stay. We ran out of fresh towels the first day. They provided extra towels the following day per request. Does not accommodate a baby. We had to sleep baby on the bed or on the floor. There is a big garage but it’s locked and not accessible. Outdoor trash cans went missing halfway during our stay and we ended up placing our closed bags of garbage outside by garage door and we were paranoid doing so because we weren’t sure what to do with the collecting garbage. We appreciated the convenience of a vacuum. We asked for an indoor broom which was provided the following day, so we could clean up after ourselves. Parking is at a decline and very close to the street. We wished we could have parked in garage."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,the house was nice. very easy to Access. very roomy. close to FLW.and lots of places to eat . fun things are the house to do.. we definitely will stay there again when we visit Missouri. And would definitely recommend the property for others to stay.

Overall an excellent value and I highly recommend."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Our stay, here was very comfortable, spacious, safe and very clean. Karen was quickly responsive for any questions we had.

2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"The place was nice and spacious bed was very comfortable, quiet neighborhood. Everyone enjoyed the time there. Thank you"
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"I definitely would recommend this spot.
It was clean, stocked with the amenities Karen listed. There are streaming options for TV viewing, board games and a gorgeous view from the back porch. The downstairs queen mattress was more of a “futon” type mattress and a bit one the uncomfortable side. But it worked for the amount of time we were there. This was perfect for the few days we stayed."
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,A quiet beautiful place that’s close enough to fort Leonard woods to celebrate our little soldier graduating basic training. The landscape is beautiful and sets a different peaceful vibe compared to life in Miami.

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"The Revelation Airbnb was an excellent option for our family stay to attend a FLW military graduation. The home is in a very nice & quiet neighborhood. The balcony to the backyard has a beautiful view and the trees offer privacy from other backyards. Kitchen has all the essentials needed to prepare a home cooked meal for guests, there is also an outdoor grill; the wine cooler and crockpot were great! Rooms are spacious and clean! I loved the master bed&bath! The board games were a great way to enjoy time together without leaving the house and spending money for entertainment.

Home is a little tricky at first to get to, especially in the dark, but after a couple of trips to town and back, there was nothing to it. Friendly neighborhood! Master bed/bath was great, and all guests said theirs beds were very comfortable. Top bunk, though, is really not usable due to the closeness of the ceiling fan. Lacks a couple of TVs in the extra bedrooms and a can opener, lol. The back deck is nice. We would definitely rent here again!! Lots of room for everyone!!"

2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"This Airbnb was very nice. Very spacious and layed out nicely. Bedrooms and bathrooms were all spacious and clean. Kitchen was great, nice sized and modern. We cooked a large meal with what amenities they provided. Large refrigerator/freezer with ice maker came in handy. Very large flat screen TV in LR for winding down at night. We did not use the outdoor deck or fire pit as it was 95-100 degrees during our stay. The area is a quiet newer housing development a few miles NW of Waynesville but still a short, easy drive to Fort Leonard Wood. Communication with our host Karen was excellent and she was very accommodating with some changes we had. We look forward to staying here again!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were in town for my son's basic training graduation. Aaron's house gave us all plenty of room to relax with our new soldier. The area this house is located is beautiful and quiet. The rec room in the basement was an excellent area for everyone to relax and have fun. Kitchen has everything a person needs for making a home cook meal. The house is an easy drive roughly 15 minutes from Fort Leonard Wood. Aaron is always responsive for any questions or concerns you may have.
Our daughter graduated basic training 7 months ago and we were in a hotel for family day and graduation. We didn't like the fact that the ten of us couldn't all fit in one room comfortably and enjoy our new soldier's company. This time around we decided to find a nice house to relax in with plenty of room, beds, and bathrooms for us all and this house was the perfect fit.
Thank you again Aaron for the hospitality and the beautiful house."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Mr.Aarons Cabin was very beautiful and peaceful . Visited Missouri for the first time and immediately fell in love ! Was looking for a place to stay and bring my son home from Fort Leonard Wood. This cabin felt just like home we had everything we needed. If we didn’t have it Mr.Aaron was a message away! Felt just like home.
my soldier was able to relax and get some much needed rest. This Cabin is so nice and clean and organized. The downstairs game room was our favorite place out of the whole cabin! If you are in Missouri please Give Aaron’s Cabin a stay . You won’t regret it!"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,This cabin was such an amazing place to stay! Highly recommend!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was just as on the picture. We were a family of 13 adults with 2 toddlers and 1 infants that stay at the cabin. But we were 19 in total. My son was graduating from Fort Leonard Wood. Which was just 15 mins away from where we stayed. We had enough space for everyone to be completely comfortable. We bought our own big pot to cook in for the amount of people we had. But they do have a few pots and pans that you can use. We enjoy our time making memories with him there, before he leaves to go to Germany for 3 yrs."
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"Aaron's place was just what we needed. my family stayed here for my son's graduation from Basic Training. we wanted a place where everyone could stay and he would feel comfortable relaxing during family day and graduation day, and it was exactly that. We utilized the fire pit, the porch and deck and the game room, all were a wonderful way to all be together in the same central location and still have a little change of scenery. It was under 20min to drive to the base, super easy and the kitchen had everything we needed to cook meals during our stay. If you're here for graduation and you're nervous about not staying on base, don't be! Aaron's home is the perfect location."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great place
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Well executed mountain/cabin getaway perfectly secluded and beautifully put together. From the game room to the kitchen everything was supplied and clean would definitely recommend!!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Brooke’s home is beautiful and a great stay for kiddos. My one year year-old was able to play with toys and there wasn’t a lot for her to get into which was great! The house is right off of 44 and provides a 30 minute drive to Rolla. While we did have minor cleaning issues we needed assistance with, Brooke was incredibly gracious and helpful with getting them solved and I would stay here again!"
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful clean and spacious. The host was super communicative when I had questions or concerns. Stocked coffee bar which was a big hit every morning.
We were here for a graduation on base and this place is perfect as it was super close and affordable. 15 min drive and also really close to an Aldi’s and some restaurants"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home! So much space, and had everything we needed for our short stay while visiting family at Fort Leonard Wood. It rained the whole time we were there, so the game closet came in handy. The only down side was that there must have been a family staying downstairs and we could hear the kids, especially since the door is right next to the bedroom, but it didn't affect our comfort level. Thank you!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stellar host! Very impressive place to stay.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at Brooke’s place for a basic training graduation at FLW, and we had a wonderful time! The house is beautiful, squeaky-clean, well stocked with amenities and extra towels and linens, and very family friendly."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place exceed my expectations! It really felt like home. We were in town for a bootcamp graduation from FLW. It was only about 10-15min away. We had enough space that the whole family could relax and spend time with our army graduate. Our soldier really missed having a home cooked meal & the kitchen had everything we needed to complete his request. Besides that the place is beautifully decorated and very CLEAN! Brooke is a very responsive host and truly cares about the quality of your stay! I would most definitely book here again!

2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Lauren was very sweet and accommodating. When we had an issue with check in, she made sure we were taken care of. The home was just as described, looked like the pictures, and was in a quiet neighborhood. The beds were comfortable and everything was clean and tidy.
She provided a helpful binder of house rules, local recommendations, and useful information regarding the airbnb including the option of purchasing forgotten essentials like tooth brushes. Between that and the complimentary snacks, coffee, and laundry pods we felt like we were staying at a hotel but with all the convenience of staying in a single family home!
It’s a convenient area, only 5 to 10 minutes from Walmart, 15 minutes from Fort Leonard Wood, and 15 minutes from Uranus Fudge Factory(lol)"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We felt relaxed and at home while we stayed here. Our Marine had special liberty and was able to enjoy the down time.

It was very clean and tastefully furnished, with just the right amount of furniture. Dining table sat six comfortably which was important for game playing. The coffee bar was very nice and well stocked and there were a few treats and water in the fridge (much appreciated). They beds were comfy and linens were spotless. It was a great place to catch up with family during out quick trip to MO. I also appreciated that there was no big list of chores to do before checking out since we were leaving at 7 to start our 9 hour drive home. All we did was start the dishwasher, turn down the heat, and lock the door on our way out. Very easy!"

The price is honestly very affordable, and it had more than enough space for my family.
The place is very very clean, and the beds were super comfortable.
100/10 recommend if you are visiting your loved one at Fort Leonard Wood because the drive is super short to get on base. And especially if you are visiting a soldier who is graduating, its the perfect space for them to feel like they are at a home away from home.
We will definitely be booking again"

My Marine is not planning on being there for too much longer or else I would already be booking another stay here. But, if he ends up back there I will for sure stay here!

There was plenty of large towels for everyone. The beds were so comfy and sofas in the living area we’re a great add with the foosball table with an elliptical machine. We traveled with small children-there was cups, cutlery, bowls, and plates for kids to use which for us was a plus. The kids room had a cute table for imaginary play with night lights.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and peaceful cabin! The host went above and beyond on basic neccesities in the kitchen and bathrooms! Well decorated! The hot tub was amazing to just relax and enjoy the stars at night! My only true complaint is the bed is a little high to get into and sqeaks when moving around. But other than that I give it 5 stars! Easy door access, host provider all necessary information before our stay, secluded away from the city but a 10min drive into town for the store or restaurants for eating! We didnt use the fire pit but it was nice, chairs provided for sitting, and wood provided to start a fire."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is absolute magic! The most perfect location ever. This cabin sits on a little slice of heaven - about a 12 minute drive to everything you could need in town, yet a secluded peaceful cabin in the woods. The views are phenomenal and the extra little touches around the house make it feel so warming. It's all about the little things, like a book that allows other guests to share what they liked around the area; to usb charging ports next to the beds to make it easier to charge your devices. The hot tub is an amazing feature at this location as it is the perfect way to relax and enjoy the beauty all around you. Arron and Michelle were absolutely fantastic when it came to communication, accommodating to our needs and helping us navigate around the area. This was one of the best and most incredible places I've stayed. Highly recommend and would give it way more than the 5 star max."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a large family group that this place accommodated easily. We were able to enjoy the peaceful atmosphere and not bother the neighbors.

I would especially like to thank Michelle for always checking on us and being super responsive to any questions we had. 100% recommend.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A little slice of heaven with this beautiful cabin! We immediately felt right at home and had everything we needed for our stay. Will definitely book again in the future!

2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"We stayed at Aaron’s place to visit with our son who was graduating from basic training. It was an amazing alternative to staying in a hotel.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,an amazing place to stay
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"We loved the stay. It was clean, beautiful and peaceful. The hosts are so friendly and very responsive. We highly recommend booking here!"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"The cabin was beautiful inside and out. The place was clean, comfortable, and stocked with everything we needed for the weekend."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,The cabin was beautiful! We rented it for my sons Army basic training graduation and it gave everyone a peaceful place to relax! The host is very responsive. I will return just for a peaceful getaway!
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"Everything was great, clean and well appointed. very peaceful location and close to Fort Leonard Wood."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing experience at the Tombstone Cabin. Ideal location for our trip. Great surrounding restaurants. Our group will be booking again in the future.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed the house- very comfortable and had everything we needed and then some! Very welcoming home with plenty of space to share family time all together or go off to our separate spaces for reading, gaming, etc. The hot tub was an added bonus and the view of the stars from the back deck was gorgeous! The owners were very easy to communicate with and it is clear that they put a lot of love and care into their rental for your enjoyment- from the welcome note (thank you again!) to the small details that are so big like leaving a washing machine pod & dryer sheet (that was a life saver with a little one)…we felt like we were staying at a friend’s house. Very close to Fort Leonard Wood and all the stores/restaurants in the area to include the quirky area known as Uranus (yes, it is awkwardly spectacular for all the reasons you would expect). Would definitely rent this home again if life brings us back to Missouri. Thank you so much for such a great experience!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Don’t hesitate - book the cabin! It was even more spacious and beautiful in person. You will not be disappointed. I grew up in Steelville (known for cabins/floating) & this beats any local resort by a mile. The kitchen is big enough for making a nice dinner. There is plenty cabinet space for organizing food and belongings. The bath & shower in the master room is to die for. Water pressure is great & gets super hot. The living area is sooo cozy & the patio is spacious with a hot tub. It stormed during our trip, but the fire pit set up they had was adorable too. If you have kids, they have the perfect room set up for them with two loft beds, a pull out couch, roomy closet & tv set up. My son has ASD, and had no issues being scared or feeling uncomfortable. They had fans and lamps in the lofts for him. Usually he’s dying to get home, this time I had to make him to leave he was so happy. Hosts are great, neighbors are quiet. Plenty of privacy while still being close to town. 11/10 spot!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Without a doubt, best Airbnb possible in the entire area! Absolutely AMAZING hosts, and a beautiful cabin! 10/10 recommend for anyone visiting the area!!!!!!! If I’m ever back in that area, I will absolutely be staying there!!"

2023-04-01,5,Group trip,Aaron and his wife were great at accommodating and responding to questions. The hot tub was great for my friends and I in the evening. We walked the dead end road for over a mile and such friendly neighbors and peaceful area. Was a great place for our staycation.
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,Love how close it was to the base
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Without a doubt will try to go back here. No worries, we just enjoyed our stay. Any questions or concerns Aaron was quick to respond. Thank you and hope to be back."
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,great place to stay very nice place and very clean. I would definitely recommend this place and would definitely stay again. I was there for my Sons military graduation and it was very close to base and easy to get to. Definitely way better than a motel.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a cool cabin! Definitely will be back!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful experience from start to finish. Great location close to the FLW base. Kitchen was well stocked with pots and pans. Bedrooms were super comfortable, and the living room was amazing. Appreciated all the furniture outside! Very pleasant stay. Home away from home with great furniture and decorating.
💯 percent loved it"
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"The cabin was very comfortable and clean. We felt very welcome and at home at all times. We would highly recommend this place to anyone. The location to Ft.Leonard Wood was perfect, ten minutes to the front gate. Plus multiple restaurants within ten minutes."

2023-02-01,5,Group trip,Great stay at the cabin. We had a graduation ceremony at Fort Leonard Wood and this location was so convenient. The cabin was larger than expected. The hot tub was great! Had everything we needed. Thank you!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our stay was nothing short of amazing everything was completely accurate based on the description and the amenities we were giving great recommendations for places to visit because we aren’t familiar with the area. The cabin was beautiful the surroundings were fantastic. My kids love the hot tub and the fire pit. It couldn’t have been a better vacation. Thank you so much.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy cabin! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here! Very comfortable with lots of extras. Rent it…you wont be disappointed.
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"The place was exceptionally clean, beds were amazingly comfy and everything was easy to figure out. When we had questions on the surroundings on where to go Aaron was more than helpful with detailed locations. We used the cabin for a quick stay for a retirement party on Fort Leonard Wood and if we ever had any other business on this post I would save the time trying to find anywhere else and would hope this place would be available."
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,Gear hosts! Ran a wine opener out to us!! Great responsiveness.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved everything, u spent most of the time in a spa and gaming 😉. Very relaxing ☺️"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved the location and ease of direction to the base. This location is within military base boundaries for family day pass leave which made this a plus. Was able to take our son and his battle buddy for a day off base and family cooking. It snowed when we were there so was unable to use the spa however it was easily accessible. Bathroom was gorgeous with amazing water pressure and hot water. Owner was flexible with checkin time which helped so we could empty the car to make room for the guys. Short distance from Walmart and food locations. Definitely a great find.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,We were looking for a small getaway and our stay at the cabin was exactly what we needed. Pictures will not do justice for how beautiful this cabin is. I thought it was very interesting to see the history behind the cabin and how well they have transformed it. We really enjoyed the outdoor hot tub and appreciated the host greatly for accommodating us on our trip. Very quick and easy to get in contact with if you need anything at all. Very highly recommend!!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Aaron’s cabin is absolutely amazing! So quiet and relaxing! The cabin was so clean and decorated very nice! So many nice touches throughout. We sat out back in hot tub and had such a relaxing evening! Aaron is extremely responsive and goes above and beyond! We can’t wait to return! Highly recommend!
