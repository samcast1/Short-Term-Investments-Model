2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Both the Hot house and Sweatshop were absolutly amazing!! This was the cleanest place I've ever stayed and their attention to detail is amazing. I loved all of the different lighting both indoors and out. This is the perfect place for an anniversary trip!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The HotHouse and SweatShop were an amazing combination for my weekend stay with my newly wed wife and I. The first thing that caught our eye when we entered the house was the amazing card, champagne and chocolates from the host! The house was everything and more. We explored and used every amenity to include the hot tub, jacuzzi tub in the house and the SweatShop had everything we desired and so much more. This weekend allowed us to not only unwind and enjoy our mini honeymoon, but also allowed us to explore and do things we only dreamed of. We are ready to plan our second trip back to this amazing combo place in the middle of nowhere! Thank you for a wonderful weekend stay at your place and highly recommend this to all looking to get away and enjoy trying things outside the norm and trying what your wildest dreams and desires want and need! Lance and Jackie!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had an amazing stay at Juliana's. I would highly recommend and will be back soon
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such an idyllic trip! Went to celebrate my fianc√©e‚Äôs 30th birthday and we were so upset to leave, we about cried! The place has everything you need and the details are immaculate. It‚Äôs set far enough out to be private and serene, but close to lots of restaurants and needs within a few minutes away.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,very far the place for couple me and my babygirl have ever been.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here so much the first time, we ended up coming back JUST to stay here! That should tell you all you need to know! üòä Definitely one of the best Airbnb's I've ever stayed in and I do NOT say that lightly. I've been using Airbnb since 2017."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have no words to describe our experience at Juliana and Mike‚Äôs place. My wife and I are in shock at how much fun we had spending our first wedding anniversary here. We are also equally depressed that we have to go back to reality when spending two days in sexy PARADISE. The place was SPOTLESS, everything was labeled clearly for our use, the bed was amazingly comfortable, the hot tub was steamy in more ways than one üòçüòç And don‚Äôt get us started on the sweatshop‚Ä¶ Had us seeing stars as we left that place each night!!! You CANNOT come here without renting The Sweatshop!!!!! We had trouble deciding where to spend time, we just kept going back and forth. They also were amazing and left us some champagne and chocolates for our anniversary! They had basic condiments and seasonings as well if you are too busy to leave the house for food üòã We are already making plans to come back. 10/10 experience!!! Thank you guys soooo much!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My advice‚Ä¶ BOOK NOW!!! This place was an absolute dream! A romantic wonderland! My husband and I traveled here specifically for this place and it exceeded expectations! The Hot House was so incredibly inviting and relaxing. Plenty of space to enjoy each other! The property is extremely private so we felt comfortable no matter where we spent our time. Juliana was incredibly amazing! She always responded to our questions within an hour and was extremely helpful and friendly. The Hot House was amazing on its own but without spoiling any surprises, The SWEATSHOP was the icing on the cake! We were here all week and were so sad to leave! We have had so many people asking for the information to book and we‚Äôll recommend this property every single time! Already planning to come back at least once a year! It‚Äôs just that good and I promise there‚Äôs no place else that is like this or better than this! Our only complain is that we didn‚Äôt book to stay longer! Don‚Äôt walk, RUN to book this place!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The only problem with this rental is that the pictures and description cant really tell you How FREAKIN COOL this place is. The amount of thought that went into EVERY aspect of this place was Super Impressive to say the least. Very Clean and organized. Questions and request were answered quickly. The Entire Experience was a Home Run. Bravo Juliana and Mike. We will be back often.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at the Hothouse! It had so many things to do and so many comforts. I adored the bathtub üòç the hot tub was peaceful and you could even see the TV from it so that was nice. An unexpected but nice bonus was the espresso maker. Being able to make good coffee was definitely a huge bonus
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We REALLY enjoyed our stay here! It was very clean & beautifully decorated. Juliana was an awesome host and left us a sweet little treat and card for our anniversary which was such a nice touch! Our Sweatshop experience was absolutely FANTASTIC and I highly recommend adding this to your stay! We will definitely be back to stay!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My partner and I absolutely loved staying at Juliana and Michael‚Äôs place. I booked for a post - valentine‚Äôs day surprise and we were blown away. It was the only house in sight, with woods and trees surrounding - made for a very private and peaceful location! ;)
The place was squeaky clean & had so many, fun surprises scattered around. The bed was the most comfortable bed i‚Äôve ever slept in.
Make sure to utilize the mounts scattered around!! We had so much fun making movies! The attention to detail is simply perfect and we were in awe with the ambiance of the place.
DO NOT MISS OUT ON THE SWEATSHOP!! This was an incredibly surreal experience. We loved being able to act on our fantasies and try new things we wouldn‚Äôt be able to try otherwise. It is 110% worth it!
Overall, our favorite parts were talking by the fire pit, relaxing in the pool with some drinking games & music, and ending the night with a fun soak in the tub. We can‚Äôt wait to return soon! <3"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Don‚Äôt think just book !!! Juliana‚Äôs slice of heaven is amazing !!!! 12 out of 12 !!! So much thought was put into this treasure ! Every nook and cranny was sensual and erotic and all the right ways ! Def will be booking again ü§çü§ç
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My wife and I decided to have a little getaway for Valentine‚Äôs Day - away from the kids, work, etc. We have been together 15 years, married 6, and have always been a bit spicy but wanted to take it to the next level. This place was IT‚Ä¶ Between the hot tub, pole, tub for two, and comfortable bed at the Hothouse to the absolutely mind blowing Sweatshop‚Ä¶ we had a blast. We tried every single thing offered between the two places and spent HOURS with each other. Love and passion was absolutely rediscovered here and we left feeling even more connected to each other. Juliana thought of everything - from the decor of both places, to the amenities, to the little details like lots and lots of towels, placement of things, etc. If you‚Äôre looking for something new, or a place to test out desires, that is it. Highly recommend the space and the host! We WILL be back!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Stayed the night for my boyfriend‚Äôs birthday at the hot house and we also booked the sweatshop. We really had an amazingly spicy time together!

I mentioned when booking it was a mini getaway for his birthday and they even left a birthday card and chocolates for him üòä We‚Äôll definitely be returning!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a gorgeous property ! I loved the gold aesthetic and the coffee set up was super cool.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for our 25th anniversary getaway and let me say we will be going back. We opted for the optional sweatshop that was just what we needed. So many things to try and do.
The house is clean with lots of surprises to find all around. There is a nice area outside to hang out even though it was too cold out this time for that so we just kept going between the two spaces.
We cannot wait to go back!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is so unique. Is not just a place to stay is an experience that every couple should have in their life. We went there to celebrate our anniversary and we love everything about this place. They had champagne and chocolates waiting for us and rose petals everywhere when we arrived. We were there for three nights and we didn't have to go out anywhere. From the hot tub to the big screen TV, the grill, and the coffee!! They help us with everything we need and even give us tips on how to use some of the amenities of the place. Everything was clean, the kitchen was fully prepared for our cooking needs.

She even left us a card with wine and chocolates because I had mentioned it was our 20th anniversary getaway. That kind gesture was much appreciated. Everything was as described but we were in awe of how much thought went into the decor, we kept finding little things we hadn't seen at first glance and loved the attention to detail. It felt like our own little slice of heaven. The Sweat Shop had everything we could have asked for and more! It was so much fun to get to spend quality time with my wife and just enjoy all of each other in absolutely solitude and no distractions. We will be booking here again in the future."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I rented Juliana‚Äôs place for the night and it was AMAZING. If you are looking for a place to reconnect with your spouse, you have found it. They pay very close attention to detail, and you will lack for nothing for an intimate night.
I would 100% recommend to also rent the sweat shop. It is literally 2 feet from the house and super private. The host came and showed us around and explained everything to us, it was super fun to explore all of that in our own privacy, as we have never been in an adults only space like that and it was worth every dollar.
Both owners were fantastic at communication and extremely responsive. We will definitely be back! Thank you for hosting us!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place.!!!! The place is exactly as described plus more.!! Wonderful experience for my husband and I. We will definitely visit again!

Definitely recommend to anyone wanting a nice sensual getaway with their loved one!!! Thanks Juliana for having this place. We can‚Äôt wait to book with you again!!!!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Anything and everything to the very last detail is well thought out and executed on. A very nice ‚Äúwelcome handbook‚Äù awaits you to layout your stay. Juliana is great with responding if you do have any questions or concerns! My partner and I had a WONDERFUL stay. We didn‚Äôt leave the property once we arrived and still didn‚Äôt get to enjoy everything we wanted to do while we were there since there is so much to enjoy. From soaking in the jacuzzi, to lounging in the living/bedroom. The house is great and relaxing. Everything is clean and nice. The upkeep of everything is solid. Definitely do the add-on, very worth it! If you‚Äôre on the fence about staying here, do it! It is soooo worth it. My partner and I will for sure be back!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This has to be my favorite stay. My fianc√© and I had a great experience here. I might have to see what their party rules are and I might have to see about possibly throwing one. This was my favorite stay ever on Airbnb and I definitely plan to book again.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything was amazing for our stay and the home was exactly as described! Location is very private but easy to get to and the house was immaculate. The host really thought of everything and made it so easy to use the house and everything it had to offer. The bathroom is incredible and there was tons of space and more than you can even get into in just one night. We will definitely be back!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First, her response is quick! We booked her place for an intimate weekend to celebrate our anniversary. Reserving was quick and easy. We loved how truly private and CLEAN it was. The house had everything we needed, it was perfect. Fresh linen, fresh hot tub water, and the decor is soooo pretty! You will definitely love this place, highly recommended for any couple looking for an intimate experience."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was great this has to be simply the best experience I‚Äôve ever had in couples travel. Juliana is super friendly and don‚Äôt get me started on the dungeon. Ask her about the dungeon you won‚Äôt be disappointed! We had a blast folks kept asking us where it was we told no one lol wanted to keep this as our special place can‚Äôt wait to revisit this property. I had fun shooting some hoops, grilling, cooking, out doors all the land there it‚Äôs so quiet and peaceful no neighbors or noise my favorite was the hot tub out back and the golden throne to handle you business in the beautiful bathroom I also love the luxury of the patio set up and front porch over all 10 stars man you won‚Äôt be disappointed here. I tried to add additional two nights but it was already booked days ago I waited to late availability here is limited because it‚Äôs new but becoming high demand! It‚Äôs worth every penny she charged, it was a great time for a great couple of nights! Have fun be sure2leave her ur feedback."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Juliana was a wonderful and responsive host! Tbh I was a little hesitant about booking this more pricey location, but it actually turned out to be a sparkling gem in the sea of mediocre, over-priced Airbnb‚Äôs and was worth every cent!. The way that Juliana turned such an unlikely place into a sexy and elegant playground for adults with just every detail imaginable blew my mind! The pics on the listing just cannot do justice for the amount of creativity and attention to detail Juliana brought to bring this fun filled attraction to life. One of my absolute fave features- there are two light switches in the house ‚Äúparty‚Äù and ‚Äúneon‚Äù, flip the switch and hello! The place is transformed for the perfect party atmosphere. <3"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Peaceful and romantic for our anniversary it was perfect!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I needed some time to ourselves, this trip was a quick trip but so much fun! Let‚Äôs just say you WON‚ÄôT be disappointed!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Stayed at Bradley‚Äôs tiny home for a week. What a lovely tiny home this was. It is as pictured, I was amazed by the space utilization and how everything I needed was just at a arm‚Äôs reach. They even provided coffee pods which is rare at Airbnbs these days. They have so many storage space, I was surprised at how thoughtfully this space wasbuilt. I didnt even have to use all storage units. They even have a closet space.
All in all its lovely.
There isn‚Äôt much to do around the area. I was a bit worried about safety but the home is inside a gated property and felt completely safe, didnt have any issues at all. I drove back few times pretty late at night and felt completely safe. So if you feel the area seems sketchy while driving there, you wont have to worry about it.
The only issue I had was with the internet. It is pretty slow and was spotty every day. Had issues streaming movies and even when attending online meetings. Besides this everything else was great. Would stay again"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"For someone traveling solo the tiny home fit my needs really well! It‚Äôs nice having a whole place to yourself.

Love the interconnected outdoor space, and if the koi pond actually comes together it'll really be something special.
He was very responsive and communicative throughout, and even accepted a groceries delivery for us (and packed it away) before we arrived without a problem. Not that I'm wanting to set overly high expectations for other guests.
Thanks a lot Bradley! If you're ever in Australia, hopefully we'll be able to host you in *our* tiny house one day."

the tiny home itself was adorable. My boyfriend and I stayed for one night for business trip.

Hand crafted by Bradley himself, this space was very very modern and homey. Very elegant touches such as beautiful driftwood on the walls as decor. Light dimmers, a double wide kitchen sink, an extremely comfortable bed and more."

2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing tiny house with everything you need! You can tell that the owner lived in it for some time with many thoughtfully detailed touches included throughout. Some Airbnbs these days can feel plain or uninviting but not here! Would definitely stay again.
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Bradley‚Äôs tiny house is awesome! It‚Äôs very clean and very comfortable. We felt at home. You can tell a lot of time and effort was put into this tiny house. It‚Äôs creatively decorated and has an relaxing vibe. You feel like you are staying in a tiny beach house next to the ocean. My 6 year old son with sensory issues loved the moving blue lights on the porch. Out of our two week vacation he was the most relaxed staying in the tiny house, it made for a relaxing time for me. I only wish I had booked it for longer. My 8 year old who is gifted was fascinated with the construction and design of the tiny home. My son enjoyed looking at all of the treasures that tell a story. It was a great place to unplug.
I appreciated the camera and heavy duty locks on the door as I was traveling alone with my two sons. I felt very safe. Bradley greeted us shortly after we arrived. He was very prompt in response to any questions I had. He was very professional and down to earth. We enjoyed our time so much that my boys want to come back again next year. Our stay in Bradley‚Äôs home far exceeded my expectations!

We were able to use the composting toilet without any difficulty. The rest of the unit had everything you need for cooking a small meal. We were impressed. Bradley was very responsive and helpful when we booked last minute. We hope to visit again soon.
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is truly a hand crafted gem, it‚Äôs amazing and cozy.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It‚Äôs a small place, barely a bedroom and a tiny kitchen and bathroom. But it has been cleverly designed to be welcoming and restful, a tiny oasis in a big city full of plants, candles, and pillows. It was just what we needed.
We left most of the lights off the whole time we were there to make a cave away from the harsh sunlight of Jacksonville. The neighborhood is pleasant and walkable and there are tons of nice restaurants and shops very close by.
We received several emails about getting in and amenities and anything I messaged got a response almost immediately. Very satisfied with the stay."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Whimsical, Majestic,Peaceful!!! Those are the words to describe Nancy and Ron‚Äôs place. Not only was Nancy and Ron proactive and effectively responsive; they provided a sense of security. The modern day chic and harmonious decor made this place a home away from home and a environment to step away from life in. Everything looks as described in the pictures but seeing it in person gives you a feeling that‚Äôs closure to nature and peace. This made my stay in Jacksonville one to remember.

I will definitely be back each time I need to visit!

I hope to stay again!"

Ethan and his family went out of their way to make sure anyone staying there had all the things they could need incase anyone forgot something or incase they ran out and needed items they couldn‚Äôt find or didn‚Äôt want to have to spend money on. There‚Äôs also a guest book previous guests have signed stating where they were from, their favorite memories and giving recommendations of different places to visit while in town.

I really appreciated being able to freely use what I needed, especially the washer and dryer. They both have such good spirits and the room is warm (in feel, not temperature) and comfortable. Everything was as pictured, clean and the decor inspired a sense of positivity. It is quiet and peaceful and they really made sure not to make noise when they thought I might be asleep. I also appreciate how understanding and flexible they are. I had some changes to my itinerary and they were very accommodating. Vicky asked how the temperature was to make sure that I was comfortable and said I could adjust it. That was thoughtful. They are very friendly and I enjoyed speaking with both of them. They also gave me my space and I knew when I was in the room that I would have my privacy and not be disturbed. I felt very comfortable keeping to myself to take care of what I needed and also welcome to interact. Everything is spelled out in the check-in instructions and Vicky is very communicative. Parking is convenient. I look forward to my return."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jc‚Äôs home was exactly as listed. We were late arriving so she left the lights on and closed the blinds. Lovely touch. There were ample supplies at the house, not like some where there is nothing at all.
Our only problem was the heat. Upstairs in the night it got very hot. However, we did not reach out to Jc about this since our stay was so short.
We would definitely stay there again‚Ä¶.beautiful spot"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was very clean, beautifully decorated and very bright! Everything is new, with fully stocked kitchen and comfortable furniture. Beds were comfortable with nice linen and blankets. Everything was clean, fresh and felt like home. Jc is really good host and had lots of suggestions for our weekend trip with kids."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"my husband and i had the pleasure of staying at casa de mi padre while i recovered from a specialized medical procedure. while our visit to jax wasn't a fun one, this airbnb's comfort (tricked out recliners!) and homey touches (makeup wipes by the bed!) provided some much needed ease and lightness. jc was the perfect host and proactively reached out to help us strategize post-surgery sleeping spots since it's a split level, which was really touching.
the only nit i can pick is that, since it's a newer building, noises from the neighborhood and nearby expressway were a touch loud. (and we're from chicago!) but we also came during what turned out to be bike week at daytona, so it's def not the airbnb's fault lol.
i can imagine this spot is perfect for families, or for anyone looking for a truly hospitable experience. i'll be thinking fondly of casa de mi padre!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our first time staying at Jc's Airbnb. It was perfect for us! My husband and I were there five nights and our grandchildren joined us for two of those nights.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My son and I stayed here for the weekend to attend a golf tournament. The house is really clean and neat. It has a fully stocked kitchen. The beds are comfortable. The furniture in the living room is comfortable and useful (loved the recliner couch!). The neighborhood is relatively quiet. JC does the extras that make you feel welcome and special (little welcome note, small gift items good for watching golf, small waters, etc). JC communicated well and proactively. It is close to the beach and TPC. This is definitely with the price and was perfect for what we wanted. I would definitely stay here again."

The area where it is located is safe & well lit. There are many stores & restaurants within a 5-7 minute drive. Attractions are also a short driving distance. Because the property is so new, our Apple Maps couldn‚Äôt locate it so we had to use G. Maps. We would definitely recommend staying here."

Extremely clean and had snacks and waters for guests, literally coming back in 4 days and will use this as my weekend spot when I visit.

I would highly recommend a stay at Captain's Quarters!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Excellent! This was a last-minute decision as we were traveling down to Florida for a wedding and needed to stop for the night. Jason had no hesitation to welcome us so late and even offered a late check out if needed. The captains quarters was spotless, and no details overlooked.

2023-02-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"The neighborhood is very walkable and our parking space was good. Unfortunately, we did not leave very high marks for Jason‚Äôs place and this is why: The photos make it look like this is a cozy place but we didn‚Äôt find it to be. The stairs are precarious and without tread on the steps it is dangerous. The photos don‚Äôt make it obvious that this is a garage with garage door tracks on the ceiling and they are low. My husband is 6‚Äô4 , he ducked his head a lot while downstairs. The shower doors are not secure and the shower as a whole wasn‚Äôt good, the water went hot and cold the entire shower time. I would say that the place was clean but the cheapest amenities were used i.e. coffee, toilet paper, soap etc. The air conditioning and heat worked well but overall the bad out weighed the good."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Jason‚Äôs place was everything we were looking for! We had nice long walks with our dog to Avondale, and were able to explore all the popular areas during our week-long stay.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great Place.... Love the neighborhood!!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I am a germaphobe, and the first thing I said to my husband was that this is the cleanest Airbnb we have ever stayed in. The cleanliness made me feel relaxed immediately. The living area was really comfortable, and although it was an experience to have a spiral staircase, it kept our little dogs downstairs where they belonged. It was just charming. The bedroom and bath area were tranquil. Well supplied kitchen, and very good instructions for wifi. I would check for availability here first if I need a place to stay in the Jacksonville area."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Guys this place is amazing, The captain quarters is modern in design, it's decor and sudden nuances make it clear that the garage was remodeled with serious foresight.

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My stay with Jason was perfect. The location is in a great neighborhood, close to everything one may need (food, groceries, shops, restaurants) and centrally located, making Jacksonville exploration easy and convenient. The quarters were immaculate, well-designed and as beautiful as the photos. The place is stocked with all you need for daily life, including a vacuum and mini iron (I was very impressed by these two items). The bed and bedding was super comfy; upstairs was like being in a luxurious treehouse, with vaulted ceilings and windows looking out onto lush greenery. I especially appreciated the off-street parking between the guest house and main house - it couldn't be more secure. Jason was readily available, super helpful and wonderfully accommodating. I would highly recommend his place and would definitely stay here again."

Jason was an accommodating host and we enjoyed our interactions with him.
We‚Äôll be back!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome stay. It was perfect for me and my BF. It was very clean, cute, and quaint. I would def. recommend staying here if you want to be near downtown. It was a safe neighborhood that isn't too far from the beach. Thank you Jason!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved the bamboo detailing! Thank you so much accommodating us. 5 stars!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place was so perfect! Top notch host! Me and my wife were burnt out and needed a short escape. This space turned out to be exactly what the doctor ordered. Thank you Captain Jason you rock and so does your space!
2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay! Cute quaint spot perfect for my staycation with the Missus!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay. Really unique home layout and perfect for two people. Captain Jason was terrific - very engaging and communicative. We wish we'd had more time to spend with him as he has vast knowledge about Jacksonville. The location is close to anything you'll need (coffee/bagel shop in walking distance, grocery store the other direction). Jason was also very welcoming to our dog. If you have large dogs it could be a tight fit depending on how energetic they are. Also tough for them to navigate the spiral staircase (although Jason is working on an external staircase). Our dog sleeps downstairs at home so had no issue staying downstairs. If you have a dog recommend you speak with Jason about it!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Feels like home! Jason is a great host, he was very good at communicating and was also super nice. First time visiting jax and will definitely be booking with Jason next time I come back!"

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great and super convenient location. Safe neighborhood, private quarters. Jason was readily available with anything we needed and had great recommendations. Very friendly and all the essentials were in reach. Highly recommend!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Hands down one of the best Airbnb experiences my wife and I have ever had. Jason accommodated us and our pets for 6 weeks while we waited for our home to be built. The Captains Quarter was situated in the heart of Avondale and I'm will forever be a fan of the area. You could take a stroll down the street and have plenty of options for food and drinks. Jason is an amazing host and gave us complete privacy and we sometimes forgot he was even there. I highly recommend staying in the Captain's Quarters, you won't be disappointed you did!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Amazing stay in JAX!! The captain‚Äôs quarters quickly became a home away from home, and I would definitely stay here again if I was back in town.
Jason was super attentive, helpful and friendly. Always had suggestions for things to do in town & was quick to respond if I ever needed him.
Thank you for being such an incredible host!!
I did a long-term stay for about 4 months, the place is perfectly equipped with all you may need during your stay."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The Captain‚Äôs Quarters was perfect! It is located near all the fun restaurants, shops, and green parks in Avondale and was a short drive to all the fun of Riverside and Jacksonville. It was wonderful to be able to stop for a nice breakfast as I took the dog on his morning walk to Fishweir or Boone Park through lovely neighborhoods. The house itself is well designed, comfortable, and comes with everything you need for your stay. I loved having access to the W/D each week! It was great to have the privacy and quiet of a house, but a place near easy entertainment. Captain Jason even had recommendations for fun dog parks around town. My dog and I enjoyed our stay immensely and will be back! Thanks Captain Jason!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"My husband, my little dog brwnie and I are traveling to Jacksonville and we rented the apartment for a month, the place is super well located, a 10-minute walk from the restaurant area, in a quiet neighborhood with many trees and you can breathe nature, the architecture of the houses is very nice. The apartment is perfectly laid out to have a comfortable stay, you have everything you need, well equipped kitchen, large TV space to eat and work. The decor is very stylish, it has a large garden, and our pet enjoys it very much. Jason is very friendly and is always attentive to help you, he has many recommendations on what to do locally, if you go on Christmas, don't miss St. Agust√≠n and if you like the sweet, don't miss out on mixed feelings. We loved everything, highly recommended!! We hope to go back! Thank you captain!!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Jason is a wonderful host. His place is clean and located in an excellent area. Overall great experience
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We enjoyed staying at this extended stay Airbnb for 2 weeks. It had a kitchenette we did use but it was also easy to get food deliveries. We were within walking distance of a couple restaurants including Bagel Love, and had a dedicated parking spot. Our host was very responsive to our needs. At one point there was a thunderstorm and the power went out briefly and then the internet was down. He had it fixed very quickly. We were also glad to have on site laundry accessible at the main house via the back door. Of note, the spiral staircase was hard for our small dog to navigate so we did carry him up and down. It was close to NAS Jacksonville where I was working and an easy commute. We would recommend for a couple or individual for extended stay."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Jason is a wonderful host! He was very accommodating and personable. I really appreciated being able to communicate with him easily.
The space itself is very comfortable. We stayed for about a month and found that the kitchen and bathroom amenities were sufficient for us to live pretty normally. It was very clean when we arrived and we had access to supplies to do our best to keep it that way.
I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to stay here again if we needed to!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you need a place to stay in Jacksonville select Marianna‚Äôs place. The location is near downtown in a trendy area with lots of restaurants and shops. We loved the beautiful houses in the neighborhood . The house is unbelievable! It‚Äôs so beautifully decorated. I was most amazed at the extra touches Marianna does. There were snacks and drinks (water and some pop) in the refrigerator. There was a great selection of coffee and tea. The bathroom had all toiletries you would need: toothbrushes, suntan lotion, toothpaste, etc. The bed is so comfortable and the bathroom is gorgeous! We took pictures of it and texted them to our kids because the bathroom was so impressive. The weather did not cooperate so we did not use the outdoor area but it is so pretty and relaxing.
Mariana was easy to contact and answered our questions right away. I hope to be back in Jacksonville so we can stay at her place again . I thought the rental price was very resonable."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,One of the best places that me and my husband have visited everything was provided at the house unlike most places the only thing was that we didn‚Äôt know that we have to ask for the pool to be heated so make sure you ask for that.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second time staying at Marianna's Place. Her place remains at the top of my list of the best Airbnbs I have stayed at. Marianna continues to be such a sweet person. She made my second stay just as wonderful as the first time. It was my birthday and she made so special by leaving me a bottle of delicious wine, snacks, water, and soda products. Her place is super clean, peaceful, and the decor is beautiful. The soaker tub is relaxing and the ambiance is unmatched. The neighborhood is safe and there were no issues with parking. The pool is always beautiful. Her place is a gem. There are ample delicious eateries and restaurants in the area. Book her place. You will not be disappointed. I promise. I will be returning again and again."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time at Marianna‚Äôs place. She was so welcoming and provided us with extra amenities upon check-in. Her location was only a mile and half from the stadium which allowed us for a swift walk home after the football game. Appreciate the hospitality.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute little gem of a house and property overall. This was probably in my top 3 of air bnbs we have ever stayed in. It‚Äôs very well laid out for the space and has lots of convenient little touches. We didn‚Äôt use the pool but it looked amazing and the deck space spacious.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying here! We were so excited to come back.
Marianna shines as a host! She is super responsive, she wants you to be comfortable and enjoy every minute of your stay. Last year, we gave her a small suggestion of making a door that was kind of loud quieter and she had the improvement made right away and we were pumped to come back this year to a truly perfect house with a quiet door. She goes out of her way - best Air BNB host we have ever had. This year, we accidentally broke an item and she was super kind about the incident and just wanted to make sure we were okay (which we were.)
The living room, bedroom and bathroom are all super cute, comfy and well-stocked.
We splurged for pool heat this year and using the pool made the trip PERFECT for us.
I am always telling people about this listing. Book away and enjoy the nicest little Air BNB ever! We will be back!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Growing up in this area it‚Äôs easy to forget there are little gems like this place hidden right around the corner. This home was very beautiful and inviting and it is definitely a place I felt I could escape too for a few days to forget all my worries, the lack of a place to cook honestly made me feel happier having too cook is a daily stressor for me personally the pool area is gorgeous but it‚Äôs definitely better at night it‚Äôs not the most private pool in the world with the over look from next door but still a nice spot to sit and relax, the bathroom was the cherry on top for me really with the beautiful tub and how you can just sink and watch tv and wash away all your worries 10/10 I will be back here"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Marianna was an awesome host! The space was super modern and very clean. We‚Äôd definitely stay again if we‚Äôre back in Jacksonville!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My husband and I were looking for a quick and quiet private staycation away from responsibilities to celebrate his birthday. I wish we had more time at Marianna‚Äôs zen retreat. We were blown away by how relaxing this home is. I wish we never had to leave. She goes above and beyond as a host. We hope to stay here again and again. Also wish she could come renovate my home because the decor and design were something out of a luxury magazine.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for a concert and a relaxing weekend for my birthday. The bed was comfortable and we fell asleep quickly. The bathroom was peaceful and I enjoyed taking my time getting ready every day and even sitting at the vanity to do my makeup. We felt right at home as it was so cozy. The TV in the bathroom was the best part so we could keep up with some football games! The neighborhood was only a 5 minute drive to Daily's Place/Jaguar Arena. Definitely would recommend for a place to get away, relax, and snuggle in."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better space for a couples getaway! Exactly as pictured.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Marianna‚Äôs place was perfect! So private, cozy, clean, beautiful, and relaxing.

We were also surprised to see the stocked fridge and plentiful supply of hygiene products/necessities. Marianna reached out multiple times to ensure our stay was great and provided local restaurant recommendations - which were all delicious! Location is great! So close to so many things.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves on our stay. The first impression from the outside and the neighborhood was quiet and quaint. Marianna has outdone herself on the decor and amenities. Every second it felt luxurious and yet like home. The pool is a welcomed place to relax into the evening with beautiful ambience after a nice day out. The tub was honestly a place I never wanted to leave. It was sooo peaceful. The provided bath bomb and bath-salts felt like a true pampering. The shower was even better with the amazing tile work and overhead rain head. We cannot wait to comeback and experience this special getaway and Marianna‚Äôs warm hospitality.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful home, same as the pictures<3"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I'm going to be completely transparent. My husband and I were going through a rough patch. I booked this for his birthday in hopes we could rekindle what was lost. This house was so peaceful and allowed us to just love on each other without needing anything. 1st night, ordered a pizza, talked, stayed in the pool and the next day was more relaxing, woke up and immediately spent time by the pool. We needed this and this stay made it easier for us to reconnect. We are rebooking for my birthday because we loved it so much."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were absolutely blown away by this little gem of a house in historic Springfield. We chose this home for a little stay-cation and we left feeling refreshed, rejuvenated, and inspired by our weekend. The attention to detail in this particular home deserves a round of applause. It is so modern with the most charming vintage details. It was so nice to see that they had re-purposed parts of the original home in their remodel. I truly feel that they have thought of EVERYTHING. Most airbnbs come with the bare minimum... not this home. Marianna has made it SO EASY for you to have a worry-free stay. Our entire experience was absolutely incredible and we definitely plan on returning. THANK YOU MARIANNA!"

The extra touches she had to make guest feel comfortable and at home is something I will remember. As a host, she was so easy to communicate with and very flexible.

The place was very clean, modern, had everything we needed to feel at home. Marianna was able to decorate for the special occasion! The bathroom was stunning! The pool was an amazing! The only thing was the VERY spotty wifi connection but we figured to just use one tv at a time or connect our hotspot from our phone to the tv. The location was a little off putting at first glance but we were never bothered and felt safe! An easy location for Uber eats to find us as well lots of options! Also the St. John‚Äôs town center is only about 15mins away with a strip of restaurants & a great time! I definitely recommend Marianna‚Äôs place to everyone! We will be staying again soon! Thank you Marianna!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"2nd time guest @ Zen Garden. All I can say is ‚ÄúZENSATIONAL‚Äù!!! Every single detail has been thought of at this property. Aside from the incredible decor and spa like vibe, there is nothing that the super host has not thought of. It rained during our stay (umbrellas on standby). Scuffed my dress shoes (a full shoe polish kit by the front door!). I ate some spicy shrimp and did not have any antacid tablets (Antacid tablets in the drawer!!!). Complimentary light snacks and hydration available. It‚Äôs almost like if the Zen Garden didn‚Äôt have it, you didn‚Äôt need it! This place checks all the boxes and never disappoints. Within short walking distance of a very delicious eatery. Host incredibly responsive and personable. We are already looking forward to another stay!!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was the perfect getaway for a birthday celebration for myself and my fianc√©. It was quaint and romantic. It was a bit too chilly to take a dip in the pool since we didn‚Äôt plan ahead to ask for it to be heated. Marianna was extremely helpful and communicative! Thank you and we will definitely be back!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful space with everything you may need! Great host!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was Awesome, the lighting , the pool and not to mention the shower ! We had a great time here . Would love to come back again‚Ä¶ ü§ó"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful romantic space to get away.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was perfect for just a little weekend couples getaway. We were extremely happy with how everything was set up.:)
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My four day stay at the cottage was great. It was a restful break from work and family responsibilities. The rain shower was so relaxing and I loved the chandelier in the bathroom. The space was amazingly designed and furnished. Great lighting throughout the house. Marianna was an attentive and thoughtful host. For me, it was time away in luxury by myself."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect spot for a lover's weeked!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have never had an Airbnb experience like this one with Marianna‚Äôs. She was absolutely amazing and so was her space. Her home is not only beautiful but you can tell that she really loves what she does and wants to make sure that her guests enjoy every moment in her home. Me and my husband came on our wedding night and Mariana had a beautiful set up for us when we arrived: balloons, roses, petals, candles, a bath set up and more. Her communication was perfect too. Always responding quick. We had no issues while at her home. An extra thing that I love was how STOCKED her home was. She had games, water, ice, coffee and tea, plenty of towels, sunscreen, makeup removing wipes, a sewing kit, aloe gel for sun burns, and so much more. Anything you could possible need during a stay was already there! Me and my husband can‚Äôt wait to come back again."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was absolutely one of our best experiences with Airbnb. The charm, decor, cleanliness, and comfort of this ""couples retreat"" added value and enjoyment to our experience. Marianna was highly attentive to our needs, communicated with us clearly, and created an incredible sense of hospitality and delight. From the moment we stepped in the door, we were wowed. We cannot wait to come back and would recommend this wonderful and cozy home as highly as any place we have ever stayed."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Let's start with Marianna's hospitality. It is top tier. She was sweet, kind, and made sure my stay was going well. I loved her instructions and recommendations which improved my stay. She's a gem and one of the best host I have came across. Her place is beautiful. I can't say enough as to how beautiful her place is. You have to see it. It was better than the photos. The decor is beautiful, the bed is super comfy, and home is filled with unique touches, amenities and extras I did not expect. I felt as if I was in an upscale hotel, but with much more to offer. It's a great couple's retreat or a solo traveler self-care refuge. The pool was a bonus. I still would have booked this place without a pool. The neighborhood is diverse, peaceful, and close to cafes and restaurants. I felt very safe. I will book again and again. I am so happy to find this gem. Thank you so much Marianna."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a lovely stay in this beautiful and cozy oasis. The bathroom is awesome and the interior inviting. Restaurants and stores not far. Host responsive and friendly. A place to remember.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My experience was only with the host. She was extremely kind and gave us a partial refund due to an unexpected flight situation. Marianna made the stressful part of cancelling a vacation a very nice experience. We hope to rebook for the summer and get to use that beautiful pool! Thanks for being an understanding and kind host!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is as described, a perfect couple‚Äôs getaway. The residence is quiet, peaceful, and really well designed.
The location is within short drive/Uber from Jacksonvilles restaurant/nightlife locations.

She had wine ready for us with glasses and even a nice card! So thoughtful and it really made our stay special after a long flight.
Check in was very easy as she sent clear and concise instructions well in advance so we were able to come in and relax right away.
She continued to check on us asking if there was anything she could do to improve the quality of the stay and that was a first for me and greatly appreciated.
The space was spotless and looked exactly like the pictures! We were very satisfied and we will most definitely be back!! Thank you so much for a great experience. Book this location! You will definitely not regret it!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This is my 5th business stay at this AirBNB. I love the attention and gratitude that I received. I was blessed with fresh lemons and oranges üçä from Marianna tree. This is my favorite place when I am in Jacksonville.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice home with almost every need met.
We were treated with a bottle of wine upon arrival and softly playing jazz - nice touch!
The rain style shower was like being in the Amazon Rain Forest. Peaceful and relaxing!
Typically we bring our own linens and pillows - this trip they stayed packed away as the sheets and pillows wrapped around us softly and comfortable.
Complementary bath robes to wear to the private pool set in a tropical paradise right downtown Jacksonville.
The only thing lacking was an outdoor grill.
If you find yourself traveling to Jax,FLA - stay here!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful space! Great Communication! Will definitely stay here again!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Much like the other reviews I can imagine are on here for Marianna‚Äôs listing, this place was an oasis away from home. We unfortunately only got one night and a day and half in this beautiful bungalow. Marianna and her team supplied us with things like music playing upon our entrance and security on the outside of the home for our safety. The neighborhood was quiet and hide away from the hustle and bustle but if that keeps you from wanting to pick this place, don‚Äôt! It may not be sandy beaches but the private pool will satisfy that, no sand in all your stuff and plenty of shade if needed. The stay was even granted with refreshments in the fridge and reusable ice in the freezer! The bedroom had some of the softest sheets me and my husband have ever slept in and the bathroom‚Ä¶ well you gotta see it for yourself! immaculate, very well thought out‚Ä¶ i actually thought there wasn‚Äôt a toilet at first because it is a little private area in the corner of the bathroom! forgot your soaps or bubble bath foams‚Ä¶ no worries Marianna even left us items for the bubble bath! We 100% recommend this beautiful bungalow and look forward to coming back very soon for a longer stay!"

The house was very spacious, wonderful neighborhood and it felt like home! Chanda had absolutely everything we needed for a home away from home! So much so we didn‚Äôt have to reach out to Chanda at all! We had no issues! The only time l had to reach out was concerning check out. Our town had just had horrific storms so we didn‚Äôt have power so Chanda allowed us a very extended late check out! Chanda was absolutely awesome! I definitely recommend Chanda‚Äôs home and having her as a host! We will definitely rent with her again!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is my second time enjoying Chanda‚Äôs beautiful home. I highly recommend if you are looking for a quiet, friendly neighborhood with convenient location to restaurants, grocery and main roads.

2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"‚Äú Feels like home‚Äù is the first thing my cousin said when he and his family walked in. As soon as the door opens you are greeted with calming fragrance (I have a thing for how homes smell) and beautiful decor. This is a true family oriented property with a space for kids in the front, a space for teenagers in the media room and relaxing outdoor space for adults. Everything is clean and in working order. The host is the sweetest, she is professional, responsive and flexible. If I could give more than 5 stars I would. We will definitely be reserving this home again, the next time we have family in town. Don‚Äôt hesitate, book this home, you will be glad you did!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,This place was above and beyond our expectations!! Chandra made sure we had everything that we needed during our stay at her place. Everything was right at our fingertips!!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Chanda‚Äôs place was outstanding and much bigger and better than the pictures portrayed it to be. The neighborhood was quiet and well maintained. You could smell the cleanliness as soon as you opened the door. The keyless entry was very easy due to the in depth instructions. We didn‚Äôt cook at the property because we were visiting family but everything you need for preparing meals was provided. I stayed with my two boys. They both enjoyed the game system in the theater room along with the game room provided. Beds slept well for all of us. My favorite was the soaking tub after a long day and the nice stand up shower in the master. Plenty of space for larger families as well. The home was very well appointed. Chanda communicated well before and after the trip and was available if needed during the stay. Close to the interstate as well. We will definitely look into staying here again in the future.

2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"First I want to say this house is immaculate. The pictures does not do it justice. We used the Airbnb to celebrate my son's 18th birthday. This location was perfect for the event. Chanda was very helpful from the very first inquiry to the end. Checkin went very smooth. The house was clean and everything was in place. Their ice machine wasn't working but she had ice waiting when we got there. Also, she got us a few bottles of wine (Which I enjoyed because they are my favorite lol). At the last minute I asked for late checkout and she allowed us to stay a little longer. That was very helpful since the night before we didn't do much cleaning after the party. This home also has an outdoor space which is screened in. So we didn't have to worry about any bugs in this Florida heat. All in all I would definitely go through her again. If you are coming to Florida I definitely recommend her. It's worth the money!!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"If I could give this 10 stars I would! What a beautiful home. The pictures are good but the house is better. We had an extended stay while we were waiting for construction to finish. It was a stressful time for us. We arrived at the house to find a beautiful basket which was so thoughtful. When I sat down on the sectional in the living room I thought I might never get up. I might have shed a few tears when I left because I will miss it that much. The home is very elegant but so comfortable. The neighborhood is quiet and lovely. You could not ask for a better host. She was such a pleasure. If you are coming to Jacksonville and this house is available, you need to stay here."

Chanda's hospitality and professionalism was awesome, I mean AWESOME!!!!..Before I showed up to the home I mentioned to Chanda that I was coming to Jacksonville to celebrate my birthday...So you can Imagine how surprised I was when I saw two bottles of wine in a beautiful wrapped basket,with two ballons that said Happy Birthday, along with two gift cards, one for Winn Dixie and the other for a restaurant called Cubbys which was less then 5 minutes. away. Thank You so much Chanda for everything."

They let us check in a little early which was very appreciated since this we were traveling with a wheelchair and gear."

2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,Kayla and Tim were amazing. They were helpful and friendly and accommodating even when we asked dumb questions. The construction on the main road was a bit disruptive. Of course they could not do anything about that
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Kayla was excellent. The place was a little dated and dingy. Missing little things like dish drainer, entrance runner from and back, small imperfections throughout. But, the fireplace made up for it. - John"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Celebrated my birthday week with my boyfriend that flew into town and we had a wonderful time. The area was quiet and nice. We felt right at home. Very beautiful. Nice area with everything close by and the beach right down the road.
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The host is the most responsive of all the hosts I've had in the past. Self check-in was super easy. The beds were very clean, and so were the toilets. I liked that it was cheaper than a hotel and yet, my adult son could have his own bedroom. There were many towels, soaps, shampoo, and conditioner available. They decorated the place nicely. My son's bathroom had been renovated recently and was very pretty. The only thing, and i dont think it's the host's fault, is that you could tell it's a rental. Some of the doors were damaged (paint missing from people'ssuitcases I assume), the outside chairs were... tired, and the lamp shade was broken. I think a lot of it is that too many guests dont take care of a rental. Overall, I was glad I rented this place since it was clean and had a private space for my son."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place had all the room and comforts you need. Nicely renovated. Short drive to Jax Beach and surrounding area.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I will definitely be staying again. The place was so cozy and inviting, even with so much to do around the area, I was happy and content with just staying in the home. It was clean and just like the pictures."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You know when you see your place anything to yourself, ‚Äú there is no way that is as beautiful as it looks‚Äù, well let me tell you it is. As soon as I walked in and took a look around I am really message Jorge told her how beautiful is home was. If this was a standard of Airbnb could be solid fives everywhere. The only reason I put four is there a little snafu with checking in and that was more just a communication aspect of it, yet at the same time I did you rather last minute booking, so I imagine anyone else will be smooth sailing. Jorge has multiple properties and I plan to stay at every single one if I get a chance even after I move here I would just love the opportunity Jorge thanks for the amazing day"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved the place

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cool place. It's a full on apartment with living room and full kitchen.
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,it was OK
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed my stay at this quaint, older apartment. Would love to know the history of the building.
A softer bed would be my preference, but overall my stay was lovely. I would stay there again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A few of the reviews mentioned the surrounding neigborhood and to be honest when I got there the neighborhood was fine. There was no problems walking around or parking.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was easy to find, street parking was readily available, is the perfect distance from TIAA Bank Arena/Daily's Place and the Jacksonville Zoo, and there are numerous, delicious nearby options for food! Jorge gave thorough instructions that made everything easy, and all of their recommendations were spot on.
As a preservationist, I loved staying in this historic building and was excited to see it still had its historic windows in place!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Was a super cute little place to stay the night while i visited jax, clean and comfortable. Jorge was super quick to respond and had lots of recommendations for restaurants!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful apartment in the heart of downtown Jacksonville. The places recommend to us was amazing. Absolutely would stay here again next time we‚Äôre in the area!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Starting with the positive; the place is cozily and thoughtfully decorated. I think it‚Äôs a great deal for the price point & it‚Äôs a good place to rest your head at night. Biggest pet peeve was that every night I had to park around the corner, carrying groceries, etc because parking spots were always occupied across the street. Also, I questioned the host if he would allow my family members to be my guest or even come inside, to which his response is that he normally ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt allow more than 2 inside the apartment,‚Äù and notes that it is very small. Upon reading the house rules, guests are not allowed, not even for one hour otherwise the reservation will be cancelled and not refunded, being monitored by external cameras‚Ä¶so, they take that pretty seriously around here! Wi-Fi is pretty unstable as it keeps alternating between the various networks nearby and has trouble connecting. Another thing worth nothing is that check out time is before 10AM. Bathroom could use some remodeling."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Check in was a little rough but, good quiet neighborhood, the Apt was noisy with people above us and next to us . A lot of weird noises and taking the trash out was sketchy having to go all the way around the building . If you need a place to stay for one night it‚Äôs good but more then that you might second guess staying there ."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The apartment is quaint and located in a central location.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"He‚Äôs very professional and easy, would recommend for sure."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jorge‚Äôs listing was great! The residence was clean, quiet and private! My spouse and I loved the interior decoration and utilization of space. Located in the middle of Jacksonville, this residence was within walking distance of downtown."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jorge and his co-host helped us out tremendously. It was a late notice stay, but they were able to accommodate. The home smelled lovely and had a feel of peace. Definitely recommended these hospitable folks. Thanks again!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"I‚Äôm ALWAYS looking for a unit hosted by Jorge‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs an amazing host and his places are always immaculate‚Ä¶ You can always bet on a cold beverage and a snack with a beautiful luxurious setup‚Ä¶
However this unit let me down a bit‚Ä¶! A little more work needed on the unit‚Ä¶
Bathroom light flickered something seriously haunted‚Ä¶ The paint was peeling super bad especially on bathroom door‚Ä¶ The sofa was light gray yet noticeably dirty to the point we didn‚Äôt want to socialize in that area..!
Floors in this unit wasn‚Äôt up to par as those I‚Äôve had the pleasure of prior‚Ä¶ Definitely not my favorite unit‚Ä¶ Photos are better than the unit is in person‚Ä¶"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was really peaceful and it felt secluded yet in a apartment but it was really nice!

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Thank you for the nice apartment, everything was great."
2023-01-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cleaning chemical smell on arrival was so strong it gave me a headache that lingered into the next day. Had to kill a roach in between the shower curtains. The louvered door into the closet area to the back door had heavy thick, dust in between each crack. The ceiling tiles in front of bathroom and bedroom are falling down to the point you can see the duct work, & very dusty. The doors and windows have a LOT of layers of paint on them, & the noise outside is very well heard since they do not seal. This is an apartment that is accessed by a hallway, which is accessed by all tenants in the building that is three stories. This particular one is on the ground floor. I would not recommend this place to anyone since I expect for every place I stay out of town to at least be the same quality of the house I live in. This was not a safe place for anyone in my opinion! Just not a good experience for me. Hosts were attentive and available, but I didn‚Äôt need them for anything."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was pleasant and the place was well put together. The decor was appealing. Overall, we had a good stay!!!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our one-night stay.
A few suggestions:
Repair the broken rungs on the headboard
Repair the shower rod
Include shampoo in the shower (there were two conditioners and a body wash but no shampoo)"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I loved it
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place and great host. Had the chance to run into the host during the check in and he was super friendly. Place looks exactly like the pictures and was beautifully decorated. Overall my girlfriend and I enjoyed the place!

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was cute and clean. Exactly as advertised. Please note, it is street parking, which I was slightly confused about. Overall...a wonderful stay and I will definitely book again. Although it is a ""transitioning"" neighborhood and you pass some areas on the way to the apartment that seem a little ""less desirable""...I found it really nice and felt safe and comfortable for my entire stay."

2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Loved the place, it was cute and clean upon arrival! Location was MEH, but it served its purpose and we were able to get everywhere we needed to. Overall, we enjoyed our short stay!"
2022-10-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean micro apartment, Just needs a few fix ups and would be a perfect quaint stay. The neighborhood/location is definitely not for people that don't feel comfortable with streetwalkers. Overall a great place for a couple or solo traveler."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jorge's place was great! I was close to downtown which is still a growing place. However, I was able to ride around and really get some great scenery. The street is quite and the neighbors are friendly. I will stay again!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautifully maintained apartment, in the hear of the Springfield neighborhood. Easy walk to everything you want."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was clean and cozy! Nice neighborhood and close to the downtown to hang out around the local area.
2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"I think it's necessary to leave honest reviews so I'm gonna be detailed here. The hosts were lovely and very helpful and responsive. The location was decent and the bedroom (we appreciated the black-out curtains!) and living room are reflected well in the listing's photos.
However, in the case of this listing, ""historic"" just means old (ie a lot of stuff crudely patched or painted over a million times). The lighting was super dim everywhere and, though the mattress was pretty comfortable, the bed frame didn't feel very sturdy. I also think the frequencies from other apts' remotes messed with the lights (same fixtures) because the light in the living room kept turning off. There was also a weird smell coming from the fridge and a generally moldy smell in the kitchen/dining room combo... which probably has something to do with the cockroaches we saw. We saw three during our three-day stay, one of which was the biggest cockroach we've ever seen. We ended up sleeping with the dining/living room lights on to keep the roaches in hiding (we only saw them in or around the kitchen).
Overall, it's an ok place to stay if you're gonna be there to just bathe and sleep like we were. Idk, maybe we visited on a bad weekend."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice little place. The neighborhood is a little sketchy but actually very quiet.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This quaint little apartment was perfect for our weekend in Jacksonville! We really enjoyed our stay!

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a gorgeous little spot. I get what some people are saying about feeling unsafe in the neighborhood but I suspect they‚Äôre people with not as much experience with cities. If you‚Äôve ever been to Long Beach in California it‚Äôs the same vibe. I didn‚Äôt feel unsafe at all (5‚Äô2 woman) and there weren‚Äôt people standing around. Especially for the money, this was an awesome spot for a weekend. Looks exactly like the photos and all hosts got back to us within a few minutes. Would definitely come again!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment is perfect for a getaway! It‚Äôs so simple, boho, a total vibe. It‚Äôs location is close to downtown, main attractions, mom and pop shops, coffee shops, etc. My wife and I really enjoyed our stay, and didn‚Äôt want to leave.
One of our favorite things was discovering that the backdoor lead to a backyard that is lit up at night, so cute.
Jorge was very quick on communication. Neighbors are quiet and friendly. Highly recommend!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jorge‚Äôs place was cozy, cute, and a great location! Very safe for women.
My friend and I enjoyed the complimentary water and snacks, and we really loved the vibe of the place."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a nice stay, Loved the area."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I came to Jacksonville for my birthday! I wanted to relax and be a beach bum and that‚Äôs exactly what I got! We went to Atlantic beach which is about a 30 minute ride out (about the same for Neptune and Jacksonville beaches) however this Airbnb is located to lots of activities near downtown Jacksonville: trinket Shops, a local weekend market, restaurants, a mural walk, some museums , a bookstore and more! If you‚Äôre looking for a cute and cozy place for you and your partner to escape for a weekend, I HIGHLY recommend this Airbnb!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice location‚Ä¶ Good people
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Highly recommend booking with Jorge. He went above and beyond with communication and there was even snacks and drinks when we arrived. Everything was amazing!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was immaculate , clean and cozy boho . Exactly as described !"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic place to stay! Would recommend to anyone.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It‚Äôs a very nice clean little apartment for quick trip ! Really enjoyed our stay would definitely go again !
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jorge was very responsive! Easy to follow instructions and even sent food suggestions! Highly recommend.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jorge is a fantastic host; he‚Äôs great with communication and answered all my questions within 10mins. The Airbnb is beautiful; it looks EXACTLY like the pictures. I was on a business trip so I needed internet access and the wifi was terrible from the bedroom some moments it worked, then some moments I couldn't open google. For the best wifi connection, I had to be in the living room for service. The only thing is, it‚Äôs in a sketchy neighborhood. I had an Uber driver cancel the trip because they didn‚Äôt want to pick me up due to location.
Upon booking, I told Jorge that I‚Äôd be checking into his Airbnb at 7 pm due to me having a late flight and asked if I could check out at 4 pm on my last day due to my flight being late. He told me no. He stated that check-out is at 10 AM, and I‚Äôd have to pay for another night if I wanted to check out that late."
2022-05-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would definitely tame expectations for this place. The photos are beautiful and it is definitely well-decorated for the modern/boho vibe, however, this is a really old historic building and it shows.
The neighborhood is rough - there are some nice homes sprinkled in and you can tell it's a gentrified neighborhood. I wouldn't feel safe walking by myself because up a block was this gas station that had questionable activities and people there. Despite that, it is a quiet neighborhood and the building itself is quiet at night.
Upon entry, we noticed that it heavily smelled like bug spray but thankfully no bugs our entire stay. The place is really homey and chic, which was appreciated. The AC was also at a very comfortable temperature and was lovely throughout our stay.
The bathroom could use some work. The tub in the shower had a big dip in the center of it and felt as if you were sinking. There was black mold along the caulking of the tub and didn't seem very clean. The ceiling in the hallway between the bathroom and bedroom had some sort of water damage or something...looked like it was falling apart.
The bedroom was spacious and the bed was ok. The wifi is extremely spotty and I would get bumped on and off using it in bed. Really appreciated the ceiling fan though as I love sleeping with a fan at night.
Overall, wasn't a horrible stay but it also wasn't the best. Jorge and his team were extremely responsive and I appreciated the detailed communication and information that was given. They rectified a minor issue upon check-in very quickly so thank you for that! I think with a little more work, the place could be really nice."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay! It‚Äôs a cute apartment great for 1-2 people no more than that. The area is slowly building up, so keep that in mind. There are quite a bit of restaurants and shops near by. The Airbnb is 30min from Neptune Beach, 40 min from Amelia Island, 5 min from the Riverwalk and Downtown. I travelled alone and felt safe in the Airbnb. Jorge abs Stephanie were extremely helpful and responsive!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place for a night! Close to the Florida Theatre. Comfy bed and really nice, homey decor. Neighborhood was rough but we were out most of the time üëçüèΩ Recommend for a good time in Jacksonville"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The apartment is a very well decorated space in a historic building. The hosts have done a great job of making it feel cozy and comfortable. Overall a nice place and location; very walkable to the shops on Main, or Silkie's around the corner. ... Only one gripe: the wifi was unreliable, specifically for doing remote work and taking Zoom meetings (basic checking email, etc. was fine)."

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had the best stay! Such a cute and comfortable little apartment. Very well decorated and a central location to all things in Jacksonville. The check in process was super easy and Jorge was always very responsive. They gave great recommendations for local food choices too! Street parking is the only thing available however we never had an issue finding a spot. Can‚Äôt beat the proximity to downtown. The area surrounding the neighborhood looked a bit rough but we had no issues nor felt unsafe. Overall excellent value and cute space for a weekend getaway.

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a lovely place to stay! Super cute apartment and perfect for a solo trip by yourself. They were wonderful and super helpful with suggestions on what to do and where to eat in the area!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It's a perfectly fine spot. Jorge had good coffee, nice breakfast snacks, and plenty of cookware in the kitchen. The house is comfy and nicely decorated and has a good layout. The neighborhood is pleasant, though just a few blocks away from less developed areas. All of the houses around the block are very nice looking, old historic houses with good lighting at night.
Parking was easy, we were always able to park near the apartment. In winter months, the heat doesn't get back to the bedroom very efficiently but it wasn't too bad. There's a space heater in the closet in case you need it, but only one blanket provided. Overall it's a nice space for a reasonable price and we enjoyed our stay."

Appreciated the firm mattress, which is becoming too uncommon! We walked to some great local restaurants and met really interesting people. Terrific and unpretentious getaway spot."
,,,"cute in the pictures, small and cluttered in real life. Noisy neighbors & TERRIBLE neighborhood. Such and unsafe & bad area (especially for younger people ) would not recommend. When brought to the hosts attention he responded with ‚Äúthat‚Äôs to bad‚Äù & a very defensive paragraph about all the properties he owns and basically saying my feelings weren‚Äôt valid & didn‚Äôt even ask what had happened. It was so bad we didn‚Äôt even stay till the last night. You can also tell how bad of a host jorge is by the way he responds to negative (but true) reviews !!!"
,,,"Had my son go and decorate the place upon entering noticed the resident could use a serious update along noise from the surrounding units, sent the host a message that I have decided not say and wasn‚Äôt expecting a refund and my son immediate left. The host offered to help out on a refund of the cleaning since nothing was touched just need to verify. Never received a refund on the cleaning sent several messages no response. I stated that, I wasn‚Äôt going to leave a negative review but felt the need since the host never kept his word. Lesson learned you pay for what you get."
