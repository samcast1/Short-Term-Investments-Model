2024-06-01,4.0,Group trip,Great place! had 8 women stay for a bachelorette. Only complaints were some of the bowls in the cabinet were dirty when we went to use them and there was some existing damage- mainly the hand towel rings mounted to the wall had some issues and some of the curtains had tears. Otherwise we really enjoyed the space and didn't have time to enjoy all of the amenities since they provided so many decent options!

The house had comfortable and elegant interiors. It was the place that made you want to take off your shoes and relax.
Speaking of comfort, this place nailed it. The beds were cozy, and the living spaces were perfect for hanging out.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great small apartment for a one night stay!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We truly enjoyed our stay at Richard's and Tim's Garden level apartment. The furnishings were very comfortable and it was easy to settle in and relax. The apartment was tastefully decorated. The location near the downtown area of Cedar Rapids was a perfect choice for us as we wanted to be able explore some of the dining and attractions nearby. The location on Ist Ave NE makes it easy to travel to other parts of the city. Tim's quick response with programming the TV was greatly appreciated. I feel that the apartment is a great value for visitors wanting to be near downtown Cedar Rapids. I look forward to staying with Richard and Tim in the future.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved the location and charm of this historic building. Tim and Richard are gracious hosts and we hope to return to see the garden in bloom!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay! We came into town for a friends wedding so we didn’t get to explore much but we had a fun weekend! We went to the Map room for dinner- their burgers were delicious. We went to La Casita for breakfast- we highly recommend! It was convenient to walk across the street but Definitely go earlier in the morning since they don’t have a lot of tables! We loved the easy access to the parking lot and the condo was so cozy! We will definitely be staying here again if we come back to Cedar Rapids! Thank you again!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed at many AirBnBs/other lodgings and this one ranks near the top. The historic building with private outside pool/sitting area, designated parking and quiet apartment was exactly what we wanted. And though the location was on a busy street, we could not hear any outside noise from our unit. The furnishings, size of the apartment, amenities including TV/Internet, special touches in the kitchen, wonderful shower, etc. were tops! We didn't use the exercise area but it had equipment that rivaled a gym! Highly recommended."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We were so happy with our stay here! So clean and the courtyard with koi pond was such an amazing surprise! Most of what we did was within a few blocks of the location. Off street parking was a plus. We thank the hosts and will recommend this great place to “drop hat”!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really neat place. Decorated nicely. Very comfortable. Hosts are very responsive. Bed comfort. Would definitely stay again.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,I always stay at here when I visit my hometown. There are no surprises. My favorite place to stay. Would recommend to anyone coming to Cedar Rapids.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"After a drive half way across the country, Richard and Tim's place was a welcome oasis. Before we even arrived, Tim and Richard reached out to us, providing us options as to our stay. The place was spotless and beautiful. Cedar Rapids experienced a crazy heat wave when we were there (105 degrees) and the pool was delightful. It offered such a lovely quiet and cool break from the heat. Any questions we had were immediately answered, and new towels were provided immediately. The laundry and gym was perfect! I cannot say enough about the lovely space and we will be back! We will be back!!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Unique historical building with a lot of charm and close to downtown and Coe College.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was just wonderful. Richard and Tim's apartment was very nice and we felt at home. The courtyard was our absolute favorite! Its beautiful and so peaceful out there. Brandi the lady that takes care of the grounds and place in general was just wonderful. She let us feed the coy fish, which was so appreciated! Don't forget to tip her, she really deserves it, she works her butt off and is seriously so sweet!! If we come back to Iowa again, we will definitely stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"garden and pool are well cared for. this is the first time I had visited in the summer, so was glad to be able to use the pool."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We have stayed in a lot of airbnbs- this stay was a treasure and at the top of our list of experiences. The garden level unit was secluded and felt special. The furnishings exceeded expectations, the bed was sooo comfy and the check in and check out a breeze. We didnt have time to actually indulge in the pool but I encourage you to make it a priority- the yard was gorgeous and I wish we could have spent more time there enjoying it! Just lovely. All of it."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! Close to everything in CR. The description matches the experience. Will stay again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Immaculate ground level rental that is a 10 minute walk to downtown and an easy 25 minute walk to Newbo and Czech Village . This place has all the amenities- plenty of towels (including pool) and linens, fully stocked kitchen, and free parking! I loved the cold bottled water, the basket of snacks, and paper towels AND tissues (a rarity.) The pool, koi, and gardens were so peaceful!
I accidentally blew a fuse the first night, and Tim was very responsive and had the living room up and running again within a half hour.
The disadvantages were that being on the ground level of a 100 year old building you do hear the neighbors above; the shower takes several minutes to heat up, the toilet was a little slow to flush, the only a/c unit is in the living room so you'll need to leave the bedroom door open and ceiling fan on in the summer for ventilation, and the mattress was very hard.
That being said, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again if I am ever back in town!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place for a fun couple days in CR!!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. Apartment was cozy. Courtyard was adorable!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My daughter and I had a great time at Ausadie Building. The cost was extremely affordable for a downtown location, and for the amenities the place provided. My daughter enjoyed seeing the garden area and liked how the building looked. The kitchen was fully stocked with utensils, crockery, and the like. We unfortunately didn't get to cook there, but we did make full use of the snacks and water they had as we were on the go every day. Thank you guys for a great stay!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great host and place to stay!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a lovely stay! The facility and grounds were immaculate and beautifully kept. The garden was an absolute oasis right in downtown Cedar Rapids, walking distance from great restaurants. The breakfast cafe across the street was wonderful - La Casita - try the churro pancakes! Richard and Tim sent perfect instructions for how to get in, and the info they left for guests was helpful and friendly. The blankets were soft, the towels were fluffy, and the shower was a dream. Perfect!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was very clean and well equipped. I would stay here again
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful building furnished and fitted with all one needs for a relaxing stay. Walking distance to Coe College.
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful hosts, beautiful building. They even accommodated a last minute room switch because of a musty smell in the garden level."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay if your kids go to COE College!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is awesome !! The place feels like what I wish my own home looked and felt. Elegant cherry (?) wood floors...great galley-like kitchen...spectacular bathroom and bedroom...the ambiance is that of a very updated late 40's,early 50's uptown home. The place we stayed was amazingly quiet...Tim is an excellent host...at check-in, he guided me easily and in person ( I am an avowed technophobe so, I need lots of shepherding through the nuances of electronic entries). Tim was, also, there as we left...a gracious and friendly host..I will definitely book another stay here in the future, as my needs arise. I highly recommend a stay here to everyone."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything about this stay was very professional and delivered exactly as described. Clean, had all the amenities, and was a beautiful place to stay."
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"I was scheduled to spend 1 night at the apartment. I arrived late due to storms, so spent less than 12 hours in the apartment total. I love historic buildings & this one was cool. It was late & cold out, so I didnt get to venture too much to check out the grounds. It was decorated cute & very comfortable. When we arrived, the key lockbox was open, which was a little odd & made us think we might be in the wrong place. But all was good. I liked that the property instructions didnt require too much housekeeping upon check out. Some places require so much, but this was easy. My biggest complaint was that you dont have access to the thermostat in the apartment & it got very hot throughout the night. We finally opened some windows (as instructed in the property guidebook)."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay in your lovely Airbnb, especially the decor! The shower was also amazing-great water pressure. If ever we return to Cedar Rapids, we will surely stay here again. Thanks for making our weekend feel more like home!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I will never forget our weekend trip to Cedar Rapids!! We visisted the Motorcycle Museum in Anamosa before checking into this beautiful building. The place was quiet and romantic. We enjoyed lounging in the living room with the fireplace and candles lit. I especially loved the shower lol super hot water and great pressure. The lighting in the bathroom could defiantly be better for getting ready in though. We checked out the courtyard, I'm sure it's beautiful in the summer! Close to many great food options, we found plenty to eat! We would love to stay here again if we ever make it back to CR!!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Ausadie is a beautiful place to stay. Right as you walk in you feel at home. It was decorated beautifully for the holidays. When I walked into my apartment they had a welcome personalized for me. The space was warm and cozy and with an electric fireplace to boot. I recommend this to anyone who needs a quick getaway. I will be visiting again in the summer as to enjoy the pool!! 😁
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Richard and Tim have provided an impressive place to stay at a reasonable cost. Beautiful building and classy decor. I highly recommend staying here and will do so again when we return to the area. We had everything we needed and more. I wish we had stayed a little longer to enjoy the pool and garden a little more. Thanks for a wonderful experience.

2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Ausadie building is a wonderfully restored historic building right outside of downtown Cedar Rapids on the edge of the Med Quarter. The building itself is right on a main street, but tucked away behind the privacy fencing is an adorable outdoor living space that has a nice pool and several seating areas to relax and talk or read.
The apartment itself was tastefully redone and makes you feel like you're at home and not staying at an Airbnb. The full kitchen had all the amenities for anyone who is wanting to cook some meals at their Airbnb. Richard and Tim were absolutely wonderful hosts that were extremely accommodating and thoughtful, which easily shines through during your stay. We even had a great conversation after relaxing at the pool on one of the nights. As someone who is local to Cedar Rapids, this is an Airbnb that I will *always* recommend to friends/family traveling to Cedar Rapids. The experience was absolutely perfect!!"

2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and felt so at home. Richard and Tim have done an admirable job of retaining the essence of the building while creating an inviting, modern space. Even though the weather was very brisk, we took time to walk the garden, koi pond and pool, which we would love to visit in warmer weather. We look forward to staying here on our next visit!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is my go-to place when I stay in Cedar Rapids for work. Amazing amenities and a super stylish place!!
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"As fine an AirBnB stay as i have had over the years.
Exceeded all my expectations. Large one bedroom
apartment, beautifully decorated and appointed. Very
clean and quiet. If you want a good workout during your
stay, the lower level gym is filled with top grade
commercial fitness equipment. Is definitely my go to
now in Cedar rapids."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The building and the room was amazing. The ad doesn't do it justice. My wife was blown away. We got to appreciate the beautifully maintained historic building as well as a modern and luxurious living space.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A+. You must know that first thing!
These are some highlights that we very much appreciated:
*Stylish and well thought out - it offered much better space than a hotel room.
*Very clean - which I appreciate that above all else!
*Complimentary snacks & water bottles - love touches like this!
*Lovely, large shower.
*Full kitchen.
*Convenient parking on side of building.
* Close to sooooo many things.
*Easy, timely communication with the owners.

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is, hands down, one of the best Airbnbs I have ever stayed in! The space is absolutely gorgeous, spotless, has every amenity you could need, and is incredibly stylish as well as cozy. The location was very central to everything I needed. I hope I get to come back to Cedar Rapids again just so I can stay here in the Ausadie building!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Currently my favorite AirBNB! Classic building, space was well appointed, comfy...didnt feel like I was traveling! Only thing is, you can hear the road from time to time. But other than that, this is one of the best places I have stayed at!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a really great time in Cedar Rapids. The room and the grounds were lovely, and the snacks were *very* appreciated. The check-in system was super convenient— we loved it! An additional thank you for the personal message on the chalk board. An all around lovely stay!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"At Ausadie you'll instantly be struck by all of the time, effort, investment and, attention to detail Richard and Tim have put into what must be a labour of love. It was like stepping back in time. From the entrance to the hallways to the garden. The building is a stunning example of early 1920's architecture that's gotten better over time. Inside, it's top class but comfortable - welcoming even. Especially with a personal greeting on the chalkboard, and fresh muffins, juices, snacks, and so much more waiting for me when I arrived.
They're super-responsive too. I had full details on the place days before I arrived. And, the couple of questions I had while visiting were answered within minutes. Five-star rating? Six :)"

2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a very fine, upscale location with great attention to detail. The historic building has been beautifully reclaimed while tastefully updated. Tim and Richard are perfect hosts who have thought of every amenity."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is a nice little basement apartment. The place was clean and convenient, and - for those who have been to Cedar Rapids before - far enough from the train that you don’t hear it. Richard and Tim are lovely people and they gave us all the information we needed for an easy check-in. I would recommend it."
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful apt., tastefully decorated, and in a great location for seeing all the sites to see - ie. NewBo district, bike rentals, restaurants...."

2019-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Delightfully older building turned into apt airbnb spaces. Comfortable with easily accessible kitchen. The living space was a handsome and cozy design. Bathroom shower was awesome. Bed was super comfortable.
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The garden level unit was such a perfect place for our stay! Not only is the unit in a beautifully renovated historic building, close to walking distance to downtown and Coe College but every little detail mastered from sanitized tv remotes to muffins and snacks, great dishes for cooking and comfortable bed and sofas. Everything was immaculately clean and comfortable that we wanted to stay in Cedar Rapids longer! Richard and Tim were great hosts. So accommodating and obviously take great pride in the property. Thank you!"

2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely apartment and very thoughtful and gracious hosts. It was nice to check in after a long day of work to find an assortment of snacks and beverages. They went above and beyond. Tim introduced himself when I happened to meet him in the hall during my visit, and was easy to contact before and during my stay. He kindly accommodated some special requests. The apartment was beautifully decorated and perfectly appointed for a comfortable stay. I’d like to know where they got the bathroom tile! Really a top-notch renovation. I highly recommended the Ausadie apartments and will stay again."

2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Definitely enjoyed my stay at Richard & Tim’s Ausadie Apartments. The space was clean, modern and extremely well appointed.

2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is the best AirBNB! The place is sparkling clean and exactly as described. Loved the location and all the special little amenities that they left for me. Truly a special place and I would definitely recommend the Ausadie!!

Highly recommended."
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great corporate rental. They were easy to work with.
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed everything about the Ausadie and what Tim and Richard have done with the decor, the amenities, the surroundings, and more. But even more enjoyable (if that's possible) was meeting them both. They have thought of everything and each added so many thoughtful touches. It's a 'wow' place and experience!"
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place! Great communication from hosts! Excellent hospitality! They provided juice, crumb cake, coffee, and waters. Will be back and suggest to friends!"

2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The building was beautiful, and everything was perfect. Richard and Tim added so many personal touches, which made for the perfect home away from home."
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed at Richard and Tim's on the night of our wedding because we thought our house was going to be full of relatives. It turned out they got hotel rooms so our house was empty, but we couldn't have asked for a more charming and well-appointed place to spend our special night. The apartment was beautiful and comfortable. They went above and beyond to make sure we felt welcome and comfortable. They even had a special note to us on a chalkboard as we entered the apartment! Amazing!"
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Richard and Tim have thought of everything! The apartment is beautifully decorated, and has a loving, cozy feel. They have included a helpful guide on restaurants and things to do in the area, along with an easy to follow check out list to help anyone new to Airbnb. Great thoughtful gestures such as a personalized welcome board, variety of breakfasts and beverages, as well as make up remover cloths. Thanks for a great first Airbnb!"
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful apartment with amazing hosts. Richard and Tim love their place and love serving their guests. Attention to detail was awesome! Also, location is close to downtown and New Bo district (super fun). Hope you enjoy your stay as much as we did!"
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I selfishly don't want to tell you how much I loved this place because I want it to be available whenever I'm in Cedar Rapids. But here goes. The space is charming, comfortable, practical, and very clean. Tim bent over backwards to make sure my parents and I would want for nothing while we were there. We didn't get to meet, but his texts were prompt, friendly, and he anticipated any questions I might have had before I even asked them! The building is very cool; we really loved that the reading material in home included a detailed history of Mr. Palmer's work and this building. There were also personal tips about how to get the most out of a visit to Cedar Rapids - places to eat, learn, and have fun. Really nice, especially since I've been to CR a few times and they turned me on to a few new things! Back to the space, though. The kitchen is small but super practical, squeaky-clean, and decently stocked with dinnerware and tasty snacks. The bathroom is lovely, shower is fab, and beds (yes, even the hide-a-bed) very good! Also - don't worry about getting cold in this place, even during a freaky April snow-storm, because the steam heat is very effective! Tip for future guests: If you haven't already started traveling with some ""white noise"" to use during sleep, you might want to have some, here, or the occasional knocking in the radiators might have you checking the door for a visitor! Overall, a wonderful home and a place I'd like to return to. Thank you, Richard and Tim!"
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was my second time staying with Richard and Tim and they have once again provided a stay that is beyond expectations. The garden level suite was clean and cozy, a perfect weekend getaway. Richard and Tim are responsive and were greatly accommodating allowing for a late checkout when I was running behind. If you’re in Cedar Rapids, this is the place is to stay. And if you’re deciding between this and their other available room don’t worry, both are equally fantastic!"
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,You will feel welcome and special once you see all of the special touches that Richard and Tim have provided. I only wish we could have stayed longer. It was very comfortable. I'll definitely be back!
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a pretty great place. It was right behind the Grant Wood museum and the museum of art is just blocks away. The apartment itself was clean and relaxing and the furniture and colors were tastefully selected to create a calm atmosphere. We couldn’t decide whether to stay in or go out! There are plenty of good restaurants in walking distance, and the hosts were very friendly and accommodating. I would definitely stay here again."
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My wife and I had a chance to stay at the Ausadie building last weekend while visiting old college friends from Coe. We are relatively new to the airbnb experience and weren't sure what to expect.
From the moment we made our reservation, Tim and Richard were very communicative and accommodating. They made sure we were comfortable with every detail and ready for our stay well in advance of arriving in town from out of state.
The property is in a great location if you plan to spend time enjoying downtown Cedar Rapids and was an easy walk to some great bars/restaurants. Check-in and check-out were incredibly easy, and we enjoyed the comfortable furnishings. We'll definitely keep this location in mind the next time we return to Cedar Rapids."
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the first time I’ve used Airbnb and Tim and Richard made it very easy for us.

Apartment is lovely and it feels like home right when you walk in. It was easy to make ourselves at home. Great fireplace and we love the mints everywhere!
Our hosts were quick to respond and super easy to communicate with."
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved this house! Much better than expected, very beautiful, tastefully decorated. I was able to check in early and get settled.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The only issue we had was the street light shown through the bedroom window. I noticed the description stated room darkening shades, but were none. also the description stated board games. we did not find any. orger than that everything was great. I hope we left everything as expected. This was my 1st experience with an air b&b. I hope the rest will be as great. Thank you."

2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was my first and my mother's first airbnb stay. My mom was super nervous, she is old fashioned, prefers hotels. Thankfully this home exceeded our expectations! My friend and her daughter took the bedroom upstairs while mom and i took the 2 bedrooms on main level. my friend has to have a TV on to sleep and the walls were thick enough that I never heard how loud her TV was! Beds were so comfortable! Everything so clean and fresh!
My only complaint is myself- being my first time I hope I followed all the proper etiquette as a guest. we greatly appreciated the binder with instructions and local recommendations, otherwise I would have panicked on what to do.... actually I just now realized I never put a dishwasher pod in the dishwasher or hit start. Oh no, my apologies."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house was beautiful and the location was lovely. Overall, a 5 star stay! Two things to know about, the stairs are very steep and the ac/heat has a fan attached to it that is really loud when it kicks on. However, my favorite part was all the windows on the back porch! Great place for morning coffee."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely neighborhood, great for a stroll. Quiet. House was spotless. Great communications. Would return without hesitation."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute cozy place close to downtown but we noticed the heater was loud during the night.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Roy’s place was great. Exactly as described. The beds were comfy and it was a great location, just a 10-15 minute to a beautiful park with great trails to enjoy some of the nature that CR has to offer. Would definitely stay at Roy’s again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This house is an adorable updated cottage. The beds were very comfortable and kitchen well stocked. The neighborhood is quiet and well established. It is conveniently located to main thoroughfares. The hosts are very friendly and quick to communicate.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Love the location, adorable bungalow in great neighborhood"
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Classic small house in a very quiet neighborhood. The neighborhood is quite walkable, but the house is not near a commercial area for restaurants or groceries or coffee.
The two bedrooms were equipped with good beds and closets. Small, but quite functional. Great kitchen. Well equipped.
The access to the third bedroom upstairs is via a steep staircase and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who might have difficulty climbing stairs."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect for our needs - thanks, Roy!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great spot for our family of 6. Loved the layout of the home. Would definitely stay again!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Positive experience overall!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really good location. Helpful binder with to do options listed as well as restaurants. Plenty of space for us. The stairs to the upper bedroom are steep so be aware those are not really appropriate for someone older. Having the half bath was a great help to get ready for the day. Off street parking was good to have. The spaces fit a standard SUV or smaller, a pickup wouldn't fit. The neighbor was pleasant and her little dog a delight. We rarely heard it bark."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great location. Host was super responsive to messages and the house was clean and neat. The stairs are steep and I didn’t attempt to access the 2nd floor. AC worked great, even in the 90+ degree days."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,everything was great would definitely stay again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,thank you!
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage was comfortable and very clean. And Roy is a very attentive host. The neighborhood is in a great location and is tree-lined and generally quiet. The exception is the yapping dog next door, who, whenever outside, barked himself into an annoying frenzy with regularity. The basement stairs were steep and shallow and a little scary to traverse."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Easy checkin and very clean! Great for our quick one night stay!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house is in such a beautiful neighborhood. We took the most lovely walks in the evening. The house is also beautiful and the beds & linens were so comfortable. The place is very spacious. Tons of room for our family of 5. The neighbors were very nice. Easy parking. Two things to note: we stayed at a time when the highs were in the upper 80’s / low 90’s. The AC did not get lower than 76 until around 10pm at night. That might be too warm for some people. Also, the upper level stairs are steep and a little scary in the dark. We made sure our kids turned on a lamp before navigating them at night. Overall, a wonderful stay. Roy was a fantastic host with great recommendations for many different things to do in the area. We would highly recommend this place!"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,exceedingly tidy and clearly well cared for. if there's any one single downside it is the neighbor's little dog which yapped constantly when you approached any door of the house. I cannot imagine being able to enjoy the yard. If you are looking for an affordable and well-managed home and don't care to be outside you've hit a winner.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Roy was quick to respond and is genuinely a friendly guy. The house was spotless and looked exactly like the pictures. The neighborhood was quiet and when we took a walk the neighbors were friendly. The shower has great pressure too. All of our activities were on the east side of Cedar Rapids so the house was in a perfect location for us. We would definitely stay here again.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This home was absolutely what was promised. The bed was super comfy and clean. Roy was an excellent host. He was easy to get a hold of and had a book of all instructions and recommendations there for guests. Would highly recommend this play to stay and will definitely stay here again in the future.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We stayed couple a nights at Roy’s place and enjoyed everything about it. It was cozy and clean. Perfect for a stay with the family.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Two of us stayed at Ray’s beautiful home. The home was immaculate and very spacious. Roy provided excellent recommendations for things to do and places to eat. He was also responded quickly to any questions. I would definitely rebook and recommend this home.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The home was easy to get into, super clean and cute, and much better than a hotel room. I especially enjoyed the glowing crystal lamps."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place had really comfortable beds! It was very clean and spacious. We would come back again!

2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful place with nice neighbors. Also thankful that there was a super safe basement while the tornado warnings were happening!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We appreciated having this tidy, spacious house and quiet neighborhood within a short drive of downtown Cedar Rapids. We hope to stay again! There are a few stairs required to reach the front door or back door. The ground floor bedrooms were convenient for my elderly parents, but the upstairs attic suite does have some very steep stairs and is best left to able climbers."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice home! A+ and good host!
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time in Cedar Rapids.
Clean house.
Lots of sleeping options.
Bring blankets. We had to run to Walmart to buy bedding for our children.
Beautiful kitchen!
You may want to bring dishes if your going to cook full meals.
We ate out a lot and brought paper dishes / plastic utensils, so it didn’t bother us.
Located right off 1st Ave. absolutely adorable neighborhood.
Friendly neighbors. Their dog startled us a bit late one night but the neighbor stopped to talk to us and wished us a good time during our stay.
Overall a great experience!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super cute place, very clean. We came in late and left early, but the beds were very comfortable."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean. Didn’t cancel last minute like my previous reservation
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was fine. We were happy...
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place, very comfortable, well worth the money. Roy was very responsive to our questions."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything was great.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The name says it all, Cozy Cottage! Upon arrival in single digit Temps, Roy's place Was warm, Very clean, comfortable and Updated! Simple Check in and Out instructions. There was snow before our arrival and Roy Made sure there was a clear safe path to Home and came back out on subsequent days to make sure pathway remained clear! Safe Quiet neighborhood with great neighbors! wouldn't hesitate to stay again, met all of our needs!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Was worried at first about not being close enough to our venues, but found our short travels very easy. Quiet neighborhood, easy to find. House was clean and beds were comfortable. I needed the kitchen space to prepare food for sons wedding rehearsal dinner — worked perfectly!! Enjoyed our stay!!!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Left some kind words and snacks for me when I first arrived! I’ve always enjoy my stay and the location of where it is. Will return again!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place! Very big, we all had plenty of space. Beds were comfy and everything was very clean. The location seemed to be very convenient as everything we did was within 10ish mins drive time. Would definitely stay again!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great, spacious, well-located in CR. Perfect for a family of 6. Everything was able to have their own space. Roy was friendly and easy to communicate with."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great space in Cedar Rapids! Lots of room and everything was as promised
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay while visiting with our college boy. The home was cozy on the cold days we were there. Enough space to visit and have a separate space to do work. Location felt safe and was easy to get to everywhere we wanted to go. Would definitely stay there again!
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Clean, well supplied, but main bedroom should be moved to main level and the loft space turned into optional rec room."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We have a family of 5, it was nice to get a house for the same amount we would have spent on a hotel room that would have been cramped and sharing walls.
The kitchen was well stocked with pots and pans, utensils and dishes. There was coffee available for the coffee maker.
I would just note that the rule of no shoes in the home caused me a little anxiety because the area to unload was very tight. 5 of us coming in the house with bags out of the snow was a little tight.
Although it seems you can park in front of the house it’s easier to park behind, but it is a very tight squeeze.
We have a van and we needed to do a 5 point turn to get out of the back driveway. The downside there is you have to walk around to the front of the house to get in-A way to unlock the back door would have been helpful.
Steep stair sets and the upstairs has low angled ceilings. The furnace is loud and it gets HOT fast up there.
The house is cozy, and perfect for a few nights, Comfy beds, updated floors"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, clean, and quiet neighborhood. Roy was responsive to questions."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house was cute, clean and comfortable."

2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place with plenty of space - finished top level and basement (very steep stairs up and down). Small back yard that is partially fenced in. And in walking distance to the lovely Beaver Park!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We only stayed 1 night. But there was everything one would need to stay longer. Since it was only 2 of us, there was plenty of room. Very clean place. Nice & quiet neighborhood. Beds were comfortable. Host was always very quick on respond."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Bigger than it looks from the outside. Nicely laid out. Quiet location. Well taken care of.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a pleasure to return to this clean, well-kept home in a quiet neighborhood. All of the basics are covered with plenty space for personal belongings.

2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Accommodations were exactly as pictured and stated. Very clean. Nice neighborhood. Would definitely stay again. Thumbs up all around!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. Well equipped and lots of room.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beds were comfy, house was spacious enough for a family of 6. Great little neighborhood and close to amenities."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This older home is nicely updated, having kept the original vent covers, doors, and windows, which gives it a nice charm.
With it being older, I think those thinking to rent this house needs to remember that the structure is a bit different than modern homes. There are not as many electrical outlets, especially in the bedrooms. The bedrooms on the main floor are very small so we had to keep some of our luggage in the living/dining room area, which is very roomy.
The staircases are very narrow and steep, the bedroom in the attic has slanted ceilings, which makes it very easy to bump your head. Being a couple in our 50’s and 60’s, the stairs presented a bit of a challenge, especially going up to the attic bedroom (which unfortunately for us has the biggest room and most comfortable bed). Those in their 20’s and 30’s would probably not have a problem at all. The laundry is in the basement, which also has very narrow steep stairs.
There is parking on the street and behind the house/garage (through the alley) The spots by the garage are kind of short, so if you have an SUV, it will not fit well. Luckily, the alley goes all the way down to the next street so you can pull out in either direction. There are also stairs going up to the house in both the front and back. So, it is important to know that if you have any physical limitations, this house is probably not a good choice for you. The keypad entry is at the front door only, but the back can easily be accessed by the sidewalk on side of the house.
The kitchen only has the very basics so if you want to cook a lot during your stay, you may need to bring some of your own things. They do have basic cookware and utensils, as well as a corkscrew, can opener, vegetable peeler and tongs. The living room could use more lighting so if you like to read, you may want to bring a book light.
Roy provides laundry detergent, hand soap, dish soap and even coffee filters. I am not sure if he provides it or if it was left by previous tenants, but there was also coffee, sugar, and powdered coffee creamers available. I was thankful that he also provides a first aid kit (which even includes Neosporin and Benadryl ointments) because I did end up using it. He also provides free wi-fi, a smart tv, as well as a full-sized hairdryer, which was nice.
Roy was great at getting back with me to answer all my many questions and seemed very nice to work with. I did find however that he didn’t answer messages on the weekends so message during the week if you want quick answers before reserving.
The neighborhood was very quaint with very little activity going on. It was quiet except when the neighbor’s little dog was out, he would bark at us, but he was cute and harmless. Overall, it was a very nice, comfortable stay."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect location. Beautiful home. Lots of room for our family ( 3 adults and a toddler) and we never even used the beautiful basement that had lots of extra room.
Roy was easy to communicate with.
Would love to stay again when in Cedar Rapids"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very beautiful home all the things that you could need ,the bed was amazing slept great"

2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Roy’s listing is exactly as it says it is. Very nice and clean home. Spacious. We had 5 people, and there was still plenty of room. Quiet area. Comfortable and cozy. We would definitely stay here again when we visit Cedar Rapids!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home-much roomier than it appears from the outside. Beds were very comfortable. Clean and well appointed. We would highly recommend!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything was great! Super cute place. Only heads up if you have small children that the stairs are steep and the upstairs railing wouldn’t be safe for children (upstairs can be closed off by a door and Roy provided a baby gate for downstairs). The sunroom made for a great toy room/play area!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home ! Great neighbors! We weren’t sure what to expect but this Home definitely exceeded expectations. Perfect spot to be able to check out Cedar Rapids and not feel so away from home.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Would definitely stay here again when in Cedar Rapids. Very clean and comfortable, located on a quiet street. All the comforts of home, which made for a great stay."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very very comfortable
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Roy is a thoughtful host and this was a great location for us. We could have easily spent more time in this clean, comfortable home if we hadn't been in town to celebrate a special occasion.
The main floor bedrooms and common areas were all the three of us needed. Larger groups may want to be sure they are comfortable with stairs for the upper and lower levels. The workspace/sunporch and good wifi speed were appreciated by one working remotely."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This home was in a great location. Close to many different activities for you and your kids. This home was very clean and well taken care of. The owners description of the home was very accurate. We enjoyed our stay and hope to visit again.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Worked great for our family of five! Nice remodeling. Awesome kitchen and variety of rooms for family to have independent time, too. Appreciated air conditioner in hot, humid weather. Things to consider: two sets of steep stairs (basement and attic bedroom)…we navigated ok; upstairs vent fan a little loud when AC on if you have light sleepers, but we slept ok."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house was perfect for us, inside and out. Roy is a gracious and generous host."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Roy's house is fantastic! There were 4 of us staying, and there was plenty of room for more. The house is spotless and accommodating. The upstairs loft is difficult to reach, as other reviews mentioned. We have no complaints and loved everything about our stay."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderfully located near the Brucemore Estate in an adorable, well kept neighborhood. Home is clean and fully equipped."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Roy was a great host and the property was perfect for our needs. The house was clean, quiet, and a great overall value."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We husband and wife enjoyed our 3-night stay & would return for many reasons. First, Roy doesn't use air fresheners, scented sticks, plugged in scented oils. There are many windows on the main floor to keep it light and airy; and these windows have screens, blinds, curtains. Second, the neighborhood is safe, quiet, friendly. Third, the beds were comfortable and the house was far away from railroads, so we slept well; the kitchen was well stocked, functional, with a dishwasher. Fourth, the sunroom is spacious, airy, well lit; my wife loved relaxing, reading, writing, doing yoga there. It is a new add-on to an old home. The huge living room windows give beautiful view of the front yard and neighborhood. Fifth, Roy is a kind, responsive host. On the other hand, have realistic expectations: It smelled like an old home; opening windows freshened it up. We couldn't open the attic's windows. The bathroom sink's stopper did not work. The floor was sticky, not quite clean to go barefoot. Bring your own shampoo and conditioner."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Airbnb worked perfect for a girls weekend! It was super clean! It had plenty of space as well. The house is located in a super quiet neighborhood and is close to many amenities. The local welcome binder provided helpful hints for things to do in the area as well as places to eat. Roy was also helpful in giving a heads up about where to park. We would highly recommend this and hope that we can return in years to come for other girls weekends.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place could not have been better! Easy to find, easy to get into, and cute as a button. This is an adorable older home that has been very lovingly re-done. Super clean and surprisingly roomy. We didn't use the upstairs or basement areas since there were just two of us staying for the weekend but there was ample space for a larger group here. Kitchen is modern and has everything you need and furnishings were modern and comfortable. We enjoyed having the reclining couch for movie watching at night and even played a few games at the large dining table. Yard and home seem very well maintained. Would not hesitate to stay again and highly recommend!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"House was very clean, awesome bed, fast internet connection, close to everything!"

2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice mostly clean house. Roomy could sleep 8 comfortably. Shower is tiny, its an older home with uodated renovations. Bring your own can opener tge one provided is difficult to use."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The homeowner is very responsive and did a great job on renovating an older home. It’s extremely clean and comfortable in a quiet neighborhood.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,King bedroom upstairs is not ideal for elderly individuals or anyone with the inability to negotiate stairs well.

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is very welcoming, nicely updated, clean and has everything you need. Many say about the Steps up to the Loft being steep, they are a little, but but if you have younger ones traveling with you, they will all pick this room. We had limited communication with Roy, but he responded effectively when needed. We may go back to CR, we will choose this place again if available. Thanks Roy."

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was fantastically spacious and a super fast drive to lots of shopping and eating, as described!

2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The home is very comfortable and relaxing there are a few games to pass the time on a cold winter night. it seems to be in a nice quiet part of town. set up with almost everything you need. beds are very comfortable and nice to have a bathroom area in the upstairs.
2022-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our hosts were extremely accommodating. The place is much larger than it looks from the outside. But I will say that the staircases are very narrow so if you have a handicapped individual with you you may want to take that into consideration. Otherwise, the place in the host could not be better."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything I wanted abd more! was very pleased with the entire experience

2021-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Plenty of space for our larger group - the sun room was a nice bonus. Dining table expanded nicely. Location was easy to find.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was hands down the most well thought out AirBnB I have stayed at yet! Comfortable, clean, private and all the amenities you could want. The only downside is that I couldn't stay longer! Thanks again, very highly recommend!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed ending our night there and we where pleasantly suprised by the space and how comfortable we felt instantly 😀.

Would highly recommend Gina and Wes as hosts!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved it! I am a woman traveling solo so it was important for me to find a safe and secure place, and this was it! Very nice neighborhood, very clean, nice homes, no surroundings that were off putting. The area inside the home was beautiful! Everything was very tidy and clean, they had a basket of snacks, bottled water and the bathroom was full of extra toiletry items in case you forgot anything. I feel fortunate I was able to find this gem of a place and the price was amazing! Thank you! I will definitely be booking again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Love this stay! This is my second time at this location and would come back in a heartbeat. Gina is a wonderful host and has thought of everything! Great value—great location—perfect for our stay!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I had a drive from Utah to New York, I decided to book with Gina to get some rest, she was amazing, the place was in a strategic spot on my way, everything was super clean and organized. I would definitely recommend it."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"7 stars - shocked someone rated this less than 5. Great location and plenty of space. Private nice bathroom, kitchenette, bedroom with TV, and living room with another TV. Gina and Wes are great as well."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Just as described in the listing. They were very accommodating for my very late arrival. The place is spotless and the snacks were much appreciated. Only complaint is that the temperature was inconsistent, it was so hot when I got there and then it was on the colder side the rest of the night and morning. It’s a bummer that there’s no separate thermostat for the basement.
Great budget option for a short stay !"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay, couldn't ask for anything more. I would definitely return if in the area. 5 star for sure."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"While I only met Gina’s husband briefly, I felt right at home and they were helpful with communication. They were super helpful in accommodating a special request in checking out and checking in. I will be back!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Gina and Wes were great hosts. They gave us great information on how to find their house. Navigation maps doesn't take you to the front of their house, so it was explained what streets to take and where the house is located. Gina and Wes were not home when we arrived, but their instructions were clear on how to get inside and find the way to our area in the lovely remodeled basement that was designed for being a nice place to stay. There was information for us to find a nice place to eat. We went with one that was an easy walk away. When we returned, Gina and Wes were home and welcomed us.

the personal touches, instructions and spotless space at Gina's was just what I needed. the bed was comfortable and was a i needed for the night. there are 2 televisions too and I was able to log into my DierctTV Stream acct and watch what I wanted.
my wife likes places like this, so hopefully we can stay here during the baseball season and get a weekend Kernels series."
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,My stay was great. The only problem I had was the bed pillows were very flat. I had to use two of them stacked together. Otherwise everything was really nice. It was really cold while I was there but a small heater helped to warm things up.

Thank you so much!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Place was everything and more. Had the whole basement to myself. Gina's hospitality was impeccable and I can't recommend staying at this place enough.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I highly recommend. We wanted for nothing. Gina thought of everything a weary traveler might need and she was prepared. I can honestly say I have never slept so peacefully while traveling.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I needed a nice, quiet place to stay overnight before taking my last CPA exam the next morning.

Would definitely stay there again if I'm ever in the area."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"After two long consecutive days of driving cross-country alone I was spent by the time I got to Gina’s but as soon as I walked in the door and saw her smiling face I felt a great sense of relief. Traveling alone can be taxing so to be able to take refuge in her cozy space and feel like I could really settle in and let my guard down was a gift. Besides Gina’s warmth her basement suite surpassed all expectations. She truly goes above and beyond in every aspect. She is thoughtful to provide snacks and has just about all of your toiletry needs. Really amazing. Of course everything was spotless and felt unused. Oh and it was a total bonus to have her beautiful cats say hello, Misty and Luis.
Thank you so much Gina you are a true Superhost ❤️"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Gina and Wes were very accommodating — and their place was very nice.
We were only there for a short time so we didn’t fully get to enjoy the place— tons of dvds, very peaceful.
However, the bed was really stiff. I moved to the couch about halfway through the night— if you’re a person who likes soft mattresses this probably isn’t a great pick for you!
Overall, this place was definitely worth the price and was a great stay. I wish we’d had more time to interact with Gina and Wes because they were very friendly and welcoming. The kitties also greeted us a few times and they were great company too :)"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,One of the best places we have every stayed at. Everything that we could have ever needed to have an enjoyable stay was there. Couldn’t ask for anything more. We had a great stay and could have stayed longer. Felt right at home. Thank you Gina and Wes!

Thanks for the hospitality and conversation!"

Finding Paul’s house was super simple, gps took me straight to his house & there wasn’t any confusion or getting lost. It being a bit more secluded/tucked away was comfortable and honestly, just what I was looking for wanting to get away from for the day, while also being close to downtown and easily accessible (less than 10mins). Paul was very nice and inviting. His home was calm and clean and looks just like the pictures! Paul answered any questions I had and was easy to talk with. I had a brief issue with the door code and getting back in, but Paul let me in and fixed the issue straight away & had no further issues. Paul is just a super chill & professional guy - he was flexible with my friend coming later in the evening and was inviting to them as well. Super clean!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Only a few blocks away from the downtown area, the Ausadie is not only a nostalgic beauty but an oasis away from the urban din. Walking into the building is like walking into a movie set from the 1920's or '30's, it exudes history. My room in 2c was exceptional; clean, tastefully decorated with art, and the most exquisitely turned bed I've encountered in a long while. An easy walk from the building are great places to eat, the Paramount Theatre, the art museum, and many other attractions I did not have the opportunity to explore. The hosts, Tim and Richard, whom I had the pleasure of meeting and talking to were delightful and very responsive throughout the entire booking process. Highly recommended!"

They left detailed information about where things were, using the wi-fi, pool, fitness room, etc. They also had clear instructions for check-out, which I always appreciate. Their communication was excellent, both before and after my visit.
The location was perfect for me. It's on 1st Avenue, close to I-380 access, close to downtown (but not so close you get a lot of street noise), and from 1st Avenue it's fairly easy to get anywhere in town.
I didn't get to try the pool - there was a birthday/pool party going on and I didn't want to intrude - but the garden area was quite lovely, and I look forward to swimming on my next visit.
I would definitely recommend this place for single travelers. Tim and Richard were excellent hosts!"

Such a beautiful property with great hosts and a very much appreciated welcome surprise of muffins and goodies basket."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Every other review is on the nose- this place is clean, gorgeous, cozy, private, and in a central location. It’s stocked with yummy snacks, cold water, and a smart TV with every streaming service available. The apartment itself almost pales in comparison to the hosts though. Richard and Tim go above and beyond to help their customers with special requests. I really appreciate their willingness to work with me on a late check out and will find a way to visit again in the future."

The unit was just as pictured and more. We loved all the extra touches like plenty of coffee, snacks, local travel magazines and cozy robes. The building itself is quiet and has a mix of tenants and Airbnb units. Although we didn’t use them this time, there’s also a fitness center and pool. We’ll definitely be staying again if we’re back in the area. Also, the breakfast and taco place across the street are great!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This apartment was spectacular, especially if you like historical/old buildings. I loved the whole “vibe” and feel of the building and individual room. It was spacious and cozy. I was there on a cold April day so unfortunately didn’t get to enjoy the pool but the location is close to downtown, check in and parking was easy, and I felt safe and comfortable having been there alone. I really hope to return at a later date with friends or family! Definitely recommend."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a true gem. If you appreciate a retreat with all the small things done right, this is it. Convenient location and has every you need. Hosts are super easy to work with and the check-in/out process is a breeze.
Selfishly I hate to draw more attention to this place because i want to keep it for myself...but when in Cedar Rapids, check this spot out."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The space was perfect for our overnight stay in Cedar Rapids. We were in town for a wedding and wanted some thing close to the venue.

Loved it Loved it Loved it"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a charming apartment in a well maintained historic building. You can tell that Richard & Tim really care about the building and its guests. It's quiet, cozy, well equipped/stocked and very reasonably priced. I didn't check out the gym but the boyfriend said it was also well equipped. It's above and beyond any hotel experience. It felt almost like a bed & breakfast. This is one of the most memorable airbnb's I have found."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a very very good place to stay. The apartment is in a beautifully restored 100-year-old building. The decor is excellent with a large well-stocked kitchen and comfortable renovated bathroom. There is free parking, good wifi, and very pleasant surroundings. I will definitely stay here the next time that I am in Cedar Rapids."

My first AirBnB experience and I’d recommend it to anyone curious!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a gorgeous apartment! It was better than the pictures and description. The owners thought of everything to make our stay enjoyable. Check in was a breeze. We highly recommend.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a beautiful, fully stocked, centrally located apartment at a very reasonable price. The rooms are beautifully decorated and have all the amenities you could want. Current magazines and treats made us feel welcome. We ran out of time, so didn't get to use the pool but beach towels were on the bed in case we wanted to take a dip. The only drawback is the busy road it is located on, but the AC blocked out most of the noise. A slight snafu with our reservation was handled professionally and was not a problem. Downtown location in walkable distance to the art museum, Grant Wood studio, and multiple restaurants. Very responsive, great communication. Would stay again if we make it back to Cedar Rapids."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,I had an excellent stay here. Great communication and checked on me during my extended stay. It was very close to places to eat. The apartment was stocked well for the travelers that prefer to cook for themselves. I really appreciated that. It's a safe and secure building as a female traveler I liked this feature. Parking was no issue. The pool was delightful. I'll be staying here again when in the area.

Definitely staying here again next time we visit!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is FANTASTIC!!!! We loved our stay here and hope to come back every time we visit Cedar Rapids!!

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Quite an interesting time warp! Stepping back into the 1920s, yet with all of the modern comforts. LOVED the refresh that respected the building heritage, and the better half really went ga-ga over the artwork!
*Everything* we could need was there, .. even the kitchen was fully equipped!
Thanks again!!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"An absolutely amazing place. While we only stayed a night, I would like to return for longer. The bed was really comfy. The place itself was just cool."
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"What a tremendous place! The building and evident care that Richard and Tim have put into it are so evident. It was so fun to read the story of Austin and Sadie Palmer. The building itself is also so beautiful; I appreciated the charm and austerity of the dark wood and original fixtures. My only ""ding"" had to do solely with location; the building is super close to the downtown and very proximal to many downtown destinations, but as a result of that, there were quite a few late night ambulance and other traffic noises. Minor and out of Richard and Tim's control, but just a heads up for guests looking to stay that there will likely be some exterior noise. The check-in was extremely straightforward and convenient, and the actual apartment was spotless. I really appreciated the attention to cleanliness and COVID19 safety protocols. Would definitely recommend! I didn't get to utilize the pool, but noted it as well! :) Would definitely stay here again if in Cedar Rapids, but would just make sure to bring ear plugs as a light sleeper."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This place is a paradise in the middle of the city. From the minute you walk through the front door you feel right at home. The rooms are as perfect as in the pictures, with all the little touches of home. Complete kitchen with coffee and snacks. Supreme bedding and most comfortable mattress. The bathroom has thick towels and great smelling body wash. The yard is beautifully landscaped with pond, fountain and pool. I can’t say enough about how wonderful it was to stay here- I was here for 6 weeks for work. The building is a mixture of Airbnb and full time tenants. The tenants are all friendly. Richard and Tim are like family. I recommend staying here and I will be back."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I have stayed in multiple listings at this location, and I have loved them all. If you have a chance to stay here, I highly recommend it!"

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is my 2nd stay in this building. The location is convenient to everything, the space is beautifully decorated, the extra touches like snacks and bathrobes just go above and beyond. You also can't beat the price. I'll for sure return."

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"From the entrance to the building to the entrance to the room, everything is first class. The space is just as pictured, so warm and decorated elegantly. The sheets, towels and provided bathrobes are first rate. The silverware and pot ware in the kitchen are better than mine at home. All the personal touches- the shampoo and soaps, the snacks and water- help to make you feel right at home. I am definitely returning and look forward to my next visit."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Rich and Tim's place was a perfect setting for our weekend needs. The kitchen had everything we needed to spend an evening a cooking and spending time together. The market down the block was a great place to grab coffee, ice cream or a cocktail. I highly recommend renting this AirBnB."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful little place. Perfect for 1 or 2 people. We loved it!
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment would be a great place to stay any time, but it's especially great for COVID safety. I so appreciated having a key code to enter & check in, and the care and attention put into this space! Little touches like snacks, water & coffee pods are great after traveling, and the hosts were fast to respond to any questions I had. Looking forward to staying here again!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Decided on a last minute trip to CR to visit with family. Was happy to find a place at such a reasonable rate for a one night trip. I was hoping the place would be as cute as the pictures showed....and it was and then some. Very cozy, homey, tasteful....located in such a cool historic and well maintained building. Very thoughtful hosts....it snowed overnight and someone cleaned the snow off of our vehicle in the morning. Would stay here again in a heartbeat. Thanks for everything!"

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We came to Cedar Rapids for a wedding at the DoubleTree but didn't want to spend the outrageous price to stay at the hotel for two nights. This location was only a few blocks up the road and worked wonderful! That space was beautiful and Richard and Tim left some wonderful amenities. It had everything we needed and was easy to access. Communication was easy and we had all the information we needed without having to ask. We will for sure stay again if we find ourselves back in Cedar Rapids!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great place host response quickly great location close to downtown and close to my work. Will stay here again.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This place was perfect for my needs. I am a writer who needs time away from home to shut out the world and Richard and Tim were very accommodating. The bed was high quality - I slept like a baby every night. The kitchen was fully stocked with everything I needed to cook full meals. The pool and garden were lovely. My only criticism is the location, which is right downtown. But the building is pretty sound proof and the pool and garden have a high fence allowing one to shut out the busy, noisy street. Compared to other Airbnb places I've stayed, the value was the best. Overall, I was very happy and will definitely be back."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,You'll feel like you're in a movie as soon as you walk into the complex. The location is close to restaurants and bars. Parking on site was wonderful.

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I have stayed at multiple locations in Cedar Rapids, and this stay was easily my favorite. I came to visit my daughter and, due to COVID, we had to stay in pretty much the whole time, but we played games and watched movies on the very nice TV in the room. While I didn't cook this time, I was very pleased to see a large assortment of cookware.
The snacks and muffins were unexpected and greatly appreciated.
Highly recommend!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Richard and Tim's apartment building is beyond beautiful! The garden and pool were quiet and lush.

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. Would stay again
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"House is clean.
Kitchen well stocked.
Super comfortable beds and pillows!
Nice ceiling fans in bedrooms.
The fridge is new and nice. The oven is very old
This is a townhouse/duplex.
I paid the five day rental and all fees in full, the day I booked so everything was set and hassle free.
However, too much communication (8 text messages) about adding a guest for two nights. The request to pay the extra $22 couldn’t be completed electronically because the host had previously added a $150 “resolution fee” the day we arrived. The fee is returned after check out. Fees have to be paid in the order they are issued. I left the additional $22 in cash on counter when we checked out. We were very busy with a wedding and this issue of $22 extra dollars being paid was irritating. I suggest raising the nightly rental fee to a flat rate regardless of the number of people staying."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great place to stay. Very clean home neighborhood is quiet. Communication with host was easy. Will stay again in the future!

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Directions and instructions were clear and helpful. Check in was done remotely, and instructions for entering the house were sent via text shortly before arrival. House rules and instructions were printed and left in the kitchen and living room. They were very reasonable and easy to follow. The home was comfortable and had everything we needed for a weeklong stay. The neighborhood is quiet, but we’ll located, and the neighbors are friendly."

It’s one side of a duplex, but we never heard a sound from the other side. The furnishings are eclectic but comfortable.

We loved that we were able to cook a meal there and she had all utensils, pans, etc we needed. The place even had a toaster which is surprisingly absent in most Airbnbs.
Communication with Joan was always quick and helpful. Unfortunately we were not able to meet her, but we had all the info we needed for self check-in beforehand and it was easy! We will stay again if ever in the area."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautifully restored piece of Czech history of Cedar Rapids; very clean and accessible. We like the location next to Newbo and CSPS Hall. A little distant from parts of downtown, but it is still walkable if you have time."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Incredibly well restored space, staying true to the history but creating comfort! I had it for a mini girlfriend getaway, perfect for walking to restaurants and shopping. Being the only apartment we didn't feel bad about laughing and talking late into the night. Upstairs location felt extra secure for the nights I was by myself too. Loved all the tile and of course the micro museum. Recommended!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sue is an excellent host! She answered all our questions and was very accommodating.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a two night stay in Iowa with a 3yr old and a 6yr old. They, as well as us, enjoyed the excitement of walking up the stairs to find our little retreat for the weekend. Our children also enjoyed the themed firemen books and the games that were provided.
Please expect to carry your suitcases and all items up a steep flight of stairs. If anyone has physical constraints this is not the place for you.
The house also has a lot of windows, if you are sensitive to light like I am, or can only sleep when it is very dark make sure you bring an eye mask (which I always travel with), but it didn’t bother my husband or kids at all :) , the shades were plenty to keep the room dark.
The decor is delightful and the surrounding coffee shops and bars are all within waking and biking distance. I wish we would have had more time explore all the local places."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place. One of the best I’ve stayed at.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I loved the location and space! The kitchen is limited but I did not have time to cook, so it was adequate for my needs. I hope to return on a future trip to Cedar Rapids. Thank you for all your communication and assistance, Sue! You are a fab host."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a great time. The airbnb was exactly like it was described on the site. It was super clean, and check-in directions were easy to follow. Sue was a great host. I'd highly recommend people to book with her airbnb. We ate at Cedar Ridge Winery the first night and Kingston Steakhouse the second night. Both places are great. Make sure to stop in downstairs at the stationary shop and visit the Almost Famous ice cream/ popcorn shop. The market across the street is also great.
Thanks again, Sue!😊"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The firehouse did not disappoint! The place is clean and cozy and so homey! It was so easy to get in and out of.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall Sue’s place is the perfect location. It was easy to find street parking and I was within walking distance of restaurants, coffee shops, and the convention center. The place had all of the amenities I needed and was thoughtfully decorated.
I will say two things, the location is awesome but just note that if you are trying to sleep you will need earplugs, which are provided. Secondly you’ll need to use your own streaming service, which I wasn’t super successful in casting or logging in (probably a personal problem :-) ).
I’d definitely stay again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Unique space and good location of your are going to be downtown in Cedar Rapids and don't want to stay in a chain hotel.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I loved staying at Sue's firehouse-themed apartment. The location is right in the heart of the New Bo neighborhood in Cedar Rapids. The New Bo Market is directly across the street from the apartment, and there are several restaurants, bars, a coffee shop, a popcorn/ice cream shop, and other unique shops within 1-2 blocks of the apartment. During our visit, we enjoyed a guided tour of the Brucemore Mansion and the shops and restaurants in both the New Bo neighborhood and the nearby Czech Village. We would definitely stay here again, we and will recommend it to friends and family who need a place to stay in the Cedar Rapids area.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely LOVED our stay at the Bohemian Firehouse and highly recommend! Sue was an excellent communicator, and check in and out was seamless. The place was impeccably neat, clean, and full of character. The high ceilings make it feel spacious and airy. We slept more than soundly in the king-sized bed with memory foam mattress, and plenty of pillows for our comfort! The location is amazing too - we walked across the street to the City Market on Sunday morning where a variety of local vendors offer delicious fresh food and fun things to buy (think indoors farmers market). You can also walk to several restaurants, shops, and bars. Finally, it was just a short drive to Coe College, where we watched our son play tennis all weekend. Can't talk this place up enough. Thank you so much Sue!!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is absolutely what you would find in the dictionary under charming! Cute and comfortable (great bed) and in the heart of a great little neighborhood - and across the river from another quaint historic district. There is shopping and dining nearby (within the block). You'll love Script which is in the building - it's hard not to spend money there (we found their other store - Scout - in nearby Marion). We loved walking to breakfast at Brewhemia on the next block. We were there during a cold snap and want to come back when it's warmer and we'll plan to stay at Hose Co. No. 4 again.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the cutest AirBnb in such a great area of Cedar Rapids. Very private and quiet, but close to many restaurants and attractions."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had the absolute best time at Hose Co 4 ! Such a fun charming experience. I am obsessed with the stationary store below and had THE best taco of my life at a restaurant nearby called Caucho. Walking distance to fun shops and places to eat. The kitchen and bathroom are roomy and you even get a cool exhibit in the bathroom. The living/bed combination was spacious and the mattress was so comfortable I never wanted to get out.
Plenty of fun design elements to create a fun firehouse experience.
Thank you for the Christmas Tree!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This space was beautiful, quiet, decorated with historic and super charming decor, and very clean. I loved the natural light during the day. The walkable location and free parking out back were great perks to this rental. Because it is an older building, it took a minute to warm up , but was cozy and comfortable once we got settled in. A nicer shower than I expected. I would definitely recommend this spot to a friend."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sue went above and beyond for us. We had a lovely weekend stay for a wedding downtown. Highly recommend the place to anyone else looking.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place. Highly recommend.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an awesome spot - we loved all the history and unique touches, right in the heart of newbo! We will definitely be back. This spot is a gem and a must stay the next time you’re in the area."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a wonderful weekend in a wonderfully honored and well preserved place!
Communication with the host was timely and everything was in good, working order and as listed on the site.
The apartment is spacious and immaculately kept.
The bed was comfortable and the decor was fun and matched perfectly with the atmosphere.
Everything is within walking distance and there is plenty to do and explore.
On the first night, I had to retrieve something from my car at a late hour and I felt totally comfortable and safe while doing so.
The area is great for a variety of reasons and this place only heightened the experience. We will return!"
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"Very cool restored firehouse apartment on 2nd floor above stationary shop, on main square in New Bohemia. Kitchen, good bed, A/C - all good. Would have given 10/10 if had laundry facilities. Will return!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This cute firehouse-themed place was really fun to stay in. No problems getting in, and it was very safe and secure. There were plenty of linens and kitchen supplies, and we had everything we needed. We were there in the sumer, and the AC worked well. There are several restaurants right nearby. There's an electric stove, microwave and a large refrigerator. The king bed was comfy (not so sure about the sofa bed if you needed an extra). Even though the neighborhood gets very busy towards the weekend because of the Newbo Market and it's activities, it quieted down at night and we were able to find nearby free parking all week. Plus, they provide a sound soother and ear plugs just in case. We didn't use it, but there's a large TV. Some cooking essentials are in the cabinets, such as salt, pepper and oil. The shower was nice with plenty of hot water. I would recommend this place for 2 people looking for a place to stay in this hip section of the great little city of Cedar Rapids!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The firehouse is the perfect place to stay if you want to be in the heart of the Newbo area. It is warm & inviting, perfectly decorated & clean as a whistle. I would definitely stay here again."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The firehouse is a wonderful and truly unique place to stay right in the heart of a fantastic neighbourhood. The host has put a lot of thought and creativity into making the place very comfortable, and we had a great four-night stay. The firehouse is actually bigger than we expected, and we were blown away by how close (steps) it was to many cafes, restaurants, bars, and stores. Parking was free and convenient and we felt very safe even late at night. This is a gem of a place to stay if you are visiting Cedar Rapids."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location to enjoy the NewBo night life, and great breakfast locations. Close to the Czech Village as well. Very clean and the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on. We’ve recommended it to our entire family and hope to stay again each year!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely historic place to stay right down by the Newbo market. Can walk to lots of places or use scooters or bikes. Sue is an excellent host. I will be back!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We travelled from the UK to attend a wedding, but stayed a few days beforehand to get over the jet lag and to have a short holiday break.
The old fire station was so much better than a hotel. It’s so central that there’s lots you can explore on foot. An interesting market just across the street, with a park that hosted an art fair and live music on different days. We tried several local bars and restaurants, including the motorcycle themed Chrome Horse, which also had a live band.
We walked across the river to see the Czech quarter, and to visit the Czech and Slovak museum. We walked to the African American museum. We drove around the Amana colonies and had a great homemade soup in their former communal kitchen.
The ice cream in the nearby popcorn shop was outstanding.
So we had a great stay in a place full of character. We got used to the number of people taking photos of the house - and the young model using this house and the one next door as a backdrop for her photoshoot.
Hostess Sue could not have been more helpful, welcoming us with Union Jack bunting, suppling a kettle for making tea and an iron and ironing board so I could iron my shirt for the wedding.
This wasn’t a cheap place to stay, but it gave us a very memorable holiday and was worth every penny. Thank you."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This little gem was so absolutely awesome & in a cute neighborhood!! The shop on the ground floor was fantastic as well!

Since I and all of the bridal party live out of town we were able to bring in all of the church, rehearsal, and wedding dinner decorations into one location and did not have to run back and forth for the entire weekend. We had all three locations within one mile of the Firehouse. The accommodations were clean and all kitchen and bathroom accessories were aplenty. I would recommend the Firehouse for a nice getaway."

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The photos don't even begin to show the historic charm of this amazing property! The host has thought of so many amenities, right down to the bag chairs for live outdoor entertainment right across the street. We enjoyed the bustle of activity outside during the day and the quiet, restful nights on the deluxe king bed and comfy sleeper sofa.
You'll want to be comfortable with climbing stairs staying here. They are a bit steep but just add to the character of the Firehouse."

Coffee and tea provided; just bring some creamer cups to make it perfect morning time. Great restaurant was Black Sheep close by. Concert at McGrath was cool. All in all; a superb long eeekend stay
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The firehouse is a gem in a great neighborhood with everything in walking distance. Don’t miss the large glass mosaic art by Grant Wood in the Veterans Admin Building, a 20 minute walk away, Wood’s largest artwork, and done prior to American Gothic. Very comfortable bed and living spaces, spacious bathroom, and enough kitchen for 2.

,,,"Joan tried to charge us for TV channels, snow removal, & then at the end of the stay tried to charge us almost $1500 to replace a glass shelf in the refrigerator which she ended up buying a new fridge instead of replacing the shelf that was broken because of food that she had stored in the freezer. She also tried to charge for normal wear & tear on a front door weather strip and a toilet handle. Also trying to charge us for snow removal & tv is ridiculous!"
