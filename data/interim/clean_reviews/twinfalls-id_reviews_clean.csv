2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We were in town visiting Shoshone Falls and enjoyed how close this was to that. Simple check in and check out. Very nice Airbnb and the bed was so comfortable! We were a little surprised of the noise coming from in the house as we could hear conversations. But it was fine as we didn’t spend that much time during the day in the Airbnb. Great place for the price.

2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"My stay at Marty's place was very pleasant; Marty is the epitome of the friendly, well-meaning and well-organized host.
Unfortunately, due to the nightmare experience I had with Airbnb in another city I can no longer recommend Airbnb to anyone. Airbnb's customer service is more accurately described as ""customer abuse."" I would have ended up sleeping in the street had I not made my own (hotel) arrangements in another city, 50 miles away; I had to cut my visit to Washington State short as a result. I will not use Airbnb again. I hope hosts like Marty will demand that Airbnb scrap its current ""customer support"" operation and rebuild it from the ground up with a completely new team and the value of actually helping customers.
Another - and perhaps better - option for Marty would be to abandon Airbnb altogether in favor of a hosting platform that values customers (guests)."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Marty's playlce feel just like home~ she has a lot of things you can use in the kitchen too~ highly recommended for those who look for short term/longer term stay. (p.s. I am going back to stay at her place one more night after I finish my trip)

I took a walk after my long day in the car!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay for the night as I passed through and explore part of Idaho. Marty was very responsive and had everything I needed. The one downside was that I wanted to use the hot tub, as it was a listed amenity. But when I got there I was informed that it was closed."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my very first experience booking an Airbnb. I can’t say enough positive things about Marty and her home and the experience we had at her place. The home was centrally located and close to all amenities in Twin Falls. It was a great value and the neighborhood was safe and quiet. The turtle reef bedroom was comfortable (loved having our own frig in the room) and the shared bathroom was clean. The shared kitchen space was accessible and easy to navigate with labeled cabinets and drawers to easily locate items. Marty’s home had everything a person could ever want or need. She was an accommodating host and went above and beyond for me and my granddaughter. It was everything I was looking for and more in an airbnb (including the basement where my granddaughter could play with children’s toys as well as a large outdoor area for playing outside as well). Enjoyed staying at her place. Would stay again in a heartbeat and would recommend others book a stay too. Thank you Marty!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Marty always has the room set with all you could need for a short or long stay
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Marty did an excellent job in preparing for all our needs and in providing comprehensive instructions concerning how things are done at her place. She kindly showed us some flexibility in her schedule by allowing us to check-in early when we arrived in her area several hours earlier than we expected to arrive. She is a pleasant person to associate with, and her home is beautifully and tastefully decorated. We thoroughly enjoyed the tropical/sea turtle theme of the room, and the bed was very comfortable so that we slept soundly. This was our first time at an AirB&B in which we shared a bathroom with other guests, and we experienced no times during our stay in which we needed to wait for someone else to finish in the bathroom.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean place to crash for a night. The bathroom and bedroom were spotless. Checkin was easy. The kitchen was well equipped. Communication was easy and Marty always responded quickly. It was quiet and we couldn't hear the other guests. Wifi was a bit on the slower side (3Mbits), and we couldn't open the window im our room or see through it since it was blocked with an insulating cover. Basicly a windowless room. The A/C provided enough airflow during the night, though. Great value!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, convenient stay."

For those who over heat easily this is a perfect room, the ac was set to very cold and the room was so nice and cool in temperature. did not wake up hot at all, as we did in the airbnb room we booked the following night. you could adjust the temp by the closing the floor vent, but we left it wide open and slept super comfortably.
very nice room and very clean.
huge plus, they had clorox wipes in the bathroom along with odor sprays and sanitizer items, so sharing a bathroom with 1 female who checked in and out before us was easy and not a problem at all. this was our first time renting a room only through airbnb and I will.do it again!! I would book this room again! very very clean as well :)"

She was lovely from the time of booking, waited up for us even though we arrived late and made sure we were settled. The room itself was exceptionally clean, comfortable, had every amenity I could think of- from make-up remover and cotton wipes in the bathroom, to shower supplies, to chargers in the room.
We left in the morning, refreshed after a great night’s sleep and hit up Twin Beans- we highly suggest it- get the strawberry tonic!
And Marty’s home was on a quiet street and it felt very safe."

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I think best value would be to book this place longer term . Short term bookings have the same pesky cleaning fee which is more about air BnB than the actual hosts.
It’s a really nice setup here and would be a good place for a small family to stay with a very large bed and some couches that could easily sleep children. The cooking facilities were excellent with super efficient induction stove and a wonderfully clever microwave that cooks super fast ! I didn’t use the oven but it’s nice to have one available. If you are looking to get away and save some cash by cooking at home this is an unbeatable place for it!
There is a big beautiful park walking distance and some coffee shops and restaurants not far away.
The street is quiet and safe and my motorcycle was unmolested out on the street. I’d love to come back for a longer stay but this place is popular for good reason !"

If you go to sheli’s you get what you pay for. If you go to sheli’s and expect the belagio, you’re an idiot. Traveler know yourself.
So thank you sheli. And, oddly enough that bed was really comfy."

2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The apartment was super clean and exactly as the pictures look. It is definitely an older home in an older neighborhood, but it was cozy.
My only real problem was that the owners were doing their laundry at 10pm and it was super noisy (must have been located above the bedroom we slept in). But, to be fair I didn’t say anything to them or ask them to fix the noise issue either."

The night we got there I open the cupboard to find a Box of k cups.. I was so happy.The next morning when I woke up to make my coffee it was just a Box, no k cups in it. There was sugar in it. I went to take my shower. The water pressure was so low that I could barely get it on. It took 8 seconds just to fill up a cup of water. That is how slow it was... The only plug in the bedroom was under the bed. My husband had to climb under the bed just to plug in a cell phone charger. Also the lamp cords, in the bedroom, were not long enough to even reach the plug in...the bed was comfy and house was clean"

This property was just as described.
I was incredibly happy with the accommodations. I needed to care for my daughter while she recovered from surgery. The location was great- close to CSI so my daughter could still participate in classes, and observe practices. Adjacent to Fred Meyers (glorified Wally World, you’ll love it!), Maverick, as well as several fast food locations, restaurants, & coffee shops.
This property is clean and well taken care of. Very comfortable for my daughters recovery!

The place was easy to find, easy to remember lock code.
Unfortunately there was no toaster as stated, the owner was away, but immediately responded, but then it took 4 days for her to finally tell us we were not getting a toaster for our stay!
It felt really weird sleeping on beds that had plastic waterproof covers.
Who ever cleaned before our arrival left the other sets of sheets in the dryer, Sorry, I didn't fold them.
It would be nice for a dish towel instead of constantly using paper towels to dry things.
Thank goodness for Dollar Tree, we had to buy dishwasher tablets, as there was only 1 under the sink, for the last day of leaving when we were asked to start the dishwasher."

Marty is the finest white star diamond resorts? Geez, I don’t know what to say she’s the best Private and has high standards for herself and doesn’t pass it on to her. Guess she’s not too many rules and the price was outrageous. I would’ve paid more but I guess I’ll have to do that with tips with her next time.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Farah was amazing. I would 12 out of 10 recccomend. It was booked as a needed getaway for my mom and was everything and more than what she needed.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was such a sweet little RV. I had never stayed in one before and was surprised at how roomy it felt. Everything worked perfectly. I loved watching the quail through the window. I was just passing through so didn't take advantage of Hot Springs and other things to do in the area. Maybe I'll just have to go back!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy fifth wheel and exactly as described. Bed was very comfortable and the AC worked well. Farah was proactive with driving instructions, but if you have difficulty seeing at night, it would be better to arrive while the sun is out. We didn’t cook, but there was a stove, oven, and microwave and we saw pots/pans available. Restaurants close up early in the area so make sure to go at a reasonable time (unlike us); if not, Twin Falls has a few more options. There is water nearby and we enjoyed paddle boarding (we brought our own). A lot of the websites for the area were very inaccurate, so make sure you call or just go and explore."

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Really enjoyed our stay! First time staying in an RV — we were surprised and impressed! We had everything we needed and check-in was super smooth. Suuuuper close to miracle hot springs which was a great experience. I will say tho, if you have someone sleeping on the futon or the lower level, the whole place does get a little shaky when there’s movement. Was still able to get a good night’s sleep regardless. We were happy with everything. Oh also! Great for stargazing!
Apparently G maps won’t give you the right location but we were able to use the coordinates from apple maps and put it into G maps."

Also, the area is very quiet and the owners respect your privacy. This is a nice, affordable place to stay. Thanks, Farah!"

I would definitely stay again at either of her places."

During our two-week stay, some city workers came to do maintenance on the water main, and then some lawn care was done. In both cases, Shelli made sure we knew in advance they were coming and kept us apprised of changes in the schedule. The house was perfectly suited to our needs, so pet-friendly, and more than enough room for the extra stuff we needed to keep there as we were between selling and buying our own houses. It was so wonderful to have a real place to stay, cook our own food, do our own laundry, and just live life while taking care of business. Thank you Shelli!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kasi's Air B&B was more than exceptional!! I traveled from southern Arizona to Nevada for a doctor's appointment and then headed straight there. I forgot about the time change and the traffic in Vegas was horrible. Kasi was more than accommodating. I updated my time of arrival to her which ended up being 3 hours later than expected, she was more than awesome letting me know it was OK and she would leave the exterior lights on for me. The space was amazing in a quiet neighborhood with every amenitie you could possibly need. If I could I'd give 6 stars. went above and beyond for me. Highly recommend."

We were happy to find we could do laundry too. And we hadn't realized that you could access the Snake Canyon Rim Trail, just a couple of blocks away.

The space had all the essentials needed for a comfortable stay, including a stove, washer and dryer. The special surprise was the cute and friendly cat that came to greet us while we were unloading the car. His name is Spot and he may be the neighbor’s cat but it made our stay even better! I’ll definitely consider staying here again the next time I’m in Twin Falls."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect place for a quick stop for some weary travelers
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely FABULOUS rental! Kasi is an amazing host, super quick to respond and very informative and friendly. Her private studio was identical to the pictures published and everything was exceptionally clean and very updated. She has all the amenities you’d need if you forgot anything, which is very nice cause I can be forgetful! Great location, lots of restaurants and retail/grocery very close by.

2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"I’ve stayed here before & it’s such a nice place. It’s kept very clean & it is very easy to check in. The only hiccup was that I requested a late check out (12 or 1 pm) that the hosts agreed to on day of check in. I later asked if I could check out later than 1 pm, & she ended up responding while I was sleeping (morning of check out) saying that she needed me to check out by 11 (even though we had agreed on 12 or 1). Since I was sleeping, I didn’t see the message, so she came and knocked on the door at about 11:30 saying she was going to have to charge me a late fee for having to change the time for the cleaners twice, and that I needed to be out in 10 minutes because the cleaners were arriving. I was in bed so I quickly got my things together & checked out. I think it was a miscommunication but I was a little disappointed at how it all played out. Still generally a good place to stay, though."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I was passing though Twin Falls on my way to Minneapolis from the PNW. After a long day of driving Kasi's space was such a wonderful place to unwind and relax. After days on the road it was an extra treat to be able to do some laundry! The space is clean, quiet, and very comfortable. As a new homeowner I was impressed with the details and craftsmanship put into the space. I wasn't able to explore Twin Falls much but what I saw was beautiful. I hope to make it back to Idaho! Thank you for a lovely stay!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kasi was very friendly. Communicated very clearly and very responsive. Place is tucked away. There was a nice parking option and easy access to the location.

The area was convenient, we found the perfect coffee shop right across the street and we went there daily.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow! Where do I even begin. I’ve stayed at quite a few Airbnbs and this one is by far the most aesthetic and cozy that I’ve seen. The ambience was next level - from the fire and music playing outdoors when we arrived, to the sweet little (and big) touches in the dècor (that root system by the bed is fantastic)… my wife and I were delighted at every turn.
Wonderful experience - soaking in the hot tub then relaxing by the fire was so refreshing, and we had a good night of rest in the comfortable bed. This whole place was very thoughtfully and creatively put together, and the hosts were very communicative.
Thank you Shawn and Stasia for making such a gem available!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely fantastic. The 5-star rating is well-deserved. We stayed here two nights while on a snowboard trip, and it was wonderful to come back to.

We would love to come back for sure!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is an incredible place to stay. I was only in town for about 9 hours but i sure do wish it could have been longer. The decor was so friendly and inviting. The backyard was so relaxing feeling. If get the chance I will definity rent this place for a night again.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed here several times and love it! We love it so much that we drive 2 hours to come have a magical, romatic get-away here! When some prior dates didn't work out for us, they worked with us to rebook. We love that you can stay there the whole time and be completely content staying-in or if you stay a couple days it is a great place to come back to after a day of adventuring. Between the comfy chairs inside, the warm fireplace outside (BBQ when it is warmer out) and the hot tub it is a beautiful, calming place to connect with your loved one and relax. Beautifully decorated with essential oils, calming music, fairy twinkle lights and a calming salt lamp. This is a true treasure nestled into an unlikely location that you can get lost in."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I stayed at this place for our anniversary and it exceeded our expectations. It was very private, cozy and romantic.

I feel like we really lucked out with finding this place. It’s the perfect little romantic get away."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The hosts were so quick to respond and helpful. I needed a later checkout time, she was able to extend by an hour which was perfect for me.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Me and my husband had just got married and wanted something Romantic for the night. This was absolutely beautiful and would definitely stay again loved everything about the place private parking spot you walk in and it looks like a lil forest oasis loved the tranquil music they had playing outside the fire pit and bbq and hot tub then walking in the door was greeted by bird chirping sounds was rustic inside. Loved how they had a tree branches by the bed with twinkle lights and omg the bed was amazing and the big decorative pillows were so soft. This was so much better than a hotel for the night and so much more romantic. Then they even left us a lil present to find and take home. Won’t say what it is so not to spoil it for the next couple that stays. I Give this beautiful place a 1000/10♥️♥️♥️♥️

A relaxing oasis in the middle of everything. We spent the evening enjoying the pre lit fire pit and hot tub and totally forgot the rush of life outside the gate! I would describe this stay as comparable to a 5 star resort spa stay!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I have stayed in a few air bnb's over the last couple years and have never had a bad experience. But...this place truly exceeded my expectations. The property is like an oasis in the middle of town, place is as described, and then some!!! Shawn and Stasia provide the most in privacy and comfort. Twin Falls is a cool city with a lot of hidden natural beauty. But even without all that this place would be a destination in itself!!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place and we had a great time!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,One of my all time favorite stays. Absolutely beautiful inside & out. The design was so peaceful & whimsical. They were thoughtful host and had the little things to make us feel at home. We stayed for one night wish we could’ve stayed longer. Can’t wait to return.🧡🧡🧡
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is outstanding! I have told all my friends and family how it touched all 5 senses almost from the moment you walk through the gate!
We loved all the attention to detail. Beautiful, clean linens. Such a wonderful smell with the natural cleaning supplies! The hot tub is super up to date and great!
It's hard to imagine you are literally right off the main drag of town, but it's a little ""Nature Corner"". We so enjoyed our time here! Sean and Stacia were great hosts, responded well to any questions and provided flexible check out. 5 stars 🌟 x 5 senses! 25 🌟 🙂"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"All time best Airbnb hosts!!!! So accommodating, thorough, kind, considerate, the list goes on… they just wowed us, and so did their property. It’s a show stopper. Shawn and Stasia, set the mood from the moment we pulled up with tranquil music while entering their lush garden. The place looks like it’s right out of a magazine, everything in a perfect artistic place. Lots of heart and soul went into its creation, no doubt. My husband and I sat for hours admiring the structure, design, and craftsmanship of this home. We are renovating our own place, just us, so we know how hard it is to complete these things.. Overall, we had a rejuvenating experience, that I’m now afraid I won’t get at any other Airbnb. I don’t want to spoil anything for future guests, but know you are being thought of before, during, and after your stay.. these folks really care about giving their guests a place to let all their worries wash away. The hot tub really helps out with that! S&S you’re the best <3"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I am extremely satisfied and will stay again.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful! We had a lovely time. Hope to come back!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The space is unique. It feels cozy an luxurious, and mixes rustic/industrial with nature to create an incredible experience. This is definitely one of our new favorite places. Everything you could possibly need, and way more, was provided by the hosts. I prepared for a lot of noise from the nearby streets, but surprisingly, hardly noticed it. The beautiful oasis that you are immersed in, makes you forget that you are in town. It is also within walking distance of stores and restaurants, which is just an added convenience. LOVED this place so much, and we'll most definitely be back. 100% HIGHLY recommend!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Shawn and Stasia’s place was by far one of the most beautiful, cozy and relaxing places I’ve stayed. Everything about the place was pure magic and charming. I wish I could live there!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was so wonderful I felt renewed and inspired just from a weekend visit. The space is so secluded you wouldn’t believe you’re so close to a main road. I had a wonderful peaceful relaxing stay and would highly recommend staying here.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is my second stay with Shawn and Stasia! They are incredible hosts with a very peaceful paradise of a space. The landscaping is gorgeous and makes you feel like you are in the woods. The home decor is inviting and organic and very well-curated. It is warm and welcoming. They had everything we needed and then some! I would highly recommend this place and we will be back!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Rustic romance - wonderful staycation. Lots of restaurants and lovely waterfalls. We had a lovely time, and would recommend it for a romantic evening or zen retreat. Bring your own food and celebrate the wonderful vibes and escape."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Magical would be an apropos one-word description of this lovely Airbnb. The love and attention to every little detail is apparent everywhere you lay your eyes. It ended up being the perfect respite we needed and at the end of each day, we could hardly wait to get back there.
Sitting on the patio sipping wine by the fire pit listening to the lovely music selections on the house iPad, soaking in the hot tub or nestled. in the cozy interior reading a book - perfection every time.
My wife and I have stayed in some amazing Airbnbs far & wide, but the Artdoorsy Uncommons is special beyond compare. Already looking forward to the next time we can score a stay here."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful stay. They really made an effort to provide a calming and well designed environment. The stay was top notch. They really put their heart and soul in the place and it shows. Everything was well maintained and very clean. A beautiful and serene airbnb. Would definitely recommend it and we will be back if we are in the neighbourhood.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One of the nicest Airbnbs we've stayed in. Shawn and Stasia have created a beautiful oasis. We especially loved the garden and outdoor space. Inside, it's clean and had everything we needed. Wish we could have stayed longer than one night. We'll hope to book again when we're passing through Twin Falls."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We found thisthis to be a hidden oasis in the heart of town. The space was extremely relaxing. Outdoor space is as good as the indoor space.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was purely magical! Would stay again in a heartbeat. Shawn and Stasia were wonderful hosts.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Always spectacular!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,An oasis in Twin Falls. Loved the thought and art both inside and out. Fireplace and hot tub were outstanding and bed was super comfy. Loved being able to play music outside while eating and hot tubbing. Nice touches all around. My wife and I can’t wait to stay again next time in TF.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The last several reviews before mine all said, this place was one of the best Airbnb’s they have ever stayed in. They are not over exaggerating. We walked into an incredibly beautiful garden area, where the hot tub is in a very private spot, just steps from the fire that they had going for us as we arrived. Calming music was playing over the outside speakers, and no detail was missed. I was very impressed with how cozy the place felt with minimal, but carefully chosen, decorations. It had everything we needed. We were blown away. We would absolutely stay here again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great hosts! Private and relaxing.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Felt like a mini resort all to ourselves. The outdoor space was private, relaxing and comfortable. Just what my wife and I needed. The hosts have put so much heart and soul into creating the entire space, both inside and out, to make this feel like your own private resort. The lighting created such wonderful ambiance. The place was perfectly clean and the bed was soft and cozy. Would definitely visit again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely gorgeous. The pictures don't do it justice. The amount of time that went into every detail of building and decorating- I can't imagine. The tiniest details are beautiful and inspiring for me as an artist. It really was awwing and so serene. Can you please come decorate my house? Had the best, most peaceful and relaxing time here. Great stay for our 15 year anniversary. Nothing but great things to say- we will look back on our time here with great affection. Thank you for sharing this magical place with us."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful stay at Shawn and Stasia's place! The home and yard area were beautiful and it felt like they put intention in every choice they made. I enjoyed noticing new thoughtful details each day!! My trip was a personal retreat for me and this was the perfect place. I felt like I had escaped somewhere remote even though town was just on the other side of the fence. I could sometimes hear cars because town was so close, but I couldn't see them. And, the outdoor speaker that Shawn and Stasia set up made it easy to fill my ears with music or nature sounds that made me feel like I was off in the woods. I felt very welcomed and appreciated the small, thoughtful details. It seemed like my enjoyment really mattered to them."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This retreat is like something out of a dream! The moment you walk in, you are greeted with a feeling a peace and tranquillity! We sat by the fire and ate our dinner, roasted marshmallows and soaked in the hot tub late into the evening, and enjoyed the comforts of a relaxing getaway! The extra special touches that made us feel welcome, loved and unique didn’t go unnoticed. We will be back every time we visit Twin!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Really nice place. Even though right by a Main Street the sound wasn’t noticeable and didn’t feel like you were in city. Shawn and Stasia even had a little scavenger hunt around the property to do.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"OMG - this is by far the best airbnb we have ever stayed in! We were just passing through but will now consider a return trip just to stay here again. Felt like we were at a spa! After a 10 day road trip, this was our last stop. We felt completely rejuvenated after our stay. The ambiance and special care our hosts took in welcoming us felt very nurturing, from the music, outdoor lighting and patio with gas fire pit, hot tub, chocolates and treasure hunt. We will be back! It was awesome! Thank you Shawn and Stasia!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,exelent
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Rented this for my daughter and her husband's wedding night. They absolutely loved it.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely breathtaking! The entire place was so private and peaceful! What a hidden gem! We needed a place to stop and rest on our road trip for our anniversary and what a romantic place we stumbled upon! It was late and last minute on our end but Shawn and Stasia were so accommodating and sweet! There’s not one thing I could change about this experience other than wishing we stayed another night!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place! Peaceful, relaxing. Very clean. The ambiance is perfect inside right when you walk in you feel relaxed. We spent most of our time in the evenings sitting by the fire pit enjoying the beautiful landscape that brought in birds. The thought that went into inside and outside is truly amazing there was absolutely nothing we needed. Communication with Stasia was the best we ever experienced very friendly and accommodating and asked if we needed anything, that was great.This is definitely our go to place for a quick easy getaway for relaxation. So very thankful they opened their home to us."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed in this amazing space and loved it, so we decided to reserved this place for some of our friends who had recently gotten married for a surprise! She texted me this message about the Artdoorsy Uncommons!
We 100% plan on visiting the Artdoorsy Uncommons again for an anniversary or vacation!

Thank you for making their stay wonderful!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a lovely time at Shawn and Stasia’s place! We were greeted with zen music walking in, which was such a nice touch.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I don't even know where to begin. This place was everything we thought it was going to be and MORE! The hosts were so wonderful about everything. They send clear instructions, responded quickly, and had the place completely ready for us upon arrival. We stopped in Twin Falls on our road trip home to Denver. We were looking for a unique and fun stay on our trip and happened to find this spot! We got in later than anticipated, but let the host know when we were getting close. We found the parking location quickly and easily (right behind a mexican restaurant). The hosts had gotten the space completely ready for us! As you enter the gates, you are transported from the busy city into a magical cottage and forest like environment. Both the indoor and outdoor space were created with such beautiful detail. We admired all the creativity that the hosts had included! If you have the chance to stay here, BOOK IT NOW! You will not regret staying at this amazing BNB! Thank you Shawn and Stasia!"

Their attention to every little detail goes a long ways to making the retreat special for us. They remembered it was a return visit without us saying anything.
100% worth every penny and then some!"

I have stayed at many Air bnbs over the years, and this one is by far my favorite ❤️ the attention to detail, the decor, the cleanliness, and the thoughtfulness that Shawn and Stasia put into this place is astounding. I couldn’t recommend this place more.
Also we were very surprised by how cute the small city of Twin Falls was! Lots of good food and brewery options :)
I recommend Yellow Brick Cafe and Koto Brewing 🙌"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the most unique and magical stay I’ve ever experienced on air bnb. The pictures of this place just don’t do it justice. My partner and I walked in and literally were shocked!!! We came to twin to spend a couple days at miracle and this is where we stayed, even after a super great day at miracle I almost would have rather just stayed home at Shawn and stasias!! It’s super private! Super clean, super cute and they had a cute surprise game for us when we arrived but I don’t want to spoil it for everyone else. A fire pit, hot tub, bbq, hot plate to cook and everything you’d need for a little romantic getaway. We will be back for sure and I’m sure all of our friends will book too after I rave about it."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was an amazing stay! So glad we were able to experience it. Thank you for the wonderful home away from home.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is a beautiful and peaceful Oasis!

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is our second time staying here (the first time 2 years ago) and we were once again amazed by how beautiful and relaxing this place is! It's obvious Shawn and Stasia designed this place with the guests in mind because they really thought of everything you could need or want. We stayed at other unique Airbnbs and this is hands-down the cleanest, inviting, serene space inside and out that we have been to. We love the spa-like, homey feel of this place from the outside and inside including the well put together design. Do yourself a favor and book this place! If you're local, this is definitely an ultimate, romantic staycation! Thanks for having us back and helping us celebrate our wedding anniversary with inspiration, rest, and comfort close to home!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Shawn and Stasia’s magical oasis is a stay we will cherish forever. This property is beyond what you see and expect. Thoughtful surprises throughout and experiences that will create spectacular memories. Hot tub was sensational and so special to have the outdoor fire on while soaking. Outdoor speaker, fairy lights, A1 bbq and trees made us feel like in Bali. We felt recharged and so appreciative for our stay. Highly recommend to anyone looking for something special.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I can not say enough about this magical abode. If is available - book it! - you will not regret. I have stayed at some nice Airbnb‘s and this is by far the most thoughtful and intentional one I’ve been to… and my absolute favorite! Shawn and Stasia have created such a sweet and magical place. Upon arrival it is immediately obvious that their hearts and souls has been sewn into every detail. This peaceful sanctuary is truly a work of art.
I stayed here on my trip down from Montana to California in December, it’s 10 hours away for me and I have seriously considered driving the 20 hour round-trip just to experience the this place again."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"BOOK NOW- you won’t regret it!!!! What a thoughtful curated space and the outside very much reminded me of Shore Lodge. We spent one night here and are already planning when we can return. There is so much to say about the Monroe’s place but you have to experience it yourself, it is indeed an experience. Not only is the place lovely but the host were top notch making it one of the best airbnb spots. It’s truly an oasis!"

Kudos! Thanks creating a great place for people to stay."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re going to stay anywhere in the area this has to be your top pick! I’ve stayed in some really nice Air BnBs before but seriously this one is by far the absolute best. My husband wanted me to say that he wishes we could bring this place everywhere we go! It’s really your own private sanctuary with so many amenities, quiet, comfortable, beautiful, and even close to everything. We walked downtown, which is only about a mile away. Shawn and Stasia were also amazing hosts who checked in to make sure we had everything we needed and had it all set up to welcome us with wine, chocolates, and a nice fire."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I’ve used air BNB all over the world and this one takes the cake! The Backyard and interior decor were picturesque and peaceful. We hot tubbed in the morning under the leaves and read in the garden. Shawn and Stasia went above and beyond to create a peaceful retreat and to make us feel comfortable. I can’t say enough wonderful things about this place and the hosts. We will definitely be back!

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We love this retreat so much, we drive from Boise just to escape here! AMAZING!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This may have been one of the best Airbnb experiences we have ever had. The space is just as beautiful as described, perhaps even more so. The hosts go above and beyond to create the perfect balance of privacy and attentiveness. I’d highly recommend staying here if you get the chance!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Attention to every possible detail. Every other rental should take note of this Airbnb. I’m so tired of the average rental and lack of attention to the little things that count. I didn’t want to leave. Never relaxed and enjoyed a place so much. Thank you Shawn & Stasia. We were blown away.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was our second stay in less than a month and it was just as magical as the first. We highly recommend a stay here. It is by far our favorite. We will be sure to book it when we next go through town.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had such an amazing time celebrating our anniversary at the Artdoorsy UnCommons! You could tell that Shawn and Stasia put so much thought into every single detail, which made our stay even more enjoyable. All the extra touches were great. We will absolutely be back!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There are not enough ways to Thank Shawn and Stasia for giving life to such a special place. We felt the love as soon as we opened the door. Hands down the most well thought out and beautifully created, but it was more. If you want to be carried away to feel the peace this place offers definitely book a stay- one weekend wasn’t nearly enough. We will see you again real soon."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"MAGICAL is the best way I can describe this place. Not just five stars -- five twinkling stars, lol. Who puts that much care into every beautiful detail of a guest house? Shawn & Stasia, that's who. When you first walk into the yard, you go, ""Whoa! This is pretty."" Then, when you enter the guest house, you go, ""OMFG"". It's like walking into a warm, fudge brownie. We stayed two nights, and could have stayed much much longer, especially once we met these two people. The Twin Falls Chamber Of Commerce should feature this gem on their website. If it's available, grab it, now!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was the best Airbnb we had ever stayed in! absolutely outstanding with so many thoughtful touches. communication was great as well. I would drive hours out of my way to stay here again. I cannot recommend highly enough.
,,,"The area is a ghetto. We wondered if our car would be ok. The apt stinks like some one smoking cannabis. Old toothpaste in the sink and countertop. Microwave greasy and old food stuck on door and sides. I found a pin in the carpet with my foot. Carpet looks like it hasn't been cleaned in years. The photos of the shower is the outside or the inside wall. The floor is 1950 tile with 1950 mold, soap scum and other people's bodily fluids. It's disgusting. The bed was comfortable but I couldn't move without waking up the whole neighborhood. We had to walk by piles of trash and debris and dead plants to get to the door. We lost the TV remote in the couch and found someones dirty sock, and a used drink bottle. Why am I paying for a cleaning deposit when NO ONE cleans. Not sure I will be using Airbnb platform again."
,,,"My stay at Marty's was terrible. i communicated well in advance of my plans to come for Thanksgiving week and that my kids who lived in the area would stay a few of the 10 nights with me. Once I was there, she was very cold and unwelcoming to us and even said that she should not have booked anyone during Thanksgiving because her family ""doesn't like strangers around"". I did not feel comfortable to use the house and most of the time the living area was blocked off with a screen.
She even tried to request more money from me after I left for extra guests even though this was never mentioned in our communication when I asked if it would be okay for a couple of my kids to sleep over with me. I feel misled, lied to and taken advantage of."
