2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clark's bungalow is small, but has everything. We cooked some things and found all we needed to make our meals. We felt ""at home"" and very comfortable. This is a sweet little find."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’d recommend to stay here, Clark & Denise were very polite, communicative & attentive. Beautiful home, beautiful views & so many places to go in just a few minutes away."
2023-10-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"I thought it was ok. When we walked inside, it looked very clean and tidy. With further inspection, things were not as though they appeared. My entire backside was covered with pet hair when I sat down on one of the recliners. I was disgusted and couldn't believe the amount of hair that was on the chair. The toilet was not clean and the bathroom floors were dirty. Since this was someone's basement, I expected some noise from upstairs but not what sounded like stomping. Our stay was short and we were only there at night time. It was ok for the price but definitely needed to be cleaned properly."

2024-03-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here two nights. The area seemed to be clean and never encountered the owners while there. Netflix seemed to be the tv option.
Likes:
-Desk workspace
-Double sinks
-Kureg coffee maker with coffee
-Small refrigerator
-reasonable price
Dislikes:
-shower head is harsh
-extra bed in couch was bad
-noise from passing vehicles
- no vent fan in bath/shower
-turning hard to see small numbers to unlock a key to get in while its pouring raining not fun."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,really enjoy staying here each time it's been great. Host is great.
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The place was as described but there was a musty smell. I also wish that the key code to my entrance wasn't the same as the other room on the property because I accidently walked in on someone else! Meaning they could also gain access to my room too. Ugh. Probably will find soemthjng else because of the security risk to be honest.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"As usual, Maria’s place was impeccably, clean, and very welcoming.
It is a perfect spot, quiet, but right close to Dalton .
The weather got cold, and I slipped into wonderful warm flannel sheets.
She is so very thoughtful about taking care of her visitors.
Love this place. It’s perfect"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love it. We had a wonderful stay.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Would absolutely stay again! Thank you!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little place to stay. We have rented quite a few places from Air BnB but this was the first that was a shared place with an owner. We were a little apprehensive initially. But turned out great. Never even met the owners and only saw what I assume is the husband in the yard a couple times. Exactly what we wanted, privacy. Had a private drive and private bedroom\bathroom. We felt comfortable the entire time. Place was clean and great for a short stay or if your active and not really gonna be in the room a ton."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,had a wonderful stay once again. I appreciate how comfy and clean the space is. Looking forward to future stays here.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,She was so very helpful with the pullout couch situation! Everything worked out great!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,always enjoy my stay here. peaceful quiet area.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time we have stayed with Maria. Both times were great! It is a cozy, peaceful place just a short, easy drive outside of Dalton.
I highly recommend this place."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,2nd stay here just as delightful as the 1st stay.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, price and location for our trip!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,My stay was wonderful. Felt right at home really enjoyed the area. Hosts were great and very welcoming. Peaceful and comfortable place to stay.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The bed was a bit firm, but other then that, it was an outstanding stay. We had everything we needed and I have zero complaints about the location."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, quiet and affordable. I will definitely stay again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay! No complaints. Easy to find. Super clean!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I think the fact that I have now booked this same venue 7 times speaks for itself.
This space is pristine and quiet.
Maria is a very warm and responsive host and I absolutely love staying here.
It is a sanctuary after 12-14 hour long days, a beautiful retreat.
This is THE place for anyone needing or wanting to stay in Dalton, GA."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Simple and pleasant if you don't need a kitchen. Maria is very responsive and keeps a clean house!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a very comfortable place to stay. It was quiet and relaxing. We had everything we needed and it was very clean and inviting. Would definitely recommend this place if you are in the area.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Absolutely loved everything about Maria’s beautiful place. I would highly recommend if you want some R&R away from the city with a beautiful view will definitely be booking with Maria in the future. She was also an amazing host and offered any help she could! Would give more than five stars, if I could!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We enjoyed being at Maria De Lourdes's so much! There were so many trees in her yard. The road was very busy but it was hidden by the trees. We enjoyed having our meals on the patio and we enjoyed just sitting outside enjoying the beautiful yards. The apartment was clean and cool. The bed was so comfortable. It would have been nice to have a full-sized refrigerator, but for the price we paid, we have no complaints. Maria and her husband were very nice. They shared fresh figs from their fig tree in their yard. It was an enjoyable stay and we would love to stay there again some time."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is my sixth stay here. Maria is always responsive and lovely. Her place is perfectly clean and there is a wonderful porch with a nice view.
I will continue to come here-perfect."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Maria was a perfect host. Her descriptions prior to arriving were clear and helpful. Once I arrived, she immediately introduced herself, gave me some suggestions for using the space/locking doors/etc, and reassured me of my safety in and on the property.
The slace was clean and ideal. It was private and had a nice variety of furniture to allow for a good night's sleep, a relaxing sit on the couch, and some productive time at the desk.
I highly recommend and will book with Maria when I return to the area."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Maria is very kind. This place is more spacious in person. Everything was super clean and comfy. I forgot almost all of my toiletries, but Maria keeps the bathroom stocked so that was very helpful. The location is pretty close to Chatanooga which was awesome! I would definitely try and check in during day light since it is a little difficult to see the street once it is dark. I highly recommend staying here!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a last minute trip to the area and needed a place for myself and my teenage son to stay for a baseball tournament for the week. This property was perfect for the two of us. Close to the fields and very budget friendly. Would stay again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have lost rack of the number of times I have stayed at this lovely place. It has a nice private entrance with a comfortable porch and pretty view. The room is spotless (as is the bathroom).
Maria is also incredibly helpful and responsive and I will continue to come her.
Absolutely worth the stay!
LOVE IT!"
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Maria was very welcoming and greeted us in the Airbnb as we entered from her inside door. The place was as described. We left early due to my husband not feeling well, nothing to do with the Airbnb. Just a few things to note. The entry door only opens half way due to the sofa blocking it. Large people would have a difficult time entering. There were no available electrical sockets near the night stand to charge phones. Electrical sockets on one wall did not work. Found out later there must have been a a light switch somewhere that needed to be flipped. Switches by the front door most were taped down. The air conditioner works well but is extremely loud. There also is a lot of traffic noise. Walkway to the front door needs to leveled for easier entry. I don’t want this to be a bad review they were very nice people just wanted to be honest about the place."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It’s not fancy but a affordable and safe place to sleep. Basic amenities at a good price point.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is my fourth stay at Maria’s place. She is simply lovely and responsive within minutes if not sooner.
She has an extreme kindness.
The apartment is spotless and roomy and I love it.
Anyone who needs to stay in Dalton should stay here. I can’t say enough good things about her and the apartment."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"DEFINATELY arrive during daylight hours if this is your 1st visit to this property!!!
Repeat--arrive during the day.
I was a conference attendee all day and only needed a place to sleep. So I cannot comment on things to do at/near property. Nice patio to eat your takeout.
This suited my need perfectly."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful back garden
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a wonderful place to stay with Maria! The room was spotless and very neat! The backyard was absolutely beautiful and the room was fairly large. The bathroom has a gorgeous his and hers sink, if you come with your SO. The only take aways are the lighting for the driveway since it’s really dark out there on that road at night and the bed was a bit stiff. I would recommend a mattress topper to ensure more comfort for the guest in the future.
She also volunteered to wash my clothing for me which I also though was very sweet. Thank you for allowing me to stay at your place!"
2023-05-01,4,Stayed about a week,"I recommend this place only if you drive and plan renting a car as it’s fairly far from downtown and cabs are not easy to find.
The place is cozy and I’ve never been in an Airbnb with so many amenities. Everything we needed was there.
Maria was very kind and was fast on her responses.
The room has a nice terrace with a table and chairs and the view is nice.
Negative points:
- The bed is too stiff. Feels like sleeping on a brick.
- The sofa bed is not actually a sofa bed but a sofa with a pull out bed that is not big enough for an average adult. Would be comfy for kids or teenagers or small adults.
- The room is in a family house. The doors that connect to the house are locked but it doesn’t feel very private.
- Walking from the driveway to the terrace, the path is made of concrete blocks and you aren’t able to roll your suitcase.
Overall, it was a good experience for the price."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Maria is a wonderful host. The space was perfect for my needs. The private deck is very peaceful. The suite is private. There are lots of restaurants, things to do, and amenities within 15 minutes. Maria was available for any questions before and during my entire stay."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is my third stay in as many months so that should speak to the wonderful and clean venue.
Maria was ALWAYS responsive. The room was immaculate and comfortable and the residence is peaceful.
It is fifteen minutes from the place at which I was working as well as downtown Dalton.
The area is quiet and peaceful and the porch is lovely.
I will keep coming here ANYTIME I need to stay in Dalton.
Simply wonderful in every way.
Thanks Maria!
Mahsheed"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,The room was very clean with everything available that we could ever need. Very quiet and a short distance from the ball field that my daughter was playing at that weekend. Definitely cheaper than a hotel and cleaner as well.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Maria is super responsive and very nice.
This is my second stay and I have already booked a third.
Love it."
2023-04-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"Maria was a friendly hostess. We did not have trouble finding the location but it was a little further out than was convenient. We had difficulty getting our luggage from the car to the steps as it was very uneven to walk on. The steps going up to the porch were dangerous as roofing shingles had been laid on them and slid around when going up or down. Getting into the front door with luggage was cumbersome as a couch jutted out and kept door from opening completely. The room was pleasant and clean. Traffic noise was bothersome.
Our biggest complaint was the very hard mattress. All other problems were small and we could have dealt with them but the mattress was too hard therefore we didn’t get much sleep. We did not stay the second night."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Maria's place was clean and uncluttered. It was close to the venue where I am working and she was exceptionally responsive.
The place was exactly as she described and it was well worth the cost! (A very excellent bargain).
I have already reserved the room for an additional stay (actually, two separate stays-one end of April and one in May)."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very nice clean place. My seven year old granddaughter and I had a great time. We had tea parties with her stuffies, and got a kite in the air! I never felt like I was sharing a house. Very good set up. I will definitely be back."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent all! Very nice persons😊
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Over all my stay was fine and served its purpose. Maria was very sweet and was extremely accommodating by letting me check in early. Couple of things, the room is not as pictured. Everything is differet this was not a make a break for me but I would suggest updating the listing. My only issues were that check in was difficulty and towels. I couldn't find the door. The map was hard to understand. I would suggest a sign at the edge of your yard where we turn in and the bath towel I used had someone else's hair on it. Even with those two things I would still stay here again. I'd just bring my own towels."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,host is very cooperative and the Airbnb is one of the best Airbnb i have ever stayed in with all the facilities that are not even in a hotel! totally worth it
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and comfortable. We would stay here again. Thank you!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! Peaceful environment, hosts are very responsive and helpful. Will definitely rebook!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another great stay! Flexible check in, responsive to any requests ! Truly appreciate air bnbs like this one!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The sofa is different than what is pictured. It actually worked better for us because it pulled out into a sleeping space. Bed in the room is a full-size so a little cramped for 2 larger adults. Rest of pictures are accurate. Very quiet location.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Maria's Airbnb was very clean and cozy! It had everything we needed and more. Would definitely recommend.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice quiet space to relax.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet beautiful suite thats exactly as describe with plenty of space. A nice relaxing place for a quiet time with access to main areas to check out. A place call home. A Friendly, Courteous host on site but out of site.Love It."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Maria’s place was perfect, great value for money and not far from downtown Dalton. The space was spotless and welcoming and the shower was great, and there was tea and coffee, it was nice to wake up and have the big yard outside. All in all the place was great and would recommend it to anyone."
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very nice affordable option instead of overpaying at a hotel. Very quiet and comfortable place to sleep. Unfortunately I was unable to partake and the beautiful surrounding area. But would be a great launching spot for exploring.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Spacious room
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great Room! 10 minutes from Convention Center. Private.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Maria’s. The location is about 15-20 min from Dalton Convention Center & is in a very safe, rural area. The decor is lovely, and the water & coffee is much appreciated & convenient. Use the map provided upon checkin to know where to park; there is ample space for 2 cars. Her communication is excellent & we really appreciated her flexibility in our check in plans/time."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Clean, calm, quiet, beautiful, relaxing, homey, modern, a great value, wonderful......."

2022-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Great place, very clean and Maria was always there to help with every need"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Maria and Jaime are wonderful hosts! Communication with them was smooth and easy. The suite was “as described” and very clean. I checked in around 7pm and Jaime greeted me outside and guided me into my parking spot, assisted with my bags, and provided a quick tour of the suite and amenities for my stay. The bed was comfy and the mini-fridge was stocked with some bottles of water. The suite was perfect for my needs while in DaIton. It was easy to find, and I felt safe and secure the entire time. A gas station (with convenience store) and local pizza place were only moments away. Walmart and other stores and restaurants were about 10 minutes away. I highly recommend Maria and Jaime’s AirBnB — and thank them again for their hospitality!"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It's a lovely space, and good location for those traveling on 75 or staying in Dalton. Comfortable, clean, with great amenities. Maria was quick to respond and easily available for check-in. Great value!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,I could not have asked for a better place to stay! Maria is such a great host and is very thoughtful. The place is immaculate and is well stocked with anything you need! Will stay here again if I am back in Dalton! ❤️
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Maria’s space was sparkling clean, convenient to multiple places in Georgia and Tennessee, and very affordable if you are like me … traveling on a budget. I felt right at home. Even though the space is a part of their residence - I never saw them except when I checked in. You have a private entrance and the apartment space is closed off from their living space. Maria did check on me via email to see if I needed anything. The space was wonderful; comfy bed and sofa, great work space for my laptop, big screen tv, keurig coffee pot, small refrigerator and lots of closet space… and did I mention sparkling clean?! I hope to stay here again when I return to the area. You won’t be disappointed in booking with Maria!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This private room and bath is actually more like an Inlaw apartment, without a kitchen. You do get a microwave a Keurig color TV with cable and Wi-Fi. The bed is extremely comfortable. The pillows were fabulous! And the grounds are similar to a private park. I sat outside at the little table having my coffee in the morning just looking into the trees and enjoying mother nature. I doubt you’ll have any complaints! Great accommodation!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful price for a great stay! We had everything we needed! It was easy to come and go as we pleased. Very nice hosts! The bed was very firm so that took a little getting use to but for the great price of a clean room/bathroom ….it was a not a problem! We loved having the little refrigerator. My husband had to have a work video conference so it was nice to have the desk. The road was a little noisey at times but still fine for the price.
Overall, it was a great value!"

There was even a basket of flip flops, even though we didn't use them, I loved the idea. The wifi connection was great. She was a great communicator, responding quickly to any questions. The yard was well maintained and we walked in it to complete our daily step goal. We will definitely return if we are in the area."

Quiet home located off a two-lane highway near Dawnville, not far from Eton and some basic shopping/food choices. Very clean and comfortable accommodations. There is a little bit of road noise if you are sensitive to that. Love the porch and all the fun birdwatching from there or the windows. Well-stocked with ""extras"" in case you forgot something.

We had one question about the TV, and she quickly assisted us with that. We travel to Dalton at least once a year. Maria's place will be the FIRST place we check for availability. She's a lovely hostess and we hope to stay in her place again."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in Dalton, GA for a slow pitch softball tournament at the Heritage Point Regional Park. The airbnb was 10 minutes from the park which made it easy to go back and forth to our stay. We absolutely loved Marie. She was very helpful and quick to respond. The studio apartment was very well kept and had every thing we needed and more. We highly recommended and hope to stay here again soon :)"

2019-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had a excellent experience at Maria's home. I was in the area for a show at the Dalton Convention Center and her home was about 15 minutes away. So it was very convenient. The home is located in a nice private area and has a well kept yard and exterior. The room was spacious and had all the things I needed, including a private entrance, desk, TV, couch and a comfy double bed. The private bath is just a few steps outside the bedroom in the hall. It is nicely tiled with a double sink vanity, toilet, shower and fluffy towels. I highly recommend Maria's home if you are in the area and I would definitely stay at her home again."

2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very convenient location and made for a nice place to stay while visiting family.
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Hosts responded almost immediately if we needed them. The place was very clean and decorated very nice. The sofa/daybed in the living area was not very comfortable for us but that is because my husband is recovering from knee surgery and I am awaiting hip surgery. The bed in the bedroom was very comfortable. The parking was a little challenging as we were in our big truck and not a lot of room for turning around and too steep to back out. We would have driven a different vehicle if we had known that. Only other issue is the ceiling fan in the bedroom did not work and we are used to sleeping with a ceiling fan but we made do. The kitchen was well equipped and they left plenty of bath towels. Very pleasant to deal with. I would stay again.

2023-12-01,4,Stayed about a week,"The only reason for the overall 4 Star Review is the driveway and a couple small things. But, this is a cute clean place and located near stores and shopping for convivence. Our kids live in Tunnel Hill GA, about 10 min from the AIRBNB which was so very close.
We came out for Christmas and enjoyed the place very much. The bed is very very comfortable which is our #1 priority due to back issues. There were very nice touches like coffee pods, tea, honey, sweeteners, creamers and everything you would need to cook. The bathroom is stocked and the washer & dryer was super helpful. Everything worked great!
We had a little bit of a hard time finding it because I did not get the exact instructions until 10:30PM while we were driving from the ATL airport, so that communication could have come sooner. We ran out of toilet paper the second day, but they brought us some within 30 min.
I recommend this place for a couple it's small but very cute and felt homey."

There's so much to look at and take in while you're here, the attention to detail in this home just blew my mind. Me and my partner stayed here as a surprise for his birthday and it was just truly such a wonderful experience. I cannot be more appreciative towards the host for the work put into this home and offering it as a place for others to stay and enjoy.
Also extremely grateful for helpful, quick responses. Jeff recommended two amazing restaurants in the area and we had both. Everything about this stay was just lovely."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a treat! My friend and I met at Jeff’s Hobitt house to celebrate our 50th birthdays, and it didn’t disappoint. It’s a lovely, peaceful place. We would visit again!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"My friends and I had a blast at the Hobbit Hole. Never would I have thought that I would visit the shire in Dalton, GA. Great deal if you want to stay somewhere cool outside Chattanooga. I wish I could include a picture."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Home under the Hills was magical, as expected. My daughter said she had the best sleep ever there. so many fun details - daughters loved the ""food"" the best. Every other regular aspect of the stay was smooth and well thought out as well. We hope to come back and stay in one of the other properties in the future!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The details in this little hobbit house are amazing! We had such a fun visit. Hosts are responsive and friendly. What a fun little house 😍

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thank you, Jeff!
Our stay was easily the most fan-tastic rental property experience we have ever had. The accommodations and attention to detail were better than advertised.
We made a detour to spend the night here. If you are captivated by the photos, then we recommend you detour as well."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We felt like we left our normal world and transformed into a different one. It was awesome.
I read a review that mentioned bringing your own hair dryer, so I did. There is now one in the house so no need for that. I would bring hangers for the clothes closet, if you are like me and cannot relax without unpacking and finding a place for everything. Other than that, it is a perfect getaway. Honestly, once you are there, you don't want to leave!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Must stay for LOTR fans. A cozy (hobbit hole) cottage coupled with LOTR inspired design and decor. Responsive host who is great both in communicating and in making sure guests feel welcome and appreciated.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a really fun time in this fanciful home
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is by far one of the best places I have ever rented. It was exactly as described, clean, and Jeff was a fantastic host. It literally took you into a Hobbit's home - cozy, warm, and peaceful. It is any LOTR fan's dream rental - but also perfect for anyone looking for a relaxing environment. The details were perfect. Even the towels, sheets, shower head, and kitchen supplies were more than what we were expecting for a rental. It was well worth the price and we are already wondering when we can return and who we can recommend it to.
(Jeff also let us tour one of his other properties with a similar theme and we will definitely be book it in the future.)"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,If you’re a fan of LOTR then this house is for you! They really committed to the decorations and the whole experience. 5 out of 5 would recommend to anyone.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great overall stay, cool theme. My kids loved the hobbit theme. Easy to reach host. Would stay again if in Dalton."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! Very well done!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had an amazing stay! The pictures do not do this place justice, especially if you are a Lord of the Rings fan. So many amazing little details to this place and it's decor. We had everything we needed, although you would need to bring a hair dryer. That's not a negative, it's just informational. Location is secluded but really close to the main area with restaurants, grocery stores, and gas stations and just a 31 minute drive to Chattanooga. Jeff was very communicative and check-in and check out was a breeze. We look forward to another stay in the hobbit hole or one of the other amazing properties Jeff has."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jeff’s Home Under the Hill was a wonderful location! The home was super thoughtful and decorated very well. Little hidden gems, and there is a second bedroom, look for it! 🤣 the ultimate hobbit hideaway home just right for hobbits 😂 Warm, inviting, comfortable, cozy, perfect. Parking for the house is right next to it so don’t wander up into the lands of Rohan (larger home above the hobbits) definitely will stay again. Thank you so much Jeff."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an absolutely wonderful time in this magical place. Went well beyond what we expected. Very happy. Thank you Jeff!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"the place was better than our expectations for the details that related to LOTR theme. it was very cozy and easy to stay there and comfort Even though of the very creative Hobbit theme. The amount of detail and creativity that went into it was well worth staying there. It's about 2 hours north of Atlanta and about 30 minutes south of chattanooga, worth leaving big city to check it out ."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Truly magical.
This place is so much better than the photos could even capture. Felt so cozy and warm. Has so much character. Even if you don’t know what Lord of the rings is this place is the perfect little mountain home. I didn’t want to leave!!!
I would highly recommend to anyone who is even considering it. Go!!! Goo!!! This is an experience i will talk about forever! & definitely coming back!! Thank you to Jeff for sharing this wonderful place with us, you are an artist!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our kids loves the Hobbit style home having seen all the movies. Their favorite thing was the hidden room. They were disappointed that The One Ring wasn't there, but we told them it had been destroyed in the fires of Mount Doom and they were good with that."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow.
All I can say is, wow. This is single-handedly the most incredible bnb experience I've had so far. Jeff is always a fantastic host, and he is so friendly and accommodating beyond what I would consider hospitality. The location itself is breathtaking. The photos do not do this place justice. Whether you're a fan of high fantasy or just want a warm weekend away from home, look no further. This is the place to go. From the cozy atmosphere, natural woodwork, homey, grandma's home feeling, to the fantasy inspired, mystic wonder the home bestows... This property is truly a location for everyone.
If you book this property, expect a warm welcome from a great host, a relaxing and unique stay, and a few secrets as well.
Enjoy, I certainly did."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing place with a great host! Loved being close to everything we needed.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Loom Room Retreat is Dalton’s hidden gem! We were absolutely shocked at how amazing it was because the listing really didn’t even scratch the surface of it!! The unit itself it top quality, spacious; comfortable, beautiful- everything you could hope for. The atrium right outside your door turns it into a place fit for Nashville, Austin, Daytona- you would NEVER expect this place to be in Dalton GA. Our one night stop on the way through turned into 3 nights just because we loved it so much. We ate every meal in the atrium- the prices are fantastic, the food is fresh and delicious, the atmosphere is so peaceful and beautiful! I can’t wait to come back!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful place, convenient location."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was an amazing pit stop on our cross country road trip! I wish we could have arrived earlier and stayed longer. After 10 hours on the road it was a dream to arrive at this clean, modern, chic, spot with every amenity. The beds are so comfortable and clean. Everything is new and spotless and modern. There is even a noise machine by the bed. I took a picture of every area of the space, it is so classy and cool. We didn't realize when we arrived that you can literally walk through a door to restaurant/music/huge space! We discovered this the next morning and had the best breakfast, huge playground for the kids outside with a climbing wall etc. This put Dalton on the map for us!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay here!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Peter's place. The beds were comfortable and it was conveniently located (store, food, etc)."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love the unique atmosphere & Peter was very easy to work with. We stayed here for my daughter’s softball tournament & couldn’t have picked a better location. Within 15 mins to each complex in Dalton. We will definitely stay again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a unique and fun place to stay! SUPER CLEAN, very convenient and had all the amenities we needed. It was nice that it was connected to the Mill because we got in late and were just in time for a great Italian meal at Donatelli’s! We were staying for a softball tournament for my daughter and the beds were VERY COMFORTABLE! Thank you for such a great stay!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time and really enjoyed the surrounding area. The market type atmosphere was perfect and had great food and drink options! Highly recommended to anyone!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Peter saved the day for me! I had another Airbnb (not hosted by Peter) reserved for several months. When I showed up on the day of check-in, I found out that the home had actually been sold to a new owner, not the person who had listed the house on Airbnb. Needless to say, I was left without a place to stay. Peter's place was the only one available in the area as it was a busy weekend (there was a large race happening in Dalton), and he went above and beyond to get me checked-in on SUPER short notice. He was highly responsive and even pulled over while driving so he could send me check-in instructions before the scheduled time when he heard of my predicament. This made a huge difference in my ability to get to the race the next day and was GREATLY appreciated. Highly recommend!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a spectacular property, full of interesting history, innovative use of space, and luxurious touches (nothing short of heavenly bedding and linens) ! So happy to have found this spot, we'll be back!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were in town for daughter’s softball tournament and it was a great place to stay. Newly renovated with everything we needed. It was a neat place to stay with restaurants in the property that we attended between events. It was better than staying at a hotel. We plan to come again next time. A touch of history in every space but comfortable modern conveniences.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed staying here! I loved the historic touches throughout the building! It was conveniently located to nearby dining and shopping. We’d certainly love to stay here again in the future!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the most charming, quaint little place to stay. It was perfect for me & my cocker spaniel for the week. Very well appointed, super quiet neighborhood, and close enough to shopping if you needed it. Christy was very responsive with all my questions and concerns about coming in late for check-in. This is a perfect place for an overnight stay or as in my case for a week. Definitely recommend to anyone coming to Dalton."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lovely little house, convenient to everything in Dalton. Christy responds to questions very quickly. I plan to stay here again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This tiny house has tons of character! It's not one of those modern trailers with a tiny house built on it. This is a tiny house built on a very old foundation that I'm sure could tell some stories.
Christy was great in all her communications and had local recommendations in a binder for us.
The neighborhood is calm and quiet. The lot is large and the grounds were well maintained.
The kitchen was stocked, 2 TVs in the place, games, a work desk.
You could live here and be just a couple of minutes from almost anything you might need.
You have a great opportunity if the dates you need are available, better book it now :-)"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The place was so cute pulling up to this “cottage.” Christy was very helpful and quick answering any questions. We would stay at one of her places again.

2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This house was what we needed and then some! Beautiful color plan and lay out, pictures are accurate. Easy check in!
Only complaints would be the bed room stays very hot along with the rest of the house and the water pressure in the shower was so light we had to take showers elsewhere after the first night. All around a good small home to stay in for a few nights and would return if we had another ball tournament there."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Room was lovely and will return soon !!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Definitely the best experience I have ever had with a host! It was perfect for a weekend getaway. She even did a Valentines Day theme. We will be visiting again if we are back in town.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow! Five-star accommodations. Need I say more? The cottage is a tranquil place that provides everything a traveler needs and more. The hosts (Christy and Matt) are very hospitable and flexible. They kindly accepted our impromptu booking and were flexible with our need for a 4 a.m. arrival time with same-day evening departure. They went the extra-mile in providing excellent hospitality, as they had the porch light and some house lights on for us when we arrived, as well as had bought some white bath towels for us given that we have allergies to the colored-dye bath towels they had for their guests. We slept like a baby in the extremely comfortable bed with wondeful linens, which was also due in part to the fact that they allow their guests to control the thermostat in the cottage! And, we also enjoyed being able to do our laundry on the premises while we looked at all of the literature they provided for the local area including eateries we had not heard of before as former Daltonians."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,The cottage makes me wish I needed an extended stay in Dalton. Very nicely laid out. Has everything you need. Christy was very responsive and had good suggestions for food. Nice and warm on a chilly night. Definitely would recommend.

2022-11-01,4,Stayed one night,Very beautiful and cozy home. I felt right at home the host even left snacks which was very thoughtful. The home was decorated for Christmas which lead me and my partner to buy gingerbread houses to decorate. I will say it got very very cold especially in the morning. I realized it’s because the AC had been turned off in the night and wasn’t set to start again until 6pm that day but that’s bad on my part. Other than that it was a nice stay. Would’ve definitely visit again.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect and cozy for our overnight stay. We enjoyed watching a movie by the light of the cute Christmas tree. Everything was clean and in order!

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Christy's place is exactly as pictured. Nice and cozy, and it is a good space for a couple or three friends as the coach that I fell asleep on one night was just as comfortable as the bed. The street has private homes, so it is very quiet during the day and at night. You will also be very close to everything you need, supermarkets, and restaurants, and it is less than 10 minutes from the Dalton Convention center. And Christy was very quick with responding to questions. If you are in the Dalton area, you will definitely appreciate this home away from home."

Not only is the location safe and central to everything but the house itself is super cozy and has everything you will need for a stay away from home. We previously stayed at a hotel and this time decided to stay at this Airbnb and it was the best decision we could have made and changed my whole outlook on the city of Dalton. The bed was luxurious and so comfortable with the softest sheets, the kitchen was fully stocked with everything you might need, the added touches of a washer/dryer/detergent, shampoo/conditioner/body wash and the book about Dalton and things to do was just the topping on the cake.

The bathrooms were extremely spacious and clean! There was even a pool table and work out room, which were nice additions.
We made such wonderful memories there during our short stay, as we were in town for my graduation. My mom, dad, and sister came over for dinner one evening and we played pool and ate in the beautiful dining room. There was more than enough space for us to comfortably enjoy ourselves.
The neighborhood was nice, quiet, peaceful, and close to all stores or restaurants. However the location of the home was in such a place that noises from traffic or people could not be heard. We felt so safe and at home!
I could go on and on about how much accommodating Althea was and how comfortable and beautiful her home was.
I would definitely recommend this home to anyone! We were beyond pleased with our stay there! ☺️"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house is much larger than I thought it would be. It is in a great neighborhood. The bed was comfortable and there was plenty of room to spread out so we weren't on top of each other. The only con (and it isn't really much of one) was that one of our group was on the phone in a heated discussion, not yelling, but definitely louder than normal, and the neighbor came outside and looked over at her. We didn't feel we could enjoy the backyard or fire pit due to feeling like we were being watched. I would definitely stay here again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house is beautiful tucked in a very nice neighborhood.
Althea is very helpful host, responds quickly to messages.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful location, great, private and quiet space with plenty of amenities. Rachael was quite friendly.
As well described, the approach road and drive are twisty with elevation changes, and probably handy to scope out in the daylight if possible.

Thanks so much for a great stay."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The cottage was adorable, she provided amazing plush linens, snack, new toothbrush and toothpaste **if needed.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed my stay here. it was exactly what I need for my work trip. I wouldn't recommend this as a place if you are looking to spend a lot of time in your air bnb because it's exactly as described ""a tiny cottage"" but it's perfect for a place to rest at the end of the night. Rachel is very responsive and the air bnb was very clean."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Everything was as described in the listing - cute little clean and private place with all the amenities I needed. The only small detail I didn't expect was that the noise from the highway was audible enough that I needed some white noise for sleeping. Rachel responded right away with some choices, and the fan did drown out the noise. This probably won't bother most people - I've been told before that I'm really sensitive to noise!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Rachel's place was a perfect half-way stop when heading home to visit with family. Bed was super-comfy and smelled lovely. Starbucks was only a mile away for our early morning ""fuel-up"" when hitting the road!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This ""tiny home"" was the perfect place. It was immaculate and cozy with a comfortable bed and absolutely spotless bathroom.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The house was immaculate and had absolutely everything we could need. They went above and beyond with thoughtful amenities and the superhero decor was awesome! If I'm honest, it looked kind of remote/sketchy from the Google streetview image, but it was a lovely, peaceful, private area!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"House was so fun! It was a little hard to see the address numbers on the street (and Google maps didn’t take us exactly to the address), but the little bat signal at the end of the driveway gave it away :) My kids loved the house and can’t wait to stay there again. Lots of little touches like bandaids, hair elastics, extra toiletries, etc, added convenience to our stay. Host was very responsive to questions before and during the stay. 10/10 recommend and would stay here again."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for a cornhole tournament at the Dalton Convention Center. My husband's birthday was the same weekend and he and our son are big Marvel fans. They absolutely LOVED the house!! It was so fun, I just wish we could have been at the house more to enjoy the peacefulness of the outdoors around us. I bet it that side deck is great for coffee in the morning when the trees are fully bloomed! Jeff is literally the best host also! If there is another tournament in Dalton, we will most definitely book with Jeff again! He has several really cool houses to rent!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Home is new with cute details. Driveway is steep and parking is difficult at least for us since we drove two large trucks.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jeff’s place was awesome. Kiddos loved it and said it felt like home. Kitchen was equipped with just enough to get me by. I was beyond thankful for stocked showers, we forgot to bring stuff. The only complaint was hubby, the driveway was steep and on the narrow side (he drove the truck this trip). We are flat land beach bums, so hills felt funny to drive on. Overall, great for the price, good location, beautiful season."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here on a long roadtrip and only saw the location during the dark but the house was great inside! Out two boys also loved the superhero theme and we got a request to stay here again.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We were looking for a nice place to stay for the night that was close to the interstate and we're blown away by Jeff's place.

2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"great place , was so impressed with the place I will definitely go again"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything we needed, appreciate the attention to all the details!!! Safe, clean and beautiful view!!!"
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"This place is easily the coolest place we have ever stayed. We have stayed in a castle and this place blows even that out of the water.
The souvenirs that are available for purchase was such a cool touch too! We love LOTR and the attention detail is absolutely incredible!!! We will definitely be coming back to stay here again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a fun place and definitely the most unique Airbnb I’ve stayed at! Every room is filled with interesting things to look at. Note to families: busy toddlers may find the memorabilia too tempting but my kids (10, 7, 5) absolutely loved it. Jeff went ABOVE AND BEYOND as our host and we truly enjoyed the whole experience."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is like walking into a museum. Host was awesome. Will definitely come back again
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,This is our second time staying at one of Jeff’s places and it was once again great. This house is SO cool. We were not prepared for how much attention to detail was put into the space.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was awesome!!! Whether you’re a LOTR fan or not, you’ll love it! The kids loved the scavenger hunt and all the decor. The beds were comfortable and the bathrooms were clean."
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"Incredible and memorable, we will be back"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow! What an amazing rental property! Our group had the absolute best time and Jeff was so very friendly and accommodating. We can't wait to return and explore his other rental properties. If you're a LOTR fan, you will absolutely love this property!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely Incredible. I was only able to stay one night and it just wasn’t enough. As a fan, the attention to detail and craftsmanship was so impressive I couldn’t stop gasping in awe. It felt like an experience we won from a sweepstakes. Highly recommend! Will absolutely be staying here again!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"We are speechless. Jeff has created a magical experience for LOTR lovers but the comfort and convenience of this place is perfect as well. Even grandma, who had never seen the movies or read the books, loved it, even though she ended up sharing her room with Shelob. The kids spent our stay watching the director’s cut dressed like Gandalf and Eowyn, eating second breakfast in the Prancing Pony, catching lizards outside by the dark tower and the gates to Rohan. Beds were super comfy, and the double queen bunk was perfect for my daughters to share a room. The details in this place are incredible. The welcome letter with scavenger hunt and One Ring kept us busy and the joy of finding all of the little details lasted all three days. Getting to and from Chattanooga was easy and we explored the local civil war history as well. There was a nice spot to hike just a few minutes from the house as well. Jeff gave us a peek at his newest project so we will be back to stay there too!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"This little ""cottage style"" home was perfect for our overnight stay in the Louisville area. I am sure it is a busy little area when it is Kentucky Derby time, but it was quiet while we were there.
Keep in mind, this home is older but if you like a homey cottage feel, it is perfect. Jeff supplied everything we needed and it was nicely decorated to reflect the derby ambiance of the area.
We will definitely use this space again for our visits!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a wonderful place to stay! Jeff is a great host as well and super responsive. We can’t wait to stay here again!
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,It was like you jumped into the lotr movie and staying the night there. Truly unbelievable. Felt like I was at Disney world.
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Amazing spot for all LOTR fans! Even fun for those aren’t fans. The detail is amazing! Will stay again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"You're not just getting a place to stay - you're getting an entire experience! We felt like we signed up for Airbnb, but instead got Disney. Wow, that may have been one of the best lodging experiences we've ever had!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our family LOVED staying at the Horse Lords. We were sad to leave and wished we had made our stay even longer. It was so relaxing and we felt we were in another magical world. The amount of detail and work that Jeff had put into the place was evident we are definitely recommending the stay to friends and family. As everyone else has said, pictures don’t do it justice. We were in awe!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This visit was a surprise for my husband who is a HUGE LOTR Fan! This place was an absolute AMAZING experience! The level of intentionality was extraordinary and we loved every minute of it! Jeff created an interactive experience that constantly kept us exploring. We had so much fun and Jeff even made it fun for our young children!
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,The attention to detail to include little things in each room was great! Very thoughtful host with amazing response time! We had the best girls weekend playing games watching movies and being able to enjoy the space and company.
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Awesome place to stay, easy check in and check out. Would stay here again for sure."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wish we'd booked 3 nights, to watch the whole trilogy here! Amazing LOTR themed house with mind blowing details abounding. Not to mention all the necessary amenities and cozy as can be. We hope to return."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,As advertised
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"We really enjoyed our stay! Beautiful, clean, and very unique!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This group of Lord of the Rings fans loved the place! The photos help capture the beauty and detailed attention to creating a Middle Earth experience, but there is nothing like being here! There are so many interesting artifacts to look at, that staying one night is not really enough to enjoy it all. The entrance is inviting to ""speak friend and enter"", and the wood carvings and decor throughout is spectacular. The swords, helmets, lighted torches, and welcoming touches are fabulous. The host leaves lembas shortbread to give you a boost of energy, and the ""Inn of the Prancing Pony"" decor is a happy reminder of the nostalgia. There are even cosplay outfits if you wanted to dress up and take photos, though we did not have time. There is a nice TV to watch the Lord of the Rings and other things on, but we did not have a chance. The grounds are also great with Dark Knight sculptures and the Tower of Sauron nearby. Jeff is a responsive host, and made the experience personalized. Loved!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Unforgettable experience!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a wonderful get away. It was true experance to say here loved it.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were absolutely blown away by the level of detail. There were so many little touches that I appreciated as a Lord of the Rings fan, and it really shows how much Jeff loves and respects the material. My family and I loved every part of our weekend stay - for being close to town it still felt like you were in a remote retreat. Jeff is also a great host and was very responsive and helpful. We are already planning our next stay!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,My kids and I absolutely loved it! We were excited to buy the souvenirs before leaving.
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"If you are fans of the Lord of the Rings this place is more than worth the stay, its so fun, so beautiful, and so clean. If you aren't fans, its definitely still worth it. This place is extremely creatively made and decorated and I hope I get to stay here again at some point!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,The pictures do not do this place justice! Best airbnb we ever stayed in! The attention to detail was amazing!!! Super Clean and comfortable!!! Highly recommend!!!
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,T'was an eventful adventure to Middle Earth! The scavenger hunt was a nice touch. Decor was spot on! Lantern hallway was the coolest! Staying in this residence was an event in itself.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Must stay for any LOTR fan! This place is middle earth on earth. The details were amazing. Very comfy and quiet. I can’t wait to go again and I’m very excited for Rivendell once It’s finished. Do yourself a favor and stay there. You won’t regret it!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"as a huge fan of LOTR def recommend, his collection is awesome and can't wait to come back when he finishes rivendell"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"EVERYTHING about this home is INCREDIBLE. Look no further for a truly charming experience. So much love was put into every detail -- I don't want to spoil any of the surprises but there are MANY!!! The space was perfect for our family of four (2 adults and 2 teenagers) with a roomy living room for re-watching all the LOTR and Hobbit movies, very comfy beds, and all the thoughtful touches made our stay so memorable. Jeff and his wife were very warm and I can't say enough wonderful things about this home. Don't pass on this one!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are a LOTR fan, then you must stay here to experience what Jeff has put together. There are tons of LOTR memorabilia along with an environment that speaks of someone who loves LOTR and who wants others to have a fun and enjoyable experience. Loved this place and will plan to stay there again in the future."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Superb place. Pictures do not do justice to the house. Attention to detail and artful creativity is out of the world... right from entry to every corner of the property. It seems Jeff is doing it just for his passion. We were a family of seven and had a comfortable stay. I would rather call it experience.. you feel like you got a private museum... just for you.
Jeff is down to earth, friendly person. He personally ensured we are comfortable, we met, and had a great conversation. He is flexible and very responsive. House makes you feel you are in the movie.
Its a 5-star rating, just because review the system doesn't allow more. Apart from the LOTR theme, I would anyway give it a 5-star rating just for its beautiful surroundings, amenities, and comfort."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We've stayed in a lot of Airbnbs in a lot of places, and this was my hands down my favorite! The themed decor is unbelievably well done, and the small details - like toiletries in the bathrooms - are very thoughtful and appreciated"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,The photos don’t do this justice. If you are a LOTR fan then you will be amazed! So many hidden details and a beautiful location.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jeff was a fantastic, responsive host… His place is unbelievable! If you are a Lord of the Rings fan, this is the place for you.. it’s a little slice of Middle Earth in Dalton, Georgia..
It is exactly as depicted in the pictures, but the pictures absolutely do not do it justice… The attention to details in making this a true Lord of the Rings experience is exquisite..
Anytime I’m traveling near Dalton. This will be my first choice… Highly recommended!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,It was evident that Jeff put a lot of effort into each tiny detail! The scavenger hunt and souvenirs were an added touch that went above and beyond! I absolutely cannot wait to come back and spend more time since we only made it through the first movie :) thank you so much for an awesome experience.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,The House of Rohan was beautifully decorated and made each one of my family members feel as if we were in The Lord of the Rings story. It was an adventure that we enjoyed taking! Breathtaking and detailed beyond expectations!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is absolutely magical. My family and I found ourselves immersed into what felt like a Lord of the Rings version of Disney Land. The details in the structure of the home and the decorations are fantastic. The pictures don’t do it justice. We were so comfortable and had so much fun looking around and watching the kids’ eyes light up as they explored. The beds, linens, and towels are high quality. Fixtures and such are all high quality. Beautiful lighting and fun touches around every corner. You will have an amazing time in this place, guaranteed. Thank you Jeff for having us! We hope to come back again sometime!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Being a Ringsgeek Superfan, when this ultra-impressive AirBNB was shared with me in an online group in January, my first thought was “no way!!!” WAY. After scanning the photos for a few milliseconds - though the pictures don’t ever do reality justice by a mile - I just knew that this was where I needed to be for my 50th birthday.
In my stay, I kept discovering new elements that had escaped me, and that’s precisely what i mean by an epiphany around every corner. You stumble upon something which instantly propels you into some scene of the movie, some narrative from the book, some cherished part of the running storyline that you hold dear.
A surprise lies in each room as you continue to make these discoveries and it makes your stay that much more enjoyable. This AirBNB is a genuine tour-de-force and very well could be the nicest place I’ve ever stayed. I’m not just saying that. I even slept with a balrog, and you can’t say that about every vacation home, now can you?"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband thought the world of this stay. I myself dont care 1 flip about LOTR but I love this place. It was lodging and an attraction in one. So much to see that you really need more than a one night stay. Jeff got us in last minute. Provided a game and a gift. And if one was inclined.... had all the movies saved for the Ultimate Movie Experience. My favorite part was the bathroom ducks as the LOTR characters. But its the little things really. 3 big bedrooms, full working kitchen, 2 bathrooms. Lots to see and lastly laying on the bear skin and looking up at the ceiling to see Middle Earth. Host was awesome, fast response and communication from booking to checkout and a few messages after; I liked that a lot. Great Stay, cant wait to do that again. Thanks for an incredible stay."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"A great theme location. I generally regard pictures of the location with a grain of salt, the pictures of this Lord of the Rings location did not disappoint. We loved the Director's Cut of the Trilogy and had fun referencing the map of Middle Earth with the laser pointer on the great room ceiling. The decor that included the named swords and helmets as well as items place throughout the house was fun to discover."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing place!! So many fun details - we made “discoveries” of new LOTR things the whole stay! Whole family - even 2 teens -loved it!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jeff went above and beyond. There is so much attention to detail. The pictures really don't do it justice. If you are the slightest LOTR fan, you will truly enjoy your stay."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was so much fun!! I loved all the attention to detail, every single room is full of so much Lord the Rings lore and it's honestly impressive. It's also very cozy, well stocked with anything you may need, and quiet. Couldn't ask for a better place to stay!"
2023-04-01,4,Group trip,The spot is amazing! the pictures don't do it justice and the attention to detail is awesome!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was awestruck by the detailed LOTR theme from even before we opened the door. We kept discovering cool details up until the time we checked out. I don't know of anything that could have made the trip any better. Still smiling. We spent 2 nights & are talking about coming back sometime. Anyone who's into fantasy, especially LOTR, most especially Rohan, I would highly recommend this place."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This isn't just a stay, it's an experience. Pictures don't do justice to the place. The attention to detail is breathtaking. The place is welcoming and comfortable. Jeff was responsive. This is an absolute must book and the best airbnb we've stayed in hands down. All I can do is applaud Jeff and what he has created."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Just book it! You won’t regret this unique experience if you are a Tolkien fan. More comfort and quality than expected. We constantly found ourselves finding new things and wondering how they accomplished some of the details. New custom construction, very nice linens/mattresses. If you are lucky, you’ll have a chance to meet the friendly host."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I recently stayed in an Airbnb and I have to say, it was an incredible experience. The location was absolutely stunning, with breathtaking views of the surrounding scenery. The house itself was immaculately clean and had every amenity we could possibly need.
But what really made the stay unforgettable was the Lord of the Rings decor and memorabilia throughout the home. As a huge fan of the franchise, I was blown away by the attention to detail and the sheer amount of items on display. It was like stepping into Middle Earth itself!
I would highly recommend this location to anyone who is a Lord of the Rings fan or anyone looking for a unique and memorable stay. The hosts were incredibly accommodating and went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable. We will definitely be returning in the future!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a cool place to stay! We wished we had more time but we really enjoyed our time in Jeff's property. You couldn't find a kinder host - we will be back!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Lord of the Rings theme was so well done. But in addition to that, the house was in a beautiful setting and had every amenity a traveler might need. Really exceptional stay!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very enjoyable place to stay! Clean, comfortable, and really immerses you into the Lord of the Rings."
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"Fabulous place, very creative, great experience!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,After a very long traveling day was great to come upon Georgia’s version of the Last Homely House. A unique experience that had our kids raving; residence was as described and very comfortable. Appreciate Jeff setting out the lamp as it was easy to miss in the dark!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"my husband is a big lord of the rings fan. so when I seen this place I knew I had to take him to spend a night, and it was so much more then I expected, since I'm not a big fan of the show, but I absolutely loved it. so much detail in every room. it's an amazing place for sure"
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"Everything was wonderful, amazing, awesome... Except for one thing. The steps to the front porch. The first step was easy for a gimp like me but the second step was a bit of a struggle to get up. I had to use my cane and pull myself up it. It was too high."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely amazing home. So much attention detail, we kept finding new things even on the third day. If you are a fan of Lord of the Rings, this a must visit location."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Rohan was a great place to visit and stay the night. Such a neat home, meticulously thought out and designed. Our family totally enjoyed it! Jeff was a great host. We would totally recommend for any LOTR fan!"
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"A MUST for any Tolkien fan! The moment you step foot onto the beautifully ornate porch, you are transported into both an impressively immersive and yet lovingly crafted experience that can't help but evoke that childlike wonder and delight that many fans recall when first watching the movies. Jeff's passion for both Middle Earth and his guests is evident down to the smallest detail, and there is everything you could hope for in an accommodation (the towels are so soft!). Tolkien himself would be proud. I absolutely recommend this as your stay on your next Unexpected Journey."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place plus the host were absolutely phenomenal. The house has so much love poured into it. Whether your a LOTR fan or not you'll be amazed at the attention to detail. Jeff is such a great guy and his sweet wife. The house is only a few minutes away from grocery stores, restaurants, and gas stations. It's also only a 30 to 35 min drive to Chattanooga, TN where you'll find Ruby Falls/ Rock City and many other things to do. I can't accurately describe how wonderful the house is. Pictures do not do it justice! It felt so cozy, clean, and most importantly felt like home to my husband and I. Do yourself a favor and check this place out, you will not be disappointed. I can't wait for our next trip! Thank you Jeff for being so great!"
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"I have never seen Lord of the Rings, and this was still AWESOME! It was so thought out and clean. I could just walk around and look at the details all night. Very thoughtful notes and snacks. It looks even better in person than in the pictures. Whether you’re a fan of Lord of the Rings or not, I highly recommend this place!"
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"Awesome place
And
Location"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was truly AMAZING!! Not only was it VERY clean and comfortable, it was also so beautiful and unique! The attention to detail was incredible, the decor was phenomenal! I don’t have enough words to describe how fantastic this place is! From the map on the ceiling to the gorgeous chandeliers to the swords and pictures and maps and quotes everywhere! Plus there were exquisite items to admire in the display cases plus plastic swords and even period clothes to dress up in! Everywhere you looked there was something to amaze you! One of my favorite touches was the silverware! I won’t give it away but do make sure to check it out when you visit Rohan. 🙂 I could go on and on about how magnificent this place was, our expectations were high and the reality of Rohan surpassed them! Jeff, thank you for sharing this place with us and others, it is clearly a labor of love! We will be back!!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home has to be on any LOTR fans list. Amazing home, that had my entire family immersed in Lord of the Rings. This has all my kids excited from 14 to 4. The home was immaculate and beautiful. Very clean and beyond met Expectations. We will be adding this stop on our trip every year."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Pictures don’t do this place enough justice. So much detail and thought went into every aspect of this home and it shows. If you’re a fan of LOTR, you have to stay here. The home is extremely clean, has everything you need and more, very cozy, and perfect for a movie marathon."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"My significant other and I absolutely loved the place! We booked it for Valentine's Day/Night and had a lovely time. So much stuff to look at, and we had a blast with the scavenger hunt. The pictures do not even compare to how wonderfully done the decor and memorabilia are around the place. So much fun stuff in every little corner! Fantastic immersive experience while watching the movies. Highly recommend for lovers of this franchise!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was everything we could have imagined and more. A true work of passion from a fan. My husband is the Lord of the Rings fan and he was blown away by the attention to detail. I enjoyed the true craftsmanship throughout the house. From the driveway entrance, the walls, sinks, and bar, the moment you pull into the driveway it's like being transformed into the movies. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and definitely plan to visit again soon."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you are reading this review, just book this place! Jeff thought of literally everything and in every corner you will find details and adventure. I like Lord of The Rings but this place is so cool even if you don’t! It’s like being in a castle/hobbit house complete with serene surroundings. The thought that went into this place is amazing! We role played, we made steak and eggs and we lived like a King & Queen! The sinks are wood and the craftsmanship is outstanding! Jeff is very responsive also. We will be back! One ring to rule them all and this is it! Just go! There are costumes in the closet to use to get into character. Go live your fantasy!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jeff's place is simply amazing. the attention to detail, the atmosphere and just the way he went the extra mile to make sure the experience was immersive and memorable. I Wether you are a fan of the franchise or not, this is a rare gem that needs to be visited! Absolutely loved every minute, highly recommend!!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Want to feel like you’re in Middle-earth or New Zealand this is the place to be. What a joy, you won’t be disappointed!"
2024-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"The place was nice, would stay again but there were alot of trains and sirens at late hours."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed the stay, great location."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very friendly host. Thanks Jeff.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Host responds promptly. Cute place
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Great stay ! Will be back again
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,👍
2024-02-01,4,Group trip,Great place for our trip to Dalton! Host was very responsive and helpful. The location was close to all the softball parks we were competing at. the place was clean and as described.
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"Great place, just as described."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute place! No issues.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and a safe place to stay.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was well located near the main streets, very clean everything, the sheets were clean, which sometimes in other rental houses do not change them. Or an important detail. They had disposable glasses and plates, thank you for that. The only drawback was that the main entrance was for the back part and not for the garage and it was raining and coming with children. I didn't understand because if there was access to the garage, you could not enter there. It's the only detail I'd suggest changing, then everything is fine"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"As always, we enjoy Jeff's available Airbnb's"
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Only issue was that my elderly parents had to walk up the side of the house at night as we didn’t realize we could bring them in through the garage until after we were already in. We were only there one night and it was comfortable and Jeff was very responsive.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to rest
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to rest after work
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was a very nice and quiet area. House was very comfy and felt like home. Host exceeded our expectations and was nicely stocked with all necessities. I highly recommend that anyone visiting Dalton is looking for a home away from home. This is the place.
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Other than the loud trains blasting their horns all morning, not allowing us to sleep. It’s a nice and clean home.
Only complaint is the train station blasting their horns starting at like 3 am I believe every 45 min."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had a wonderful stay at this Airbnb and truly appreciate the experience. The accommodations were fantastic, and the host was extremely welcoming. Thank you for a great stay!"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Great place! Jeff was super helpful and descriptive of solutions (back door). Location was very central to the Dalton area, as well. We’ll be back each year as long as the Georgia Jewel is still going on!"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Very good place
2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,Jeff had a great place in an awesome location. Thanks Jeff
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,great host and very understanding
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"everything was as indicated. The only bad thing is the noise from the train, I didn't think it was so bad but if it's a little annoying since it's heard at any time of day. But in general it's a good place. I'll definitely be back"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Jeff place is just as described! Excellent location , easy check in. Host is very responsive and helpful! Thank you Jeff for letting us stay at your place we appreciate you having us."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It's very clean.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was clean. For a last minute trip, we found everything that was needed at the place. We will definitely stay there again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was as described, very clean and stocked if we needed anything. Odd thing was no door to the bathroom in bedroom. Only other issue (nothing to do with Jeff) was the constant sound of train horns throughout the night. Otherwise was very enjoyable."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Jeff’s place is as described and pictured. Clean with comfortable beds. Location was convenient for our needs, however, I do feel as though the location leaves a lot to be desired. Seemingly very low income area and not an area I would considered walking around in for any reason. My husband stayed with our daughter so that was not an issue for him. Train is loud and comes by very frequently. Other reviews state the availability of sound machines to help drown out the noise but our party did not use. I think they just dealt with the noise. I think this place is fine for some people, but because my daughters and I travel alone at times I can’t say we would return based on location."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jeff is a great communicator & host. He provided thorough instructions for how to enter the property upon arrival. There is a fairly good size fenced backyard. As soon as we entered, it was comfortable. There were ample amounts of cookware, toiletries, etc. He really did think of everything renters may need during their stay. There were 7 of us staying in the home. One person did utilize the sofa bed. The mattress for it was very thin & you could feel the springs. They ended up just sleeping on the sofa the 2nd night. The beds were comfortable. You could even smell the laundry detergent & cleanness on them. The entire house was pristine with cleanliness. Check in & check out was a breeze. Our favorite part was the garage we were able to park in during our stay! I would say the least favorite part was the train! It ran & held its horn every hour. Even with the sound machines & ear plugs, you can't miss that noise. Besides the train, it was a nice stay for the $$$."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I’ve stayed here three times and have loved it every time! We will be back for sure 😊

2023-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,Great place and great home! Jeff responded back quickly to all questions and concerns! Does mention the train that’s close by but it was noisier than we expected. A train will come through once every hour which is rough when you have 2 toddlers trying to sleep.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jeff was an understanding and outgoing person I would definitely definitely try to stay there again if I'm ever in Dalton that place stays booked so if you want to book it don't hesitate because it will go fast I appreciate everything he did for us while we were here in Dalton and would definitely stay in the Airbnb again it was a beautiful open place has a garage so your car is safe and he's a very outgoing understanding person thank you Jeff for everything

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Jeff went above and beyond to make my stay great.
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"Great place and great host! We stayed for a tournament and this was a great spot. Clean, comfortable, and we felt right at home. I read some reviews on the nearby trains but it wasn’t noisy or a distraction by any means. We barely heard them. Jeff was super quick to respond and very helpful. We hope to stay here for every tournament we play."
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,Awesome place to stay. Jeff was easy to get in contact with. We’ll definitely stay again when needed.
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,Jeff was amazing!! He allowed us to check in early!! Great place and location. We were in town for a softball tournament and it was about 4 miles from the park. Very clean and a nice setup. There is noise from the train but Jeff has sound machines to block out the noise. We will be back!! Thanks Jeff!!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Every extra that you could need is here. Coffee, condiments, toiletries, laundry. If you forgot something, it will be here."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great house and great stay. Jeff is a super host and was extremely helpful and accommodating. There is train noise with the house but Jeff does a great job providing white noise machines.
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"This was a great place for our family of 7 to stay! Super comfy beds too! We didn’t need to cook, but it has a very well-equipped kitchen! We appreciated being able to make a cup of coffee for the road in the AM! The place was clean. We also loved being able to park in the garage - wonderful for a rainy night. It was a quiet area, there was a train nearby, but sound machines are provided, and the trains were not an issue for us at all! We also found a great pizza place - Cherokee - very yummy, and reasonably priced! Overall, great place to stay!"
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,This home was amazing! I definitely recommend. It was just like the pictures and very well kept. I will definitely be back again.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"We just couldn’t endure Miami to Indiana, so we found Jeff’s very convenient place to break up the trip. Jeff responded in moments anytime I had a question. He allowed late check in. I can’t give much help on the area as we arrived late and left early and did not explore it. It’s certainly convenient to the interstate and we paid less than a hotel room and got double the space. We did hear the train and wondered if it would keep us awake. Either it doesn’t run from around midnight to 6:30 am or I was just too tired to hear it. I tried to be a good guest but broke one of the very short list of check out rules. We left expensive medication in the fridge. Then we quickly learned my sons girlfriend was missing her fanny pack. Jeff’s housekeeper made an extra trip and found it beside the couch and Jeff spent his time to properly next day the items to us. I would definitely keep this place in mind if we have a long road trip or any business in the area again."
2022-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,"we used this place as a overnight stop for our family in the way to Florida
place was clean and very accommodating
Jeff was very helpful to our questions
only thing you want to remember is that being in town there is quite a bit of noise"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our kids loved searching for tiny doors. We loved access to the garage. It made unloading in the rain a breeze!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was very clean, the beds were comfy, and the Keurig was a nice bonus! The bedroom with the two queen beds worked out well for my daughter and her kids, while Grandma and Grampa had the king bedroom."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, I felt right at home. The home is even more beautiful than the pictures. Very clean and welcoming."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. Jeff recommended Cherokee pizza and brewery for dinner and it was great (maybe 5 minutes away from the Airbnb). You do hear the train at night but noise machines were provided which helped tremendously. Loved having a garage to park in with enough space to fit a Lincoln navigator. Will look to stay here again if ever in the area.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything was spotless and just as described. We would definitely stay here again if in the area. Thank you!

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This property exceeded all my expectations. Jeff's property is immaculate. It's really nice and clean. It was the small touches for me that made me feel right at home. I was able to have my coffee every morning which was perfect. The only downside to the place was the train passing close but honestly it wasn't too bad. Jeff supplies noise machines in the bedrooms along with ear plugs if needed. The location was also perfect. We was literally 2 mins from the gym where my son's basketball team played at which was excellent. If we are ever in Dalton again, we will definitely stay at Jeff's property."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place conveniently located near restaurants and grocery stores.
2022-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,Great space and very clean. Perfect for trip from Chicago to Florida.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great visit to Dalton in this space! The furnishings and beds are super comfy, the carpet and flooring felt brand new, and they added several personal touches to make the stay complete. (First aid kit, q-tips, plenty of toiletries, and also colorful ponytail elastics!) It’s close to the train tracks so our first night was noisy but when I asked Jeff if he had a white noise machine, he actually went out and bought TWO that same day & hand delivered them to us. Now THAT is customer service! We had everything we needed and more, even down to a personalized welcome note as we entered the home. He’s certainly earned his title of SUPERHOST!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was great. I stayed for a couple of days and it felt like home. I messaged Jeff the night I got in after midnight about where an iron may be and by 8:30am, he had dropped a brand new one off on the back porch for me. He answered all questions that I had before and during my stay. It was great. If I am around this side of town again, I definitely would love to stay there again. Thank you so much for an amazing place!"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This location is exactly as it is pictured. It is super-clean, and everything in it as as nice and new as it appears in the photos, from the furniture, to the appliances, to the flooring, to the paint -- it's impeccable. Even better than this is the level of consideration that the owners have put into the ""extras"". The unit included items such as tin foil, zip locks, basic cooking seasonings, snack bag clips, and new bathroom amenities (such as soap, toothbrushes, etc), in case you forgot yours. Things you wouldn't expect, but that sure were nice to have, if needed. Oh, and the softest bath linens EVER! Even the furniture was comfortable. :) The location was very convenient to tons of restaurants, fast food, grocery stores, the interstate, etc, and the communication from the owner was great. I'd gladly stay again, if in the area."

Very quiet neighborhood, the beds were all extremely comfortable, and the house was exactly what we were looking for. The gps took us right to the house with zero complications. The kitchen had plenty of room to cook breakfast every morning, we enjoyed sitting on the deck in the evenings, and again the beds (I slept in the main bedroom) I slept the best I have in a while!! We will definitely return to the area and book this house again!! 10 stars!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at Tony's place! My family and I came on a trip with my sister in law and her family. We were 9 people in total and 3 of us had to sleep in the living room. I would say the listing is more for families with small children since there are only 3 beds. The only thing we would say needs improvement are the doors since they were hard to open. Other than that, our stay was great and we are very appreciative of Tony for accommodating us."

The host Tony bent over backwards to help us out! We were traveling with grand children and when we arrived there were snacks that were based on all three of their ages, and dark chocolate cookies they just happen to be my husbands favorite!

It was an easy decision to rent this house as it was in our local area and accepted dogs. When we arrived, we were happy to find the house extremely well stocked.

2023-07-01,2,Stayed with a pet,"This was a dirty house. I wiped up the kitchen floor and my cloth was black. Refrigerator not wiped out. Cob webs greeted us at the front door. Large (3” by 3”) spill of powder blush in bedroom. Door wall lock broken. No screens on windows so could not air out the house.
The garage was dirty and we had to walk thru it. Front entrance had no handrail and was dangerously steep with non conforming stairs. No hair dryer found. Jeff notified and he offered nothing. There was hair and dead bugs on the entry way and living room floor.
I have photos I want to share.
We should have our $ refunded."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jeff's ""Beach House"" was a great place place to stay and lived up to the description/pictures in the listing. Large house with plenty of space for everyone to enjoy.

Would definitely stay there again."

2023-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here on our way to Florida. Excellent communication with Jeff. Check in and out was easy. The house was cute and as pictured. What we loved: Big full kitchen, available laundry, 2 1/2 bath, able to park in the garage, lots of nice touches throughout, like soap, shampoo, a toothbrush if you forgot yours and other little amenities that were very thoughtful. The kitchen was stocked with all the basics. It was a quiet location not too far off of I75. There was also tons of closet space and hangers available to use.
Things that could use some improvement: the floors were not real clean, some towels were dusty, there was no window coverings in 2 bedrooms and the beds while very comfortable, were quite high.
Overall, I would recommend staying at this house. I would say it is not ideal for small children due to high beds, stairs and there were knives on the refrigerator. None of those were an issue for us but if you have very little children, those might not work for you."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Awesome location and super cute house, felt super safe in the neighborhood. Great host, would stay here again."

We would recommend this home for anyone looking for the same.

2022-12-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Nice area, house was a little dusty.. bathrooms could’ve been cleaner. Worst part was the garage door was super loose and doesn’t close the right way. Handle probably just has to be replaced. Also, being pregnant, having small children… the EXTREMELY HIGH beds was totally unbearable. Hard mattresses and thin pillows definitely weren’t great either. Host was very nice. House could be more “kid friendly” knives sticking to the fridge wasn’t a great look. Other than that, served it’s purpose."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My family had a very comfortable stay! We needed somewhere on very short notice and Jeff made things ready for us quickly. The house had All of the extras on hand from extra toiletries to coffee and to-go cups, blankets, books and more.

Hosts could not have been more accommodating and kind! Definitely recommend!"
