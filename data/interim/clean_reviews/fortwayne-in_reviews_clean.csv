2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"we were passing through and this place caught my eye. super cute, responsive hosts, easy to find house, I'm direction impaired so I parked on the street. my bed was super comfortable, I slept really well. worth trying! would stay again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I‚Äôve stayed here a few times and it has always been a pleasant stay especially with little ones. The location is great and has a coffee shop across the street. We went to the children‚Äôs zoo and the Tin Caps baseball field all close drivable distances. The botanical conservatory has a great butterfly exhibit that is great for families for the summer I believe. Thank you Micaiah and Anna!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a really nice remodel of an older home. It is very well-stocked with appliances, especially a work-horse washer & dryer. It is located on a kinda-busy street just outside of downtown that has some noise, but then again, the ability to walk to downtown is quite nice. The coffee shop across the street is charming and clutch.
The HVAC is loud when the AC is on, but it‚Äôs a constant hum not a disruptive sound. Given that we had a 6-month old who was often napping, this built in ‚Äúwhite noise‚Äù actually was quite advantageous to us üòä
The place had a couple spiders we had to smoosh, but nothing out of the ordinary, and the place was otherwise extremely clean. Water pressure in the shower and hot water were both superb.
Also, bonus points for the neighbors on both sides being really, really hospitable. They were often on their porches and were nice and friendly to chat with. They even told us about a fun festival that was going on downtown. We went and really enjoyed ourselves!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"They have a great little place just outside of downtown. There‚Äôs a coffee shop across the street. You‚Äôre right near the river so it‚Äôs great if you want to go for a run. Lastly, the beds were super comfortable."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The only place to stay in Fort Wayne! Both rentals are perfect. The upstairs is even better than the downstairs.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were in town for a concert, house was perfect for two couples for the night. Close to venue. Very comfortable stay."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a great experience staying here. Very clean and cozy.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,As described. Very cute. Easy access to get in. In historic/downtown area (there are some homeless in this area a few blocks away as you are driving around) (felt safe in the apartment location). My only recommendations are: you could tell they washed the sheets - they were a little damp on the bed and very strong smelling from the detergent or softener and I have a lot of allergies so it was a lot for me. Maybe a suitcase rack? in the bedroom would be cool - I hate leaning on the floor or sitting my suitcase on the bed. I liked that you didn't have to do any cleanup :)
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent place to stay. Easy to talk to downtown Fort Wayne to explore. Everything was very clean and fresh!

2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very clean place to stay and beds were comfortable. Off street parking was great as well as extra parking in the front. House decor was updated and nice. They provided complimentary amenities that made our trip much easier! My only small complaint is the shower head could be updated as it didn't have options to easily rinse my hair and provide tvs in the bedrooms. Will definitely stay again if we are in the area!

2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"The place was pretty as described but noisy and dusty from construction work which I did not expect to disturb my peaceful getaway. Construction started before 7am. A heads up before the booking would have been nice but worse yet after enduring this dirt dust and noise, and paying about over 150 for the night, they tried to charge me an extra 50 for leaving at 11:37 instead of 11am!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The space was a perfect retreat for our ‚Äústaycation.‚Äù It was adorable and cozy, and the location was perfect: tucked in a friendly neighborhood just steps from a great coffee shop and the greenway, and it was close enough to all the downtown attractions that we could walk everywhere we wanted to go.

* Good budget accommodations, especially for families because the place is large and roomy and has a full-size washer and dryer.
* Nice, well-equipped kitchen with a few bottles of spices and some olive oil.
* Free off-street parking.
* Quick and easy walking distance into the heart of town and the art museum.
The cons:
* The place was not clean, especially the bathtub, shower curtain liner, microwave, and the decorative throws. Also, the windows were particularly dirty.
* The front of the house sits roughly 10 feet from a major road, so there was a lot of traffic and a lot of traffic noise.
* No cleaning products are left for guests."

I'm serious when I say the place was spotless and the updated style fit for our short home away from home getaway. Location was perfect for us, we got coffee at the cute coffee shop right across the street and walked into downtown. Off-street parking was a major plus. Instructions were easy to follow and made it seamless for us to get in and relax. My boyfriend said he particularly enjoyed the nice hot shower which is always sort of hard to find when traveling. Having such a nice place to stay honestly made our trip even more enjoyable and I highly recommend. 100% staying here again next time I come to the area."

No detail was left unattended . Dean/Nancy were very quick to respond any message or request I had. Checkin was great! Very easy and we were fortunate to meet Nancy. She was very accommodating and conveyed her availability with any other request or need during our stay.
Take the time to read the Tiny Shed history!!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Tiny Shed is the best kept secret in Fort Wayne, IN. We are local and had our families Christmas pics taken here a few years ago, before the Tiny Shed was remodeled. We fell in love with the property then, but the renovations have really made this place super special. It‚Äôs perfect for a quick romantic getaway, that‚Äôs what we did‚Ä¶ celebrated our wedding anniversary there. It‚Äôs so serene, cozy and comfortable. The bed is a Tuft & Needle mattress, like we have at home, and is so incredibly comfortable, as were the linens. I think it makes a world of difference when hosts pay attention to these details. We read the guest journal there and a lot of people came alone to decompress, connect with God, be creative or to just find solace in nature. You will find all of those at the Tiny Shed. Do NOT hesitate booking a visit, you will not regret your stay. The hosts have everything you need, are very friendly and attentive. We cannot wait to stay again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Tiny Shed was a great getaway for my husband, our two pups, and myself to get away for the solar eclipse this year.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My friend and I were in town apartment hunting and this was the PERFECT place to come home to. From the moment you step in the door you can tell how much thought, care, and love has been poured into this home. From the book of recommendations, to the Polaroid guestbook, and homemade chocolate chip cookies everything was perfect. There was even both dairy and non dairy creamer supplied in the fridge to go along with the local coffee. We decided when we have people come visit, we‚Äôll just send them the link to this tiny house and not have to host! lol. Everything was perfect and we will 100% be returning or bringing friends and loved ones here!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The pictures don‚Äôt do this place justice! It truly was the most peaceful place to unplug and get away from it all.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was really neat that they provide a camera to take photos to put into a book and you can read all the experiences left behind. The bathtub was really cool with soap shampoo and conditioner provided. The stuff from Trader Joe‚Äôs was cool as I‚Äôve never been there to shop so to use stuff from there was neat. The windows to view the woods when you‚Äôre in bed in really cool and beautiful! We didn‚Äôt get a chance to start a fire but sure it would‚Äôve been wonderful. Overall a great time!

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Book here! You won‚Äôt regret it. There‚Äôs a reason so many people have chosen this listing. It is nestled outside Ft.

My kids and I enjoyed our stay. From the beautiful views of nature to the beautiful small touches in the home. We arrived with a warm welcome with our name on the board and fresh baked cookies, which was very thoughtful and cute. This place was an amazing experience. My kids and I have always watched the Tiny House TV show, and to be able to have experienced one so cozy and clean made it even more enjoyable! Thanks again for being great hosts. I'd definitely recommend this place!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Tiny Shed, along with Dean & Nancy, is the pinnacle of Airbnb. The space is beautiful, perfectly arranged, and super cozy. Dean and Nancy are great and thought of EVERYTHING. Right down to the mini container of Tums that my wife ended up needing badly. The antique windows are huge and make you feel like you‚Äôre sleeping in the actual woods directly behind the Shed. We hadn‚Äôt even left before we started looking at when we could visit The Tiny Shed again. We cannot wait."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I needed a place to stay overnight with our pup, and Dean & Nancy‚Äôs place was the perfect place to rest and relax!

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing and quiet love the soft bed and cozy inside of the tiny shed
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at the tiny shed!!! It was cozy, peaceful and so beautifully decorated for Christmas! The pictures are exactly true and we were more than impressed. I gasped when we pulled up!! It was so cute and honestly bigger than I imagined. My husband is 6'3 and he fit just fine! The 2 things I was a bit nervous about ended up not being a big deal at all - The bathroom being outside/detached and no curtains/blinds on the bedroom windows. The bathroom is just 5 steps away from of the tiny shed. Even at night, it felt secluded! If you are disabled, or have difficulties doing steps, keep in mind that there are a few leading up to the bathroom door. I brought my cane with a led light attached and that really helped me!! And then for the bedroom.. when it was dark out and we turned off the lights, I ended up not feeling scared about not having curtains/blinds. The tiny shed really does feel private and away from everyone, so it eased any prior nerves. We will be back!!!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a fantastic night, staying in the tiny shed. What a quiet and calm place to relax, sit by the fire, and enjoy each others company. I had wanted to see what this place was like for a long time and I‚Äôm glad I finally got the chance. Definitely worth a visit!"
2023-11-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"The tiny shed is surely a pretty little place to stay in! I could see that the owners had put in lots of attention into little details, and the place is pretty. However, it was much smaller than expected, or than it looked in the photos. Lastly, the bathroom was clean and pretty, but the water smelt not good."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,My pup and I enjoyed our cozy short stay at the Tiny shed. I let them know I'd have a late arrival and they made sure the lights were on for me as we arrived. I always love a personal welcome and truly dog friendly stays with special doggie touches (they had both!) Waking up to the trees and the sun bouncing off of them through the big windows was warm and lovely. Would recommend anyone stopping in the area to book here!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely LOVED my stay at The Tiny Shed!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cozy stay, my husband and I had a wonderful stay. The property was well kept. The inside was so clean and neat."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second trip to The Tiny Shed, and it probably won‚Äôt be our last! It‚Äôs only 15 min away from our home, but it feels hours away from home in the way it takes us away from the stress of daily life and provides rest and restoration to our soul."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you‚Äôre looking for a little private get away, perfect place at the perfect price. The Hosts were fantastic and even helped welcome a Birthday! 10/10!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We stayed for our 12th anniversary and had a lovely time. The place was perfect. It was a warm and welcoming place with so many little details.

When we pulled in, we were overwhelmed with how sweet everything looked and were so excited to spend time there! We enjoyed all of natural lighting and touches that Dean and Nancy added in the space. We also loved that the Tiny Shed was a short drive to downtown and other areas we visited. We truly felt away and close at the same time! We look forward hopefully visiting again one day!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely wonderful place to stay! Peaceful, beautiful, and although it‚Äôs next to a country road it feels secluded in the forest when you‚Äôre in the bedroom looking out the large windows. Dean and Nancy left homemade pumpkin bread for us and stocked the home with essentials in case we forgot (toothbrushes, toothpaste, pain meds, etc).
There are books and board games available to use as well as a mini fridge stocked with coffee creamer.
The bathroom has baseboard heating and a space heater, so even if it‚Äôs cold out you can make the room warm enough to comfortably take a bath.
We didn‚Äôt get a chance to use the fire pit, but Dean and Nancy provided everything you would need to use it if you wanted.
Overall such a cute place, it‚Äôs clear Dean and Nancy do this out of a heart for loving and being hospitable to others.
Looking forward to coming back in the future! ‚ò∫Ô∏è"

The private firepit area was perfect and we used it both nights of our stay. We also LOVED the bikes parked out front for our use....these hosts go above and beyond!
We HIGHLY recommend this place and will definitely be visiting again."

Such a cute and cozy place as well!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I rarely write AirBnB reviews because I would feel bad to give less than 5 stars, but most AirBnBs I‚Äôve stayed in fall squarely into the ‚Äú3 to 4 star category.‚Äù But not The Tiny Shed! My first thought when I walked in was ‚Äúoh man, I need to book another trip to come back here.‚Äù The windows are as beautiful as they look in the pictures. I‚Äôve never seen such attention to detail from AirBnB hosts, and I loved how the tiny shed was packed with meaningful stories and inspirational decor. If you‚Äôve been considering booking a stay I highly recommend it!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything was clean and tidy! The sugar cookies were yummy and I liked that there was a small fire pit area set up! Only thing is for someone who didn‚Äôt grow up around well water the mineral smell was too much for me and I couldn‚Äôt enjoy the tub like I had hoped - not their fault, just a personal thing, but otherwise was a great little place for a 1-night stay!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was perfected for a relaxing quiet weekend.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Tiny Shed is exactly as described and the photos are accurate. We plan on staying again and are telling our friends about our beautiful stay.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Tiny Shed was so cute! We will definitely be back!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"10/10!!! We had the BEST time! We went to dinner then came back and used the bikes provided to take a long bike ride. Then we had a fire and sat outside - it was so peaceful, relaxing and really just perfect. The bed was super comfy! We never wanted to leave. Thank you!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Simply amazing! I cannot wait to come back!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Dean and Nancy‚Äôs tiny shed was an excellent way to get out of the city for a few days. Very clean, well decorated and had all the essentials you could possibly ask for. Plus they left homemade cookies and dog treats. Tucker (my husky) absolutely loved all of the dog friendly accommodations. Thank you both for your amazing hospitality!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The tiny shed was charming and just what I needed for a night. The location was easy to find and the hosts were communicative and understanding when I needed to change my stay dates around.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"PERFECT and super charming!! I loved The Tiny Shed! Ft. Wayne was a nice surprise with all the new upscale shops, restaurants and parks. Great street art and the Ft. Wayne art museum is a must. Their blown glass gallery is fantastic! Brought my ORU kayaks and paddles down the St. Mary River also. 2 days is perfect to explore Ft. Wayne. The Tiny Shed is amazing and every detail is thought out to perfection. Great communication with owners and they have left nothing out. LOVED LOVED LOVED IT. üëçüòä‚ù£Ô∏è"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dean and Nancy‚Äôs Tiny Shed felt like a home away from home. They customized a beautiful little shed into a cozy oasis. This gorgeous space felt comfortable and private, but it was only 10 minutes from fun and diverse restaurants. It was the perfect little vacation home for a few days for my family. I would love to stay again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,By far the best Air BnB I have ever been to. We were welcome with homemade sugar cookies that were to DIE for! Everything was perfect. I have no reason to come back to Fort Wayne but hopefully I can make one just to stay here!!!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I can't recommend the Tiny Shed enough! Dean & Nancy paid such attention to every little detail. Everything was comfortable, clean, and cozy. Can't wait to come back."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely place! Would highly recommend!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved it and will definitely be back!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay at the Tiny shed was everything I hoped it would be. Such a unique venue with the most intimate and thoughtful furnishings. From the moment you step inside you feel a heightened sense of calm and relaxation. The surroundings are beautiful. Nancy and Dean really go the extra mile to make sure your stay is perfect. The cozy bed, comfortable furnishings, inspiration detail and breathtaking windows to view nature are perfect.
Although the venue shares the property with the owners, the space provided is very private. We brought our own bikes to spend time on the local bike trails, however, bikes are also provided for guests to use.
Nancy and Dean were very responsive to all of my questions prior to arriving as we were coming from three hours away. It was nice to have someone scope out some local interests for us and provide that input prior to arrival.
My only regret is that I couldn‚Äôt stay longer or live here!
If you want to experience Glamping, this is the venue for you!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Wish we had more time to enjoy the peace and serenity at this tiny cabin. Dean and Nancy thought of everything with all the small details. A very welcoming space. Do note the bathroom is separate from the house and check in /out is later (4pm) / earlier (10am) than most bnbs.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The stay was fantastic. Everything was clean, and we were constantly surprised just how thoughtful Dean and Nancy were by including just about everything someone could need and then some. They have such a special little space for relaxation. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and would love to come back again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My two dogs and I loved the tiny shed! It was exactly like the photos - super cozy and peaceful. I went out to explore some of Fort Wayne, but in the end I loved being at the tiny shed the most. Nancy and Dean thought of everything, especially for the pups - dog treats, dog linens to keep the sofa and bed clean, water bowls, and paw wipes for cleaning paws when coming back inside.
The coffee was great, and water bottles were provided in the fridge. The bathroom was very clean. The other rental property is right next to the tiny shed, and there were other people with a dog there, but there was enough space for everyone, and the garage acts as a nice barrier between the two for privacy.
I will definitely recommend to friends, and would love to come back again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful stay with our dogs in the tiny shed. Dean and Nancy were wonderful hosts!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I didn't want to leave! The photos don't do the shed justice, it is so charming and the bed was very comfortable and there's nothing better than waking up with a forest outside the window. I enjoyed a hot epsom salt bath (its only 4 tiny steps away!) And loved watching the fireflies in the evening and being greeted by blue butterflies the next morning. Fun, beautiful experience ""glamping"" on a farm."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely adorable! I love finding unique places to stay and this was just that!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"From the personalized welcome note to the binder with instructions and recommendations, everything was just perfect.

I will definitely look forward to more stays at the Tiny Shed."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little shed was amazing! Nancy + Dean did not miss a detail. They had literally everything you could need. They had things I didn't think I'd need. I have stayed in several Air b n b homes and this was the first I have ever stayed in that had women's hygiene products availablein the bathroom, easy to access and different options. I am very impressed with this little shed. The Local support, the donation wall, and the story of how the tiny shed came to be was so fun to look at. The little guest book with the Polaroids was beyond amazing and I loved reading everyone's stories and where they came from. I would recommend this place over and over again. I rented it for a photoshoot weekend for my business but my husband and I doubled the weekend as a staycation. loved everything about it!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would like to say that this stay was worth every penny paid. Dean & Nancy laid everything out from the instructions to where to park, it was plain and clear that I never felt I had to reach out for anything extra. The listing was so accurate that I could not believe that I got exactly what was in the pictures. I came alone and felt safe and that‚Äôs very important to me. I came looking to get away and get refreshed and found a tiny shed that will forever be etched in my heart. The details that went into making this shed what it was so thoughtful that I couldn‚Äôt help but sit in silence and look in awe. Beyond blessed and grateful for places like this. I hope to be back in the near future."

2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful and peaceful space for a much-needed getaway. Waking up to the birds singing and the sunshine glittering on the leaves outside the floor to ceiling windows‚Ä¶ so restorative and soul-filling. Thank you, Nancy & Dean for creating such a welcoming and bright space for those in need of rest."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was easily one of my favorite trips so far! As soon as I left the tiny shed I was ready to go back. I will definitely be back sometime soon! Such a beautiful and peaceful place.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Tiny Shed has been a place that has been very special to both me and my fianc√©. We have spent birthdays and special occasions there for many years now. It was only right for Dean & Nancy‚Äôs property to serve as the backdrop for our engagement. Dean & Nancy were nothing but accommodating leading up to the day that I planned to propose and ensured that The Tiny Shed, The Country Bungalow, and adjacent property was in beautiful condition. This spot can not be recommended enough and I can not recommend Dean & Nancy more as hosts."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Tiny Shed is a little slice of heaven. It was such a peaceful, gorgeous space that instantly makes you feel relaxed and at home.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Tiny Shed was such a wonderful stay. It was quite magical to wake up to the birds and the sun in the trees right outside the big windows! Place was sooooo cute.

Loved our stay!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay at the beautiful glamping shed. The atmosphere is very peaceful. We met Dean who was very helpful, and Nancy responded quickly when we locked the door with the key inside.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What makes this place stand out is all of the little things- homemade banana bread, snacks, phone chargers all set up, Polaroid camera, fire starting kit- that Dean and Nancy have set up for guests when they walk through the door. It takes the stress out of traveling and allows you to relax and enjoy the beautiful location and incredible tiny shed!"

Thank you so much"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Dean and Nancy‚Äôs place is truly one of a kind! Probably the best Airbnb I have ever stayed in. Came for a solo retreat and left feeling so refreshed. Every single thing was thought of and it is evident they put great thought and prayer into making the tiny shed a haven for rest. Loved bird watching from the bed while sipping coffee!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just as lovely as pictured. Very private while feeling very safe. Cozy but didn‚Äôt feel cramped. Going outside the door a few steps to the restroom was not problematic, it is a private and pleasant space. This is a perfect space for quiet time yet is really close to Fort Wayne. I enjoyed sister time, and solo time during my stay. It was perfect!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I had a great night here! It was cozy, beautiful, peaceful and very comfortable. We will be back!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dean & Nancy were incredible hosts. Always super responsive, intentional with all the little details in the Tiny Shed (homemade sugar cookies, inviting welcome note personalized to us on the chalk board and so much more), flexible with check in/check out times when our plans changed, and made us feel right at home. Check in was extremely easy and we had complete privacy. During our stay we had to leave for a hotel room because of a tornado warning, and they graciously offered us a free night‚Äôs stay the next time we return. God‚Äôs presence and love was felt in the Tiny Shed and outside of it - the nature/surroundings were beautiful. We cannot wait to come back!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was extremely timely as it was exactly what my soul needed. The hospitality with the details that the hosts so graciously provided in this safe haven was healing for me.
If you‚Äôre looking for place to experience peace and you feel a need for rest as life sometimes can be hard.. I believe this may just be the resting place you need.
Thank you Dean&Nancy. It was also a great gift to have met you two. ‚ù§Ô∏è
May many more find restoration!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,wonderful tiny shed!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, peaceful, quiet, private, gorgeous views‚Ä¶ These are some of the first words I think of to describe this space. One of our favorite things was the amazing reclaimed barn windows, where wildlife would come up within feet of the window. There is a birdfeeder right outside and we saw such a great variety of local birds, as well as squirrels and rabbits within feet of the windows. It was so gorgeous lying in bed at night looking out the windows at the trees, and waking up in the morning to the haze in the trees.
Even though the bathroom is separate from the main space, it truly is only a few steps away, and it was well lit at night. Another thing I noticed and appreciated was that the bathroom was nice and warm when you stepped into it, even though it was chilly outside. Everything was clean, and there were so many thoughtful and beautiful little details. If you are wanting something that looks good on your social media feed, this place was super aesthetic!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a lovely place! My husband and I had the best little getaway we could have imagined!

Everything was extremely clean and tidy, with free snacks and homebaked cookies upon arrival. The bathroom is just a few steps away from the front door, so don‚Äôt let that deter you. It is a very inviting and welcoming atmosphere that is in the heart of a beautiful atmosphere in the middle of nature."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Tiny Shed to celebrate a year and a half together and Valentine‚Äôs Day. We can‚Äôt recommend this place enough!

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Tiny Shed is a really special place. It has a beautiful history, and there is love in every detail. It's a very comfortable space to unplug and unwind, from the super comfy furniture to the huge upcycled windows where you can watch the birds eat from a feeder. Dean&Nancy go above and beyond to offer treats like local honey and sustainably grown coffee from their local coffee shop in Ft. Wayne. They were welcoming to our pup and even provided bowls, special treats, dog blankets, a dog bed, and wipes for his feet! It was too cold to use their s'mores kits at the fire pit this time, but it looked like a lovely spot to be outside and listen to nature.
It's clear that Dean&Nancy love to share their beautiful space and treat their guests with kindness, even though we were strangers. If you need a reminder of the goodness of humanity, come visit The Tiny Shed!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Tiny Shed was the perfect way to celebrate our anniversary.
Quiet, cozy, and peaceful. Plus they had two cats on the property that were so cute and friendly!!

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is awesome. Truly a place to getaway and disconnect and just spend quality time with yourself, your partner, whoever you bring along with you. The windows are as stunning as in the pictures and really spice up the place. I went with my husband & 50lb goldendoodle and thought the space fit us just fine!
We had an issue with wildlife but i think that‚Äôs to be expected being out in the country in a tiny home, but we did communicate with Dean & Nancy our concerns and they were awesome.
I am not taking off a star for that incident because it was out of their hands & they did the best they could to make it right and it really is such a beautiful space. The hosts are so kind and helpful, they get 5/5 as well!
Overall, a very unique experience."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We can't recommend the Tiny Shed any more than is possible!! We LOVED it. They've thought of every need one might have. The decor is over the top and we especially loved the big windows overlooking the woods. It appears they've been open since 2017 but honestly it looks as if they opened yesterday. It's brand new!! Everything was perfect. We also enjoyed Promenade Park and the Children's Zoo. You must experience this at least once. We'll be back.

I went for one evening, and wished I could stay longer when it was time for me to depart! It is a little dream destination! It gave me great ideas also for a future tiny home if I ever would have one! Dean and Nancy were very hospitable, and they had many snacks and water to enjoy! Pictures say it all!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The tiny shed is the perfect tiny retreat. Thank you for your hospitality
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a cute place to stay! We highly recommend booking a stay at The Tiny House! Super cute set up. Location is very relaxing as well.
The owners are very kind. Nancy is excellent with replying promptly to any questions/messages on AirB&B messaging.
As recommended by The Tiny Shed hosts, we explored the following places, and would recommend them to others as well‚Ä¶
Roanoke and Grabill are great places to visit near The Tiny Shed. Downtown Fort Wayne is also a beautiful city to explore. The Utopian Coffee & Kitchen, in downtown Fort Wayne, is a great stop for coffee and breakfast/lunch. Also, A. Shively & Co is a super cute home goods store about 17 min from The Tiny Shed in Columbia City, IN.
Great place to stay!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed here for a couple nights on a cross country road trip and it was total bliss. I needed to recharge and relax - this is the perfect spot. The personal touches and attention to detail were unbelievable and so incredibly thoughtful - from extra special measures for my pup to homemade banana bread. Wonderful stay.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was a beautifully decorated shed. We really appreciated the effort put in by Dean & Nancy to make it a welcoming place.
We wanted to get away from the busy life in Chicago and their shed popped up while searching on Airbnb. This was our first time visiting Fort Wayne. Dean and Nancy recommended the children‚Äôs zoo, it was one of the best zoos we have visited so far, very interactive and perfect for a kid‚Äôs day out."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a wonderful, peaceful getaway spot for my husband and me. We loved the view out the windows from the bed. It was magical to wake up to that view! A one of a kind find!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Can‚Äôt get enough of this place! BEAUTIFUL, clean and spacious!!!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Dean and Nancy not only have a idyllic and gorgeous setting {the windows alone are worth the stay}; They deliver so many little personalized amenities and homey touches that I would 100% recommend them to anybody looking for a charming little getaway.
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dean and Nancy's Tiny Shed is a beautiful, unique, private retreat. The space is beautiful and very thoughtfully put together. Coffee, tea, snacks, and books are all at hand and I loved learning about the ways they give back in different ways through their business. They were very responsive in resolving some issues with the wifi and in helping me get checked in. If you're looking for a getaway and a unique experience this is it!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Tiny Shed was the perfect spot for me to retreat to for a couple nights of rest and relaxation. The location is remote enough to feel private but there are homes near enough so that you don‚Äôt feel unsafe! The little personal touches and details throughout the shed were so well thought out. The windows were perfection and falling asleep to the sounds of nature was so peaceful!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Book the shed! It‚Äôs adorable. Really enjoyed my stay. I was VERY comfortable and comfort is key for when I vacation. The bedroom portion of the shed is truly luxurious. I felt guilty when I left the shed to explore the city but I truly enjoyed being there. The small touches elevate the stay. Nancy and Dean are very thoughtful hosts and helped to make our anniversary trip special.
The only downfall was the bathroom. It is literally steps away, but I tend to wake up out of my sleep to use the bathroom and that wasn‚Äôt the most convenient when you‚Äôre half asleep at 4:00 am. And being a city girl I had to get used to the well water. Not worth taking a star away though, I would totally stay again!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Dean and Nancy‚Äôs place is exactly as advertised. Extremely cozy and comes with all amenities. The view is spectacular. Everything was super clean! Would recommend it to everyone.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Hands down perfect getaway for our anniversary celebration. Every little detail was so well thought out and beautiful. Dean and Nancy have a gift and are blessing so many along the way. We will be back for sure!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very cute space. We stopped here overnight on a drive across the country and really appreciated the hosts thoughtfulness. We had two dogs with us and they made sure there were items available to make their stay comfortable too. We woke up feeling refreshed and ready to continue our drive. We would definitely recommend a stay at the tiny shed, we only wished we could‚Äôve enjoyed it for longer."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Cute and clean Airbnb. Worked well for us and our dogs traveling through Fort Wayne for the night.

It looked exactly like the pictures. The only thing we had to decide was who preferred which bedroom. Josh had great communication with us throughout our stay. If we ever need a place to stay while in the Fort Wayne area we'll look for availability. We accomplished getting my maid of honor dress and shoes this weekend for my sister's wedding in August, so that was an added bonus! Best of luck Josh, thank you for a safe and comfortable stay!"

It was clean, modern, and enough space. Lots of white towels and the heat worked great. I loved the layered lighting in the house. Which is important for me in my own home. There is a river walk about a block away where I walked my dog every morning. Very peaceful. The neighborhood felt safe to me. Josh was a helpful and communicative host. I'm so glad being her caused me zero stress. Highly recommend."

Only problem with the weekend was construction on the street so we couldn‚Äôt park in the driveway or in front of the house and needed to walk a block when we used our car.

It was so close to town and the arena which made everything easier! I didn‚Äôt want to leave. The simple touches in the home were perfect and Nancy and Dean go above and beyond for their guests. I would come back to Indiana just to stay in this perfect home! My kids loved it! Thank you Nancy & Dean! ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was clean and stocked full of keurig pods and had a dishwasher which was a perk. They have a second airbnb rental on the property but we never saw anyone as it was vacant during our stay. I only have two beefs with this place. (1) The house had a huge draft coming in from the front door causing the thermostat to run excessively. Cold in living room and Boiling in bedrooms. We jammed a towel in the front door and it helped a bit. (2)The other beef I had is they have Hard Water at the home. The filters on the sink and filters on the water dispenser on the fridge needed changed Desperately. This left large white deposits in our water that you couldnt miss. We had to make a trip out and buy purified water. These two issues need addressed by the hosts immediately. However I still give them 5 stars. Nice home. Nice people. Nice location. Just those 2 small details and it would have been perfect. Even with the two small issues it was just about perfect. Check it out!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,this is my second stay at this ad . My husband got to come with me this time and we both thoroughly enjoyed it. hoped return this time this time next year
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Dean and Nancy‚Äôs place was just what we needed on a short notice. We only stayed one night and this place had everything we needed. Their place was clean and inviting and affordable especially compared to nearby hotels. Loved all the little touches in decor including the scripture messages. The only negative was the weather was super cold and snowy.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Despite one ""crazy night"" where the power went out, this was an amazing stay. And even with the night the power went out, it just added to our adventure, plus we couldn't have been more grateful for Nancy and Dean keeping good communication and coming out to help us that night.
Nancy and Dean were so helpful and communicative that we had little to no concerns that we would be taken care of. We're so grateful for you coming to our rescue in the late hours of the night.
We truly enjoyed our stay in your beautiful Bungalow. We will definitely be returning to this place and recommending it to friends and family. Thank you!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This house was very nice and welcoming. It was very clean and was a home away from home.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our quick getaway to Dean and Nancy‚Äôs place! Great communication, easy to find, beautiful furnishings, but the real MVP? The luxe beds and linens! Such a game-changer to make a place feel like home. Can‚Äôt wait to come back!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I've lost count of how many times I've stayed at the Bungalow at this point, but each time feels like coming home. This space is so charming and welcoming, and Dean and Nancy are wonderful hosts. My recent visit was especially charming as they had put up a Christmas tree to give the space a holiday vibe. That added a little something extra special to my visit during this holiday season. Be sure to check out the guest book during your stay. There are so many beautiful stories from past guests who have shared special moments and memories in the home on their travels. It may be a small home, but it clearly holds a big piece of so many hearts‚Äîmine included."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The country bungalow is absolutely wonderful! A beautiful, peaceful property with amazing hosts! Dean and Nancy were kind enough to let us host Christmas with our Grandkids in their beautiful home! They had it decorated for Christmas, including a beautiful tree! The home is so warm and cozy, I really didn‚Äôt want to leave.
They pay attention to all the little details that show they truly care about their guests! The bedding was fantastic, and provided a much needed nights rest! The kitchen is beautifully updated and well stocked with everything you need!
I cannot say enough good things about this home or the hosts!

Dean and Nancy are such sweet and kind hosts. we will definitely be staying here again :)
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We booked Dean and Nancy's place for a quick girl's trip, and it was perfect! The bungalow was so cute and tidy, and it was the perfect cozy home to relax and unwind in. The kitchen was stocked with everything you'd need to cook a meal, and the bathroom and bedrooms had many small details that were so thoughtful! It is a 15-minute drive into downtown Fort Wayne, so if you want to spend time there it takes some planning. But it's worth it to stay at such a great place!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Dean and Nancy were the perfect hosts and their lovely cottage was simply fantastic! The place is beautifully decorated, spotlessly clean, and extremely cozy. It had everything we needed for a perfect getaway, with thoughtful extras and a helpful welcome binder that included detailed instructions for the cottage and local tourist recommendations. We felt right at home and can‚Äôt wait to return. Highly recommended!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We love this place! This was our second year to visit its the true definition of a home away from home!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We spent 2 nights at Dean & Nancy‚Äôs and as soon as we arrived, we felt right at home. Everything was so beautiful and clean. The property was large and the landscaping gorgeous. We stayed there as a little getaway before and after we got married at Union 12 right down the road. It was such a relief to come back to the Airbnb and relax after a long day. It gave us so much inspiration for things to do in our own home. I would recommend Dean & Nancy‚Äôs to anyone. Even if you live in the area and just need a little staycation, this is the place to go üòä"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It doesn‚Äôt get any better than Dean and Nancy‚Äôs beautiful cottage.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Dean & Nancy are wonderful hosts! I had the pleasure of meeting them in person. Their Bungalow is charming & very dog friendly. I loved the thoughtful touches throughout the property. It felt like a home away from home. I would highly recommend if you are visiting the Ft. Wayne area!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"For a country feel close to the city this is the perfect, adorable, and picturesque home. It was clean, tastefully decorated, and the perfect size for what we needed for our week stay. Highly recommended home and superb hosts, a must stay for anyone traveling through or wanting to stay for a bit. We will be back again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a beautiful bungalow! Very clean and the d√©cor was very nice. Felt like being at home. So cozy and comfortable. We enjoyed being out in the country and enjoying the country air, but close enough to get to a grocery store or other stores if needed in minutes. If back in the area, we would love staying here again, 100%."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was another peaceful, beautiful visit. Thank you Dean and Nancy for a lovely stay."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second time staying at the bungalow. Love the location. Close to most stores/restaurants but yet set in a beautiful country setting. Comfortable beds and bedding. The reverse osmosis is really nice. Since our last visit they had added an adorable seating area outside along the large black building for the bungalow guests. And, also a picnic style table next to the bungalow. Great place to have coffee or evening cocktails. Everything was clean. Our pup enjoyed the yard as much as we did. Things to note; the owners may stop by sporadically and enter the basement area for their prep/cleaning work for a tiny home they have on the property. So, you will hear them come and go but was no bother to us. Also, check out was 1 hour earlier than most other Airbnbs for some reason. So, make sure you confirm before booking that this is ok for your schedule. We prefer 11 am check out when it‚Äôs a 4 pm check in. We managed and still had a wonderful visit and hope to stay again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was an amazing stay ! Responsive host and they went above and beyond to make our stay as comfortable as possible .

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We hate to write an awesome review for this bungalow, because we'd like to keep it all for ourselves! We enjoyed a wonderfully peaceful stay in this lovely home. Nicely decorated and truly filled with all the comforts of home. We've stayed at many airbnbs, this one was very generous with amenities and items to enjoy. Super clean too! We highly recommend and we will certainly return when we revisit Indiana.
This bungalow is a MUST STAY!
PS- Two attractions we recommend in the area, the Fort Wayne Zoo and the Sweetwater Performance Pavilion."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I booked Dean & Nancys home to celebrate our wedding anniversary. It was such a beautiful location, so peaceful! The home was so clean, bed very comfy! They didn't leave out any details from the yummy treats on the table when we walked in to having ""extra supplies"" if we forgot to bring something. We highly recommend it and would absolutely stay here again if we make it back to Fort Wayne!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Dean and Nancy‚Äôs bungalow is the perfect place for a getaway. It was beautifully decorated and felt homey and cozy.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing!! Beautiful country location but close enough to a big town!! The house was perfect for our girls trip! Gorgeous home, beautifully decorated, and SUPER clean! We will be back!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I really enjoyed my stay!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our hearts needed a getaway and The Country Bungalow hit the spot! We are already talking about coming back in the spring! We loved the birds, sweet cows across the street, and the stillness of the corn around us! Such a quaint and quiet space for our family to disconnect, relax, and refuel before the craziness of fall begins! We absolutely loved that our precious fur baby, Joy, could stay with us!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful stay at the country bungalow! Dean and Nancy‚Äôs home is very sweetly decorated and the area is so peaceful, though not too far from town! They had some great touches for my dog who was traveling with us, and they go above and beyond for their guests! Would gladly book with them again if we are in the area!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"What a sweet place! Out in the country it was so peaceful with the sounds of birds every morning. Set amongst big trees with a well kept yard the home was even better than we could have imagined. Walking inside I felt as if I had stepped into a country design magazine. The bungalow was so adorable and had such comfortable furniture and a pillow soft bed! The kitchen was well stocked with all the utensils, dishes and pans needed to cook a meal. The home was clean an immaculately kept. It was one of, if not the best, vacation rental we've ever had. The owners were quick to answer questions and made sure we had everything we could possibly need. We thoroughly enjoyed our time at the Country Bungalow and we recommend it highly."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a lovely stay we had at Dean and Nancy's bungalow! The setting is idyllic amid the corn fields and dairy cows, whom we liked to watch through the giant picture window in the living room. The furniture was comfortable, the place was decorated with all kinds of special touches, and the kitchen was wonderful. We even got to watch the town's July 4th fireworks through one of the other living room windows. We had a perfect view! We likewise enjoyed the outdoor spaces. We may return in the fall (and will be eager to visit the cafe opening up across the street at the dairy farm!). üòÄ"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Dean and Nancy‚Äôs place was comfortable (the queen bed was the best airbnb bed I‚Äôve ever slept in, it was so sturdy!) and homey. It was in a quiet location (but very convenient to get to just about anything in the city), and we loved wandering the property and using the outdoor spaces. Nancy always let me know when she and Dean would be on the property for any reason so we weren‚Äôt surprised, and I thought that was really awesome. Would definitely stay again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This bungalow is a beautiful home in a peaceful setting. We especially appreciated the comfortable bed in the butterfly room - so many places we stay have rock solid mattresses, but this one was very plush while still supportive. There has clearly been care taken to make this a special place."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Our stay at The Country Bungalow was one of the best Air BNB stays we've had! The country setting was so peaceful, yet close to anything you need. I joked with Nancy that I might not leave!
The house is so cute and very true to the pictures. Dean and Nancy have thought of everything you could possibly need. They were wonderful hosts and very responsive to any questions we had.
We would definitely stay here again."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We throughly enjoyed our stay at this lovely bungalow. We had driven for 10 hours in heat and traffic and were exhausted when we arrived; it was so easy to get into the property due to good instructions. The property was cool: the air conditioning had been turned on as the hosts had anticipated our probable need to cool down after 90+ degree heat. The entire bungalow was immaculate. Everything looked and felt so cozy. The decorating was right out of a magazine. We had a dog and he was able to enjoy the well manicured yard. We all slept well and were refreshed for another days full drive. We definitely would recommend this property. Our only regret is we couldn‚Äôt stay there for more than one night.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Dean and Nancy were absolutely wonderful! There place was so cute and put together so well. If you‚Äôre looking for a peaceful and cozy getaway this is the place.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Dean and Nancy‚Äôs sweet Bungalow is exactly what me and my husband needed. We wanted to come back to somewhere quiet after being at a concert. Dean and Nancy literally thought of everything that someone might have forgotten. I myself forgot my phone charger! But no worries they had chargers of all kinds there! Our only regret is that we didn‚Äôt get to stay longer. We cannot say enough good things about this Bungalow and Dean and Nancy‚Äôs hospitality.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,So peaceful and relaxing. We really enjoyed looking out at the cows and so did our dog. Great getaway!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My parents (& 3 doggies) came in from out of state to visit me and my family. Dean & Nancy‚Äôs home was quaint, quiet and the perfect amount of room for them for the long weekend."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely quaint and beautiful! All the added little touches made us feel special. One night we had a tornado watch and was a little concerned. Dean & Nancy made sure we had access to the basement in the event of a tornado warning.
We loved the wall clock.. it took us back to simpler times growing up. A touch of the past and the luxury of the modern made this place exceed our expectations!
As a matter of fact, we already rebooked!"
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Staying at Dean and Nancy's Bungalow was a very nice experience - their home has a lovely kitchen and is decorated in a very attractive manner. I was particularly pleased with how comfortable the bed was as well! The kitchen is very well laid out and the appliances are all new. The living room has a lovely picture window and there were a delightful number of birds to watch at the feeders just outside. We really enjoyed our stay overall and would definitely stay again and/or recommend the bungalow as a great place to stay while visiting the Fort Wayne area.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The ‚ÄúCountry Bungalow‚Äù was even better than our first visit! Dean and Nancy are perfect hosts, and they are very hands on and prepared the property for our intended use! We were in Fort Wayne visiting our grandson and they left out some cars, Lincoln Logs, puzzles, and books for him to enjoy. We appreciate being allowed to bring our furry friend! Beds and linens are luxurious, and we‚Äôll certainly use the property again on our next visit to Fort Wayne if it is available."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little old farmhouse. The inside is great. Enjoyed staying here. The cow dairy accross the street is a little smelly but didn't bother me because i was inside the whole time.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is one of the best airbnbs we have stayed in. It was so comfortable, homey, and clean. The bed was amazing! I just wanted to stay in bed all day.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,An absolutely stunning place! You will not be disappointed. Dean and Nancy have made sure every minute detail has been thought about. I think our pup enjoyed the place more than his permanent spot (the best dog bed provided)! Will definitely be back again. Thanks again Dean and Nancy.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The bungalow was an absolute gem and a wonderful home base for my trip. The home is lovely and situation on a stunning property, not far from amenities but secluded enough you really do feel like you're in a peaceful, rural retreat. Dean and Nancy were not only responsive, but some of the friendliest airbnb hosts I have interacted with on the platform. Can't say enough nice things about this lovely home and hosts‚Äîand very much look forward to a future visit."

It was easy to find and absolutely gorgeous inside. I had my dog with me and greatly appreciated all the small touches for dogs (e.g. food and water bowls, treats, and a bed). If you're in the Ft. Wayne area, I would highly recommend Dean and Nancy's bungalow as a place to stay."

Secondly, the decorating was charming, such detail! Thirdly, the lighting was not that bright overbearing stuff, was luxury and soft for a nice calm visit. All my adult kids felt very comfortable for a visit and loved it! We will definitely be putting this place as our must stay, if available in Fort Wayne. Not to mention the cute tiny home on the other side. Everything is well appointed and has a very cozy welcoming feeling, sleep was great! Very quiet and private as well!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A great place for a quiet, peaceful escape."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Dean & Nancy‚Äôs place is extremely cozy, in fact, it had the most comfortable beds we have slept in. Bedrooms all had very nice bedding and charging cords on bedside tables. The kitchen is packed with all the essentials you could possibly need. The dishes, cutlery, and appliances were all top notch. There were even frosted pint glasses in the freezer. The living room is perfect for reading a book while bird watching through a huge front window. Dean and Nancy thought of every detail, and made our stay a five star experience. Being able to walk the dog through the woods and enjoy a fire pit outside were added treats. We stayed over the Christmas holidays and their property made us feel like we were home away from home. We have stayed at many airbnbs around the world and the Country Cottage ranks as one of our all-time favorites!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful country setting close to shops and restaurants. So much thoughtfulness went into this home as an Airbnb. All the extra touches made us feel right at home. I highly recommend staying here.

Would definitely recommend and would definitely stay again!!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, quiet, comfortable house surrounded by farms but still just a 10-15 minute drive from downtown. Nancy and Dean are super friendly and helpful and committed to making their guests feel at home. I had a great stay and would gladly return."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Dean and Nancy‚Äôs place is the epitome of what Airbnb is. It‚Äôs the warmest and homiest place we‚Äôve ever stayed. It felt like a home away from home for us and the warmest place ever!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Perfect!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Oh my- Dean and Nancy are just the most wonderful people. They let you decide how much interaction you want to have with them, but we were more than happy to chat with them every opportunity we could because they are lovely people! The home itself is exactly as it looks in photos and beautiful. They provided everything we needed and more for a month long stay ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Best place to stay in Fort Wayne!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Family of three traveling through-it‚Äôs gorgeous and well kept inside, WAY more than enough room. Dean and Nancy have created quite the comfortable and inviting stay we were even a little disappointed it was a single night packing up. Comfortable beds, easy check in, communication, great decor, thoughtful touches we‚Äôve come to expect only outside larger hotels-hospitality to put in a word"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful space! Very quiet, and Dean and Nancy go the extra mile to make your experience wonderful."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter & I were in town to visit with family. We stayed at this cozy bungalow. It was a welcomed , peaceful stay that we needed. We are from Orlando and the hustle and bustle of the big city gets exhausting at times. So, to stay in a peaceful,quiet,country home was just what we needed. The beds were comfy and we loved the updated kitchen. The dining table was perfect for some family card games and lots of laughs. We enjoyed sitting outside under the trees and having coffee in the morning and cocktails in the evening. The location was close to a lot of things yet just out of town enough to enjoy the peace. Dean & Nancy stop in and go through another entrance to basement when they need to get supplies or change out their other rental (tiny shed). They text ahead and let u know. There are clear instructions about which rooms/doors are not to be used by guests. Keypad entry was easy. We didn‚Äôt use the TV much, which is a good thing for me. They had reverse osmosis at kitchen sink. Hall closet had supplies and paper products. Bathroom was stocked. Parking was close to front door with about 2-3 steps on the deck leading into front door. Cute little mud room that I adored welcomes u. There is a dairy farm across the road but we only smelled the ‚Äúdairy-air‚Äù once and it was not too bad. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the bungalow and hope to return when we come back up for a visit."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Excellent communication, adorable house, very clean. Little extras were so nice, snacks, soaps, creamer for coffee. Loved the decorations, such a cozy home."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Dean and Nancy were amazing! We ran into a few hiccups on our trip in (nothing related to their home or accommodations) and Dean and Nancy were so helpful! They helped us try to find a body shop or mechanic on a Saturday due to us hitting a deer on the way. Overall they are just exceptional people! The house is like you walked into a chip and Joann bungalow. Everything is very simple but also has a sophisticated feel. All of the little detail is there from the snacks left out to the canister in the bathroom with toiletries in case you forgot something! You feel like you are in the middle of the country but you are 7 minutes from Sams and the highway! Definitely a must stay if you are in Fort Wayne!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Thank you Dean&Nancy for the respite and generous hospitality of your Country Bungalow during a very challenging time for our family! After being hit by a record breaking storm, we were without power during a serious heat wave.
This home was an absolute gift from God. From the moment you enter, you get a sense of calm, peace and retreat. Beautifully designed, spotless, well appointed and elegant. But what sends it over the top are Dean&Nancy!
I now understand what sets apart a super host from the rest. They anticipate your every need before you do. It‚Äôs all there! This home is a luxurious retreat in a beautiful country setting, the beds are very comfortable, the kitchen is well appointed, and the hosts are the best I‚Äôve ever met! I can‚Äôt imagine staying anywhere else in Fort Wayne."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed the country ambiance with the convenience of the city! The Country Bungalow was comfortable and well suited for our extended family‚Äôs needs. Dean and Nancy were generous hosts and thought of every detail (even providing amazing coffee creamer). We especially enjoyed the movie night in the secret theater room! The night at the firepit should be long remembered for the opportunity to be together around a fire. All and all we were quite content and hope we left your home none the worse for out visit. We would like to visit again if you would have us.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was the best Airbnb stay we have ever had. Dean and Nancy have a very nice home that is super clean and comfortable. They thought of everything from the personal note that greeted us upon our arrival to snacks and water bottles on the counter to a container of helpful and typically forgotten items in the bathroom, they covered it all. We really enjoyed our stay in their home and if we return to the area, we will definitely book again. Thank you for letting us borrow your home for a few days, we really enjoyed our stay. Five+ stars!!!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Five stars for everything! So easy to find and check-in, the bed was super comfortable, I had space to lay out clothes and personal belongings.

Thank you for the amazing night! We would definitely stay again!"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Let me just say this felt like I was right at home! They were accommodating right from the start especially with having my boyfriend and I‚Äôs cars there! Super quick booking and relatively cheap especially for our last minute one night booking! They went above and beyond for us! They had towels in the closet, water in the room, the WiFi name and password, shampoo/conditioner as well as body wash, extra items in case you forgot something, snacks in the room for us to snack on and even had a sign in the bedroom welcoming us! Even though we got in late and left before we could get to say hi to the them they showed it through their messages between my boyfriend and I! I would definitely recommend this because it‚Äôs less then a 15 minute drive to the Glenbrook mall and all food locations which was amazing and super convient especially being right off the highway, which made it easy to get too and from their lovely home! I will definitely book again in the future! Amazing people!!"

The pool area looks very nice, however still too early in the year in Indiana for it to be opened. This made for a wonderful weekend spot for me to recharge and get caught up on work. Next time I need another staycation for myself, this is where I‚Äôll look first."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Kathy and Mark were awesome hosts. They were so friendly and helpful. Mark even kept my stair swept from snow and even CLEANED the ice and snow off my car!

Everything was just wonderfully relaxing."

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The farmhouse suite was wonderful! It was exactly as described. We appreciated Kathy‚Äôs attention to the details. The throw blankets and pellet heater made it cozy while we watched our Netflix. Check in was a breeze. We liked that check out is at noon so we weren‚Äôt rushed to leave.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"To say I have a unique view of this property is an understatement. Kathy has done an outstanding job keeping the place up to such a high standard. It‚Äôs a very quiet location and while on first glance it may not seem centrally located it really is. Very close to 469. ~20 minutes from the airport. About the same to the DuPont area (DeBramds etc)
Don‚Äôt neglect the Georgetown area while there. Jeff‚Äôs Coneys was a childhood favorite and as a former Bandidos employee I can put a plug in for them. Honorable mention to the rib joint. Or take some food back and enjoy the beautiful scenery and quiet.
Cannot recommend this place enough"

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When we walked in to Kathy's suite our 9 year old exclaimed, ""Wow this is better than a hotel!"" And it really is: the suite is tidy and roomier than I expected, and the furnishings are comfortable and stylish. The swimming pool is just steps away and although we brought pool toys, there was a stash of pool toys and kid-safety wearables available. The water was perfect - clear, clean, and just warmed up enough by the sun. Although it is a shared pool, we pretty much had it to ourselves. It felt like a private resort! This was the perfect spot for our little family weekend getaway. Kathy stopped by while we swam to say hello and remind us of the big, plushy towels available in the bathroom. She is a great host: friendly, kind, and thought of every detail one would want in a home-away-from-home."

The place itself located just a few mins from the downtown, but it feels like its a world apart. The people are the nicest you would meet. And the p[lace itself truly does feel like a Homestead, and Kathy and her husband does make you feel the warmth and friendliness of the area. They have a huge plot and its kept up beautifully.

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kathy & Mark are exceptional hosts. We had a great time staying at the farmhouse suite! Everything was very clean and organized. The pool was fabulous on a hot day, and we enjoyed having a spacious living room for winding down in the evenings. As first-time visitors to Fort Wayne, we appreciated that the location was within 15 minutes driving to most of places we wanted to check out for outdoor activities, local coffee, etc.
What truly stands out about our stay were the small, thoughtful touches. Kathy, knowing we wanted to take a dip after arrival, kindly set out pool towels for us. The key code was personalized and custom set for us so that it would be easy to remember. Cold, filtered water was ready to go in fridge, and Clorox wipes were available and appreciated given extra cleaning precautions with COVID-19.
We truly loved the experience and hope to be back again sometime in the future!"

The location is very ideal, just a few minutes to the nearest highway and very close to restaurants and groceries. It took me about 15 minutes to reach Parkview Field. It has a ‚Äúcountry‚Äù feel to it while being close to what you need.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The host was accomodating. It's a sweet cottage on a large bit of land that gives it that country feel. While being mere minutes from most everything Fort Wayne has to offer. There is a swimming pool and gardens. Also a large field if you wanted to do some outdoors stuff. It was a late spring stay so the gardens were still growing their produce. I'd recommend an early fall stay to reap those benefits. The pool was open but I felt a bit too cold for me personally. I imagine in full on summer I wouldn't mind. Clean and cozy inside.

Guests may nibble from their lush raspberry patch when berries are in season. I took advantage of the last October harvest!
Kathy & husband live on a house on the property & were quick to respond when I needed help with a couple things.

Kathy was very welcoming and hospitable. The pool was wonderful and there are a couple parks within walking distance (I only walked to the smaller one). Really nice neighborhood and just down the street from gas, groceries, etc. Make sure you get Penn Station if you're not from the east coast!"
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place for families with little kids in tow to stop over - the playground equipment and the pool onsite meant we didn‚Äôt have to travel to entertain the kiddos, and the hosts couldn‚Äôt be nicer! We had a quick and easy stay. Recommended!"

2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The hosts are wonderful! It seemed that they were genuinely happy to have us. Great cottage: Small on the outside, but you don't think of that when you're inside (It was one adult and two children under 12, keep in mind--and I didn't cook, although we certainly could have). Location great, and acres and acres for kids to play! The boys played soccer and on the swing set and were very happy. The hosting, the outdoors, and the value: Come with kids!"

2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We love it here! We were delighted with the peaceful and quiet setting which was a perfect way to relax after a busy week. Kathy's attention to detail is evidenced through not only the charming decor, but the small touches that make for a comfortable stay. It was also so easy and convenient to prepare our meal. We wish we could have had more time here!"
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kathy's place was very quiet and close to gas stations and a large Kroger. We were impressed by the comfortable beds and well stocked kitchen.

We would recommend this place to anyone needing a small quiet place in the Ft. Wayne area."
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a great place for our small family to stay. We enjoyed our stay.
2019-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This is an older cottage that has been nicely remodeled and is spotlessly clean. It is relatively small, but quite comfortable, and very quiet except for one of the two bedrooms which is next to the rather noisy forced-air heater in a back room. The only thing we missed was a table around which the three of us could sit while eating, as there is only a counter with two stools, but it wasn‚Äôt important for us. Surprisingly for a ‚Äúcosy‚Äù place, there was a washer and dryer in the back room where the heater is."
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This space was perfect for me and my 2 daughters. We had plenty of room and the location was perfect! Kathy's place was super clean and comfy. We had the perfect amount of amenities and everything we needed for our stay. Kathy was a great host. I would definitely recommend this place for your travels to Fort Wayne. :)
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was fabulous!
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I hate to say this, only because I hope it‚Äôs available when we come back to town. Kathy‚Äôs ‚ÄúKottage‚Äù is such a treasure...The home itself was spotless and so inviting, I kicked my shoes off right away and felt so relaxed. There were many unexpected extras, the location was perfect, peaceful and somewhat secluded, yet 5 minutes away from it all. We were even able to star gaze at night because the property is so large there weren‚Äôt any street lights lighting up the sky. Didn‚Äôt get a chance to use the swings, but next time I come I will definitely gaze at the stars ‚ú® from them. Thank you again, to our wonderful hosts.

This guest house was by far the best experience I‚Äôve had. The home was exactly as pictured and described. It is a very comfortable space with lots of nice touches. Kitchen was stocked with some ingredients that made cooking there easy. My 4 year old grandson stayed with me and loved his room. Lots of stuffed animals, some toys, board games and books that he enjoyed. Location is close to downtown and local park. Lori, the hostess, went above and beyond. Checked on me before, during and after my stay. She responded quickly and was understanding of a situation that happened during my stay. I would definitely recommend and go back in the future."

I sent a message to Lori to let her know why I was coming into town to see if her space would be a good fit for my group. We were only coming into town for one night, and I know some properties require a minimum of 2. She responded quickly and was super kind and professional. We had all of the information about check-in and check-out in advance and she was very accommodating with the times for us as well. She greeted us at the door when we arrived and gave me a ‚Äútour‚Äù of the space. The guest house smelled amazing and was squeaky clean. So much attention to details that make this space comfortable, cozy, and peaceful right smack dab in the middle of town. The restaurants she recommended were top notch too (and one of the people in my group has severe food allergies.... We had zero troubles!) My only disappointment is that we were only in town for the one night. I would have loved to stay longer and enjoy more time."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cozy place within walking distance to the city. Lori thought of everything you might need and then some. It was a great place to stay and a top-notch value. We would stay here again should the need arise.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It is such a cute place. It is small and there is not a lot of sink counter space in the bathrooms, but we loved our stay and had plenty of space for 4 people! I would definitely stay here again."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We love staying at Lori‚Äôs place ! The home is immaculate , in a quiet neighborhood , comfortable beds , well stocked kitchen close to downtown area . I personally
love the master bedroom that feels like a luxury retreat! What else could a person ask for ?! Great communication from Lori and she is always available and willing to help with anything you need . Great host ! Highly recommend !"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lori‚Äôs place is perfect from when you drive up to when you leave the house. She didn‚Äôt miss a single detail. Provided things for my kids, left Tylenol/advil out, and just so much attention to detail. I was a little timid regarding a guest house but after reading the reviews and staying there, I will look for this house every time we visit ft Wayne. Beds were super comfortable and the house was spotless. Honestly, probably the best house we have stayed at. Thank you!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best Airbnbs we have stayed in! Great, quiet, walkable neighborhood surrounded this beautiful home! The outside was warm and welcoming with Christmas decorations as was the inside. We felt right at home the moment we drove up. The inside was comfortable and cozy with the attention to detail evident throughout the guest house. We also appreciated having minimal things to do before checkout especially when the day you are leaving you need to leave early. We were fortunate enough to be able to meet Lori and Todd during our stay and after talking with them for a few minutes it seemed like we were chatting with old friends!
This is a must stay for anyone visiting Fort Wayne!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Where can I start? I think this might‚Äôve been our favourite air bnb stay ever.
Lori and Todd are so lovely and went over and above for our stay. We are a family of 3 with an 8yo daughter and we stayed over Christmas. We arrived to find a Christmas tree setup, decorations in the home and a kid-friendly nativity scene for our daughter to play with. It was just the sweetest thing.
We wanted for absolutely nothing during our stay and Lori stayed in contact without being over the top which I‚Äôve had from other hosts in the past.
This is a beautifully renovated home with such great attention to detail and not a spec of dust or grime to be seen - super clean and a fully functioning, well equipped kitchen.
The beds were heaven to sleep on and lovely linens and big fluffy towels.
Thank Lori and Todd, we‚Äôd stay again in a heartbeat!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"So thankful for this perfect place stay. Lori thinks of everything you may need. Even cuter in person!! Thankful for easy communication with Lori, location convenient to downtown . Plenty of space to relax with family.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely beautiful restoration of historic home, and owner Lori was so nice, informative and helpful. Near thriving downtown of Fort Wayne which is enjoying a true Renaissance it seemed to us. Our first trip to this cool little city, on three rivers with excellent restaurants recommended by Lori ; The Copper Spoon was stellar, best salmon we have ever had anywhere. The duplex home‚Äôs attached two
floor unit was gorgeous, spotless and private. C omfy and classic furnishings, two tvs with plentiful choices, and the shower was amazingly enjoyable.. Nothing vintage about the water pressure as owners redid everything top to bottom inside and out, with great pride and craftsmanship. Really a special place if you are in Fort Wayne and want to be close to but not in the downtown."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Lake Avenue Guesthouse is an absolute gem! It was the perfect spot for our out-of-town family members to stay for a weekend visit, and Lori is a wonderful host.

Lori is a great host, very responsive and attentive while also giving space if needed - but we knew she was there should the occasion arise. The house was perfect for our family with little kids. (There are stairs, but a gate at the top of them). Fabulous little touches and amenities while being perfectly clean."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We can absolutely recommend this apartment. It was extremely well equipped and Lori and Todd were very quick to respond, helpful and friendly. We would definitely stay there again!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lori's place was wonderful - clean, spacious & great amenities - the bedding was posh, the towels were huge and plush. Lori was so friendly, so responsive (esp when I had an issue), had lots of local recommendations; she treated us like family. I will definitely return! Although on a busy street, it was pretty quiet except for one or two noisy cars and a train went past a few times. Her place was a short walk to a lovely park & gardens & a delicious coffee shop. Downtown is a little further, but still walkable. A great place if you want your own space close to downtown."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If I could give Lori‚Äôs place a 10 Star I would. It was very quiet, very clean, and very comfortable. Lori made sure we had everything we needed. She went above and beyond even when we had a big favor to ask. Lori takes care to add extra touches like big fluffy towels for the amazing shower. I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better place to stay. We will definitely book again when we come back to Fort Wayne."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The guesthouse was a dream! My husband and I stayed for our 10 year first date anniversary. The house was exactly as described, so many cute little extras and personal touches. Lori was warm and welcoming, she greeted us when we arrived and checked in with us a couple of times to ensure we were having a good experience. It was a perfect balance of checking in while giving us space to enjoy. It was so nice to be walking distance from downtown‚Äîdefinitely check out all of the recommendations in the guidebook! This was our first time visiting Fort Wayne and we‚Äôll definitely be back! Thanks Lori!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lori‚Äôs place was a perfect spot for our wedding weekend. The kitchen and living room were great for my friends and family to all hang out and get together. The master bedroom was beautiful and the bed was so cozy!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lori's place is a piece of heaven! The way it is tucked in it's own secluded area, even though it's on main street that leads to the beautiful Lakeside Park. Lori has an antique table that greets her guest before entering her airbnb, it's what got my attention where I could imagine myself sitting out there letting the day go by. Lori thought of everything that could make her guest feel welcomed to be a guest in her beautiful restored historical home. She had amenities that you never thought you needed away from your home. I enjoyed my private time with my family! I will make sure to visit Lori's restored historical downtown home again! She is a delightful woman that loves to bring joy to her visitors while they relax and take in the peaceful scenery and her beautiful home...."

The bed is super comfortable. Everything you need to feel like you're right at home!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lori,
What a delightful gem just blocks from downtown Fort Wayne. The apartment was charming and immaculate. It was perfect for our needs. We had the best time and plan on coming back next year for the Vera Bradley Sale.
It was a pleasure meeting you and we can‚Äôt thank you enough for the recommendations on what to see and do in Fort Wayne. We loved ‚ÄúThe Landings‚Äù, the Mercado restaurant, the fountains, and the murals in the downtown area. The Coffee shop had the best summer specials, and the food was so yummy. We sat outside and enjoyed the unique vibe of the shop.
Thanks for sharing your lovely space. It is much appreciated.
Sue"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The king bed was amazing! The host thought of everything if you need anything. Super friendly and Amazing! thank you for the great stay, hopefully we can return next year!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was absolutely lovely. As a former Fort Wayne resident, this location felt just like coming home and reminded me and my fianc√© why we loved the area so much in the beginning. The location is extremely close to downtown but far enough away that it doesn‚Äôt FEEL like downtown. It has gorgeous, historical elements and has me embarrassed by the hardwood floors in my own home (they‚Äôre THAT nice). This location is within walking distance of many wonderful downtown locations, as well as Lakeside Park!
As a host, Lori was extremely responsive, helpful, and accommodating. From confirming if we had everything we needed, to chatting with us directly and letting us meet her adorable puppy, Lori made us feel like family.
My company has a location near Fort Wayne and I plan on reserving this location for my accommodations during future work visits. An absolute delight."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Second best host I‚Äôve ever had. Only reason being the first best gave me free nights due to being in the hospital and even brought time an overnight bag.
But Mrs. Lori is right there with her. She‚Äôs one of the most polite attentive good hearted not just host but human being I‚Äôve ever met in my life. She went above and beyond to make sure me and my elderly parents felt welcomed and taken care of our entire stay. Anytime I had any questions at all she was quick to respond. As for the house couldn‚Äôt be cleaner. You can literally eat off any surface in that house (if you want to) the beds are comfy and the tv‚Äôs are very nice. Definitely the nicest house I‚Äôve stayed in my entire time on AirBnb!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I were in town for our grandsons high school graduation and decided to choose an Airbnb this trip vs a hotel. Did we ever make the right choice! Lori was excellent to communicate with and we had a lovely chat when we arrived. Turns out she knows our daughter-in-law and the Fort Wayne art work in the kitchen is our Son's art. Small world.
The guest house is attached to the main house but very private and quiet and the neighborhood was also very quiet. It was impeccably clean, very tastefully decorated and the king bed was HEAVEN! Not a detail was missed from the diffusers upstairs and down, bathroom necessities provided (deodorant, toothbrush, makeup cloths, cotton balls, qtips) , high quality towels, large screen tvs in living and bed room with Roku, large clean shower with shamp/cond and body wash. I could go on and on.
You wont be disappointed! We will definitely be back! Thank you Lori for a great stay."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay. The house was just as described, had everything we needed and was very spacious.

There were travel sizes of different first aid items (Tylenol, ibuprofen). The rooms were spacious and our host made it important to meet us in person! She provided awesome recommendations for food/drinks and responded very quickly social media! Thanks again Lori! We cannot wait to visit again‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lori was very communicative from the start! She was very helpful in making our stay a great one.

Lori went out of her way to make us feel at home, and it worked!

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is really really nice.
I‚Äôm guessing Lori has been to AirBnB‚Äôs in other cities and took notes of what guests need, met and exceeded some of those expectations.
I‚Äôve stayed in this area before and while not one of the safest neighborhoods in Fort Wayne, we felt safe and in a private/secure place.
I would definitely book this place if available on my next trip to FtW."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We have stayed at a lot of B&B's over the years and this was one of the best! I honestly cannot think of anything we would have wanted that wasn't already provided. It exceeded our expectations. From design and decoration to the amenaties provided, everything was very thoughtful. It is within walking distance to beautiful Lakeside Park and close to downtown. Lots to do for a wide range of ages and interests. Definitely worth the money!

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lori‚Äôs home is just beautifully remodeled and so so comfortable! She literally has thought of every detail: from refreshing essential oils diffusing upon arrival to the luxurious bedding on the King Bed to colored pencils and a coloring book available to unwind! Her wonderful library of books was greatly appreciated by my kiddos, (and myself) and the kitchen just had absolutely everything you could need- right down to the few plastic baggies I had forgotten to pack for our lunch on the road! Oh and age-appropriate toys were provided- I mean- how could we have ever even contemplated spending a night in a hotel?? This was perfect!"

Everything was catered for, so well equipped with nothing left out.
Kitchen and bathroom all well stocked.
Very well presented and furnished, and so well appointed.
The bed was fabulous, so comfortable, bedding superb, towels so fluffy.
Having stayed at so many Airbnb across many countries, it was one of the best we have stayed in.
Lori was a great communicator, always got back to me so quickly.
And was so good to talk to, and she had a delightful large puppy called Sadie who enjoyed the attention.
I would most strongly recommend this accommodation to anyone staying in Fort Wayne.
And next time I come to the fort, it will be my 1st choice."

Basically, this home has it all! Beyond that, the host takes it to another level with prompt and friendly communication.

She went above and beyond to provide toys and activities for our two young kids and gave excellent recommendations during our stay. We will most definitely return on our next trip through town!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very friendly owner, and a very nice home. It's clean, has all the amenities, and comfortable.

She was so sweet and accommodating and provided everything we might need for our stay! She welcomed us back home when we returned from a long day out to make sure we were enjoying our stay and to ask if we needed anything else!
The house really is very central to every thing you can think of and it only took us 15 minutes at most to get anywhere we needed to be.
We would 100% recommend and if we could give more than 5 stars we would. Next time we are in town we will definitely check to see if her home is available before looking elsewhere!!"

The house was a quick drive to numerous activities and a short walk to a great coffee shop. Lori did so much to accommodate our kids- and they loved the toys and books she set out.

Great location. Thanks again Lori... We will definitely see you again!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved Lori‚Äôs place! First of all, the home is historic and so beautifully updated. Everything was very clean and the little touches were so thoughtful.

This is how all Airbnb experiences should be!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Staying at this home is quite the experience. it's a beautiful 2 bedroom 1 and 1/2 bath Victorian duplex. The home is so beautiful with small touches designed to make you feel at home and welcome. The host is attentive and quick to respond--providing comforts designed specifically to each guest.

Highly recommend this listing."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was only our 2nd stay at an AirBnB and this more than exceeded our expectations, both in terms of location and comfort. The house had an historic feel, but with completely modern appliances and conveniences. We felt very much at home and both got a terrific night‚Äôs sleep. Lori was a great host in dealing with two novice guests and we were very pleased with our choice. Would definitely stay again if we had the chance."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Lori keeps this place super clean and comfy. She‚Äôs thought of everything and offers the perfect combination of communication and privacy. Our favorite Airbnb to date!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An active person‚Äôs dream home. Lori and Todd are located two blocks from the Rivergreenway (25 miles of paved trails). I left straight from the house to walk and run downtown. Rented a bike from the Bike Hub and rode the trail as well.
Lori will tell you that everything is ‚Äú5 minutes away‚Äù and it‚Äôs so true.
I visited 5 different YMCA facilities in the area and they all have swimming pools except one.
In addition to having a beautiful apartment to use with everything you might need in the kitchen and bath, I loved that the house smelled so nice on arrival with air diffusers.
The bed and pillows (a nice variety of pillows I will say) are so comfortable you might find it hard to get out of bed.
I found a fabulous book in the library for the rare times I sat still inside.
As a light sleeper, I was thankful for the noise machine as there is a fair amount of traffic during rush hour times on Lake Avenue. I was able to drown out the evening traffic noise and get great sleep.
I will definitely plan to stay with Lori and Todd the next time I am in Fort Wayne."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I stayed at Lori‚Äôs as part of an anniversary gift. When we arrived, there was champagne and chocolate waiting for us; how sweet is that?!

The ‚Äúapartment‚Äù, if you want to call it that -as it was more like a home -was absolutely spotless, beautifully renovated and decorated with lovely simple antiques. The apartment has its own entry and was so quiet. The first floor living room, half bath, and kitchen provided everything to make us feel at home‚Ä¶only better!!! And the second floor bedroom, sitting room, and bathroom were charming and so comfortable. Lori kept the feel of the century home when she remodeled the space with new fixtures and appliances.

My kids absolutely loved the big bunk beds and all the room they had. The outside sitting area was perfect to relax and hang out in the evenings, we had great weather. I will say parking isn't ideal if you have large SUV's. But other then that the house was beautiful and suited for everything you and your family would need."

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was super nice.
The only issue we had, was there wasn't air conditioning in the bedrooms. The host did provide fans. It just wasn't enough for the summer heat after working outside all day."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,We loved the patio with the gas fire pit. We tried a Brewery recommended by Lucas and it was great! The house worked perfect for us and our 4 young adults. Definitely will keep it on our list when visiting Ft. Wayne in the future.
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Lucas was a great host and the house provided a great home base for a family wedding. Everything was spotless, great simple instructions, comfortable beds, and plenty of water and coffee. We appreciated the fans in the bedrooms upstairs as the AC liked to stay downstairs.
If you need a spot in Fort Wayne we would recommend."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,House was great just as described and accurate pictures. There is parking for 2 cars in garage just a tight fit. Great entertaining space in the courtyard but no shade provided. Overall a great clean place to stay with grocery close by and couple places for food and drink walkable distance. Would stay again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"We really enjoyed the house, and even wished we would have stayed longer!! Lucas was a great host!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at an Airbnb hosted by Lucas, and I must say it was an absolutely outstanding experience from start to finish.

Thank you, Lucas, for creating such a memorable stay. I hope to have the opportunity to visit again in the future!  "

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The location is excellent, the house is spotlessly clean, and everything is well-organized. There is nothing lacking, and the landlady is extremely welcoming and helpful. The house is located in the heart of the city, making access to shopping facilities very convenient. It would be a pleasure to return here to enjoy the amenities again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We attended a concert downtown and this location was perfect for 4 adults. Loved having the Electric and so many food options within walking distance.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I recently stayed in this apartment and would highly recommend it. The location in the center is unbeatable. The apartment is amazingly bright, which makes it extra inviting.
Cleanliness was impressive, and the landlord's attention to every detail made the stay even more enjoyable. The landlord himself was friendly and willing to help at any time, which has really positively impacted the overall experience.
If you are looking for a comfortable and well-maintained apartment looked after by a friendly landlord, this is definitely the right Wah"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a great place for a weekend getaway! The beds are comfy. Jacalyn is a great host!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at Jacalyn's place in Fort Wayne. We would highly recommend the space to anyone visiting!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time. The place was super cute and very clean when we checked in. Parking was very easy to get on the street right by the house. We walked to Electric Works across the street one night which was a fun experience.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The house was amazing. My gf just kept saying how she wanted our house to be just like that one. Definitely will come back

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We needed a baby friendly place that could accommodate two couples and an infant. A kitchen and two baths were essential. The location was close to the venue, the botanical gardens, and east to get back and forth. Our host were generous with our check in time making it easy for our transition into formal wear then in to the wedding. Everything was spotless.
There were several access numbers to keep track of. If you‚Äôre not a numbers person plan to have pen and paper ready."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place !!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The host was very accommodating and the home was very nice. Everything was very clean and comfortable. We will definitely book again.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"An awesome place in Fort Wayne! This was perfect for our girls weekend trip. We could see Electric Works from the house and could have walked there. The rooms were spacious and we had plenty of room for the night. Jacalyn was very thorough with her instructions for us to get to and enter the house. Parking was tricky with multiple vehicles, but we made it work with street parking. We had a great stay at Jacalyn's place and would definitely stay there again. Thanks!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I absolutely adored this listing. It was so nice to have a dedicated garage that was easily accessible leading to the house.
Although my stay was brief, I found the apartment stylish, functional, spacious, and laid out very well. High ceilings, open concept, the furniture modern, yet comfortable and warm-feeling. The fenced backyard was the perfect size with just the right amount of privacy for me and felt like a comfortable, natural extension of the house. I could imagine a family BBQ with kids running around w/ music playing & corn hole being played (there weren‚Äôt boards, this was just what I was imagining in my brain).
Jacalyn was a great communicator, super nice, & flexible. I was very appreciative of her kindness. I was a little confused by the house #, because there was a totally different number on the front of the house than the side of the house. To be fair, I arrived ridiculously late and my eyes in the dark are not stellar. Maybe just mention this in the instructions."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at this beautiful, clean, and cozy house! Jacalyn was quick to respond to messages anytime we needed help. Easily walkable to Electric Works and other nearby stores. Definitely an Air Bnb that you want to spend more time in :) Can‚Äôt wait to stay here again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were here for a family funeral, Jacalyns home was just what we needed a quiet, relaxing retreat. We look forward to coming back when we can enjoy the area more. If your thinking about booking, you should do it you won‚Äôt be disappointed.
Jacalyn, thank you for sharing your beautiful home with us."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful home! So beautiful and cozyüòá
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We got in late and left early in the morning, so we did not have much time to enjoy the property. We mainly needed a place to crash for a night. The place was convenient, clean and comfortable. Jacalyn was very responsive. The unit is well decorated and supplied. The kitchen, which we did not use, looked great. The living room was comfy."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean and comfortable place. All of the essentials included. It was right across from electric works which was so fun and fed us twice. ü§§ü§§ The market there and the food was great. This location was within walkable distance to almost everything downtown. 100% worth the price!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This Airbnb was everything we thought it would be . My sister got married the weekend we rented this place and she was able to get ready for her wedding here too ! It was like home away from home ! I would definitely stay here again ! Host very responsive and friendly and Exquisite taste for the decor of the Airbnb too ! Stay if you can because the Electric Works is across the street and lots of restaurants and bars and shopping and farmers market ! We loved it ! Thank you !
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful space! Clean, modern, comfortable. Highly recommend!!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect place for what we needed in every way‚Ä¶.very close to the concert venue‚Ä¶.plenty of space and super nice‚Ä¶!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous home!‚Ä¶This AIR BNB is full of charm and more than we expected. The hosts were very responsive and helpful. The Electric Works building across the street has a wonderful farm market on Sundays, so we were able to visit and enjoy as well as eat inside the restaurant venue within this location. Love, love, this town! We will most certainly be back to visit."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice place, good location. Good communication."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Always great to stay at Jackie and Alan‚Äôs place. Never disappoints.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely beautiful home in a location that is convenient to everything Fort Wayne has to offer.
Would definitely stay again and highly recommend !"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A quadruple plus ++++! I rented this 2 bedroom, 2 bath apartment to host a few friends from out of town. The apartment was clean with accurate listing pictures and description. The kitchen was awesome and we all loved the open floor plan. I was able to prep and cook with no problem! The enclosed backyard patio was a perk. The location was perfect with Electric Works right across the way and downtown within walking distance. Staying downtown seems to be the better option in Fort Wayne as it is central to the main attractions and all sides of town. We were able to make it to the Immersive Gogh Exhibit at the Coliseum in about 15 minutes by car.
Side notes 1. in agreement with the other reviews, Jacalyn was very timely with responses, and 2. we always tidy up after ourselves but it was refreshing that there was not a laundry list of chores upon checkout.
Should the opportunity arise again, I will definitely reserve Jacalyn's place - AND you should not hesitate to do so!!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jacalyn‚Äôs place was so clean and nice. My family stayed there following a family event and were very comfortable. Her instructions were accurate, and she was responsive leading up to my stay. I didn‚Äôt have to reach out during the stay because everything was on point!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our overnight stay. The apartment was very nice and comfortable. Jacalyn was very responsive and helpful.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved this place! Great location, clean and just as described. I can tell that the hosts really care. A gas grill was just added, didn‚Äôt have the chance to use it, but what a cool amenity with the private patio! The off street, garage parking space was just what we needed. Being next to EW and minutes from downtown, makes this a no brained. The host was very responsive!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jaclyn, was awesome. she got us in last minute was really responsive and was lenient with us as it took us a little bit longer to pack up. the house is absolutely amazing! I had an event next door at the electric building being able to just walk across the street was so great"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jacalyn‚Äôs place was absolutely amazing. I felt right at home and loved the kitchen - had everything I needed to make a delicious dinner. The home and garage were easy to locate and in a peaceful neighborhood. Close to lots of great shopping and restaurants. I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a nicer stay.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,10/10 recommend. It was a everything we were looking for and more. Very relaxing stay üòÅ.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jacalyn was an amazing host! Her place was adorable and she answered all of my questions immediately! Fort Wayne is the cutest town and I highly recommend staying here!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a lovely stay here. So clean, comfortable, and modern. Right across from Electric Works with amazing food and drink options. Quick drive to downtown. It has it all! Would not hesitate to book in the future!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay and wished we could have stayed longer. We were only there overnight to attend a wedding, so no real Ft Wayne recommendations. The host was super responsive and very accommodating. The location of the rental was very close to downtown in an up and coming neighborhood, so not all surrounding houses are up to this standard, but we felt safe and it was very quiet. It was nice to see some of the older/character of the house was kept with the newer remodel/updates. The garage parking in the rear/alley of the house was super helpful. The pictures are accurate and the house was beautiful and very, very clean. Hard to find an older house with 2 full bathrooms, so that was a plus! Plenty of room and very tastefully decorated. Would definitely recommend and would stay there again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This home was so cute! Everything looked brand new. The furniture was comfortable and clean. Jacalyn was quick to reply to messages. This was a great place!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I‚Äôve stayed here before and had such a wonderful experience that I‚Äôve returned and will return. I can‚Äôt say enough good things about the house, location and especially the hosts. They really are committed to making the stay as easy, enjoyable and comfortable as possible. In addition, they are respectful of their guest‚Äôs‚Äô privacy."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was easily one of my favorite rentals yet! The place was exactly as described and absolutely beautiful. Plenty of space for our family of 4, stocked with all the essentials, expertly decorated, AND A GARAGE?? Amazing value! We also enjoyed walking to and shopping at the farmers market on Saturday morning. Plenty of dining, stores, and parks within 10min drive. Jacalyn was great with communicating and quickly worked to resolve the one minor issue we had. Anytime we're in the area, we'll definitely look to book here again. Don't think twice; if it's available, book it!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jacalyn‚Äòs place was comfortable and quiet and well maintained. We enjoyed electric works next-door and the farmers market was icing on the cake!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,super cute place outfitted with everything we needed for our girls weekend!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Oh what a beautiful place! My only regret is not being able to stay longer! Central location, clear instructions, clean, comfortable and high security home. I felt very at ease and safe in the home. Thanks, Jacalyn!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place made me feel at home. Very clean and comfortable. I would stay here whenever coming back to Fort Wayne.
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great simple little place. No problems at all.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Excellent first floor apartment [we could live in a space like this] with all the comforts of home. Comfortable furniture, tastefully curated decor, exposed brick, easy entry, and garage parking. Electric Works Market is next door & we found exceptional local craft ciders [see Logan @ Kekionga for tastes & local history] & one of the most unique pizzas we‚Äôve ever eaten @ Johnny Ox [Elvis & the Green Ox].
After a 20 year absence from the city, it is clear that Fort Wayne has been working on developing an inviting atmosphere for locals and visitors. We enjoyed our explorations, including the most delicious Asian fusion & possibly the best crab rangoon at Nawa at The Landing [shout out to Chan, our server], an art exhibit featuring middle & high school student work at FW Museum of Art [inspiring a never-ending expressive future], and incredibly kind & helpful people along the way. Don‚Äôt miss the gorgeous murals and impressive architecture scattered throughout the city!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay, Jacalyn was a great host!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If you're looking for a feeling of comfort, space, quick access to downtown Ft. Wayne and food, this is it.
The main living area has a beautiful open feel that is perfect for hosting a family or small group of friends. There were 5 of us including our baby and parents. There was plenty of space with elegantly tall ceilings. The master bedroom french doors open all the way to give even more ease in conversation. The kitchen is stocked with all you need. We shopped before we arrived and had everything we needed for our meals.
The bedrooms are stocked with plenty of blankets and cozy decor. There is a comfortable king bed in the master bedroom.
The backyard is spacious and would be very appealing for warm weather.
The garage is available for your vehicle. A nice perk.
It was a quick 4 minute ride to downtown, and 1 minute to several restaurants, including brunch. Electric works! Check it out!
The light!!! If you want to feel energized in the morning, there is a ton of morning light."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place ! The house is just beautiful and peaceful! A great place to come back and rest.
My wife and I felt like home in this house.
Very quiet neighborhood and felt safe at any time. Also, very convenient location to reach almost any area in Fort Wayne.
I will definitely stay again on my next trip in Fort Wayne."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a fantastic find!! Incredible bars, restaurants and shopping nearby! Safe neighborhood and and an absolutely BEAUTIFUL home to live in. This host is SUPER responsive and desires ONKY the best for her AIRBNB‚Äôers! Do NOT Miss out and stay somewhere else‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll Love it here!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home was clean, and quiet, had good amenities (ie silverware/knives), was cozy and the communication was very good. I would stay here again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and walking distance to Electric Works. We loved how close it was to downtown too. We were lucky enough to hit up a hockey game also. Great house!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What an absolute gem of a home and location! Extremely easy to get to. The off street private parking made it comfortable to unload the luggage and kids. The house is literally across the street from Electric Works, which boasts some of the best restaurants, cocktails, and more in the area. We were only there for one night, but walked there a few times. The house is immaculate from design to cleanliness. Our family of 5 had an abundance of room and the layout is absolutely perfect for families with younger kids. Our entire family had one of the best nights of sleep. It‚Äôs absolutely a ‚Äútranquil‚Äù space. We are already looking to book our next stay here, but for more than a night as there‚Äôs so much to enjoy. Jacalyn was incredibly kind, responsive, and accommodating. I‚Äôm not sure how this stay could be any better. Thank you!!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We only stayed here for a one night but we had a great time. Very clean and modern furnishings. Close to a lot of great spots! Host was very helpful and quick to respond.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The space was comfortable, cozy, and immaculate, and much more comfortable than a hotel! If I have any future trips to Fort Wayne I would happily stay here again."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location with all the amenities. We will definitely be back, thanks."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,very nice place
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The pictures are exactly what it looks like. Very clean and comfortable. They even had a Christmas tree to make it feel more festive. Lots of nice touches! I loved that the back yard was fenced in and had a garage. Very nice place and would stay there again for sure!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place is beautifully decorated. The Christmas tree and Christmas decorations made it feel warm and cozy the week before Christmas. It was spotlessly clean. The water pressure in the shower was good. Beds are comfortable. It's larger than the pictures show. The host answered all questions quickly. The area is currently being gentrified. So you will see some houses of questionable standings but don't let that detour you from staying here. We felt very safe. The neighborhood was quiet during out entire stay. We'd definitely stay again.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place and host
,,,"We were extremely disappointed. The home and area were very unkept and we felt unsafe. It was far from a superhost. We could barely get our car down the back alley due to potholes and on top of that we were afraid to leave our car in fear it would be vandalized or the multiple wires from the power lines were going to fall and catch the whole thing on fire! The carpet going up the stairs was gross and the whole place smelled like mold. The air conditioner kicked on during the ten minutes we were there and it sounded like a jet plane. The pictures did not accurately fit the description. We have stayed in many superhost locations and this place was about the farthest from that you could get. We cut our losses and booked a room at a local hotel. This place was a joke. Lipstick on a pig. Let's not forget the neighbors on both sides giving us the stink eye when we arrived. Dangerous location, terrible parking, inaccurate description. Utter disappointment."
