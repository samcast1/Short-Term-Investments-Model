2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Sasha was a great host and her place perfectly matched the description. Her AirBnB is perfectly situated in a peaceful area, just off the main road. My family felt comfortable and safe staying at her place as we made our way north. I would recommend to any traveler."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"The surroundings are beautiful and peaceful. The decor is lovely and comfortable, it made the stay feel at home. If you want to be off the grid this is a great place to go. There is wi- fi, but it's extremely spotty. It dropped so often, I was unable to watch a 30 minute show without interruption. Please don't let this deter you. My stay may have been a bad connection day. It's beautiful, welcoming, serene, and will top your expectations. Don't pass this 'feels like home "" opportunity."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Sarah's place is great! The stairs could be daunting and the bridge out front was a little off putting with a uhaul. But?? We managed. The space was welcoming, the shower nice, and the king bed amazing. KriKet our fur-daughter loved the pet friendly atmosphere!
The surroundings were beautiful and another time we would enjoying spending more time. We were hauling antiques cross country so not a lot of time to dally. We will definitely stay here again. And heartily recommend it to the reader."

It's easy to access the downtown to see the lovely state capital and enjoy a walk through stores like Taylor Books."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"My one night stay couldn’t have been better! I loved Sasha’s place! Plenty of room and all the amenities I needed. I loved the privacy and quiet setting. It also was very clean! Much better than any hotel!
I arrived in the evening and was starving! Thankfully, I ran into Sasha and she told me that DoorDash would deliver to me. After driving all day, it was perfect! I had a nice table to sit at and eat. I enjoyed a movie that evening and slept peacefully.
The unit was clean and very cozy! I felt right at home here. Don’t hesitate to rent it! It’s quite spacious too!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Sasha’s place looked exactly like the pictures and was just as she described. Upon check-in Daniel & Sasha came out to meet me and my boys and dog and apologized for a little mud, which was so kind and courteous to address. The mud was very was minimal, but the fact that they cared enough to apologize for it shows how seriously they take their hospitality. I would recommend Sasha and Daniel’s place to anyone."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The unit matched the description and pictures. It was very clean and quiet. We had a very comfortable stay. It is 5 minutes from downtown, but is in a rural area. We tried using our GPS map app to get to a restaurant, but didn’t get cell service until we got to intersection about 2 miles back into town. Not complaining, just describing how quickly it changed from city to rural!"

2024-02-01,4,Stayed with a pet,We had a good stay! Was a little smaller than it appeared in photos and a little hard to get to with the small bridge. It was muddy outside but Sasha explained that was due to a lot of snow recently.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Sasha was so accommodating when we needed to find a last minute place that would allow us to check in earlier after not being able to extend our hotel stay. We were in the area after my mother in law was transferred to a hospital in the area for life saving surgery. Sasha’s quick response and generously allowing us to check in 3 hours early took a lot of stress out of an already stressful week. The place is so peaceful and only a short 5-10 min drive to downtown Charleston. Highly recommend these hosts, they are truly good people and went above and beyond for a couple of strangers and their dog."

I will warn you that cell phone reception might be non existent (Verizon phone went to SOS) when you get there, so please screenshot the instructions ahead of time. She also gives you a heads up that she has dogs - her German shepherd was outside when I got there, but she is calm and friendly!
It was a cute and comfortable studio space. The couch was very comfy and there are a few emergency snacks in the cupboards - which was a good thing because I neglected to get dinner and ate a microwaved cup of Mac and cheese."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a nice and relaxing two night stay at Sasha’s place. Only a 10 minute drive from downtown Charleston but still very quiet and secluded. The place was spotlessly clean and tastefully decorated, reminiscent of what you would see at a real estate showing.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was the perfect fit for our family's stopover in Charleston. Compared to the hotel options, it was cleaner, way more private and quiet, more decorated and homey, and very affordable. Sasha was great a communicating. And as an Airbnb host myself I feel that she's gone the extra mile and thought of things that many hosts don't (ex: cue tips and tooth floss). Also, our kids really enjoyed the morning greetings they received from a super sweet neighbor dog and cat."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Sasha was great to work with, answering all my questions and making some changes I needed.

2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"I was in Charleston for work and stayed one evening at the Bear-bnb, which is a about 15 minutes outside of town. The setting is peaceful and the place is like a very sweet little studio apartment. Daniel greeted me kindly when I arrived. The space was clean and the bed was very comfy. I would stay there again the next time I'm in town.
Note: If you are sensitive to scented products you'll want to be aware that this space uses an electric fragrance diffuser (not essential oils) and the scent was pretty strong. The towels and linens also held the scent."

I only wish it was available for our return trip home. We will definitely be returning."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The BearBnB was a spotless and comfortable place to spend a night on our way through West Virginia. We appreciated that the place is dog-friendly with a yard for our dogs to sniff around and stretch their legs. The guest house is just off a well-traveled road, so bear ;-) that in mind when letting dogs off-leash, especially if you have a runner like we do! There is some road noise but otherwise our stay was quiet and peaceful."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had an amazing stay. This place was warm and welcoming, in a nice private area. Felt like a real home with all the decor and amenities. Even included a few snacks for us, which was really considerate."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect location for us as we were traveling with our puppy. Amazing location, privacy, close to downtown, clean, and hassle free. Thank you, Sasha!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"So much better than a hotel! I would definitely stay there again! We needed to break up a long drive. It was clean, cozy, and inviting. Loved the stream outside!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If I could give this place 6 stars, I would! I was only here for a couple days with my brother and my dog. It was everything we asked for and more! The view from the porch is absolutely beautiful. Anything you need is within a 15 minute drive. The studio set up was perfect and made me feel right at home. Sasha and Daniel are amazing hosts. We were lucky enough to have puppy play time with one of their pups. All in all, I couldn't have asked for a better experience on my short stay here. I will definitely be back! Thank you, Sasha and Daniel!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Sasha and Daniel were very friendly and responsive. The house was very clean and well worth the price. Everything you needed for a relaxing stay. Will definitely return.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We were looking for an affordable place mid way between Kentucky and VA- found this gem and it didn’t disappoint! The pictures were 100% accurate. The place was clean and roomy w adorable decorations!! This is a great place if you are looking for someplace quiet and off the beaten path!! (But not that far off path- literally minutes from the state capitol!!)
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Sasha was extremely nice and accommodating to my dogs. She was a great host and her place was adorable, very clean, and cozy!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This spot was perfect for our last minute quick trip we had to make. The house was very organized, clean, with an open floor plan. Plenty of food options nearby. Sasha was very nice and very helpful. If we ever come back this way, we would love to stay here again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"My Mother, sister, and I stayed overnight here on the way back to Michigan from Virginia Beach. What an amazing hide-away! Beats a hotel by a mile any day. The hosts were very responsive and kind, even coming to introduce themselves in person once we were all settled. They went out of their way to let us know if we needed ANYTHING they would be able to give us advice and be right there to help out. The deck was incredibly peaceful - listening to the creek and watching birds. The inside was perfectly laid out with plenty of “extra” goodies! We all got a very refreshing nights sleep. We would definitely swing in again. Thank you again for the amazing stay!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was my second time here. It is a nice little space…clean, comfortable, and well equipped with a deck overlooking the lawn and woods, and a stream whose sound is very relaxing. I’ll be back."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a comfortable and quiet stay next to a stream with dogwood blooms and spring flowers minutes from the city of Charleston. Such an enjoyable and comfortable stay that was a short drive from the capitol without the traffic of the larger roads. The space has everything you need and more, I am definitely adding it to my favorites!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is a rare value among bnb’s. It is quiet and homey with a nice deck where you can sit and enjoy the sight and sound of a winding creek. The apartment is cozy, the bed is comfortable and the kitchen has everything you need. The hosts are friendly and responsive. I’m booking it on my way back home."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I contacted Sasha with less than an hours notice for my booking. She responded right away and approved my stay. Such a cute and comfortable loft with a wonderful deck. A creek and nice sized grass area surround the loft which my dogs loved. Great Wi-Fi and tv options as well as coffee, snacks and drinks in the kitchen. I will absolutely stay again when I am in town!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Sasha & her husband were far too kind & very responsive of any questions I had while staying here, comfy & cozy space with a ton of convenient amenities, on top of that a beautiful porch with a awesome view of the creek would definitely stay here Again! 10/10 stars for me!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Conveniently located, all the amenities you could need, clean, and a great stay overall."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is newly renovated and decorated very well. Extremely clean and neat! It has a huge outdoor deck with a propane firepit and wicker furniture - we sat outside in the evenings and it was lovely. Carl was very easy to communicate with, very responsive and very welcoming. Nice little restaurants close by as well, plus easy to get to downtown Charleston. It was great!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Great apt with dog run right behind! Loved our week here
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was a great location for our needs.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,I’ve stayed in this air BNB before and it was a wonderful experience last time. It was just as great this time as well. It’s very clear instructions how to gain access. It’s quiet it’s clean and it is a large space available at a good price. Well worth the price when I’m staying in Charleston.
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,C. Anthony provided us excellent recommendations and was extremely polite! We were in town for a show and we were able to walk to venue! The AirBnB location was awesome!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,The apartment was clean and cozy. The host was accommodating and made sure every detail was perfect. The location was in walking distance to many bars and restaurants. We would gladly stay here again!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed this space
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I loved the view from Anthony's place! The kitchen was super clean and the beds were very comfortable. Anthony was also super flexible about adding another day onto our reservation at the last minute. He also gave great local recommendations. I would hands down stay here again!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We had two couples that stayed in apartment. It was a perfect setup for that. Two beautiful bedrooms and 2 full bathrooms, that were immaculate. We had two separate cars, so at first we thought parking would be a problem. But it wasn’t as Mr. Anthony provided a parking pass to use at a convenient parking establishment across the street. And since on the street parking is free overnight (until 8 am when you have to feed the meters), parking was not an issue for the second vehicle. And since the parking establishment was only $2.50 per day (during our stay, I assume that is subject to change), parking was not an issue. The modern vibe aesthetic of the apartment worked well. And Mr. Anthony kept in touch with us through the airbnb app and made sure we had everything we needed. And when I did contact him with questions (i.e. parking for the second vehicle) he was very responsive and helpful. I highly recommend this site and him as a proprietor."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay here! Good local restaurants and plenty to do within walking distance. The space was clean and easy to find. Would definitely stay again!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,We hab a very nice time and the suite was wonderful. I would highly recommend it.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice space and room for a family of 4. Walkable to shops and restaurants. The bottle of wine was a nice added touch!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location! Anthony is super helpful and responsive. We had a great time!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great host, we only stay for one night so we did not experience the city."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful location for events downtown. We were able to walk to the Clay center and to local restaurants and bars quickly. Great place to stay for Charleston events!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,we had such an enjoyable stay in Charleston. this apartment has huge windows with city views great natural lighting and is comfortably furnished. C Anthony is superb host!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed our stay and would stay there again in the future.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely stay! I'm picky...truly, as an owner/host myself. But this gorgeous space was conveniently located, immaculate, warm and inviting, and very comfortable. C. Anthony is a kind and attentive host who communicated well, so that check-in was without a hitch, and check out was clear and minimal. We would add that the main room, between the sun, the view, and the decor, was such a groovy place to spend an evening. Very grateful guests, we are."

We’ll be returning to the Charleston region in the future and hope to work with C. Anthony again."
2024-02-01,3,Stayed one night,Anthony and his place were nice. Price was advertised at $99/night but additional fees added and extra $137 for a total $236/night. I thought that was incredibly deceiving. No balcony or outside space. Will just stay at Embassy Suites next time.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location downtown, easy parking, beautiful sunrise out the windows and evening city lights"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very responsive and friendly host (2nd time booking with him due to good experience last time). Location very walkable to many Charleston restaurants and stores. It was helpful this unit was pet friendly, and we were pleased to find a small fenced in dog park across the street, which made taking our dog out easy."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Stayed while traveling for work.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,The apartment had a stunning view of the city and was a stones throw away from all the sites downtown. My family and I loved it and I strongly recommend anyone looking to experience Charleston stay here!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The apartment was clean and within a few minutes walk to Capitol Street area. C. Anthony provided thorough instructions, a plethora of local recommendations ranging from restaurants/bars and unique date night ideas. Furthermore, he was very quick to respond to our questions, and was pleasant to interact with. The complimentary bottle of wine that was left for us was a nice surprise that my wife and i appreciated as well. We enjoyed our stay so much so that we requested an additional night, which C. Anthony was quick to accommodate.
Thank you C. Anthony for being a REVIVing part of our stay in Charleston."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay-spacious, clean with great natural lighting and views of the downtown. Loved being within walking distance of local restaurants and lots to do. Also loved that it was across the street from the Basilica of the Co-Cathedral of the Sacred Heart which was so beautiful at Christmas! We highly recommend and would stay there again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location was great, the apartment is quite nice, the bed was very comfortable and the white towels and washcloths were sparkling clean. The city and river view out the southern windows was a delight!"
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"Anthony was an amazing host, the whole process was very easy! He gave a great list of food and things to do, only issue we had was we had asked for a 2nd parking pass and it was not left but he had it to us within 30mins after a fairy late check in so had a great response time. Would definitely recommend if you are looking to stay in Charleston, West Virginia!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The little extras made the place stand out. Will definitely stay again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay at C Anthony’s place! The loft is gorgeous and the views from the windows are stunning. We loved the building the loft is in and the location could not be more convenient—an easy walk to restaurants and stores and to the children’s museum!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were two couples staying and it was the perfect size. The well appointed kitchen made it easy to make dishes to bring to a family thanksgiving dinner nearby. We learned of the Holly Jolly Brawley which we could walk to and that was a pleasant surprise. Our host was responsive and accommodating. The building was quiet and we met pleasant residents. Parking was a breeze. This will definitely be our go to place for any future trips to WV!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wouldn't stay anywhere else but here in Charleston again!
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful place!
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"I can’t say enough amazing about C. Anthony place. He was very responsive, gave very clear and easy instructions, and tons of local recommendations.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were very pleased with our stay.  The apartment has a clean, modern feel.  There are only a few apartments per floor and we never heard any of our neighbors.  The parking across the street is very convenient, and it's an easy walk to Capitol Street or the Kanawha River.  Definitely recommend."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great place in beautiful Charleston. Excellent views, quiet neighbors, location is walkable all around town and river front.

Thank you dear."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a great place to stay for our first trip to Charleston! Our family loved the feel of the loft, and it has a really cool view of the city. We could easily walk from there around downtown. And Anthony is an awesome host—very responsive, clearly communicates, and made us feel at home. Would absolutely recommend!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place in a great location.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice accommodations - but the stand out was all the windows and view of Charleston.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"we absolutely loved this Airbnb. we were able to get early checkin which was great after a long drive. keep in mind the cleaning crew needs time to clean after the last guest so the timing worked out perfectly on our end!
I had user issue w/connecting to the wifi and Anthony was immediately responsive and confirmed information on parking for us.
my grandma and aunt insisted on taking the pullout couch and said it was the most comfortable one they've ever slept on!
My only wish was having a large table bc we are big on playing cars games. If we get to visit next year, we will definitely book again and we plan in bringing our own card tables to make that more feasible :) everything was great! thank you for a wonderful stay"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Our host recommended Hale House and our dinner was very good. Easy to walk to. We had great service.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This apartment was super nice and clean. It would have been really nice to stay here longer if we could have. Aside from that, the host was probably the most professional hosts I've ever rented from and I am an AirBnB host myself. His customer service was way better than mine so I may have to take some notes. You'll get all the info you need along with tons of local recommendations. If you a visiting Charleston, I highly recommend this place!"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Anthony was very helpful during our stay. He provided many recommendations and clear instructions on how to access his place. The view from Anthony’s apartment is beautiful!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’m always skeptical that things look too good to be true but this loft was exactly as advertised. Photos are actual view from the windows. Corner apartment so views in two directions. Lots of windows and natural light! We could see the river, bridge, and even a glimpse of the capital dome. 7th floor apartment with elevator. Others in the building we met were full time residents and very polite and quiet. Waking distance to many restaurants, shops and river walk. Super clean and we were amazed at how well equipped! Thankfully pass was provided for parking lot across the street since I was concerned about parking for my new car. Host sent list of recommendations for restaurants and things to do in the area. Definitely a 5-star rating!"

Beautiful views of the city in a spacious loft with modern amenities and comfortable bedding.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,All good. Parking is in ADM lot so read the signs. Host was great and helpful
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great. The only thing I will suggest is to provide clear checkout instructions prior to the checkout day; just to give guests a little more time to take care of the requests.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful apartment in downtown Charleston within easy walking distance to main shopping district. Lovely view of the river and is near a couple of historic churches with views of their steeples. Easy access to Kanawha Boulevard and the South Side Bridge.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Anthony was amazing host to host he had great communication and very helpful when we needed a little extra assistance with garbage disposal. The trip was 3 nights for some personal family business with my 77 year old dad. It was important to have had a clean comfy space with no steps and easy access this place was well described. The views of the river, churches, downtown buildings etc were wonderful. We even had a fireworks display on Sunday night. The linens, pillows and bedding were all comfortable and clean. We loved this stay and would recommend it. We were able to make breakfasts, enjoy coffee and wine and cheese at night. Capitol street is walking distance and that’s were most things are going on.
We were able to site-see and everything was 2-15 min away. Enjoy 😊"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Fabulous views from this lovely loft in downtown Charleston! An easy walk to all kinds of fun downtown places. C.Anthony was the best host and his recommendations were terrific! Wish we could have stayed longer but we hope to return soon.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an ideal loft if you are visiting the Charleston area and would like a centralized location filled with options for activities. The place was spacious and the location was perfect distance to many downtown restaurants without having the hassle of taking a vehicle somewhere. The best part of working with Anthony is his communication. He offered advice on restaurants and other activities, as well as, communication regarding the loft. If we were to visit Charleston again, I would be coming back! Thanks for everything Anthony!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our second stay here and just as satisfied as we were the first time. Host is exceptionally friendly and quick to communicate!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Anthony's place was fantastic. We were only in Charleston for one night but wished we could have stayed longer.

Restaurants and shopping were within easy walking distance. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. I highly recommend Anthony's loft. It met all of our expectations and more!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Stayed here with two young toddlers, and everyone was comfortable and able to rest well. Super appreciated the included parking. We already have another night here booked!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had the honor of staying in C. Anthony’s beautiful apartment in Charleston. Everything was very clean especially the bedrooms and bathrooms (which are most important to me when sleeping away from home.)
The TV worked great, the beds are comfy, the towels and linens were all clean and smelled great. It was almost as if I was staying at my own place. The Wi-Fi name and password were displayed on a little board in the kitchen which I thought was a nice touch. There was also a parking pass on the countertop for a lot directly across the street from the apartment which was awesome.
I visit Charleston once or twice a year and I know where I’ll be staying from now on!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Exactly like the picture! Located downtown and walkable distance to awesome restaurants
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"WOW!! Charleston is a quaint place & this Airbnb started off our visit on the perfect note!! Incredibly conveniently located for exploring the area by foot or vehicle with terrific parking right across the street, C. Anthony provides a truly spacious, clean & very well appointed space as a home base!
We immediately were impressed by the historic award-winning redeveloped Atlas Building. This 7th floor layout provided beautiful city views & much appreciated natural light with its high ceilings. It's so bright, cheery, comfortable & inviting. C. Anthony's local recommendations were vast & helpful...he truly covers all the bases including a bottle of wine as a welcome relaxation. We value a communicative host always & he is prompt & thorough.
You will feel in the lap of luxury at great value with the beautiful & thoughtful decorating touches. AMAZING through & through!

The property is very clean and well organized (I only had to move 4 or 5 things out of baby reach). The rooms were spacious and tidy. The kitchen is stocked with all the necessities for meal prep/ cooking and a handful of common spices that may be overlooked while traveling. The bedrooms have comfortable beds and plenty of extra linens.
The owner is very responsive and thoughtful. Anthony includes recommendations for exploring the city and insights to great restaurants and bars.
*A recommendation for the property... a pack n play and a portable highchair. As a mom traveling with small kids and everything but the kitchen sink, I am always grateful when I don't have to bring those 2 large items.

His recommendations, unsolicited, about restaurants, bars and other kinds of place you might want to go arrived a few days before we got there. The places from the list we tried were all as he described them. We will be back to Charleston and we hope this place be available."

This place has all the amenities! Shampoo, etc is provided. Lots of comfy towels. Water pressure in shower is great and one of the showers is also a tub for those who love a good soak. The kitchen is fully stocked with gorgeous dishware, pots, pans and spices if you want to stay in and cook.

The location was only a 5 minute walk to nice restaurants and shops, and was quiet and seemed very safe.
Connecting with the host was very easy and he replied almost immediately each time.

Thank you for being such a wonderful host C. Anthony."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great time staying in the loft in Charleston. The location was great and the loft was just as described.

Close to shopping, restaurants and the museum. We didn't have to drive at all during our 4 day stay. We had to change out dates after booking and Anthony was super quick to ok it. He was really quick answer all my questions about parking and the area. The condo was very clean and nicely decorated. There was a ton of nature light and view from the condo was beautiful! He even had wine for our stay! I can not say enough nice things about Anthony and his condo. This will definitely be a trip we will take again and enjoy staying in the condo."

This is probably our favorite Airbnb we’ve ever stayed at, and will definitely be the place that we stay the next time we visit. Thank you again!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"The loft is amazing! Very nice view. We stayed the weekend and the location is 5mins to some really nice resturaunts, the museum and state capitol.

It's in proximity to a lot of eateries which we appreciate because we never cooked. The place is however well stocked with all appliances, cutlery, and spices you need to cook. Beds are big and comfortable and with two bathrooms you don't have to feel cramped with sharing. This place had everything we needed including automosphere, cleanliness, and most importantly an attentive host. Highly recommend this place."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My grandpa passed away a couple months ago, so the family got together in his home state of West VA to spread his ashes and bring him home. Grateful for Angela & Derrick for letting us stay in their home. It’s beautiful, had everything we needed. My mom is obsessed with it. My nieces LOVED the game room downstairs. The neighbors were so nice! Be careful of the raccoons getting in the trash - that was a fun surprise haha, but you are in the mountains so it’s to be expected. There’s a cute little town within walking distance. It was all beautiful."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"House full of character and easy to get to from 77 or 64. Parking is not on site (I think amenities list says there is, but house description explains in more detail that driveway belongs to neighbor and that guests must find on street parking). Kitchen was well stocked with cooking implements and filtered water. Nice pillows and towels, but could do with a couple more bedside tables. Some light from street lamps comes through into bedrooms at night. Really comfortable and relaxing living space. Overall, would be happy to find ourselves there again."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The house and the overall experience was good. Two things didn’t make sense very small beds in each room and no TVs in the rooms upstairs only in one room.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Nice central location. Would most definitely stay again!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay even though we only spent one night. Cozy home with beautiful and tasteful furnishings. we really appreciated it being kid-friendly, with outlet covers and baby gate already in place. The blackout shades & curtains were also well appreciated as parents of small children! I was so pleasantly surprised to find there was an air purifier and a water filter, something we find super important in our daily lives but don't often see in Airbnbs. Also the home has 2 washers and 2 dryers which helped make quick work of our laundry from a long cross country trip! The home was very clean and had everything we needed. We loved the food from Lola's down the street.
One thing to note if staying is that there is no designated parking, only street parking where there is room.
Would highly recommend this charming, clean, and private home!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a great time at Derrick and Angela’s place! The house was clean and met all our expectations. We really liked the location - the house was very close to some great restaurants and a park. It was also a quick drive downtown. We would definitely stay again when visiting family in Charleston!
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,They were great hostesses and the house was beautiful.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for your lovely home.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cute, cozy, and comfortable! We especially enjoyed the games - foosball, table tennis, cornhole - in the basement."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We booked this home very last minute after driving from the solar eclipse in Ohio. The host was very accommodating to our circumstances. The home sits on a beautiful street within walking distance of some cool bars on the hillside. Charleston was much more than we expected. The home was well equipped- child proof- and had plenty of space for our family to spread out after the long car ride. Everything was spotless. While the house has been recently painted and updated in some ways- it still has the charm of a home from the 30’s. Awesome place to visit and very reasonably priced.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great overnight here between Ohio and Virginia! It was great to have so many bedroom options for the kids. My son loved the big soccer ball downstairs and my husband and I played some ping pong and foosball. :) everything was clean and comfortable and there are plenty of little touches to show they’ve thought through people that will be staying there. Would totally stay here again!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Super cute house! Very clean and comfortable. Thanks for a great stay!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is adorable and absolutely charming. The bed linens were divine and luxurious. My teenage boys loved the ping pong table and foosball. The only negative was that we are all light sleepers which is entirely our own issue. The two larger beds creak a little when moving around in the bed which made for a less restful sleep. If you like to sleep in a darkened room, bring sleep masks as the curtains don't darken all that much, but there is certainly privacy. The room with the twin beds was perfectly dark and quiet in the back of the house for kiddos to get quality sleep. Access to the front door requires steep steps up to the house, which was fine for us. The house was very clean, perfectly stocked with a variety of pillows, blankets and all amenities. The street was very quiet and we found it easy to navigate around from the location. We will certainly stay here again when in Charleston."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,enjoyed our stay at the house with our family. thank you!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cozy little cottage that is very clean and so inviting! A great option for a family with a few kids who are looking for a house as an alternative to a hotel room. We were especially thankful for the extra comfy beds! Thanks Derrick and Angela.

2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Easy and convenient! great host!
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"This house has been professionally renovated and is very comfortable. One down side is all the steps up to get to the house and then more steps up to get to the bedrooms. There was a game room in the basement but it smelled moldy. Thank you, Derrick and Angela, for sharing your uniquely restored classic with us. We enjoyed all the antiques and modern conveniences. It was definitely one of the best places we have rented. We had trouble getting inside due to the key code being in a message on the airbnb site rather than in an email or text. Although we had spotty cell service at the house we eventually found a hot spot and connected to the site. So if you plan to visit you need to check your messages when you have good internet or you may have trouble connecting with the owners."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Will be back
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay, very clean, great hosts!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Derrick and Angela’s home is better and nicer than the pictures portray.
We were so comfortable, we had everything we needed and more. My two teen boys loved the fuse ball and ping pong tables downstairs.
We would definitely stay here again if we were in Charleston.
Thank you for making your home so pleasant!"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,We loved how beautiful the inside of the home was! We felt right at home! Easy check in and check out. Price was great for our family. We felt we each had our own space rather than being in a hotel room together. It worked out perfectly!
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Cozy home. Enjoyed our stay!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came to Charleston to visit a dear friend. Our stay at this home was just perfect. It was impeccably clean, with comfortable beds/rooms, great kitchen (though we did not do a huge amount of cooking), and lovely décor. Our host was very responsive and considerate. We were notified about the house being ready before check-in time; I had a concern about an item that I thought I had left behind, and our host responded in helpful manner right away. We were delighted to discover how close we were to a very quaint shopping and eatery district. We were able to walk to dinner one evening. It was easy to access the main highway to travel into the Capitol. We would most definitely stay here again!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is by far the best Airbnb that I’ve stayed in in West Virginia. Great hosts from the dialogue to the location to the home 🏠 . Everything about it was fantastic. Including the small town of South Hills. Derrick &Angela have done a fine job in providing a home away from home. I couldn’t have asked for more. I highly recommend this place. Will be a repeat for me again, thank you. Steve Workman"
2024-01-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Nice place to stay! The parking was kind of a problem but we managed.
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"This was a beautiful home with flexible, responsive hosts. They had a book with restaurants and recommendations for things to do. They even listed their favorite and they were right about the restaurant! I’m looking forward to my next trip to West Virginia and will definitely book with Derrick and Angela again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Me, my partner & brother & sister in law traveled south from the eastern panhandle for a public event we were hosting. Our experience staying at Derrick and Angela’s was 10/10 in every way, and exactly the comfort & coziness we were hoping for after lots of traveling & planning & hustle & bustle. Their expectations were clear, and communication was friendly & quick response. Beautiful, flawless space in every way- we all instantly felt right at home. Would’ve loved to cook a meal in the full kitchen & enjoy the inside spaces more if we had more time. After a flawless event with literal hopes & dreams fulfilled, we all slept like babies. Thanks, Derrick & Angela!!"
2023-12-01,3,Stayed with kids,"The house was nice and accurate but the neighborhood was advertised as family friendly but was not. Because there was no smoking on the premises and no parking in the driveway I had to go across the street to my van to smoke a cigar and almost got hit multiple times while trying to cross the road from people doing triple the speed limit, I had someone almost hit my car while parking twice. And we didn’t feel safe standing outside because twice we had someone who was either mentally unwell or on drugs who was walking up and down the street acting crazy and loudly yelling to themselves I even recorded it to report to local PD. There was 2 houses that had people screaming & fighting at all hours. The house was clean on surface level but the dusk was so bad my kids had to take allergy medicine and we found several random things hidden behind stuff including a poop smear on the back of the toilet and 4 hidden packs of smokes & lighters around luckily we found before my toddler did"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a wonderful Airbnb experience for us in every way. The home was clean and pretty, and with every additional day we felt more and more at home. We would happily stay here again."

They had a highchair ready to go for us, books for the kids to look at, and plenty of space for us to relax and enjoy our stay. The beds where super comfortable, the neighborhood was incredibly quiet and safe. You are walking distance to some of the best restaurants in the area with sidewalk access. The house was squeaky clean and had plenty of seating in the living room. We would stay here again next time we come to visit!"

The neighbor dog did bark while we were walking up to the front door, but once we were inside we couldn't hear the dog, which was nice. There were lots of comfortable spaces in the house. The patio and backyard were cute, and would be a nice space to do a fire pit."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The house was exactly what I was expecting from the photos online. We had very comfortable beds and everyone had enough space to do what they needed. I’m sorry I’ll have to return to my own shower tomorrow without that incredible water pressure.
The ability to walk to get meals and cook at home on the other occasions was exactly our speed. The carriage trail was gorgeous first thing in the morning and taking walks through the neighborhood day or night felt safe. The only regret is that we didn’t make it to get Gelato. I guess we will have to return soon!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Cute house on a quiet street. Very clean and did not have a “musty” smell I often run into with older homes. House was equipped with everything you could need and the basement has lots of fun amenities. Would definitely stay again when visiting Charleston.

It was the perfect home for my family and I to rest for the night while traveling through Charleston. There is an excellent little pizza restaurant (Lola’s) within a very short walk, and just a short walk from there, a cute gelato shop for dessert. I would not hesitate to stay here again if traveling through."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great spot for a quick stay! Really close to a. Few restaurants and shops and a short drive to downtown. Only complaint was the water drainage in the shower was a bit slow, but other than that the house was great. Exactly what we needed!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was perfect for 3 adults, 2 pre teens and a infant. After spending 5 hours each day at a soccer tournament the games down stairs was great entertainment for the kids and gave them their own space. And on the top floor the baby could be away from noise for a good nights sleep. I’ve stayed in a few Airbnb and this had the best stocked kitchen for cooking and I was so excited to find shampoo, conditioner and body wash in the shower till I could make it to the store. Can’t wait to stay again when I come back to wv in 3 weeks."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Place was as described, which is always appreciated! Very cozy home. Derrick & Angela's Airbnbs are top shelf."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really nice place, would come back when working in area again"
2023-05-01,3,Stayed one night,"The home itself was charming and clean. It was difficult getting to the home because of winding, narrow roads and hills. It was actually dangerous, climbing the front stairs, leading to the home with luggage for older people could be very dangerous."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay in South Hills. I loved the neighborhood.
The house was comfortable and clean and I liked that we could walk too many of the best restaurants!
The hosts were very warm Friendly people. I booked at the last minute and was blessed to find this place. We would absolutely come again and highly recommended this home to fellow travelers!
Thank you for the great stay Derrick & Angela! Best wishes to your family and for your continued success with the AirBnb!
Warm regards,
Deirdre, Jesse & Therese"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed at Derek and Angela‘s home on the way to Myrtle Beach for one night and on our way back home a second night.
Their home and neighbors are amazing. However, our first night we found very difficult, because we are not used to the hills and winding roads in West Virginia. On the way back for the second night we were able to find an easier route to get to the house. I would suggest to anyone not used to driving on those types of roads not to use the directions from the highway but from the city centre."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,What a wonderful place to stay in Charleston! We felt right at home in this cozy house and it was close to everything we wanted to see and do. Derrick & Angela’s place was exactly as described and pictured. Thank you!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We were in Charleston for a stand up comedy show and stayed here with our family. The home is absolutely lovely, even more so than we anticipated. We felt right at home upon entering. We used the kitchen to cook brunch and ate together at the spacious dining room table. We also enjoyed playing ping on in the basement. If you need to get to downtown, it’s extremely close by and easy to access (I would say about 10 minutes by car). It was easy for us to get to the show on Saturday night, and also easy for us to grab take out near the house if we wanted to. We even ordered doordash one night. I would highly recommend staying here! We will certainly be back the next time we’re in Charleston!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place!!! We’ve stayed in a lot of AirBnbs and this one was one of the nicest and cleanest, especially for being an older home. Inside was immaculate. Nice decor. Comfortable beds. Great water pressure. Etc etc. Definitely recommend this place!!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved this place! My husband and I traveled with our two-year old and felt right at home. The house was spotless and cozy, and was bigger than it looked in the pictures. We loved the gas fireplace in the evenings, and it was nice that coffee pods, creamer and sugar were on hand so we didn't have to rummage about in the morning. Super comfy beds. The blackout shades in the primary + kids bedrooms were really, really helpful too, since we arrived right at kiddos bedtime. We'll be back!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed this house so much!! I have business in Charleston and hope to rent again in the future! W really enjoyed the close restaurants and the walk/run down into town and back. Derrick and Angela were terrific hosts!!

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was clean & very well kept. It had an old time feel to it, but it was maintained and had plenty to give with the bedrooms and activities in the basement. The check-in & check-out process was almost too easy! I would recommend the location to anyone looking to visit Charleston!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful experience, everyone enjoyed themselves and the house was very nice and cozy !! Would highly recommend staying here!!! We just are not used to having neighbors so close as we live on a 12 acre property with no neighbors in sight , but other than us having neighbors while staying there, it was a great experience, time and place !! We took the kids to the museum and ordered food delivered right to the door !!! We all enjoyed our stay !! Derrick and Angela were great with answering our questions and making it an enjoyable and easy experience!!!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place. Clean, cozy, and just what we needed. The only con was parking. It was just tricky. We didn’t have any issues until the very last night. But it was as described so we knew ahead of time what to expect! Would stay here again!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything was great! The place was very clean and comfortable. The only issue was that we got there late at night which meant there was no parking close to the house and we had to park down at the end of the street (because there is only parking on the street opposite the house) and walk up but that wasn’t a big problem. We would stay there again.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We are from Charleston and now live in San Diego. We needed to have an AirBnb due to all the family in town. This place was great!

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed staying here with our four kids for a night. They were each able to get their own bed (which was nice). The basement was also a lot of fun for them (especially the exercise ball!). We would totally stay here again when passing through West Virginia.

It’s very clean, has all the amenities you need, very easy to check in and out and just an overall positive experience. The beds we’re comfortable, plenty of blankets, pillows, towels, cook ware, etc. The neighborhood was very quiet and just less than half a mile away are a few restaurants and a market store. Lastly the allow pets and you would never tell others have been in the home. Very clean and appreciate that the do allow pets :)"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The description of this property is right on. This is a great place to use as base camp while in Charleston. We really appreciated the host’s communication and ability to accommodate a few last minute surprises from us.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was awesome! We love houses with wood floors so this one was a treat. It was very clean and well supplied. The bed sheets were 100% cotton and to die for – way better than synthetic, cheap stuff. The communication with the hosts was good and we just did not need anything as everything needed was supplied. We would 100% come back to this house if coming through the area again. As a matter of fact I tried to book it some days later and it was booked out."

2022-08-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful home & very nicely designed/decorated which made the visit that much better. Good location walkable to cute shops and restaurants on bridge street. Loved staying there for a weekend visit to my home state.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely and cozy space! It’s not the easiest to access if you have a lot of luggage or children (due to the steep driveway). But if that doesn’t matter to you, it’s a perfect setup for a comfortable and clean stay."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The house was very clean and cozy! It was a nice place to rest after a long drive. Thank you again.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything is better than you expected. The house is spectacular with everything you need and more to have an unforgettable stay. Thanks Angela and Derrick for let us stay at your wonderful home.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Super pleased with the house. We all felt right at home. Very cozy and clean and everything you need. I would live here as my own house if that tells you how comfortable it was! Lots of games, books, tvs, beautiful yard."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved this house. Right near everything in Charleston, right off of 77. Beautiful house. The basement game room was a hit."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our visit to Charleston. This house was centrally located to great restaurants, grocery stores and activities in the area. The check in/check out was easy and the house was beautifully decorated and VERY neat and clean. If steps are difficult for you this might not work out. But otherwise it’s a perfect stay for individuals or families."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This house is absolutely amazing! It is even better than the pictures show and spotless! The beds are very comfortable and no noise to disturb you at all. Derrick and Angela are fantastic hosts and very accommodating. We will definitely be back!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super charming and comfortable spot to enjoy Charleston. Close to downtown and within walking distance of restaurants and shops. We all really enjoyed our stay here and would highly recommend.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful Hosts! House is very clean. Check-in was a breeze! Neighbors were nice and polite (they even waved in the mornings). Had a highchair and they even remembered baby spoons which made my life so much easier.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"wonderful home, very clean, lots of room for our family to spread out. it's perfect"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The pictures and listing are accurate. The only bathroom is upstairs. Street parking only. The railing upstairs was pretty low for rambunctious children. The necessities were provided (i.e. laundry detergent, soap, olive oil, etc...). That was very thoughtful. Overall, we had a wonderful stay and would love to stay there again!"
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful spacious home. Game room in basement is awesome. Great safe location.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a lovely home in a charming area. Easy to walk to restaurants in South Hills as well downtown Charleston. Would definitely return for another stay in Charleston!

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Derrick and Angela’s place was the perfect spot for exploring all over the region. We had long days out and it was nice to come back and crash in a comfortable place. It was SUPER clean, beautifully decorated, and the location in the cute little Bridge Road neighborhood was perfect. You can walk to Walgreens, Lola’s pizza, Caffe Romeo (gelato!) and Bridge Road Deli (excellent award winning hummus amongst other things! ) within minutes. If you’re visiting WV for the first time , be sure to explore beyond Charleston for all that our state has to offer!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Highly recommend!! Plenty of games and plenty of space for the whole family.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Older home, but beautifully kept. Very clean, and loved that the location was close to a cafe (Caffe Romeo, best in Charleston).
The hosts were very responsive upon arrival when we had a question, and we didn’t experience any issues during our stay. Just be aware the parking can be tight, it’s street-only and there was a car parked directly across and we had to squeeze in enough not to block the driveway on the opposite side."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great one-night stay! Everything was as expected and the host communications were prompt and easy.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful weekend in this comfortable welcoming home. The house was clean, and had everything we needed. The hosts communications was easy to follow, timely and very clear. We will defiitely stay here again if possible."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect location and home. It had everything we needed and more. We cooked dinner every week night and had all the comforts of home. Pots, pans, frying pans, juicer, potato peeler, electric kettle and more! We only slept in one bed and it was super comfy. The bathroom was perfect for what we needed. The neighbors were super nice and the parking was never an issue. Can't say anything negative about this place. My only warning would be there are stairs to the house, to the bedroom and bathroom and to the basement. If you can handle that you will love this place!!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This house is perfect! The host were communicative and the house is everything you expect from the listing. It is in a great location and provides a perfect place to stay in Charleston. If it’s available, you have to book it!"

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house has lots of room and is really cozy! The living room is great to hang out in during the evening. The place was super clean, the beds were comfortable, and the kitchen was well stocked. It's an excellent location in Charleston because you're close to anything in south hills and downtown with lots of choices for food."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Exceptional location and very clean and comfortable. Perfect for a weekend and much better value than a hotel.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great people to deal with.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Once again we had a wonderful stay. The house is so well appointed, kitchen in particular being very well equipped with wonderful sharp knives - a cook's dream. Angela and Derrick are great hosts and at the end of the phone if help needed. We will be back!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Immaculate home with wonderful character & charm with updated comforts incorporated in. Great amenities, hosts thought of everything. Would def like to stay here again when in town. Hosts were great to deal with!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed our stay. This was a great first experience using Airbnb. The location was perfect. The house was in great shape and the kids enjoyed the ping pong table.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful, well decorated and just comfortable home. We felt right at home and loved just hanging out there. The beds and bedding were awesome. Me and my girlfriends had any awesome time on our Girls Trip!!!"

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great, cozy home! We had a great stay. Thanks Derrick and Angela."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, spacious house in a great location. We were visiting my grandparents who live nearby, and in the past we've stayed in a hotel downtown. We much prefer this place to a hotel; it was very affordable and had plenty of room for us. We were sad that we ended up having to leave a day early because of a snowstorm, but we hope to book another stay in the future so we can have more time to enjoy the home and its surroundings."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. We say here often and will stay again
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This home had absolutely everything and more than we needed. Beds and furniture were comfortable. Home was exceptionally clean. You needn’t bring anything but food clothing and toiletries. The basement area was fabulous for my grandbabies. We picked this home to be centrally located for my sons memorial service and this home afforded us so much comfort during our grief. I did miss read and thought there was more than one bathroom which is upstairs but we made it work. I seen one reviewer say the home was cold. We did not have this issue. We were there during a snowstorm and 18° weather and had to turn the thermostat down to 67 at night as it stayed quite warm upstairs. There were a lot of steps going up to the home and very limited parking but it is well worth that small inconvenience. This will be our go to home any time we have to travel back to WV. Thank you for making it so inviting and comfortable.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay! The house was very clean and had all we needed to enjoy our time in Charleston. Angela was very quick to respond when I had a question, and we appreciated her promptness. I would definitely stay with them again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved our stay at Derrick and Angela’s. The house was great and the baby gate for the stairs was an added bonus. Very cool house, super clean, and overall great experience. Will definitely be looking this place up on our annual trip next year."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,We were pleased with your house. It exceeded your expectations. We had a good time on your porch. Thanks.
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"We loved staying here, it was very comfortable and we felt at home. Thank you for sharing your home with us. It was perfectly situated for our bike racing needs! Thank you"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"we love the house, so gorgeous, wonderful view and interior is so classic, feel like home. we will recommend and come back"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was such a great AirBnB! The place was spotless, and had everything we needed. It also felt spacious while being equally cozy. Our entirely family loved the place and felt right at home. It was also a great location to be a short drive to everything we needed for our stay in Charleston. Will definitely consider booking again next time we visit!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely spot, great hosts."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"They were very accommodating, flexible and always quick to respond to my messages. Amazing people to deal with. The house is beautiful and a nice quiet neighborhood. The driveway is steep, but plenty of parking. I would highly recommend staying there as I loved this old Home."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Wow what a beautiful House! From the decorations, amenities (all your needs provided), we went as a group of 10 ladies for a church conference and all beds were prepared for us! Also it was so clean! If you’re thinking about staying here do it!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"great place, beautiful home, safe neighborhood."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Derrick and Angela’s place was so cute. Right at the top of a hill with a nice view and plenty of space inside. Would definitely stay again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful place to stay. Quiet location with nice view from front porch. Plenty of space and extremely clean with lots of extra amenities for cooking, storing food, and utensils. Highly recommended place to stay if looking for home in Charleston."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great home and a great location! The beds were very comfortable, and the area was very quiet so we all had a good night’s sleep. The house was clean, neat, tidy, and just as pictured.
Instructions for finding the home and parking there were extremely helpful and accurate.
Communication with Angela was easy and friendly from start to finish. We’d definitely stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Derrik and Angela's 1920""s brick colonial was like visiting in the home of a relative. My 7 year old grandson called it a ""cozy house."" We couldn't have been more pleased. The decor and furniture was upscale and lovely. There are so many thoughtful touches: tissues in every room, loads of bath and kitchen towels, dishes and furniture for a baby, games and cards for all ages, super well-equipped kitchen, nice appliances etc. We were thrilled that the renovations done were appropriate for a 100 year old house. Also, it was very clean....The hosts were very attentive letting us know when there were tornado warnings in the area and helping us get on the internet when we were having difficulties....Our plans for visiting Charleston were somewhat derailed when our grandchildren became ill, but we appreciated a comfortable place to weather their coughs and fevers and to be together as a family. We would not hesitate renting this house again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home! Thank you!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,The home is older (1920’s I think?) but it has been meticulously cared for and updated perfectly without compromising its charm and historic integrity. It’s also squeaky clean!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wow- this might win an award for the best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in. What a beautiful home! We absolutely loved everything about it. Parking directions were easy; that was the only thing I was wary of and wish I hadn’t spent any time worrying about- piece of cake. Book here and have a cup of coffee on the porch overlooking Charleston!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Love older homes!.. Lovely place!!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Fantastic host and property!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Awesome place to stay!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was perfect for our group. We enjoyed our stay!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay! I thought I had booked three nights, and I only booked two owner was very kind and gracious, and allowed us time to leave. Our family is going through so much right now as we are in the process of adopting. so my brain isn’t quite what it normally is. ￼
The house was beautiful, and perfect for children and my teens . it was in a great location.."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very clean well took care of older house that was updated nicely. It was exactly what we needed
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,definitely revist again
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Derrick and Angela's home was amazing. Clean, well appointed, more than just basic amenities, and so comfortable. A prefect home for families, with so many thoughtful touches for families with little ones. My kiddos are older, but as a parent, I appreciated the thoughtfulness. Perfectly situated just outside downtown Charleston, but walking distance to some great restaurants (try Lola's for pizza, so good!)
I would 110% recommend this home and would come back!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Everything was great
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying in Derrick & Angela’s home, and everything was just as good as it was last time! The house is comfortable, spacious, and clean. The hosts were responsive communicators and even tracked down some items I’d left in the house. A great place to stay!"
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,My family loved the place. It worked out well.
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,house was clean and convenient location close to highway. also walkable to and from downtown area but it is a bit steep so not for faint of heart.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"love the view, and great steal for stating the night"
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"The house was in a great location, close to downtown, walkable neighborhood with a carriage trail down to the river. Neighbors were friendly while out walking.
The house was old with many charming features. It was very clean, and many homey touches. Everything you needed was there. It is spacious, we had 8 adults and didn’t feel crowded.
Highly recommend, and would love to go back and see Charleston in the summer time."
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Nice place to stay I will come back
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful home and perfect location. Will stay again.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I can’t say enough good things about this place. Clean, beautiful, spacious, close to town, and incredibly well-stocked—better than any Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in. Our hosts thought of everything. I would move here if I could. :)"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is the 3rd of Derrick and Angela’s places we have stayed in always wonderful! The parking is a bit of a challenge but that is The South Hills area! Will stay again!
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Great house would stay again very nice people
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice place for families. They had everything you could possibly need for a family with small children. The place was also very clean. My whole family enjoyed the stay.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,The accommodation was perfect and hosts extremely responsive and helpful. Would definitely recommend or stay again ☺️
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was great and our overnight stay went off without any problems. Cute house!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Fantastic place! Really appreciated how close it was to Charleston but felt removed and in its own quiet area. Beautiful house perfect for our little family reunion. Derrick and Angela were really quick to respond and flexible. Would definitely stay again!
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"This house was great. I've stayed at maybe 15 air bnb's in my time and this one by far wins the best for a well stocked kitchen. And by that I mean utensils and such, not food obviously. They had a lime juicer! They have an electric water kettle, a Keurig, and a stand alone coffee maker (but you need to buy the grinds). Best of all they had plenty of cloth kitchen towels. Can't tell you how many places I stay with no towels to put on the counter for a dish I may clean by hand (even though there is a dishwasher, some things have to be washed by hand). At many other places I end up with only paper towels. But these guys have everything I have at home! Also, have you ever stayed at an airbnb where you get charged a large cleaning fee but the list of things you have to do/clean yourself before you check out is extensive and you feel ripped off? I was so pleased Derrick and Angela didn't do me that way. Their before check out policies are simple, reasonable and minimal. Great stay."
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"This is a beautiful, spacious house in a convenient location. We especially loved the front porch and the big dining area. The house was clean and decorated nicely. The beds were great, probably the best I've slept on in an AirBnB! My teenager liked sleeping on the daybed in the downstairs rec room. Three minor notes to know: 1) the driveway can be hard to maneuver if you have a large vehicle, 2) there is only one shared bathroom upstairs, and 3) the front bedroom gets bright in the morning. That said, this house is a very nice place to stay. There are great hiking trails about 20 minutes away (Kanawha State Forest) and it's convenient to downtown Charleston. We walked into downtown one day across the bridge and it was fun for all the members of our family. We would love to come back again!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Nice place and great time.
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,We will definitely rent this location again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a beautiful home. We enjoyed the stay. We came in for my grandmother’s funeral. It was nice to come back to a nice home away from home feel. I felt right at home.
Thank you so much for allowing us the pleasure!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to reconnect with family. Lots of great gathering spaces in the home. The kitchen was good working space. We loved both the living room and dining room. We did giggle a lot about the creaky floors since we all grew up in homes with them!
We made lots of great memories in this home
The front porch is such a bonus!
My only word of advice is be careful backing into the driveway in the dark bc there is a drop off on the driver’s side if you are backing up."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,A lovely home in a peaceful neighborhood with extremely comfortable beds! Highly recommend!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This might be my favorite Airbnb that I've stayed in. I felt like I was in a home and not a hotel (which is what I believe AirBnb is supposed to be) and I felt at home. The house is beautiful and the comfortable and had everything I could think of to need. The porch was great with a table for sitting outside and a grill. The neighborhood was nice and felt safe - I went for a walk in the evening after dark and felt perfectly safe. There are shops and restaurants very close by and the whole area was lovely. I hope I have the chance to return, and I wish I was able to stay longer."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful place! Would recommend to others and would definitely stay there again!
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful place
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was very clean when we arrived. It had everything we needed for a comfortable stay, especially with having small kids with us. We'd driven for 12 hours and got in late, and a pack and play was already set up for us. They're extremely accommodating, and the house is well stocked with whatever is needed. It's located in a cute, peaceful neighborhood, and it has a very ""like your own home"" feel to it."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house had everything you need on a trip. We enjoyed Lola’s pizza and the local bakery. We would definitely stay here again if in the area.
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"We loved, loved, loved our visit. The 7 of us ladies, having met as freshman in college 34 years ago, couldn't have asked for a better house. It was nicely located and walkable to a cute little town and a nice walking path into a park we found.
The house was a lovely older home, but spotless and quaint. We worried about 2 bathrooms, but need not have since they were full baths. The kitchen table was extra big for us all and the porch was amazing. Quiet and natural! We were able to relax, enjoy and catch up. We even trekked into the adorable little town for dinner one night. Lola's was outstanding.
Linens were fresh, beds were comfortable and there was plenty of room for us! We will be back - since it was the perfect distance as a middle ground for all 7 of us!
Amazing!!"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,The home was absolutely beautiful! We’ll definitely be back!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I have stayed at one of their other properties , they’re great people. We loved staying at this house; the location, size of the home, walking to shops and restaurants. The house has everything you need for preparing meals, it felt like “home”.
It was a peaceful place to spend our week to relax and visit with family in the area."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,We had a lovely stay in Charleston at Derrick and Angela’s. They provided very clear instructions to find the place and check in was easy. The house is beautiful and very clean and the kids really enjoyed the use of the playroom downstairs. Thanks for a lovely stay.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super clean, great AC, and comfy bed. 10/10 recommend"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great house to stay in. The driveway was a little difficult to find but that was mostly because we go there late and it was dark. They house was great and so cute! We wouldn’t mind staying again if we ever have to stay in Charleston again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,If your traveling with littles this house was great. We visited the house traveling with a 2 and 5 year old. Their were toys for the little and baby gates available. The room with the day bed or “bonus” room worked great for us as we could have our little in the same room as us. We also utilized the toddler bed which worked out great for our youngest. We traveled with ages 2 to 75 and everyone enjoyed the house from the kitchen to the bathrooms there was not one complaint from anyone in our party.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Great space for me and my bridesmaids to get ready at before the wedding! It was very homey and comfortable. Parking was tight, but we made it work. Using the garage was very helpful."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Was a wonderful home for a week! They thought of everything. A little difficult to park but everything else was great!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,My wife and I loved our stay. The house is beautiful. We wish we could live there. I hated leaving. It was our first time in Charleston and we enjoyed it very much. Such a pretty town. We hope to be back soon and stay in this house again.

2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"We only stayed one night, but the place was great. Beautifully remodeled home which was spotless. Lots of nice touches like coffees and teas to choose from as well as soaps, shampoos, lotions, etc. Parking is a little tricky but the directions were perfect. The hosts were very proactive and responsive to messages. Absolutely loved the ping pong table! We didn't have a lot of downtime, but it was all spend playing ping pong. Would certainly stay again if in the area."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,My family stayed one night in Charleston on our way through West Virginia and it was very conveniently located and clean. The home was also decorated in a very modern and uncluttered style. My kids set up cornhole boards in the driveway and played for a while.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very responsive!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Derrick and Angela's place is located in beautiful spot minutes across the river from downtown Charleston. The house is spacious and looks as described with amenities and supplies. We enjoyed the ping pong table downstairs too. We had a great time.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,A fantastic stay! We made a quick stop here in the middle of a 16-hour road trip and it was a cozy abode for our crew. We enjoyed the short walk to Lola’s to grab pizza and a beer to stretch our legs and then back to the house for some relaxation. Highly recommend!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I chose this house because I am from Charleston and I knew that the house was in an excellent, safe area and close to everything. The house was lovely...extremely clean, well furnished, and was just perfect for my family that was gathering in Charleston from all different places. Angela and Derrick spelled everything out perfectly, from what to expect from them to what they expect from folks that are in their home. We loved staying there and highly recommend. We will be back. Thanks so much to Angela and Derrick!"

Aside from slightly confusing area roads (the directions were clear but my GPS was often a few seconds behind) everything was better than expected. It was perfect for our needs.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved the house!! It has all the beautiful charm of an older home but with the modern updates in the right places.

2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"Derrick and Angela's 1920s house was a gem. It is a charming historic home, with all the right updates and beautifully decorated. The kitchen was well stocked, the beds were comfortable, the living room and game room were spacious. The amenities included everything we needed. The location on a hill just above the city was perfect for a peaceful stay while providing quick and easy driving access to the downtown area. We enjoyed walking around the safe neighborhood and checking out other historic homes nearby. Derrick and Angela were also great at communicating with us and were very flexible. Next time we need a house in Charleston, we're definitely choosing this one."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place and stay! Only complaint was creaky floors (which made walking around after our kids were asleep feel like mission impossible, lol)."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Exceptionally clean, with gracious and accommodating hosts. This place is a gem, and although our stay was short, it was memorable, in a very good way. We were two families, with a total group size of 8 people, including 4 teenagers. The house accommodated all of us very well, and we all very much enjoyed our stay. The kids have decided already that apparently we need to buy a house just like this, and make our new home in Charleston!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a great home for our weekend meet up with my college roommate and her family. There is ample room, the sleeping situations are varied and described accurately on the listing, and the house has every amenity you could need. Saturday morning we wished we had remembered a crock pot so we didn’t have to cook after our day out, and just a few minutes later found one in a cabinet we hadn’t explored. They have really thought of everything! Parking is a bit tight but we had plenty room for three vehicles and the hosts were great to forewarn and send tips. HIGHLY recommend this home!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"My husband and I stayed a month in this wonderful home. The kitchen was fully stocked with everything needed for an early Thanksgiving meal with the local family. The house itself is charming with original wood floors and (non working) marble fireplaces. The bathrooms are updated and well stocked. We enjoyed walking to restaurants such as Lola’s for pizza and 1010 for upscale dining. Walgreens and a bakery rounded out our shopping needs within walking distance. If you like hiking, Kanawha State Forest is only 10 miles away. New River Gorge National Park and Hawks Nest is little over an hour away. Go Route 60 for the full experience. Parking in the back is manageable if you are comfortable parking in tight spaces. We have a full size SUV and it was only challenging when the neighbor parked their truck in the back. When we return for a long term visit ( which we do frequently), we will book again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Best couch of our whole (multi-location) vacation! Also best dining table - it fit all 8 of us. The kitchen is well stocked. Derrick and Angela gave very detailed information about check-in - so helpful! Thank you!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Her place is fantastic 🥰. She has thought of absolutely everything!!!!!! From snacks to shampoo to make up remover.

Her house is located in a quiet area. You may hear the occasional train but that was not disturbing for us.
The house was very neat when we arrived, there was a bowl with all kinds of nice ready and some water in the fridge. She also had an extra heater on because it was cold. And just to be sure, beddings for the sofa-bed.

The place was in the center of Charleston, with excellent access to cafes and shops. The place was more spacious than I expected, we only had two people here but the unit could’ve easily fit four. Everything was spotless upon arrival and the host, Dean, quite literally thought of everything when setting up the apartment. He left a nice basket full of goodies when we arrived, as well as shampoo/conditioner/body wash/bath bombs for the huge bath, laundry detergent, and even left little things like a bowl of candy (which you normally wouldn’t expect when arriving at an Airbnb). He welcomed us with open arms and really went above and beyond to make the Airbnb feel like home. The last day I was unable to get a ride to the airport, and Dean stepped in to offer and help me. I would 100% recommend this place if you’re visiting Charleston, I know I’ll be back!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Dean was such an amazing and friendly host. At one point the wifi stopped working and right away he worked to fix it. He even drove me in his car to town when I needed to pick something up. He was super responsive and flexible. I would 10/10 stay here again. I wish all my Airbnb hosts were as kind as Dean!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"2nd time staying at Dean’s loft!
I highly recommend this loft for your stay in Charleston. The unit is large and beautiful. The location is perfect. I walked everyday, on the River and around historic Capital Street.
Dean and Melody available to answer any questions. Lovely visit !"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in Charleston
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second time staying at Dean's this year. Last time I forgot something when I left and he and his wife sent it to me.
This time I had a tight timeline and needed to be somewhere at the same time as check-in. Dean kindly worked to accommodate an earlier check-in so I could drop off my things and shower before going to my scheduled event. I can't thank Dean enough for his kindness.
Great place and location. Highly recommend!"

Dean and his wife Melody were delightful and so very helpful during our stay. Thank you and we will definitely be back!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Dean‘s place was spotless, smelled very nice when I entered the loft. There was so many nice restaurants with extremely tasty menus. I don’t think I went to a restaurant that I didn’t love! All with the walking distance! Windows throughout and high ceilings, made the space much larger than the pictures even show. Dean and Melody were extremely helpful, friendly, and responded very quickly anytime I messaged them. The huge bath was extremely relaxing and the sauna very, peaceful! The bed was very comfortable with spotless linens. The little touches of a basket with treats and snacks on the kitchen bar. The kitchen also had a coffee machine with a Keurig so you could choose if you wanted a pot of coffee or a single cup. The couch was very comfortable with feather pillows, and a blanket that made it feel like home."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"What a perfect location if visiting Charleston! Dean’s loft is in a historic building on lovely Capital St. We felt safe walking downtown and from the secured parking deck around the corner. Once inside we really didn’t want to leave! The modern upscale decor was lovely. The gourmet kitchen was well stocked with everything we needed. The bathroom was large and loved the sauna and soaking tub. Plenty of towels and linens. Full sized washer and dryer so convenient right across the hall.
Dean and Melody were very easy to communicate with and accommodating to whatever we asked. Would 100% recommend this loft and if ever back in Charleston would want to stay again. Thank you for making us feel at home!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay in WV was great. The apartment was very comfortable with great natural lighting. It was in a great location for walking in downtown Charleston.

Fabulous eateries, coffee houses, and lively night life spots are all with in a short stroll. The newly renovated library next door is amazing. The loft itself is fabulously appointed and the mid century modern decor has been meticulously curated and arranged. Dean is the best host ever, communication was excellent and the everything we needed was available. Dean checked in with us via the app to ensure that we were squared away. The stay in the loft is fantastic, I don’t recall hearing a sound from anyone else in the building and the vibe there is welcoming and easy. The space is very, very clean, and comfortable. I will definitely stay here again! Thank you Dean for the fabulous Trier Loft experience!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dean and Melody's apartment was absolutely perfect for my combo business and leisure trip! The apartment was clean, well-stocked, had a great layout, and was in a convenient downtown location. The photos do not do this place justice, it's even more wonderful in person! The reserved parking was easy and convenient. Walking to restaurants/around the downtown area was a breeze thanks to the great location. The sauna was fantastic after a long day of adventuring in the New River Gorge area. I would definitely (and look forward to) staying here again!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Trier Loft is worthy of praise - a fabulous place to stay!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dean’s condo is a must if you are traveling to Charleston WV. The location is perfect for downtown walking to nearby restaurants, shopping, and the river.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Great location. Dean was very helpful.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed my stay in this beautiful loft. Perfectly located near the highway and yet near downtown entertainment. Very clean and well appointed place with very communicative hosts.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent place to stay. Very detailed description that stood true to description. The pictures do not give it justice. Would definitely choose to stay again if given the chance.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing loft apartment! The location is perfect!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is so amazing. Right in the center of all the great places in Charleston. Dean was a great host and always there when we needed help! Highly recommend
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"What a nice spot for a month-long stay in my husband's hometown. The loft was spacious enough to host company a few times and was nicely appointed throughout. The bed was very comfortable which is high priority for me in any lodging. Getting our stuff in/out was a little cumbersome with parking at a different entrance, but then we were traveling much heavier than usual for a month-long stay. Plenty of good dining within walking distance, as well as an open-air market, movie theater and our favorite bookstore/coffee shop, Taylor's. The ceilings are high and windows are huge - great views of the city but surprisingly quiet too. Room darkening shades in the bedroom allowed many long sleeping in days for me! I got some great new walking shoes then promptly managed to get them covered in mud while hiking at a state park. How many Airbnb places actually have a washtub in the laundry room for cleaning up such a mess - bonus points! Thanks so much for sharing this nice space."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This condo is amazing in every way! We hit the jackpot with this one! Excellent location, wonderful host and is beautifully decorated. I would highly recommend staying here rather than a hotel."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment is amazing! Beautifully renovated, modern and spacious in a historic building, located in the heart of downtown Charleston. There are many large windows that offer impressive views of the city from different angles and the furnishings/ appliances are tasteful and of the highest quality. The building is very quiet and Dean and Melody are very gracious hosts who are also excellent communicators. the sauna room in the bathroom was a unique and enjoyable part of our stay. Highly recommend!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this rental! Honestly, I wish I could give this review more than 5 stars.
We were giddy as soon as we walked through the door. The kitchen and living room are open and large - they felt very swanky. The bed was incredibly comfortable - I slept like a rock, which is VERY rare. Being on an upper floor of the building, there are some nice views of downtown Charleston, and the sunset was lovely.
The kitchen was very well stocked - we happily cooked a couple meals there. But if you don’t prefer to cook, there are numerous restaurants nearby, including an amazing vegan spot.
There is a reserved parking spot in the parking garage next door. It’s not connected directly to the building - if you have mobility issues, just know that you do have to go down a flight of stairs (no elevator in the garage). But it’s a quick walk around the corner, without having to cross the street, to the building entrance. There are elevators to take you up to the apartment. We had no problem finding street parking by the entrance when we loaded and unloaded the car. And Dean graciously offered to help us with our bags since I have mobility issues.
Dean is lovely as well - incredibly communicative and helpful - just a lovely human. You can tell that he takes good care of this apartment - he is an excellent host. Absolutely recommend this rental - this is the best of the best."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This loft is truly stunning! So much thought and care went into making this a true home away from home. Located within walking distance of so many great restaurants and shops. My daughter and I were in town from Florida for her to attend a volleyball camp at UC and Dean’s place perfect for us. It gave us a chance to explore the downtown area on foot and experience Charleston up close.
We walked to First Watch for breakfast each morning before camp and then walked to dinner each evening (Pies & Pints & Soho). I Wish we could have stayed longer. Dean was very responsive from our initial communication to our checkout. Would give this place 10+ stars if I could. Cannot wait to return! Thanks for everything Dean!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and spacious condo! The description was accurate and the loft was perfect for our weekend getaway. Dean’s local recommendations were spot on!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, top-notch condo in a great location. We walked everywhere except to the parks for hiking and trail running."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Visiting Charleston for the first time to attend a wedding. Did not want a chain hotel. Trier Loft exceeded all our expectations. The photos do not communicate the incredible value. Immaculate, spacious, perfect location, quiet, private, personal sauna with a soak tub, gourmet high end kitchen, which was not used with it being walking distance to so many food options! We were very blessed!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best air bnb I have been to!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing. Great location, great views and all the amenities needed.
Would stay again if it’s available."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay downtown and within walking distance to restaurants. Apt was great and well appointed. Having the sauna was an excellent perk. Check in was easy and Dean is very responsive!
The only negative I have is that it’s a bit challenging to get to and from the parking spot. That being said, it makes it difficult to bring luggage and grocery bags in since parking is tricky out front (near the main entrance for elevator usage)."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay in Dean’s condo! The historic building was neat, and the modern loft was cool, comfortable, and clean. The hosts are really tuned into guests’ needs. I highly recommend staying here!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The space was exactly as described! Very clean, spacious and walking distance from everything that you would need."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our three night stay in the heart of downtown Charleston was superb! Excellent security and entry to the building and condo made us feel very safe during our stay. The condo design is modern, attractive, spacious and Dean has thought of every possible detail to meet his guests' needs. The seating and bedding were comfortable; several workspace and dining options in the condo. The kitchen was well appointed and the bathroom was large with a soaking tub, shower and sauna. Lighting was terrific with a bonus of labeled light switches. Undoubtedly, the best accommodation in downtown Charleston, WV."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Dean is a fabulous host and everything that was promised about the place was accurate. It’s very stylish and very comfortable and it has very high-quality amenities. That location could not be better.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely book this condo if you want your expectations exceeded! From the moment you walk in you will notice the attention to detail. All the design elements make for a pleasant esthetic vibe. High end finishes, appliances and bathroom amenities that rival a spa. Plenty of room to spread out inside and such a great location to walk downtown and explore. The parking included is handy. Surprised that the listing isn't Airb&b Plus:)"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing location. Perfect for a long weekend getaway. It was clean & beautiful. Dean was very accommodating:)
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome loft in Downtown Charleston WV. Close to everything and magnificent hosts. Highly recommend for your next stay in the Capital city!

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place to stay in a wonderful location. Restaurants, bars and attractions are so close. I enjoyed my morning exercise along the river! The bathroom and kitchen are AMAZING!!!!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This loft, nestled amongst Charleston’s fantastic drinking and dining scene, is spacious, spotless, and thoughtfully curated.
It is both close to everything and also its own urban oasis, complete with a massive soaking tub and sauna. We loved the views from the historic floor-to-ceiling windows.
Dean is a top-tier host who makes everything easy on his guests. A+"

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful weekend!
We had an amazing time at Dean's AirBnb. Mr. Dean was very kind and welcoming to us providing us with all the help we needed! The communication was quick and the place looks even better in person. It is very tidy, spacious and equipped with everything you could ever need.
The neighborhood was located at a
very convenient spot, very easy to get around the awesome restaurants. Everything was just PERFECT! We 100%
recommend. And we’ll definitely be back.
Thank you so much Mr.Dean."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This AirBnB was perfect! We were in town for work & this was a beautiful inviting place to call home. Dean thought of everything from stocking the pantry with staples needed in the kitchen, shower soaps, cozy blanket for the couch 🥰, easy entry to the condo, smart tv with access to all your platforms, labeled light switches, etc. Definitely will be back! 👌"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I will start by saying, hosts like Dean are exactly why we choose Airbnbs over hotels when we travel!
The location is perfect; everything you need is within 1-3 blocks of the loft. Dean's guidebook is better than a Google search of things to do in the area and all his recommendations are spot on; definitely pick some things off of it to do(everything is walking distance for the most part). The parking was a little tricky at first because of the construction next door, but Dean's detailed directions made it super easy to find the parking spot and we were very grateful for off-street covered parking!
Check in was a breeze and his communication was very quick.
Now let's talk about the loft! Wow! When you walk in and look around it starts to feel like a warm hug. Incredibly cozy; like coming home. Impeccably clean, detailed and super thoughtful touches from the moment you step off the elevator. We stayed for New Year's and they had it decorated for Christmas/New Years and left a welcome basket of goodies for us on the counter. The amenities would be perfect for a short or long-term stay. The loft is well-stocked with more than just the essentials; sugar and cream for coffee, travel hygiene items like deodorant and toothbrushes, face masks if you need one. I also loved how things were labeled around the apartment like lighting/fans and which washcloths were for removing makeup.
Easily top of my list for best airbnb experience and hosts! If this place is available, snag it; you will be so happy you did!
Thank you for a comfortable stay, Dean! You were a huge reason we had such a wonderful time in Charleston!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dean’s condo is absolutely perfect; warm, stylish and wonderfully appointed. Will definitely stay again when next in Charleston!"

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a top notch property and Dean is more than accommodating. Excellent AirBnb with excellent views of the city. The amenities were top of the line and the best I’ve experienced compared to other inner city Airbnbs. Highly recommend 10/10!

Overall a solid place for visiting town."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay. The amenities are awesome, and the location is great! My partner worked in Charleston for three years, and was thrilled to be be able to stay right downtown and walk to all his old haunts. We will be back for sure!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dean’s condo was absolutely amazing. We needed a place to stay while hiking in the area, and the condo exceeded our expectations. The condo feels so warm and truly like a home away from home. You have everything you could possibly need, including a wine opener which we needed to celebrate after my boyfriend proposed! :)
Within walking distance to delicious local restaurants and a short drive away from some amazing hiking spots, Dean’s place should be at the top of your list when looking for a place to stay in Charleston."

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My dad and I had a fantastic stay at the Trier Loft hosted by Dean. The apartment is gorgeous and has everything you need for a comfortable stay.

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Trier loft is what dreams are made of. If you ever imagined what it would be like in a historic building in downtown just living your life of glamor this is the place to check out. Dean and his wife are lovely people and the condo is just excellent through and through. You have the ability to go try any restaurants, go shopping, and live city life with the comfort of high end finishes and well decorated spaces. If you love to cook this kitchen will melt your brain. There is a Dacor stove which is the stove of dreams. All of my friends will be recommended here for a glamorous night of living in the city."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic place! So nicely furished and comfortable. Excellent location. Dean was a great host, easy to communicate with, and he even let me know I left a blouse in the closet ... I hadn't yet left town so I was able to go back and get it. Thanks!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Trier Loft. There was great accessibility to all over Charleston, and it's only an hour away from New River Gorge National Park. Cool amenities and a great amount of space to relax and take it easy. The soaker tub was a favorite as well as the sauna - such a unique amenity! Dean was great with communication and couldn't have made it any easier on us."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful loft apartment with everything you need for a short or long stay. We thought we were in a Manhattan loft. Close to plenty of restaurants.
Comfortable bed and plenty of room to spread out. Having access to a washer and dryer in the middle of our trip was a bonus.
Dean was very responsive. Check-in instructions were clearly documented. As Dean recommended, I parked at a meter, reviewed the instructions, and checkin was easy.
I highly recommend the Trier Loft, great stay!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Deans loft is perfect. Huge space and all the amenities you need. Just 9 minutes from the airport you are in downtown Charleston. Great views of the city. Dean is a great host and is always available to help and answer any questions. Will definitely stay here again when I'm in the area. A+!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This loft is just beautiful! Dean and Melody live next door which was quite convenient when Melody baked cookies cause she brought over some for us and they were great! The location is great, just a little wonky check-in process especially on the weekend due to Capitol Street being closed off, so keep that in mind. But it was nice to have the designated parking space. There’s the Capitol Market nearby so don’t miss that. Lots of restaurants walking distance. The unit is quiet and secure. Worth checking out if you are going to Charleston."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Dean's beautiful Airbnb is worthy of 5+ Stars! In addition he is a 5 star Host !The apartment is decorated with style including quality furnishings and great art. The kitchen is so well appointed with a 6 burner stove and other great appliances. The bathroom is very spacious and includes a great soaker tub. The bonus surprise is a sauna that provides the ultimate relaxation. The apartment location is superb to explore the quaint downtown and walk to many restaurants and coffee shops. It is a easy walk to the central Market which includes a farmers market and lots of local specialties. We cannot wait to return. Thank you for such a special experience!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, would definitely stay here! Beautifully decorated"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a perfect spot! Came to the area to visit Blenko glass in Milton - love their mid century designs - and this was MidMod heaven! Terrific location within walking distance of some wonderful local places. And very easy to connect with expressways to reach surrounding areas. Dean was very quick to respond to some random small questions I had, generally though he provided all the info I might need. PRO TIP: the sauna was AMAZING! Would love to book another visit soon."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our favorite Air bnb stay ever.! A great condo in a great location. And all the extras - from snacks, to coffee, to the sauna and soaking tub - were appreciated. Plus it’s just a block away from our favorite breakfast place, and Taylor Books. We only wish we’d had more time in Charleston.
We hope to come back often.
Thanks for the hospitality Dean."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best place to stay in Charleston! Great location and very clean.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Trier Loft in Charleston, WV was perfect for our trip. Just steps away from all the downtown action-great restaurants, a few blocks from the river.
Dean was the perfect host. The loft was beautifully decorated and outfitted. Felt like home ( a much nicer home).
Very clean-followed all the protocols-even left a mask in case we had forgotten ours.
Would gladly stay again next time we are in Charleston."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"2nd and probably not the last time we’ll stay at Tyler’s place. We love the seclusion of the home, always peaceful and quiet."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The cabin was really lovely and peaceful. Really cute decorations and had everything we needed! Tyler was very kind and responsive! I’d recommend to anyone visiting.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Tyler was very friendly and helpful and allowed us to book an additional night. We were traveling with our 8 month old and 2 dogs and we had plenty of outdoor space and privacy for everyone. The cabin is decorated nicely and was equipped with everything we needed.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay at Tylers place with all the amenities you need. Very clean and peaceful. I will definitely recommend this place to anyone who is in the WV area.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A truly wonderful place to stay. We were only there for a weekend but I would love to come back for a week and enjoy the outdoors and utilize the kitchen a bit more. My only tip is to try not to arrive after dark. If you are unfamiliar with driving up hills with twists and turns it can be a little nerve wracking. In the daytime it’s no problem. Overall a true gem in West Virginia!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,We had to book a very last minute stay and Tyler was extremely quick to respond to our request! Great to communicate with and we absolutely love the place!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place was very cute and Tyler was helpful and responsive! Would stay again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved this little home, we just needed somewhere to clean up and rest for a long drive. Super relaxing and EXTREMELY clean. Definitely convenient having a washer and dryer. Only thing is if it is snowing you are going to need a 4WD vehicle. I had no idea how steep the roads were leading up to the home. If it had been snowing we definitely wouldn’t have been able to make it."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If you’re looking for a private mountain cabin getaway, this is the place for you! We had a great time staying at Tyler’s place while visiting the Charleston area. The cabin is beautiful inside and out. You have everything that you’ll need in the kitchen to make your own meals. We enjoyed an evening out by the fire pit stargazing in the peaceful serenity. Lots of hiking trails within a short drive and lots of shopping and restaurants in the Charleston/South Charleston area kept us busy! We brought our Newfoundland dog with us and he also felt right at home at Tyler’s place! Plenty of room on the property to wake your dog for a quick walk also. Tyler is super responsive and was flexible and accommodating during our stay. I highly recommend staying at Tyler’s place!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Tyler's place was beautiful and cozy. It's a perfect getaway for a couple or small family

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,This was my 2nd time staying here. The place is well stocked with everything you need in the kitchen as well as the bathroom. One of my go to spots to stay with my dog when traveling through the area.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing little cabin! The hosts thought of literally everything! Our son enjoyed all the games!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tyler has supplied everything needed for a comfortable stay, fully functional kitchen many small appliances like home. Full bathroom on main level with many toiletries that may have been forgotten, only note shower enclosure is a bit on the small side.
There are plenty of games to pass the time which was great as the Wi-Fi was not functioning with code supplied that also operated the television.
The 1.5 mile access road is very narrow and roughly paved leading to the steep driveway that is freshly paved with a very sharp up hill turn thank you otherwise I would have had a problem getting up with my adventure motorcycle, any larger touring motorcycle would have a serious issue going up or down safely."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Nice cozy place! Stayed here with my dog on a work trip. Private and conveniently located just a few miles south of Charleston.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely a wonderful stay, the house was very clean and lovely. Got everything needed and pet-friendly. The host is very responsive. Definitely back again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"2 Adults and 1 dog, we stayed around Christmas time. The Cabin is Clean and Sophisticatedly decorated. The heat was on when we arrived, the cabin was warm. There are alot of throw blankets to add to the coziness. There are nonslip treads on the stairs going up to the loft, my dog was able to easily go up the stairs. The bed in the loft is comfortable, there is enough headroom to walk around. The bathroom is well stocked with toiletries. The shower is slim but has excellent water pressure and hot water. The surroundings are peaceful and quite. To get to the cabin there is about a 10 minute drive on a narrow, winding road and the last minute of the drive is rather steep so just be prepared for that. These types of roads seem to be typical for the area but if you are not from West Virginia they take some getting used to. Tyler was a great friendly host and quickly responded to messages on airbnb or on text."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Keith Ann is a warm and gracious host. It’s clear she’s put a lot of thought and effort into making sure the Pineapple Room is a clean, comfortable, and peaceful place for her guests.

What a gorgeous gorgeous home, very easy to find, and very large space. We got to have a few conversations here and there, and I have to say there is a reason she has nearly 500 flawless reviews. What a fun and kind host, and hearing the history about her home is even more amazing!!! ☺️
Thank you for such an incredible stay!!! Looking forward to staying again sometime soon."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was traveling to Lakeville Indiana all the way from South Carolina and this was the perfect spot to stay for the halfway point.

The kitchen is fully equipped with all the essentials, making it easy to prepare and enjoy meals, within the open layout of the living area and dining space.
This loft has an unbeatable location. It's situated right in the downtown area, within walking distance of some of Charleston's best restaurants, shops, and cultural attractions. Whether you want to explore the Capitol Market, visit the Capitol building, or stroll along the riverfront, everything is within reach.
Thank you Anthony for a great place to stay and REVIVE in charming Charleston."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Place was awesome and our host was twice as awesome! Left a few things in the amazing condo and was able to quickly get in touch and line up retrieval.

Thanks again!!

We loved the recommended restaurants, good water pressure, and the complimentary bottle of wine. Head to the nearby speakeasy hidden in Hale House basement for liberating drinks. You might pass an impromptu jam session of blue grass musicians on the sidewalk who don’t accept $$."

We are not always the easiest family to host due to size and kids but the neighbors were gracious and kind. The place is beautiful and spacious with walking distance to food.

Instructions on checking in, a complete listing local dining and adventures, parking accommodations, and a complimentary bottle of wine to name just a few! I traveled to Charleston last minute for a quick weekend getaway with my son. The location is perfect for downtown views, walkable dining and entertainment. The loft was pristine and full stocked. My son and I had the perfect weekend!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, great host in a great spot! Definitely will use him again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"C. Anthony’s place was the BEST we have stayed in the past five years. It was gorgeous with beautiful views from the windows. The beds were comfortable and the space looked like something out of a magazine. I honestly cannot imagine a more perfect location in Charleston. I had a few questions the first night, mostly fueled by my sleep-deprived brain, and C. Anthony was extremely helpful and responsive. I highly recommend you stay here!!"

The apartment is just as shown in the pictures, plenty of space and comfortable. A great spot to stay for attending Mountain Stage. Thanks for your hospitality!!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic place to stay and highly recommend. We enjoyed it so much that we just ended up ordering food and staying in to relax.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We took a random, spur of the moment trip and landed in Charleston on a fun weekend with lots of events happening. The concert at the river was our favorite activity, which was only a couple blocks away. C. Anthony was a super nice and welcoming host -- he gave us easy to follow instructions, provided convenient parking, and a clean and cozy space. He also gave us a great number of recommendations. There are some outstanding restaurants on his list -- we like unique places and there were not enough days to try all the ones that were in walking distance. Standouts were Phat Daddy's and DT Prime. We also loved the Appalachian Tea House for dessert (which is a ways further but still walkable if you're a walker). Even the Sheraton hotel restaurant had outdoor seating and live music on Sunday evening when many other places were already closed. Loved the guitar store downstairs - the owner is great resource. Overall we loved our stay and would stay at C. Anthony's place again."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,Feel was overpriced compared to comparable 2bd rms in the same building. Did appreciate the parking pass however.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had to book here as an emergency at the last minute because there was a gas leak at our other rental. C. Anthony was so great - got us booked and confirmed right away. He offered to bring us anything else we may need and when my kids left some things in the apartment, he even arranged a way for us to pick it up. Wonderful place to stay in Charleston and SO easy to walk to all the things to do."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location and beautiful apartment. Anthony is a fantastic host.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,good

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From the moment I booked this great space, C. Anthony took care of business. He sent great restaurant recommendations (Hale Howse was 5*) and lists of things to do. If I had a question, he answered quickly. His place was exactly as pictured. We would definitely want to stay here again!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place for our overnight stay. The instructions were clear and check-in was fuss free. We loved how neat and spacious the loft was and had amazing views of the city. This was my first time in Charleston and I am glad we chose this place to explore the city a bit.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Highly recommend the Revive B&B, hosted by C. Anthony. The apt. was located within walking distance to local eateries & Go-Mart Ball Park. Our family of three stayed for a long weekend and were able to hike, catch a game, and explore the local scene downtown.
The apartment was stocked full of pillows, blankets, and comfortable furniture/ beds with ample closet space. Clean and exquisitely decorated for a homey feel.

The place was very nice and clean. It had everything we needed and more. Lots of nice brochures as well. Lots of daylight and a great design. The beds were very comfortable.
It worked perfectly for our family of four. Everyone had plenty of space and privacy.
We will use it again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay. Super safe since you have an entry code to the door and a certain amount of time to get to the elevator before they lock.
Close to a lot of downtown things.
The host helped me out by allowing me to stay until 1 pm. I had a few meetings I overbooked and was able to complete them before I left to the airport.
I will have to come back for business soon and I plan to stay in the exact same place.
Thank you!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Where do I even start?!! From the time I inquired on Anthony's Airbnb until the very end was nothing but stellar. He quickly responded as I was visiting West Virginia for the first time. He explained check in instructions after booking, and check out instructions before leaving, had everything laid out to a T. Now let's get into his home. It was ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL. The pictures do no justice because it looks even better in person. I didn't want to leave lol. If you're thinking about booking, DO IT!! You won't be disappointed. If you're looking for a location near attractions this is definitely a place to stay because you're walking distance to almost everything. Great host! Highly recommend."

2023-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Host was very responsive. Place overall was nice. Very close to downtown. Very walkable.
Could see dirt and old food under stove from chair in the living room. Fridge was greasy on the exterior. Overwhelmed with air fresheners.
We arrived on a late Monday afternoon . The city was dead. Barely anything open. Host advertised having games for kids. There was one puzzle.
I thought it was on the expensive side.
Perhaps a different time of year would be better. If you want to be downtown and can tolerate minor things. This is the place."

Everything was immaculate and he had all the essentials and then some. All the rooms and both bathrooms were really spacious. The views from the living room were incredible! We only wish we could have stayed longer because there was so much within walking distance that we would have loved to do.
We were beyond impressed with the quick responses we received from C. Anthony and his excellent, customer service oriented recommendations and suggestions. He and his place are topnotch. We'll definitely stay here again and would highly recommend it to anyone."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We couldn’t have asked for a better host and accommodations. Every message we sent was promptly replied to, he provided many suggestions for food and things to do and the place was just perfect. We will certainly return on our next visit to Charleston, WV!"

Plenty of space to spread out individually and be on your own or join together for some tv watching. We loved the easy walk to restaurants and shopping. We took a stroll down to the river and walked along the banks. The views of the church and city were lovely. It was easy to get to and the parking was a snap. Thanks for a wonderful home away from home."
