The space was very clean, comfortable, decorated very nicely & located minutes away from a shopping plaza.
Eddie checked in a few times & made sure that I knew they were only a phone call away if I needed anything at all ... & indeed when the bathroom light blew out he was only a message away and changed it quickly, which was greatly appreciated!
The hosts left a hand written welcome note with their info, local attractions, shopping info etc, which I found very helpful.
I thought it was wonderful that they provided a kitchen stocked with pots, pans, dishes Etc so I didn’t have to eat every meal out.
I frequently work remotely & they have a great work station set up too!
I very much enjoyed my stay here. It’s a fantastic place to stay with friendly, caring hosts. I would stay here again myself & would recommend it and the hosts to family & friends!"

The setting was so beautiful and peaceful with all the singing birds and they have put so much work into making it a little slice of heaven. Watching the wildlife for us was so relaxing, who needs TV? Esther cares for all the bird feeders, so you are guaranteed a plethora of birds, and If you are lucky, you can hear her calling in the Bluebirds. This is a must stay!!! They really deserve a 10 star for their helpfulness, hospitality and friendliness!!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Will definitely return for longer visit. Esther and Elam are the most kind, caring, and personable hosts. We arrived very late (11:30 pm) bc of circumstances beyond our control. The locked gate, stood open for us (as promised), the AirBNB was immaculate and even more charming than the description. Elam and Esther are only a phone call away and are very responsive. We plan to return - beautiful grounds, friendly and caring hosts, and the most charming place to stay will bring us back for a longer stay."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,A great and unique place to stay! The surrounding grounds were well taken care of and offered a special spring show during our visit. The interior space was immaculate and tastefully decorated in the Amish farmhouse style. We also enjoyed and appreciated the special treats (home roasted coffee and whoopie pies)! What a special touch to make us feel welcome!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely perfect! The Airbnb was extremely clean and very nicely decorated. There was a nice binder with things to do plus some history of the place. The grounds were breathtakingly beautiful, you could tell a lot of work goes into it. Esther was extraordinarily friendly and quite lovely to talk with. She even went way above and beyond and gave my mom a jacket to borrow since it was kind of chilly out. Would definitely recommend and will look forward to staying again for a longer visit in the future."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I were in the area to attend a wedding, and found Esther to be proactive in communicating property details, and very welcoming in leaving us a note and some local treats."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved the Barn and all the things to do around the area. We visites the wineries and restaurants.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I highly reccommend this space to anyone who is traveling through the area— Esther & Elam have truly created a wonderful, peaceful space. We happened to travel through Reading at the same time as a snowstorm and were snowed in, and what could have been an extremely stressful time ended up being nothing short of a magical memory. We have traveled the country coast to coast and have stayed in many airbnb's, but have never been in one as cozy and well stocked as this one. It has all the essentials you may need or might have forgotten, a fully equipped and functioning kitchen, extra space heaters and fans, snacks hot cocoa and teas, and Esther even goes above to provide a little welcome basket. When the storm came through, they checked in on us and brought up extra robes/blankets. The property was gorgeous before the snowfall but even more so after, and was so fun to explore. We can't say enough good things about Esther & her space, highly reccommend to anyone passing through!!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Esther and her husband are very nice people! We went to celebrate valentines with my boyfriend and Esther make sure everything was setup for our cookout, she decorated the table with a table cloth and candles to make our evening warm and romantic.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Really enjoyed our stay!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you want peace and calm, this is the place for you. This gem of a homestead is nestled in beautiful area just a walk away to the Union Canal Trail, where you can take in the sound of water for miles. A beautiful covered bridge awaits you down the path. The barn has everything you need to take you to peace and serenity, with a most comfortable mattress to dream away. The welcoming gift basket is a delight, while the stocked kitchen and very clean and large bathroom make for perfect amenities. Take in the history of the barn and enjoy all the nature you want, while food and shopping is just minutes away. Esther is the best, welcoming and immediately responsive to any questions. The barn will be part of my future plans and highly recommended!!!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Worth every penny. We loved our stay! It was the sweetest place to get away from it all. Every personal touch added by our wonderful hosts made it the best AirBnB experience we’ve ever had😁.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Private, gorgeous, cozy and clean. So welcoming with the whoopie pies and local goodies. We stay at a lot of Airbnbs and this is one of our all time favorites. We were lucky enough to experience this property during a little snow storm. It was so beautiful and we built a snow man! Esther let us check out late the next day due to the weather. We were so grateful. Would highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a romantic and cozy getaway."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow, what a special place! Esther and Elam were the best hosts, and the barn was so lovely and welcoming! They had left some local goodies and a handwritten card welcoming us as well as some great recommendations! Esther was so quick to respond to any questions and Elam showed us around the restored Amish house and had such interesting knowledge! What a lovely place that we will be sure to come back to."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,THIS WAS MY SECOND STAY AT THE LOFT. AND THERE WILL BE 2 MORE THIS YEAR. IT IS A HOME AWAY FROM HOME. VERY COZY WITH GREAT AMMENITIES AND FOLK DECOR. BY FAR THE NICEST AIRBNB UNIT I HAVE BOOKED TO DATE. A BIG PLUS IS HOW FRIENDLY AND RESPONSIVE ARE TO ME AS A GUEST.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved this stay! The barn loft is so cozy and the perfect peaceful getaway. Esther was helpful and responsive to any questions we had. We only stayed one night, but we will definitely come back and stay longer!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Esther's Airbnb was prestine, clean, and exactly as advertised. What set her rental apart from the others however, is the welcoming basket placed inside for me upon arrival. It provided home-made goodies and a personalized letter for my stay. That made us feel welcome at Esther's loft."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"For my wife and me, half the fun of staying in an ABnB is discovering unique living spaces in beautiful surroundings. Esther's space rates high on both points. If you have never slept in an historic stone barn - furnished with comfort and a caring touch - try this! To top it off, Esther goes out of her way to make this a welcoming experience with loads of suggestions on things to do in this lovely section of PA, without being in the least way intrusive. We spent only one night there, on a tight schedule on our way home from CT to DC, but would love to go back for a week to take advantage of the historic sights of this area and the hospitality of the host."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We arrived to the coziest, comfortable place in the middle of everything. Tucked into the most relaxing park like setting. Everything was perfect, right down to some yummy local snacks, coffee and teas. What a true blessing this little place is.
We had so much fun using the Esther and Elam sights to see list. The education into the lives of Lancaster and Berks Counties was priceless. Oh and try to catch sunset from the Pagoda and then watch the city lights come alive below. Fantastic views high above and the Pagoda itself is a landmark not to miss.
Esther has truly thought of everything, from the front door to the reading nook that fast became my favorite perch. I could just breathe and feel the tension leave the body. A well stocked kitchen left us without void, things we didn't even realize would come in so handy. A true oasis. BEST HOSTS EVER."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stayed at Esther's for just one night, but was a great stay and wished we were there for longer! Easy to access and feels very remote despite being accessible to just about anything you need. The place was clean and the coffee they roast on site is amazing."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful decorated and very homey guest house that included everything we needed for our weekend. We had great communication with Esther and enjoyed our stay!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Esther was a great host...there is so much to do within a couple of miles. really enjoyed the Gruber Wagon Works, the Union Canal bike trail and the Amish Farmer's market. Esther gave us a personal tour of the homestead which was very enjoyable."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,The apartment is lovely. We thoroughly enjoyed it. And Esther provided many local treats to sample.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"As Program Chair for our organization, I booked this stay for our out of state speaker and her husband. We visited Esther prior to the booking and was shocked to find such a beautiful historic property right under our noses! Esther went out of her way to give us a tour and answer our questions. Our speaker was enthusiastic in her praise that we had discovered such a gem for them to enjoy."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful location. Very peaceful and very well maintained. Hosts were very responsive and we never had any issues or problems.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,What a lovely airbnb! Esther was very responsive and even made special efforts to make sure we'd be comfortable (we particularly loved the welcome basket). We really enjoyed staying in this unique and special home and we certainly would stay again on a future trip.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The Nicholas Stoltzfus Homestead is a lovely and cozy apartment. Visiting family in the area and having a place of our own to stay was ideal. The apartment has a full kitchen, very nice shower and a spacious bedroom and closet area for all of our clothing. Having a private and dedicated parking spot was a plus. Our hosts were gracious and helpful. We will always check their calendar when we visit our families!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is truly a gem of an Airbnb! The loft has been lovingly decorated, the kitchen is very complete . But the welcome was even more important: the Amish treats, the level of detail, we felt at home at once. The hosts are warm and kind, the total package deserves a 6-star rating!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I wish we had more time to enjoy this space! Just stopping in for a night after a day at Hershey Park. Esther was very communicative, and instructions were clear. The space is clean and cozy with lots of great touches. There is a binder with an explanation of some pieces in the barn loft and the homestead itself. The local goodies were very much appreciated, what a treat!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean, cozy, comfortable. No amenities lacking. left book of things to do and places to see. left local snacks to try. went above and beyond. AND grinds her own delicious coffee!"

The hosts provided very clear instructions, things to do in the area, and were quick to respond. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in the area! You won’t regret it!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The barn loft was everything they said it was - and more! The location was beautiful and even though we were close to a ramp for the nearby highway, we barely heard the traffic. I wish we had more time because we definitely didn't get to take advantage of all the place had to offer. I really wanted to try out the swing hanging from the tree!
Everything was perfectly clean and anything that we needed in the kitchen was available. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was spacious.
I particularly loved the welcome gifts - whoopie pies, sodas and the fresh ground coffee. There was a handwritten card welcoming us to the loft and the guide book was very helpful.
We will definitely come and visit again the next time we're staying in Reading!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Barn Loft is living history as it is located on their family estate dating back to the 1700's at the end of a quiet road. The stone farmhouse is nearly restored and is a true piece of American history. Although the barn is rebuilt, it has been done so to nearly replicate the original structure. The loft makes you feel right at home however with exposed beams and plank flooring. The bathroom is spacious and kitchen is well equipped all with modern conveniences. The inside was so clean too. Outside, the grounds are just beautiful with exquisite flower beds, beautiful lawn, sitting area and fire pit overlooking the restored farm house. One evening, three deer were in the yard who were very content to meander through.
Esther and Elam are superior hosts and have thought of everything a traveler would want. They were very quick to respond via AirBnB messenger should you need anything.
If you are looking for a tranquil retreat and appreciate history, this is the place to stay"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"I felt very safe and cozy, far enough away from the hustle and bustle to spend a relaxing night during a work trip to the reading area. Super clean. I much appreciated the snack basket and coffee."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Esther was very quick to respond to all communication. The place was very peaceful and beautiful. Perfect location to appreciate nature within close driving distance to prime locations. She also left little treats and drinks for us with personal little touches.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is just as described. The grounds are just beautiful! The loft is the cutest, comfy & cozy place! It is perfect for a couple looking for a peaceful little getaway. There's a beautiful park right across the streat to walk or ride bikes. There's a fire pit that can be used for cooking. The hosts, Elam and Esther, were just great! So helpful and friendly! They respond right away and even left us local treats and coffee made by them! This place is a gem!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a trip that I will remember for the rest of my life. Being both a history nerd and a descendant of Nicholas Stoltzfus, I would have been happy with a sofa to sleep on and a cup of coffee in the morning. But the gorgeous loft apartment and unparalleled hospitality from Esther and Elam made this stay unforgettable. The park across the street is as peaceful as can be. Restaurants in the area are delicious and very close, and the fire pit outside was cozy and inviting. Elam’s tour of the house was very informative, and his excitement is contagious. I had been looking forward to this trip for months, and it exceeded my expectations. I loved it, and I can’t wait to go back."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a comfy and accomodating space. Loved the local goody basket and Elam's roasted coffee. Such a nice touch as was the notebook of information about the homestead and things to do in the area. Esther's artistic flower beds were gorgeous and the yard was full of birds. We really enjoyed biking the tow path trail and touring the old house. The sound of the adjacent highway was loud at first bit quite tolerable as we acclimated. Inside the thick walls we could barely hear it. We'll be back!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very relaxing place, and I would highly recommend. I wish I had more time, but plan on returning!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing stay at this historical location! Ester and Elam were very friendly and responsive and gave great recommendations on things to do in the area. The tour of the historic homestead was excellent and our stay and amenities at the barn loft were perfect! Beautiful and well kept property as well! Would definitely recommend and stay there again!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! Elam and Esther's place was amazing! Esther was amazing with her communication and always quick to respond, even when I messaged her in the middle of the night to let her know that I was going to be delayed.
The barn loft was comfortable, spotless, and homey. I loved the local goodies, and although I haven't been able to try Elam's roasted coffee yet, I brought it home with me. It smells amazing, and I look forward to trying it tomorrow.
The homestead is beautiful, easy to get to, and fairly quiet. As I was in town visiting family, I didn't get to spend as much time on the property and in the area visiting the local suggestions as I would have liked, but I hope to return and visit more of the area, and also have the opportunity to participate in an Amish ""frolic."" I was disappointed to miss that.
I highly encourage anyone visiting in the area to stay here! If you're looking for a quiet, comfortable place with great hosts, this is the place for you."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place! And friendly host
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely fantastic! The place is beautiful and the bed is extremely comfy. Esther was the most wonderful host and gave us lots of great tips about the area before we’d even arrived. She greeted us with a huge smile and the place was filled with complementary local produce. Couldn’t have asked for a better stay!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing hosts and getaway location. So much history and fun things to do nearby. Will definitely come again!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Esther's loft was tastefully decorated, very comfortable and spotlessly clean. The bed had great sheets and a nice handmade quilt. The bathroom was roomy with a nice walk in shower. The kitchen, a nice size with everything you would need to cook your meals if you choose to. Esther left a basket of local goodies and fresh coffee. We did not use the grounds due to our being so busy and it was cooler out, but it is in a beautiful park- like setting with picnic table, fire pit, yard games etc. A walking trail along the river and park are right across the street. The homestead tour was very interesting, we loved learning a bit of the history.
Esther and Elam made us feel right at home and are the friendliest people. Thank you to both of them for a delightful stay."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Charming apartment with everything you need for a short or long stay. Esther is very attentive and has prepared the best snack basket with treats from the area. Elaim also shares his personal roasted coffee beans for the perfect cup of morning ""Joe"". It is convenient to everything including restaurants, shopping and local areas of interest. I love the homeyness and contact free entrance . . . great for those of us who have early morning departures and late evening arrivals. This is now my favorite Airbnb in the Reading area! Thank you Esther and Elaim."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had a lovely stay here, all the little touches were perfect! It was so cozy, and the snacks were delicious. Loved the nearby walking trail as well. Definitely will have to come back here for a longer stay"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Whoopie! A great find! Felt like home, clean comfortable and the host was awesome. Bed is comfortable, bathroom immaculate and had everything for a comfortable stay. Did not utilize, but full eat in kitchen if needed for your stay. Beautiful property and I will be going back . . . and the local treats left by host . . . amazing! Thank you Esther."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,loved our stay here!! wish we could've stayed longer. everything was clean and cozy.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here for two nights, beautiful scenery! Esther was so accommodating and had everything set up for when we got there, with clear instructions from check in to check out. We would love to return to stay again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time. Popping popcorn and drinking the root beers Esther left us!
Elam and Esther were wonderful hosts and accommodated our every need. The homestead was beautiful and peaceful. We had a fully booked weekend and weren’t able to enjoy the grounds like we wanted.
Maybe next time♥️"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Felt like home away from home. It was such a special touch finding a welcome basket & personal note. We hope to return in the summer.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,I absolutely love this place! The hosts are absolutely amazing and made me feel at home. The atmosphere is fantastic and amenities are plentiful. I will be back!!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A very comfortable place with everything that you need for relaxing and enjoyable stay. The park and river walk adjacent to the property are a great place to unwind. Highly recommended.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The barn loft was a wonderfully comfortable, clean, and relaxing place to stay with all the amenities we needed. It was great to be able to go out and stroll around the property first thing each morning. We couldn't have asked for a friendlier or a more accommodating and responsive host than Esther. We'd certainly stay here again.
Barry and Shelley"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"great place to stay it has everything a

2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a great place! Esther was so sweet and helpful! Loved the loft and the area was beautiful! Will be coming back!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The barn loft is a great place to stay. Calm and authentic area. We walked along the channel and visited the farmers marked. Not a typical tourist spot, something we liked. The apartment had everything we needed and was clean. We even got small gifts with a taste of the are. We would stay here again."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"the house has a great location, close to shops and restaurants, right off the highway. we stayed one night to go to the Christmas village. the house is very clean and has basically everything we need. it's so cozy and sweet.
Esther is very friendly and the house is perfect! we will definitely go back!"

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved everything about this beautiful place! The minute I walked in I knew this was going to be a first class experience. I was welcomed by a basket full of local goodies. Everything was immaculate, cozy and inviting.
The hosts are two of the nicest people you could meet.
I feel so fortunate to have been able to stay here. I'll definitely be back."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Esther was an amazing host. The Barn Loft was beautiful, immaculate and interesting. Much more fun and more cost effective than a boring hotel room! Set in a beautiful country setting but very close to shopping and restaurants, the Barn Loft was perfect. Esther even had a very thoughtful basket of local snacks on the kitchen table! An added bonus for us was the location was next to an area where my grandfather had a cabin years ago…what a beautiful way to return back home for a visit! This will be our go to place whenever we visit the area in the future."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Esther’s little loft was incredibly peaceful. I spend my last days there before moving to Italy and it was incredible. The details were amazing, so cozy especially at this time of year. Just gorgeous!!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The barn loft at the Stoltzfus Homestead was a great retreat for us when visiting family over the Thanksgiving holiday. We loved all of the central location and proximity to walking, historical trails. All of the homey and Amish heritage touches in the place were great, and we loved learning more about the Stoltzfus family history and old southern words phrases. Also, there was a very well-stocked kitchen! We were able to make a few dishes in their kitchen to share with our family at Thanksgiving. Our 8 month old loved crawling on the floors and playing under the large, Amish rainbow quilt. Thanks for a great stay!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"A wonderful stay away from the world, and yet so close to everything in town! Interesting Amish family history. Adorably decorated barn style. Modern bathroom + large shower with soaps. Den for reading with a rocking chair. No television. Very clean overall.
Appreciated the yummy whoopie pies, snacks, coffee/tea. Every appliance you could need is provided.
Hosts were very nice, quick with communication, and flexible for check out. Highly recommend this space for the price."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely, private, quiet well appointed flat with quiet outside eating space."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay at Esther and Elam's place. As others have noted in their reviews, this is a really special Airbnb. The kitchen had everything we needed, and we enjoyed the chicken decorations, from the butter dish to the salt and pepper shakers! We also really enjoyed the treats that Esther and Elam left for us (along with a lovely handwritten note), including the Reading pretzels and soda. We enjoyed sitting outdoors at the picnic table, walking on the nearby bike path, and reading in the comfortable chairs in the window nook by the bedroom.
We really enjoyed getting to see the old homestead house that Esther and Elam are taking care of, and getting to read the books they provided in the Airbnb about the history of the homestead and the family. I was fascinated to see the old fireplace that was used for cooking, and to hear about some of the history of the house.
Thanks for a lovely stay and for allowing us to learn more about the history of the region!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the very best Airbnb you will ever find.Perfectly perfect in every way. The hosts, Esther and Elam, are incredible. You will not be disappointed."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Esther and Elam’s barn loft is the perfect getaway spot. We were sad we only stayed for a short time. The space was clean, well decorated, and came with so many personal touches like local snacks and a handwritten card. We really enjoyed our stay and hope to visit again soon."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Esther’s place is cozy, charming, and the hosts were very friendly and welcoming. There is a large area explore outside, the space itself is filled with thoughtful touches, the kitchen is fully stocked with about anything you need, great place and would happily stay again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a total gem! Historic and beautifully decorated loft apartment with everything you need for your stay along the river. The space was spotless! I would definitely stay here again.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a perfect spot for my husband and I to stay for the night. The Barn loft is clean, inviting and comfy and well equipped with whatever you need. The property is beautiful and well kept . The hosts were helpful and friendly"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The barn loft is perfect for a quick getaway or an extended stay in the Reading area. I loved the charm, convenience and location of the loft (never mind all the super thoughtful items like the coffee, desserts, etc.). I'll definitely be back!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved staying here! Esther’s communication was clear and friendly. The fresh ground coffee was incredible and the stay was amazing. Highly recommend this place!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Gorgeous setting! The place is next to awesome trails and parks and the history is breathtaking!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Barn Loft is a wonderful place to stay! Very quiet area on lovely grounds, the house is spotless and comfortable! Esther is very gracious and so friendly, I knew if I needed anything she would be ready to help - but everything was so well organized I didn't need a thing! It is about 1/2 hour from Lancaster, well worth the trip if you're spending time there, and a good value for a stay in such a beautiful old farmhouse!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The loft and property were so beautiful maintained. The property is very closely located to shops and restaurants but you would never know it, such a wonderful country oasis. The loft space was amazing and right amount for spacious and yet cozy, with a lovely sized bathroom. Highly recommend!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We would highly recommend this Airbnb! The hosts were kind, helpful, and communicative; they even offered a tour of the homestead, which was incredible to see and learn about the history. We could not be happier with the stay! Thank you!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved our stay here. Communication and check in was seamless. The property is beautiful. The loft inside is gorgeous! Beautifully appointed and so homey. The snack basket and local milk and sodas were such a nice touch. The bed was very comfortable and the loft was immaculate. We loved it.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"A very welcoming, unique and special place. I highly recommend this property for anyone looking for a clean, neat, well maintained and historically interesting stay."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and cozy, close to anything you may need."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Enjoyed our stay on the historic property with Esther and Elam. Very clean and well stocked. Many extras we were not expecting. Hosts gave us a private tour of the homestead and barn and explained their long family connection to the property. Plenty of outside space to relax. Took Elam’s advice to walk the trail at the county park right across the road. Path winds along the creek and over a footbridge with peaceful views of the water and wildlife.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The facilities were beautiful, the setting was magnificent and the hosts were even better. They were warm, personable and hospitable. We took a guided tour of the Stoltzfus house and were amazed at the transformation from what it was when acquired to what it is now. We were impressed with the vision they have for the future and plan to stay again. Esther and Elam have quite an interesting story themselves. We loved the accommodations, it was perfect for the two of us, the bed was comfortable.
You felt like you were in a remote area, but in reality, you were just hidden from the hustle and bustle that literally was all around you. It was immaculate in appearance. We stay in a lot of airbnb accommodations and this one was special hosted by terrific people."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb has everything I could have wanted for my short retreat. The bed is comfortable, the bathroom is bright & spacious, the kitchen is fully furnished. It is all beautifully decorated. Esther is great at communicating quickly & Elam is a gifted coffee roaster! Simply A Wonderful Spot!!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"There cannot be a better place to stay than this lovely apartment. It's cozy and beautifully appointed and decorated. The grounds are meticulously kept, the apartment is spotless, and the fridge is well stocked. The only reason to stay anywhere else would be if this apartment is already booked, and my hunch is that it will fill up quickly as word gets around. And the hosts--you won't find better anywhere. If you're staying overnight in the area, and you choose to book another place, just pause to reflect on what could have been. Then the next time stay here and you'll see what I'm talking about."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Elam & Esther were great hosts. The place is amazing, clean & they have made it a great home away from home."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Highly recommended! Peaceful, exceptionally clean and comfortable, quiet. Smelled like freshly cut wood (like a log cabin!). So many little thoughtful touches. Beautiful location for walking and biking. If I’m in the area again, I would absolutely stay here."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,It will be always my first choice in Reading…
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,I highly recommend this place. It was very well done and clean! Esther was a great host and was so pleasant to talk with. She left us snacks and some drinks in the fridge. Several local goodies as well. I would definitely stay again if I was in the area.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay! Elam and Esther are very gracious and welcoming. They had a basket of goodies for us as well as drinks in the fridge.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really couldn’t be happier with my stay. I rated each category with 5 stars and meant every one. It is a beautiful property run by a very kind and accommodating family. It is abundantly clear that they care deeply about their property and their role as hosts.
I would stay again just to spend more time enjoying the property and taking in the history.
-Scott"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the nicest people I've ever met! Esther is an incredible host and so, so accommodating!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Can't say enough good things about this rental! Really nice, private space with beautiful surrounding area. Very responsive hosts!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an awesome experience! Esther was an incredible host. The accommodations were beautiful, spotlessly clean, a very comfortable bed, and well-furnished for a renovated barn loft. You could also prepare a meal in the kitchen which was well equipped as well. And it was so quiet and peaceful. We also were able to get an excellent tour of the Stoltzfuss family heritage home as well (Thank you Elam). There’s a lot of history in this location. We would highly recommend this AirBnB if you’re looking for a very special time away! Thank you Esther for making our stay memorable!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I loved staying here! I have stayed here several times before this apartment was listed on AirBnB, and it has always been a delightful experience. I’m going to briefly talk about the hosts, the apartment itself, and the overall property.
The hosts: Elam and Esther are such sweet and thoughtful hosts! The fact that they place locally-made goodies for guests told me not only do they want guests to feel at home, but they probably have great recommendations of where to visit–and I was right on both counts. There’s a little guide of things to do in the area, and I felt comfortable asking for their perspectives about restaurants with vegetarian food and local thrift stores. They made me feel welcome, safe, and respected during my stay.
The apartment: Part of feeling welcome, safe, and respected was how the apartment is set up. I had my own door code, my own entrance, and the apartment is tucked away in a cute section of the barn above the house. The bed linens and towels were clean and crisp and an Amish quilt on the bed was a lovely homey touch. I mentioned the goodie basket (still can't get over the whoopie pies), but there was also coffee I could make, a whole kitchen set-up, and a fridge and freezer. Like a full-size one, not one of those dinky hotel ones. I loved the little breakfast nook and spent a pretty afternoon in the cute book nook by the window listening to birds and reading. I like nooks! You can tell the reading nook area is new because it still smells woodsy, which I loved.
The bathroom set up is a walk-in shower one with plenty of hooks to hang towels and clothes and space in front of the mirror to put toiletries. Everything functions as it should and just as importantly everything is CLEAN. The apartment is pretty quiet, though I will say if you don’t like birdsong bring a pair of earbuds! Making myself coffee, eating one of the local whoopie pies, and looking at the garden outside the window was a really cool experience, to be honest. It just has such good vibes.
The grounds: Finally, the overall place itself! Clearly Elam and Esther love to garden and take care of local critters, because there were so many birds, some little squirrels, some bats, and plenty of honeybees enjoying all the flowers. And the flowers are just so pretty–if you can go during Spring or early Summer, DO IT. The Nicholas Stoltzfus house is basically historic preservation in action, so if you’re a history buff they can tell you all the cool details about the area, what it takes to restore a heritage site, the archeology dig done, what happened to the Indigenous population, etc. If you’d rather be outdoors, there’s this awesome trail that runs behind the house and goes across the Tulpehocken river. You can walk, run, or bike it and it goes several miles before hitting this historic cluster of buildings and a covered bridge. It is super pretty regardless of what season it is. This place is perfect for a little meditative nature retreat. If you’d rather spend time in town, there are several small Amish/Mennonite hubs and the small city of Reading nearby, along with Penn State Berks being literally down the street. There’s always something going on and something to explore. So many local businesses and restaurants, too, it's wild being able to quickly go from this historic site to seeing fly fishing on a quiet river trail to visiting a bustling barcade.
I’m super excited to stay here again and would recommend it to anyone who likes flowers, birds, nature, history, Amish Country, Penn State, small city charm, great food, and welcoming environments. This place has something for everyone, and I really love it."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Very cute and clean apartment. Was Well furnished and even included some locally made snacks and drinks. Elam and Ester are a great host couple and I enjoyed chatting with them. Highly recommend stay!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is an absolute gem—from the warm country vibe to over-the-top hospitality to cleanliness and location, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a better AirBnB in the area.
Overall vibe: It was quiet, cozy, comfy. Like going to grandma’s house!
You can tell that hosts Esther
and Elam put a lot of thought into things. From everything large and small it was so special…it felt like coming home.

~~~

Some of my favorite moments of my stay:
I loved the homemade whoopie pie in the goodie bag. And the coffee is freshly roasted too, handpicked by your hosts.

I loved the nostalgic feel of the machines/appliances. Especially liked the Depression era table.

I loved being able to pull aside the lace curtain and look out at the stone house, imagining what life was like for the colonial family who once lived here. I had a great tour with Elam, who is enthusiastic about sharing the heritage of the place.
The bed is really comfy and it’s nice that the room is dark and fairly quiet. Plus I loved the smell of the wood—felt like I was in a country cabin."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"I really enjoyed my stay, I felt very comfortable! The hosts responded to my calls and texts so fast, they were friendly and understanding at every turn! The AC kept us cool on a summer night, we felt safe and welcomed in this luxury cabin. The amenities were right on point! Only issue we had was a few ants in the kitchen( I sent pics and the host’s graciously compensated us for this!) the place was CLEAN, so I do not think that is a reflection on them, ants randomly appear sometimes, especially at the start of summer! I don’t doubt that it will be taken care of quickly. Other than that minor item, everything was wonderful. The home was lovely, you are in a residential neighborhood (separated from neighbors with ALOT of trees) and about 20 minutes from shopping, restaurants etc. This was a great taste of secluded cabin life with surburb amenities, it was the perfect way to celebrate my bday with my sibs! We plan to rebook next year!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is beautifully designed and the hosts are very responsive and polite. We definitely want to stay here again in the future, I can’t recommend it enough. Fantastic experience all around."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very picturesque and peaceful location! Would be nice if there were slightly clearer instructions on how to work the heat and other small things, but not bad at all. Slight problem with leftover food from previous stays and ants as a result. Overall, a good weekend!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Alison's beautifully curated home was TOP tier (Target would be proud). There were quality linens, towels, toiletries, and even a snack to greet us. It felt so tranquil, especially the dual shower attachments, and lofted bedroom. They also provided local recommendations around the area. What a tranquil getaway. We hope to return again some day."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"Everything was just as pictured. Bed was very comfortable. Shower was amazing! Hot tub was really nice. I did however, think the water could have been hotter and the jets stronger, but it was still relaxing. The only few things I would recommend are
1. Have a partial covered area outside so if it’s raining guest have a place they can still go to enjoy the outdoors without getting soaked.
2. Since we were asked to remove our shoes before entering the house I would recommend having an area to store wet shoes besides the mat right inside the door. Luckily we knew it was rainy weather so we brought our own shoe tray.
3. Getting into the place was very frustrating especially in the pouring down rain. Once we figured out the lock it wasn’t as tricky, but by then we were soaked by the cold rain.
Other than those few things everything was great. Very clean,comfortable, cozy place to getaway from the daily grind. Host was very friendly and responsive. We would definitely stay again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved Robesonia! The home was easy to find, very clean, great amenities, and exactly like the pictures!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had an amazing stay at Alison's cabin. Just what we needed on our city road trip to relax and reset before moving on. I can't recommend this place enough. Peaceful, clean and well thought out. Thank you so much"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay that exceeded our expectations. Alison is a wonderful host who goes out of her way to ensure her guests are comfortable and well-taken care of. It was evident that she thought through every detail.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Alison’s place is nothing short of amazing.
The view, loft & bathroom are beautiful. The space is well maintained & we were provided with all of the necessities while still being free of clutter. For every hiccup, there was an instruction; and when there wasn’t, Alison and her husband were quick and happy to respond. They both are extremely understanding & accommodating.
It’s not a matter of IF we will come again, it’s WHEN."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin exceeded all our expectations! It is truly a beautiful space to be in with its double height living area and expansive window overlooking the forest.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"A hidden gem for anyone looking for a quiet retreat from the city! Booked a night here for my gf and I to celebrate my birthday and wish we could’ve stayed longer. This place is gorgeous, the photos somehow don’t even do it justice. Only a few miles from amazing antique shops, and restaurant options. But you’ll want to spend majority of your time in the home! It is peaceful, quiet and simply the perfect weekend getaway spot. I’ll be booking this place again and again in the future. I truly don’t have a single negative thing to say or suggest. Thank you so much Alison and family, we absolutely adored our stay in your breathtaking cabin! <3"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home! Especially magical with the snowfall!
Everything was super clean & the communication was top notch. They even thought ahead to get us snow removal the morning after a significant snow.

The comfy beds, overall cleanliness and amazing shower also added to the enjoyment of the quick 48 hours we had. You won’t regret booking this amazing home!!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,The stay was absolutely rejuvenating and worth it. The hot tub was excellent and the view was breathtaking to wake up to. A great and very comfortable stay.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alison & Jordan’s Airbnb was breathtaking. From the outdoor hot tub, to the beautiful view from the upstairs bedroom, everything was better than expected.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family stayed here for a long weekend and loved it! The kids enjoyed the hot tub and fire pit to roast marshmallows. The place had everything we needed and the town was only a couple minutes away. We enjoyed the large windows, especially when it started to snow!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriend and I had an amazing experience at this location! everything was in great condition (one of the bed frames was a little wiggly), the amenities listed were accurate and well maintained, the door lock was a little awkward at first, but the instructions were clear and easy to follow, the weather was cold and windy so the main room stayed on the cooler side (due to the amazing windows not due to any drafts) but the wood stove and cozy throw blankets kept us warm. overall I'm hoping to go back again soon!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a beautiful home
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first trip as a couple without children and we wanted a quiet weekend to recharge. Overall, that’s what we got. The home was clean and the perfect size for a couple. If you are looking for space to lounge there’s not much room for that especially if there is someone tall in your group. ."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Their home is beautiful!!! I was nervous I’ve never used Airbnb and I’m so happy I chose to stay here the home is exactly as pictured, it’s tucked into the woods and feels very private yet you’re just minutes from anything you could need. They are amazing hosts and we appreciate the opportunity to stay in their home. We already can’t wait to go back and stay longer."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful escape. Just close enough for easy access but at a location that made you feel you were miles away. Simple and thoughtful home design, great for couples looking for a nice weekend away. We used it as a mini-moon to decompress from our wedding . The firepit, indoor wood furnace, and hot tub created a great atmosphere to relax and reflect. A full kitchen allowed us to enjoy some home cooked meals and a great balcony to relax outside and enjoy a morning coffee with an amazing view. Additionally, Ali was super responsive, cordial, and accommodative. We'll certainly be back often!"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Alison’s place was beautiful!! We loved how trendy the inside was and the minimalistic feel made us focus on other things instead of technology. We had an absolute great time! Highly recommend the wineries in the area and the bbq place nearby! Alison was very helpful when we had an issue and offered to help immediately with it. Communication was great and so was the space overall.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a great place to get away from everything for a few days.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, this is the kind of place you tell all your friends and family about. My friends and I enjoyed a relaxing weekend getaway in this absolutely gorgeous, luxury cabin. We enjoyed the amazing hot tub, cooked meals in the squeeky clean kitchen, and had sunrise yoga on the deck. Our favorite day ended up being the day it rained because of how beautiful it was to watch the rain through the glass. Standouts were the comfy linens and the invigorating shower. I could not recommend this cabin enough and plan to visit many more times!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was immaculate and beautiful! It was the perfect getaway for a mental reset. I will definitely stay here again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely stunning place. Had everything we could ask for. Thoroughly enjoyed the deck and hot tub. Would definitely stay here again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place is exactly like the pictures you see on the app. Very peaceful and romantic. Jordan was very responsive when we had trouble with the electric lock and facetimed us to make sure we did it right.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved our stay for our minimoon and can’t wait to return next year! Even better than the pictures and the hosts were great!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely beautiful!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was very clean and the kitchen was very modern. We had a super relaxed time just soaking in the views and hanging in the hot tub. The weather was terrible but the hosts were super helpful and responsive if we had any issues. Rain or shine this is was a great location for a girls weekend and I would absolutely rent again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,Alison has a real gem of an offering with this airbnb. If you are trying to get away and spend time together I would absolutely recommend this place. We went there on our honeymoon and couldn’t have been happier. Alison was very responsive when we asked about using the streaming on the tv. We did use our own DisneyPlus account. The place was extremely clean and appeared well kept. The only thing to be aware of is they do ask that you leave your shoes outside. For us that was not ideal because it rained the first and last days there. But we made it work. My wife and I would definitely enjoy staying there again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful getaway that’s not to far from town but just the right distance so you have peace and quiet. Was absolutely beautiful inside and out and was exactly the relaxing getaway we needed.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely stunning property and amazing host! Perfect place to disconnect from the world and retreat! Alison welcomed us with a surprise gift as we stayed here for our honeymoon! Made us feel invited and welcomed, having the home ready for us. We will definitely be back. Absolutely perfect, can’t say enough good things!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the best time staying at Texter Mountain House! The cabin is gorgeous and looks just like the photos. Alison is a wonderful host: extremely helpful, very communicative and responsive. You can tell this is a very special spot and it made our weekend stay perfect. The cabin is very serene and the deck is beautiful. We would love to come back again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,10/10
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at this private little cabin in the woods. Alison was very responsive, directions were clear, home was very clean and well appointed. We loved the loft and the outdoor living space. The shower is awesome. Appreciated the full glass door in the shower vs a drafty glass panel we've experienced at other homes. We didn't read the directions fully upon arrival so it took us a little while to find the microwave. And we'd prefer a traditional coffee maker to a pour over. BUT those were tiny little things that certainly were not problematic. This home offered us an opportunity to unplug, regroup, and refresh as a couple. Highly recommend the hike just a few minutes up the road at Texter Mountain Preserve. Only a two-mile loop, but moderate difficulty with pretty steep sections. Great for some exercise. The bed linens were very comfy!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Texter Mountain was a beautiful and private get away. Would 100% recommend to anyone wanting to get away from all the hustle and bustle!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Booked to give my wife a stress free wooded getaway peaceful retreat and this place did not disappoint at all!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay very much and would recommend it to anyone interested in a quiet getaway.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I stayed at Texter Mountain Home for our 8 year anniversary. It was the perfect relax, reset and recharge that we needed! The house was gorgeous and just like the pictures! The secluded location was so peaceful and quiet. It was very clean and cozy. All the special touches of decor inside and outside were so pretty and made it feel like home. The hot tub was so refreshing at night and a great size for just one couple to enjoy it. We would definitely like to return again in the future!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here with my partner to celebrate our anniversary. Overall, 10/10! Place was clean and just as beautiful as it looks in the pictures. Host was kind, responsive, and helpful throughout the stay. The house is situated in a perfect location-separated enough to feel quiet and intimate, yet central enough to still feel like you are around civilization. The house is a little warm during the summer- one AC unit is responsible for cooling the entire space minus the bedroom and the constant sunlight during the day doesn’t help- but the view more than makes up for it in my opinion. Finally, you will definitely need to drive if you wish to see what the surrounding area has to offer, but the location is central enough to everything that you never need more than 20 minutes to get to the next trail or eatery. We hope to return again in the future!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to spend some peaceful time with your family in the nature. The hot tub was the star of the show and everyone enjoyed it. Perfect place to just relax.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place with an amazing review!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing- absolutely what I expected based on the photos. If you are considering this spot- book it! I did a 3 day reset here with my partner and our two best friends. I am so glad I booked my time here. Its quiet and prívate environment. I would absolutely stay here again. Alison was a great host- very responsive and available to answer questions.

The amenities they provided and extra attention to detail was greatly appreciated. Thank you for a wonderful getaway!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alison's cabin was perfect for our anniversary. Secluded, private and completely tranquil. The beds were comfy, bathroom and kitchen well equipped, the outside space was well thought out and had everything in working order.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I don’t know where to even begin! Ali and Jordan were so kind, unbelievably response, and accommodating.

We used the fire pit outside while having some cocktails and taking in the beautiful views of nature. The inside was pristine and as described.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place! Ali and Jordan were very responsive and communication couldn’t have been better. You will feel at peace as soon as you walk in the door. The cleanliness and aesthetic of this home is very inviting. We thoroughly enjoyed the natural light, loft bedroom with mountain views and the hot tub. The design and amenities of this home are well thought out, making for a cozy, comfortable stay. We had a very relaxing time and hope to return in the future. You will not be disappointed if you book this place!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,the perfect location to relax and unwind
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I enjoyed our stay and absolutely admired the design of the house! Thank you, Alison, for messaging me back so promptly!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed one night here for my husband’s birthday. It’s truly a beautiful place, and we would recommend it. However, the hot tub took longer than we anticipated to warm up. It took nearly 3 hours to get from 85 to 95. I guess we could have waited 3 more, but that was a bummer since the hot tub was a big part of the reason we booked. Something to keep in mind if you’re specifically looking for that."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The best little get away! Super clean, cozy, amazing amenities, felt right at home, wish we stayed longer!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I booked this place as a surprise Christmas trip for my girlfriend.

The location was somewhat secluded and very peaceful. It even snowed for us on our last morning! We will definitely be booking again in the future!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Loved the location and the hot tub was amazing.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,The cabin was so beautifully designed and clean. It was made with such intention and felt like staying in a magazine. Every nook was filled with natural light and custom touches. We will be back for sure!
2022-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Amenities were as described. Was disappointed that the hot water could not last for one shower, let alone the three people staying at the property."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home, prompt communication"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Alison’s place was so amazing to stay at for 5 beautiful days!

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An incredibly cozy getaway! Everything was well thought out to accommodate our stay.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This mountain home was great! We stayed for a few days and everything was perfect. I couldn’t quite figure out how to work the AC/Heat but that might just be because I’m dumb. We were comfortable so it didn’t really matter. I’d definitely recommend this place.

It was the perfect set-up for our family of 4: the kids slept in the downstairs bedroom and parents slept upstairs. The large deck was perfect for playing outside during the day. We already cannot wait to return."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is so special!
It is very well thought out and designed with care. It was so relaxing and I think the first Airbnb where we didn’t leave from check in until checkout - we didn’t want to leave the space!
Everything from the outdoor fire pit and hot tub which were perfect on a cool fall evening - to the inside wood stove and beautiful kitchen to cook meals… and the bathroom! The shower is amazing!!
We would absolutely stay here again and will recommend to all of our friends in the area!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were asked one morning in my bible study (as an ice breaker), ""if you could go anywhere in the world, where would you want to go?"" ... my answer was, I would go anywhere that is on an insta influencer post. my feed is full of vacation spots and little secluded cabins in the woods. Finding this spot filled every bit of my desire to feel like we were somewhere special and secluded. Aesthetically spot on. Super clean. The hosts were easy to get ahold of when needed. Being here gave us all the feels. Romantic and cozy. We will be back!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Odel was a great host with a beautiful apartment! My husband and I felt right at home while we were there. The only downside was the few parking available (this being a reading issue). Overall It was a great stay !

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay especially if you are going to the Santander Arena. Walking distance to the arena and close to the Pogada. Clean area and spacious for 3 people. We didn’t have enough blankets so bring your own, the owner was really responsive and let us know they have extra things for guests in a storage room. (I didn’t message the owner when I realized we needed more blankets since it was really late but we worked it out) this airbnb is walking distance to many restaurants. The bed is very comfortable and clean. The bathroom was clean and really nice. We will be coming back!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,True to description & easy check in! Very clean and great location.

I'm sure I'll be back and stay where Odel will be there without thinking!!"
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"A good place to stay for sure, I would absolutely stay here again. Though I do have a few gripes. The TV in the living room was WAY outdated, we couldn't get anything to work on it since they stopped making update patches for that TV probably 10 years ago. The Wi-Fi was also not exactly great, we could only really get it to work in the bedroom. All of that aside, it was a very comfortable place to stay, and it was right near everything we needed to do. Thank you!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Odel’s place is a gem in this city! The space was very clean and safe and there’s was lots to do!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Odel was absolutely amazing. After the airline misplaced our baggage he went out of his way to accept our luggage while we were out and dropped it off to the apartment for us. He was super helpful, fast to respond and everything was exactly as described. Thank you so much for a pleasant stay from the UK"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Odel’s place was very homey and comfortable. Everything you needed on your getaway was there. I had a wonderful time and get relax time. I would stay there again when I visit if available. Thank you for allowing us to stay in your home.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Odel's place was a great spot for our stay in Reading. The flat is super spacious and had great amenities. Odel was super responsive to our questions when we arrived.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was a great place to stay and was an easy walk to the Santander Arena.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My only complaint was the parking situation. It's street parking which isn't horrible but it is definitely something to keep in mind. The walls were also thin but that is usually the case with apartments. The apartment itself was great! Clean and cozy, it had a nice layout and was decorated cute. The shower had great pressure. The bed was really comfortable and so were the pillows. Odel was a great hostess. She responded quickly and was very kind. If i ever come back to Reading I'd be happy to stay again."
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Place was nice “balcony” view wasn’t good..
Location is sort of shady"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Odel’s apartment was very inviting & homey. I enjoyed that. It seemed as pictured. The small things like a book with where to find parking, food near by, & the shampoo& conditioner were a nice touch. Odel was very accommodating & quick with responses."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a good stay at Odel’s place. Check in was very smooth and easy.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great place to stay at, very nice and clean!"

2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This place is so close to the main avenue, theaters, museums, markets, transportation, and for such a bargain. It’s a large place with plenty of room. If you’re in town for a show or visit it’s pretty perfect."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Neat little apartment, clean and well equipped. Very easy self check in procedure"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great experience ! although parking is very difficult in the city the airbnb itself is very nice, spacious, clean, and safe."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely spacious apartment. Beautiful decorated. Comfortable bed. Large shower. Really a lovely place to stay in downtown Reading. Easy walk to venues.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I came to a concert at the arena, and it was perfect for that. The only problem was the parking was a bit tricky, I luckily had a friend who was staying at the hotel down the street so we were able to park there the entire time, and we didn’t move it the entire time because it was so walkable. Walked too and from the arena during the day and at night and never had a problem."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super attentive and kind. As for the super clean, comfortable and super central apt, everything is close."
2022-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Odel was very responsive and helpful. The area was a little run down and the city does not keep the area very clean which is unfortunate but the apt met my needs while visiting family in the area. The bed was very comfortable and it was quiet in the apt, even over the weekend which I was concerned about at first. Parking is ok, free from 6pm until 8am which worked ok for me as I was gone most of the day and didn't get back until after 6 and would leave before 8am but if you like to sleep in, it could be an issue."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The stay was great, apartment was clean and very spacious. The balcony was a good bonus."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,Beautiful apartment and had a wonderful stay
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome little apartment. . Location is good even though parking is rough still worth the stay. very clean and if a coffee lover like me.. they have it stocked with coffee..would recommend
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My fiance and I were staying for a concert at the Reverb. Check in was super easy. Apartment was super clean and smelled lovely. It had everything we needed to make a quick late night meal. Santander and Reverb are within walking distance.
2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Hosts were pleasant. Area was spacious with lots of seating. No problems with check-in. Location was a little sketchy, but close to downtown and the arena where we went to see a concert. I won't go into details about cleanliness but there were a few things that weren't as clean as they could have been. Dishes were not put away from previous guests and there was no salt, pepper, or cooking oil in the kitchen so we had to make a trip to the store. Other than that overall we enjoyed our stay."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,👍
2022-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I were attending an event at the Santander Performing Arts Center, so we made a weekend of it. Odel’s was a short walk to both the Santander Performing Arts Center and also the Santander Arena. Parking is on the street, but we were there for the weekend so we parked in the school lot next door with no issue (signs only prohibit weekdays). There were also 2 parking garages I noticed in short distance. The check-in/out process couldn’t have been smoother and all of the regular necessities were provided (towels, coffee maker, kitchen ware, etc). There was also a welcome book with maps and suggestions, which we found very helpful. Everything was as described. Overall it was a good value for the money.
For anyone wondering about the area, it may appear a little sketchy but at NO time did we feel unsafe. Surrounding area is very well lit and there was not much movement on the street directly in front of the apartment.
Would definitely stay again!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,It’s amazing place to stay in
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was great. I highly recommend staying here.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment matched the description. Place was clean and very spacious. Check-in was simple and hassle free. Apartment was spacious, comfortable and had everything we needed. Had to drive around a bit the first night to find parking but the other nights we were able to park within a block or so with out any issue. Would definitely stay again."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I shared Odel's spot with my sister! We enjoyed how spacious it was, and had no problem sharing the space. Odel was open with communication. We had no issues with parking, did have to park down the street a little one night but the area is well lit! Enjoyed our stay."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,i will definitely be coming back place was very clean and very peaceful
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little apartment! Super cozy and clean.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Close to major event center and conference center. Had no problem walking to and from my meetings. Clean and quiet. Parking is on your own and somewhat limited nearby. Great host.
2021-09-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place and close to Santander Arena if you are staying the weekend for a concert. Check in was smooth. However, one night into our stay we were surprised by a mouse in the living room and had to call the host immediately. Odel was attentive and came into the unit and placed mouse traps. However, the host knew that there had been a mice in another unit and didn’t even warn us. We have to leave the unit one night earlier than our original stay. Would recommend to ask if this problem has been solved before renting out."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"extremely nice apartment, the parking is definitely rough. if you drive around while you are not in a rush and find a space a few blocks away it's fine, but you just need to make sure you stick to streets that are well lit. I would avoid 10th.
extreme value in this cost, but you just have to be smart about your safety in this area."
2021-08-01,3,Stayed a few nights,It need more privacy
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was great made me feel like I was home
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Very nice, very clean, and feels very safe. The neighborhood was a little bit sketchy as a single woman showing up late at night but during the day it’s really nice and I felt really safe in the apartment at night!"
2021-08-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Impoverished and unsafe neighborhood. Many bad drivers, drunks, addicts and active gangs on the same street. If you are respectful, mind your own business and don't spend too much time outside after 5 or 6 pm you'll probably be fine but there's a big risk of getting mugged. Parking situation is vastly overstated. Very inconvenient and not safe. First night took about 10 minutes trying to find a space only to have someone (local) park their bumper on our bumper, push it in and left their car like that all night long for us to discover in the morning. The next evening no parking at all. Ended up paying for parking a few blocks down at the court house garage($12/night) and take a small hike through the rough neighborhood back to the apt to avoid any further issues. This would be exceptionally annoying if you had anything heavy to carry.
The apartment suite is secure. Its nothing elaborate but its generally clean, updated and comfortable. A few rough edges but nothing worth mentioning other than wash the dishes before you use them. We do that anyways.
Really depends what you want to do here. For us it was more hassle and stress than it was worth. I would not stay here again nor would I recommend this to anyone solely based on the neighborhood and parking. Its just not worth the risk but should you choose to you will find the owner is personable and accommodating and the apt was comfortable."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in Reading for Berks Jazz Fest. This location was ideal for our purposes. Neighborhood is diverse and centrally located for navigating the area. Odel's communication was prompt. The space was accommodating...very spacious. Bed was VERY comfy and shower was definitely appreciated. It's small things that matter...we saw homage to The Pagoda and other hints representative to this area. Parking was not a major issue for us. CHOOSE THIS SPOT...expose yourself culturally, you won't regret it!"
2021-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was quite a bit bigger than anticipated! The living room had a door so you could use it as a separate sleeping area as well. There were nice updates and a homey feel throughout the apartment. As stated by the owner, parking is challenging, especially at night.
The apartment cleanliness was good overall. I did notice that some of the silverware was not clean and there were dishes on the counter when we checked in. The rug in the living room could have used a cleaning, and there were no washcloths for the bathroom. But the addition of shampoo and conditioner was great! The owner also offers Netflix, which was a huge perk!
Having an air conditioner in both the living room and the bedroom was very appreciated! They did a great job cooling off the entire apartment when we checked in.
We felt very safe and comfortable in the apartment."
2021-08-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"Based on our stay, not a place for those with bad allergies or asthma. Keep an eye out when you’re in the local area, especially at night. Bed was uncomfortably soft. Great for traveling to Lancaster, West Reading and other nearby locations of interest. Charming space—think divey but for an apartment."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Odel’s place was right in the midst of Reading and easy to access. The sleek and near-digital keypad on the door was very handy and convenient. The place was very nice and spacious, particularly for the price. Do not pass up on this chance provided the opportunity."
2021-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice big comfortable stay
2021-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I had a nice time staying at this place. The apartment is very spacious and at very convenient location. The host provided a booklet with all the necessary information. Odel responded quickly for my usual questions.
Parking is on the street. Free from 6pm to 8 am."

2021-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Apartment was fine. Kitchen counter had some dirty spots, and food was left in the oven.
Parking was atrocious, and it is not in a good neighborhood."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Odel’s stay in Reading was great! The pictures definitely do not do the place justice, and the host was extremely helpful. I enjoyed this stay, will keep this in mind for future references!"

2020-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The place was very nice, and had everything you could need in an airbnb. The host was very quick with responses, and helpful. The only downside was parking. There was never an available spot on the free streets, and it took at least 15 minutes each trip back to find something open. But, that’s expected in a busy city. Everything else, though, was great."
2020-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,The owners respond in a timely manner. The place had everything we needed and more to accommodate my family of four. The place was nice and clean and felt safe with the locked doors and camera. The parking wasn't a problem if you can parallel park.

2019-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"The apartment is in a terrific location and is very secure! There is a security camera out front and there are two inside the common hallway, one pointed at the interior door to the apartment. I felt very secure leaving my work laptop and other belongings at the apartment while I was out at the concert at the Reverb. I had absolutely no complaints and hope to stay at Odel's apartment the next time a concert brings us to lovely Reading PA!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location! Clean and comfortable space.
2019-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Odel’s place was great, would definitely recommend"
2019-11-01,2,Stayed one night,The place was find inside but the surrounding area was so sketchy we ended up not staying and drove home.
2019-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was very spacious, clean and pleasantly decorated. Good value for the price point.
Only issue was finding parking in the area, which was communicated to us before hand.
Will recommend to others and consider upon our return to Reading to visit family again in the future."

2019-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Odel’s place was exactly what we needed! Everything was easy to find, parking was free for us and we got a spot right a around the corner. Also the window units and ceiling fans made it super comfortable on a hot summer day!"

2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Very clean and quiet. Easy check in. Odel was very communicative and accommodating.
2019-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Check in at the apartment was a little bit of a mess as the cleaning lady hadn't shown up and the apartment was being cleaned as I arrived at 4:30pm. I wasn't to put out by this as I had some things that I could do and Odell offered a 10% refund for the inconvenience. The neighborhood itself seems a little sketchy although we had no problems and parking seemed pretty easy most evenings. The mattress in the bedroom seems very firm to me so if you like that then you will be fine, I'm usually a soft sleeper but had no problem going to sleep."
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Odel was very quick with responses! The apartment was very comfortable!
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very amazing space , very cozy and I would definitely spend another night here at Odell’s home ! I recommend this place 100% !"

2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great space and great hosts. Would definitely stay here again.
2019-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The apartment was nicely sized, very well equipped, and clean. Odel is a very thoughtful host and included many personal touches, like nice smelling shampoo and conditioner in the shower, coffee in the kitchen, and a book with suggestions of where to eat along with directions to the Santander Arena. The apartment was nicely decorated with Caribbean and Japanese art. They really thought of everything! Odel was also kind and responsive to all of my questions upon arrival.
My son and I drove 4 hours from Pittsburgh to Reading to see a concert and it was really nice to have a place to get ready, relax, and sleep afterwards. There was much more space than a hotel room, with the convenience of a kitchen, and the price was much better than local hotels. If I travel to Reading in the future, I will definitely look into staying there again. And I would recommend to friends and family too!"
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was an amazing place to stay at me and my boyfriend had an amazing time would love to stay there again. It was a really nice place clean and roomy
2019-04-01,5,Stayed one night,His place was very clean and welcoming. He put together a notebook of suggested restaurants in the area which also included suggest routes to different attractions that was very helpful for our overnight stay. Would recommend it to anyone coming into the area.
2019-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I had an appointment in Reading and needed a place to stay, so booked with Odel. It was raining and kind of late when I arrived, but Odel was very helpful in advising where to go to grab a bite, and had even offered to come accompany me as I was by myself and it was getting on close to 10pm. I was able to find a store and grab a few things on my own. Odel was very quick in his replies.
*** Note to future guests though: stop at a larger grocery store before coming and get what you need. The little stores are fine but they’ll charge more and may not have everything you need. ***"
2019-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fast communication, easy check-in, great location. Would definitely stay here again!"
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing location cozy sparking clean and def will stay again deff top pic balcony made it even better. Host is very prompt with responses never takes long to answer.

2018-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great host

2018-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Odel was very friendly and responsive. He was accommodating and ensured that the place was clean and ready when we arrived. We enjoyed our stay and would stay here again if we came back.
2018-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a cute, beautifully decorated, clean apartment! Odel was so helpful and understanding and made the AirBnB process a breeze. The perfect place to stay, close to many attractions in downtown Reading!"
2018-10-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Odel’s apartment was spacious with a nice bed and shower. Definately a good value for the money.
Pros: It’s walking distance to all of downtown Reading, check in and check out were very easy.
Cons: Neighborhood - Downtown Reading is a bit rundown, so walking about at night is uncomfortable, especially alone, the only parking is the one hour meters on the street, and you will hear noise from outside."
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If we ever return to Reading, we will likely stay here again."
2018-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely suite. The amenities were great. The house is painted a different color than the pictures. But, other than that, it was great. I enjoyed my stay."
2018-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"Odell’s place was extremely neat and clean, with a lot of thoughtful touches. It has modern furnishings and decor. He was very prompt about getting back to me on any question I had."
2018-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Would definitely stay again!
2018-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The apartment was very easy to find, the apartment was redone and different from pictures and beautiful. The host had a binder with food options and recommended areas of town. Very clean and tidy and definitely large enough for 2-4 people."
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice space. Clean and spacious. Downtown is pretty sketchy though.
2018-09-01,5,Stayed one night,The central location in downtown Reading made it easy to get around the metro area
2018-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,The apartment was very clean and host communicated very quickly
2018-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,Was affordable and had quick responses.
2018-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Place is neat and quiet! Spacious and cozy! It is surrounded by carryouts and some smallgrocery stores. Mostly street parking around the premises.
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great host, great communication. Check in was easy, and it was nice and clean on the inside. Water pressure was good, and there were plenty of nearby stores to pick up other necessities. Would stay again if we travel nearby sometime in the future."
2018-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful 3 room apartment, right in downtown Reading. Responsive host, laundromat right next door."
2018-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice space, very clean and neat. Great host and very accommodating to our needs. Would recommend !"
2018-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay here while attending a convention at the San Tan Der arena! It's about a block and a half walk. Make sure to read Odell's suggested walking route to avoid some bad areas to walk through as this is not the best/safest part of reading. With that being said, we felt very safe in our second floor apartment with two locked doors you must go through. There were a few loud neighbors playing music late but with the air conditioner on, and having a back bedroom off the street, you could not hear it! The space was very clean and had everything you could need. Parking was easy to find a block away on 10th St when we couldn't find a closer spot on Moss St. The only improvement's I would suggest are a better mattress that didn't sink in the middle, and a full length mirror. I would definitely stay here again."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The apartment is absolutely gorgeous, nicely decorated, spacious, very clean! We were only there for one night, but it would be a great place for a longer-term stay with a good kitchen, a nice living room with lots of seating, and a dining area. The host very thoughtfully put on the air conditioning before we arrived, as it was a hot day -- SO NICE to come into and just relax!"
2018-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,We would stay there again!
2018-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,We had a great time at Odel place. The communication was easy and quick and the place looks exactly like it does on the picture. The apartment is very quiet! Would absolutely recommend to stay there!
2018-06-01,3,Stayed one night,"The place is more spacious than we anticipated with all of the necessities, including toiletries like shampoo and conditioner. The communication was great and the entry process was simple enough. As another reviewer mentioned, it is near a part of town that feels more urban–bail bondsmen around the corner, a fair number of empty shops, laundromats, etc.–but the place itself feels very safe and secure with a keypad entry to the hallway and then a handle lock and deadbolt for the main apartment door. A basic, no frills apartment, but it is well-equipped with all the necessities in the downtown area of Reading. The host communicates quickly and is eager to please guests."
2018-06-01,3,Stayed one night,The front door seemed that I could be easily broken into even when its locked. Also was very hot in the rooms.
2018-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Rene was very helpful to us during our stay providing items we needed and communication was great. The apartment was in a great location to Santander Arena. I would definitely stay there for future trips to the area.
2018-05-01,3,Stayed with kids,Bare bones and a bit noisy. Served our purposes as a place to crash while climbing at the Birdsboro Quarry.
2018-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderfully located just a very short walk from the Santander Arena! Awesome, old fashioned architecture with a vibrant local community made for some great conversations and great eats. The apartment is roomy, cute, and the balcony is on the inside so it’s private! I look forward to staying again!"
2018-05-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"Rene was kind enough and tried to be communicative, but did not answer us for hours at a time. The place is a good value and relatively spacious and clean. The place is in a pretty rough area though. No WiFi or tv. Tv there but only has one channel. The door to the apartment is super easy to pop open with a credit card and is not secure. Many of the outlets do not work in the main bedroom. The bed is super uncomfortable and warped and dips
To the center. For one person it’s not terrible as you can sleep in the middle of the bed, but for two people it doesn’t really work. The kitchen is also lacking. There is hardly any silverware or appropriate utensils and plates. Decent budget Airbnb for one person, not so great for multiple people."
2018-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Rene was an amazing host! Lightning fast responses to all my messages made it so easy for all my needs to be met. Rene is such a considerate host in a way that I can’t fully explain until you’re there. If he could be my Airbnb host each time, I’d consider myself blessed. A million thank yous!!"
2018-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice apartment close to Santander Arena. Quick tip for anybody planning on staying here: if you want food late at night, you will not find anything nearby. Only in West Reading is there a diner open 24 hrs. Also, Penn Ave is not safe after 11 PM. Stay inside."
2018-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Centrally located flat in downtown Reading in the court district, nice spacious rooms on the first floor. Neighborhood is ok, parking spaces can be found in the neighborhood. Rather quiet, no problems."
2018-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Rene was extremely responsive and the place was super clean and very close to the downtown area. I would highly recommend this spot!
2018-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This was pretty good overall. The picture of the deck is a little misleading as it overlooks a very small back area. The host was fabulous and very attentive. The rental served its purpose for me as I just needed a place to stay due to an internship.
2018-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"This is a clean space within walking distance of the Santander Arena, Fine Arts Center, and the Goggleworks Factory for the arts, as well as a big park and plenty of downtown architecture. Rene, the host, is pleasant, responsive, and was generous with us...there were plenty of water bottles in the fridge, some snack bars on the table, and a coupon for free pastry in their family bakery."
2018-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect spot of Santander arena concerts. Clean house!
2017-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,It looks recently renewed but the forniture is not really nice or new. It was mostly clean but not 100%. Generally I would say is 3/4 stars apartment and 5 star host.
2017-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place! Very clean. Highly recommend this place.
2017-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was spectacular. Perfect location for Santander Arena, is a block away. It is in the center of everything. Great amenities! This is a great value space."
2017-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fantastic airbnb experience! Rene was great with communication and the self check-in process was a breeze. The unit is exactly as pictured- clean, cozy, and spacious with thoughtful decorations throughout. I was able to find free parking on Moss St without any problem. Highly recommended!"
2017-11-01,4,Stayed one night,"Clean, great location for events at Santander, very quick responses from Rene"
2017-10-01,5,Group trip,was great value for money!
2017-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Rene's place was clean and spacious and she graciously let us check-in early so we could drop our bags before attending a wedding. This was a convenient place to stay with more character, space and value than the hotel off the highway that was our alternative. Thanks Rene!"
2017-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great host!! I booked it at the last second and showed up an hour later and couldn't have been more perfect!!
2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Very clean and comfortable, good location with nice neighbors. Rene is a great host, very kind and helpful. Would comeback for sure."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Even before we arrived Denise stayed in communication with us. She gave very clear instructions and wished us well for our event. The day we got there we were greeted by a nice card and whoopie pies for the family to enjoy. The house was gorgeous! Very clean! Peaceful and beautiful surroundings! The hot tub was perfect if you follow the very clear instructions! We will definitely Stay again if in the area.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If I could give 10 stars I would. My husband and I had planned to use this as a base to explore Reading, but once checked in, we did not want to leave! The outdoor deck with hot tub and gas fire pit were so inviting. Being on the edge of a nature preserve, we heard only the sounds of the breeze and a chorus of birds from morning til evening. My niece and her husband met us here for a hike in the Neversink Loop and to the ""Witch's Hat"" (pavilion from an old hotel). They were excited to see their first Indigo Bunting in the woods, and I was excited to ID many bird songs that I haven't heard before. The inside of the house was equally inviting, spotlessly clean and so peaceful and uncluttered. The kitchen was spacious and very well equipped. We especially loved the rainshower in the bath. We decided to only leave the place for a celebratory dinner at Judy's on Cherry in Reading, and for hikes in the preserve. I hope to return again in the near future!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Denise was excellent! We do loved be there, house is beautiful, the hot tub was great! Really want to go back"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Denise’s place was beautiful and very peaceful and relaxing! Denise was very responsive when we communicated with her and even came to bring us more propane for the grill when we mentioned it was low. The surroundings were beautiful, nice place to go for a hike or stroll. There was a lot of wisteria blooming on and around the property this time of year and it made it feel magical. The home was very clean and modern and had everything we needed for a comfortable relaxing stay. The hot tub was a great experience and all the instructions were very clear and simple. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice get-away and we hope to come back again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean and modern home, just off a city street but nestled in the woods. It was perfect and private for us. Denise was very helpful and responsive. The beds were harder than I like but I tend to favor extremely soft beds. We loved the rain shower and enjoyed the secluded hot tub. I would stay here again when visiting the city. Great location."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was spotless, and only 5 minutes away from the Santander Arena which was my reason for the stay. The hot tub was AWESOME!!!! Follow Denise directions they are much better than GPS"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Private, quiet, close to Reading, great value"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! What a beautiful and peaceful stay! The home is absolutely perfect, so do not hesitate to book this little slice of Eden. It is very private and quiet. There is a park with hiking trails that you can access from the backyard. Although we had rain most of our stay, we already booked to come back and hopefully, will be able to enjoy the beautiful mountain. The home has everything you need for your stay, was perhaps the cleanest Airbnb we have ever stayed in, and so incredibly comfortable in every way. We received a lovely note and local treats upon our arrival.. such a warm and welcoming touch. Denise was a perfect host and had perfect communication. The hot tub is the icing on the cake at this adorable cottage. We enjoyed it each evening, even in the rain. It was one of the quietest places we have stayed, as well, so you could get much needed rest. Thank you so much, Denise and Jason! We can not wait to return."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a hidden gem!!!
Great place to relax!!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Worth every penny to get away and get some quiet. Doesn’t feel like Reading at all! Feels like you could be anywhere in the world which is exactly what I wanted.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One word describes our stay, EXCEPTIONAL. If you are looking for the quintessential romantic weekend getaway, this is the place. Not only is it private and beautiful, they thought of everything down to leaving us baked goods from a local bakery! The grounds are fabulous and hotub was perfect! I can't say enough about the thoughtful intention that was put into the property and really created an experience for us. Not only that but Denise was incredibly kind, responsive, warm and an all around fantastic host. We highly recommend and will definitely return in the future. 5 stars all the way!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were in town for a wrestling tournament. Having a house to stay in with a family of 4 was so much more relaxing than trying to cram into a hotel.

The destination was exactly what we were looking for. We were able to get away and turn off at this peaceful get away! There were so many things to do around the house, the amenities and the hot tub were perfect. There were even nearby hikes surrounding us on the little mountain nearby and on the property.
Denise's customer service was also amazing! She was very easy to talk to and she even had local pastries waiting for us at check in which were amazing! I did leave my coat behind and she is even working to get that back to me.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at this location was absolutely wonderful! The house is beautiful, inside AND out! I cannot speak for summer views and foliage, but the lack of foliage in the winter months made for a wonderful view of the city below, as well as the montains and Pagoda Skyline across from us. The hot tub was so relaxing after a few hikes we did. Everything was spotless when we arrived. Denise had left us a cute little card wishing us a nice stay and a happy anniv. and left us some locally made treats. Would recommend to others and will certainly return at some point to share the views and easy access to hiking and other activities with our kiddos! Enjoy!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was simply wonderful! We had everything we needed for a relaxing stay while being right on the outskirts of the city. Most of the time, I could not even tell we were so close!"

The whole house feels so cozy, no clutter, incredible use of space, and very comfortable. The kitchen appliances are so updated and wonderful, the furniture was comfortable, and the bathroom was stunning. The shower is HUGE and incredibly spacious and clean.
The hot tub was perfect, private, and completed the whole experience. The fire pits were an awesome touch and wonderful for s’mores.
The nature trails around the property was one of my favorite parts of my stay. Absolutely stunning views from all parts of the walks, and on the property itself.
The drive feels like you’ll be cramped with neighbors, but when you get to the property it’s as if you’re in your own little world.
My wife and I will be staying here again and we will be recommending this to all our friends and family.
WONDERFUL experience."

The house itself is absolutely gorgeous. The instructions for the hot tub were simple and concise and it was a perfect amenity to have after a nice long day!
Listening to the wild life while sitting outside by the propane lit fire place was lovely. The inside of the house was super clean and the feel for the whole house was warm and welcoming.
Overall it’s been an incredible stay and I would recommend this house to anyone who is looking for a peaceful escape from the world..while staying close to a “home” like city."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a beautiful and private little oasis. We spent afternoons relaxing by the propane fire pit, made dinner in the well-equipped kitchen, and unwound in the hot tub at night. Denise's instructions to get here were very clear--- and essential!
The driveway is gravel and a little steep-- we had no trouble at all, but we were glad that we hadn't taken my husband's sports car for the trip!
We'll be back!"

You can tell Denise cares about the guests and pays attention to details; there were things she did that were not expected such as she left some baked goodies from a local bakery as a treat for us. The house sits on top of a hill and is secluded by woods, and it was such a relaxing atmosphere; was exactly what we were hoping for. Preparing dinner one night; we were even surprised by a small deer family that came out of the woods to graze and we were able to watch them from the large window by the dinner table. We would highly recommend this host and her house, and we would definitely add this to our list of places to return to."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came to this house because our ""go-to"" Airbnb was booked for our anniversary weekend, and this house did not disappoint!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, what a gem! We came into town for a few festivities in the Reading area (Oktoberfest and Renn Faire) and this was the *perfect* home base! Close to everything (restaurants, grocery stores, the major highways) but feels like a quiet getaway in the woods. Everything was comfortable, clean, and clearly explained. We loved wathcing the deer and eagles while enjoying our coffee on the front and back patios. Denise was super communicative and accomodating. Hope we have another reason to come into town so we can stay here again! Thanks for a truly wonderful stay."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We could not even believe when we pulled up to the house that it existed in the area we drove through. It's so close to the neighborhood, but this is a house and property that looks like it doesn't even belong where it is. As soon as you pull up to the house you are in a complete Oasis. The house is beautiful, they did an amazing job creating a beautiful stay. The hot tub and deck area were clean and comfortable to hang out in. The bed was comfortable and clean. You have everything you need throughout the whole house, I have absolutely no complaints. Also, within a one minute walk we were able to access all of the hiking trails that are right behind the house. We did a nice long 5 mile loop and it was beautiful. I honestly would come back to Reading just to stay here again, it was that relaxing and nice. Thank you for being an amazing host as well, Denise! She was very responsible and communicative. We would definitely recommend 100%. Thanks again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely amazing.. the cottage was beyond beautiful. Everything was immaculate, from the inside to the outside.

We enjoyed everything, the kitchen, the rainfall shower, the fire place, the comfortable beds, spacious rooms, outside deck with fire pit, hot tub, grill and the relaxing front porch.
Denise was very informative and made sure we were taken care of.
*Bonus for the directions she sent.
It was very easy to find.
Definitely the best place we've stayed for our Annual Girls Trip."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Overall we had a great stay! Host was very responsive and the house was very accommodating. We saw so much wildlife and enjoyed the outdoor space. We didn't realize the property was at the edge of town though and twice we had people randomly walk or drive on the property confused where they were. It wasn't a big deal but we thought the property was more remote when we booked and weren't expecting that. We would recommend to others looking for a weekend away!

Her place is so beautiful and private. The place was spotlessly clean, smelled wonderful, and the heating so nice and warm. Several, warm blankets in the living room to curl up under. The beds were so nice and comfortable. There’s even a gas fireplace in the master bedroom. The kitchen was well stocked with cooking utensils and spices. My daughter and I enjoyed the hot tub. It was simply incredible. It was the perfect location to visit Philly while our daughter visited a grad school. We didn’t have time to walk on the trails in the forest, but would have loved to have done that. Everything was absolutely wonderful. It’s already booked for the dates we wanted, but hope to come back again sometime."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Denise was an excellent host! The house was amazing, perfect for a weekend getaway with your significant other! The jacuzzi was perfect during the cold weather. Denise had everything and more in the house for us to make it a comfortable stay! Would recommend to everyone to visit! Hope we can enjoy this space again in the future!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy home, perfect for a getaway to relax. Everything was super clean and Denise was always available for any questions! Hope to return again!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Denise’s home was everything and more !
The description was spot on “ The house on the hill” immaculate views for sure ! Perfect get away if you love privacy & Nature ❤️"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and welcoming.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My fiancée and I came here for a short birthday weekend away & it was exactly what we needed! Everything was extremely clean and we throughly enjoyed the hot tub. The house was so cozy & Denise did a great job of adding personal touches. We thought the location would be a little bit more private but all in all we would come back again!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a wonderful stay. The host were very accommodating and had everything you need! Denise left small touches that really made a comfortable stay! Would recommend to other especially for a romantic getaway!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great getaway at The House in the Hill!
It was very peaceful and quiet. We enjoyed exploring the trails and relaxing in the hot tub! We would definitely recommend this to friends and family. Thanks for being a great host Denise:)"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a wonderful home for a weekend getaway. The house was very, very clean. The woods surrounding it are beautiful and fun to explore. The deck from the master bedroom to the hot tub was awesome. The hot tub was amazing at night with the lights hung above. It was just a very good vibe all around."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Denise was super helpful and kind throughout the entire experience! Her home was absolutely gorgeous and super clean and cozy. She provides everything you could need like bath towels, hot tub towels, shampoo, conditioner, etc. I would love to stay again sometime!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an excellent time and experience with Denise's property. The layout was clean and neat, the facilities were excellent. The kitchen was equipped with enough tools to cook several meals without needing anything extra. It was very cold so we didn't get to enjoy the trails and surrounding nature as much as we would have liked. We did wake up to a snowy morning and 1)it was beautiful but 2)with Denise's directions, departing in the snow was MUCH easier than expected."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a wonderful home. Everything was super clean and comfortable. The hot tub was private and a really nice touch. The kitchen has anything you might need for cooking. I would totally recommend this stay to anyone looking for a private getaway!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you so much Denise! This was the PERFECT Airbnb!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is totally a steal! The house is very private on a hill surrounded by nature. It was very secluded but super close to the town. The house itself has a very good zen feeling. It almost felt like you were in a spa. It was very clean, neat and the hot tub is amazing. Would definitely recommend to those who love being in the woods and secluded. Very peaceful environment. The host is super responsive and also give you clear instructions. Such a beautiful home."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was super clean and everything was to our liking
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,Denise was super helpful right from the first day. From directions to places to go. She was extremely responsive and helpful throughout the stay. The place was beautiful and very private. The surrounding city didn’t have too much to do. But the airbnb was a serene retreat stocked with everything we needed. The hot tub was amazing and the backyard was beautiful. We even made a cat friend during the trip. I’m not sure how they managed to have a place right next to the city and feel so private and serene and luxurious but they did it. We had an amazing stay.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Even better than the photos! The place was spotless and in a lovely secluded area. Denise was very responsive prior to and during our stay. We look forward to returning someday!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Denise’s home felt like stepping into a “Chip&Joanna Gains” HGTV perfectly decorated Home! She paid attention to the smallest of details. Our family enjoyed Christmas holiday baking in her fully furnished kitchen. We had a beautiful family Christmas Eve dinner in her spacious dining room. The private family room was perfect to enjoy a family Christmas movie. Which has really amazing old time elevator doors ( aren’t pictured on listing) that add extra charm to the room. The Tv had plenty of movies to select from. Then there also is the master bedroom with the cozy fire place that leads outside to the hot tub. This hot tub was absolutely so relaxing!!! Her husband even paid extra attention to keeping it clean and running great throughout our entire stay! This was one of our favorite Airbnb stays! Very private location yet close to so much to do. We definitely plan to stay again!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Denise was the perfect host for our first Airbnb stay - she provided clear directions on how to get to the house and once we arrived it was even better than the photos. The touch of locally made treats upon arrival was wonderful and the house itself was clean and had everything we needed for our weekend getaway. The hot tub was a nice bonus! We would definitely book this house again!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Denise's home was beautiful and peaceful. Despite being right at the outskirts of Reading, PA, we felt secluded in the serene location. The house on the hill is the best of both worlds- close to restaurants and shopping but just far enough to escape the hustle and bustle. We walked into the home to the calming scent of lemongrass diffusing throughout the open entry/dining space. There is a cute coffee bar stocked with necessities making mornings so much easier for us. The kitchen had everything we needed. The beds were comfortable and the linens were too! We enjoyed the hot tub at night- and the shower was incredible with the rain shower head! The house was very clean and beautifully decorated. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and look forward to visiting again!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Denise was an amazing host! The house is gorgeous, the pictures don’t do it justice! Her and her husband are so very nice! The battery for the keypad went out and her husband came and changed them right away! The house was completely spotless and very homie! I will definitely be coming back!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Denise, was a fantastic host! The home was spotless, everything was beautifully furnished! The bed comfy, all the amenities fantastic. The home smells good and is a warm cozy place to stay. The surprise whoopie pies are that good and Denise goes above and beyond to care of all your needs.
The location is above and segregated away from the neighborhood which isn’t the best, but you have your own sanctuary to enjoy.
It’s time to have the most relaxing time of your life."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My favorite Airbnb to date. The home is very well constructed and maintained. The location is hard to beat. Check out Franklyn’s dinner for brunch. The home is ideal for a private get away. It’s even nicer than pictured!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was absolutely beautiful, clean, and private. Denise always kept in touch and helped us tremendously, prior and throughout our stay!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Denise’s place exceeded our expectations! The location was so unique. It is situated on top of a hill right outside of town. There are trails right behind the property. We even saw some deer grazing on the hill. The house was clean and had everything we needed. Denise was helpful with directions and very responsive. I can not recommend this place more. Thanks Denise for everything!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house on the hill was amazing. Everything was exactly as described in the description and more. It was sparkly clean and beautiful. Denise made check-in very easy and provided us with all information we needed. The hot tub was an enjoyable bonus. This was probably the best AirBnb we’ve ever stayed in. We would definitely stay here again if we were in the area.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really lovely place, so clean and neat i was amazed. Denise was really sweet and helpful giving us some suggestions about what to do in the area. The house itself was just so cozy, definitely coming back next year !!!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was clean, quiet, and had plenty of room. It was close to a lot of stuff yet out of the way. Highly recommend!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The House on the Hill is a hidden gem above the city of Reading. I loved the location so much. I felt removed from the city but could easily access anything I needed. As soon as I walked in the front door, I knew I was going to love my stay. The owner left locally made whoopie pies on the table! My favorite!! The style and charm of this house is fresh, inviting, and detail-oriented. I loved the Coburn Furnace double doors that led to the living room. Such a unique feature! The bathroom shower is absolutely beautiful and has two shower heads- one being a rainfall shower head. Off the master bedroom is a deck and patio area with a propane fire table along with the hot tub -all lit with string lights.
There are so many wonderful details that the owner thought of and that made my stay relaxing and carefree."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is a gem. It's beautifully styled, has comfortable firm beds, and is super quiet. The location at the top of the hill is so private, we felt like we were deep in the woods at a retreat - yet, we were really just a few minutes away from the town center."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great home with everything you need for a nice getaway. Denise was a great host. She left a card and 2 treats for us upon arrival. Definitely would rent again.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely weekend stay. Use the directions Denise recommends. They’ll bring you to the home faster and over easier road. The personalized note and whoppie pies were a great way to start the experience. The home is extremely clean! The furniture, bedding, and pillows are all good quality and very comfortable! The home has more than enough supplies of everything you’ll need. I’d recommend staying in the fall as our hike to the witches hat, short drive to Reading Pagoda to watch the sunset, and dinner at Stokesay Castle were even more enjoyable because of the colorful leaves."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the house it was super clean. It was riveted but not to far from lots of fun things in the area. Denise was quick to respond to any questions. Even left us delicious little moon pies upon check in. Overall great place to stay.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about the stay was absolutely perfect. So many little touches made it feel welcoming and hospitable. The beds and linen were comfy, the shower amazing and an early morning soak in the hot tub with the tree line view made for a relaxing and enjoyable weekend. Would definitely stay here again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place by far is one of the best places I’ve stayed at in PA. Denise was so helpful my whole stay here anything we needed help with she answered right away . She made us feel so welcomed and was so kind to leave a lovely card and sweet for my birthday . This home is beautiful and even better in person . We will for sure be returning in the future . I highly recommend staying here it’s peaceful and feels like home :)

Denise was so nice and accommodating, we really had a great time here. 10/10 recommend."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing place! Amazing design. Super clean! Hot tub and night lights make this place so majestic. The pictures are accurate, but this place is even better than pictures! Highly recommended!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Was in PA with my family for a wedding. Ended up booking Denise’s place and so grateful that we did. The house is spacious, clean, and comfortable. The home is up on the hill and very private. Really felt like a getaway. This was by far the best Air B & B that I have ever stayed in. My family was so happy that I found it. Thanks Denise!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, very clean and it has everything you need."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time! The house was minimal, cozy, super clean and has a beautiful backyard just as listed. The only difficulty we had was with the directions. Although Denise had sent us alternate directions to the house we didn’t check them until we were too close to the place already. Tip: Please use CVS as the landmark and navigate yourself from there per Denise’s instructions."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable, clean and Denise was a great Host! We were missing some things and were surprised it was there, so didn’t have to make a run. Great access to hiking trails around the house. Just as described, Will definitely visit again!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice safe neighborhood. Probably within 2 miles of 222. Easier and easier off. Dosie dough. Donuts was just a few blocks away. Good coffee and breakfast sandwiches but the donuts for stale or over cooked. Super clean bathroom and adjacent bedroom.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lauren went out of her way to make me feel comfortable and at home. Wonderful personality. Positive, intelligent and upbeat. Beautiful neighborhood and just love her three pups! Can't say enough as Lauren and my stay was exceptional!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"A nice, clean place to spend the night! I was only here to sleep in between drives, but Lauren was a great host and quick communicator. Would stay here again."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great cozy place! Lauren is sweet. Friendly dogs who I never heard bark.
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great host, nice home and cozy bed."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had a phenomenal stay at Lauren’s place! I was a bit concerned because this was my first time getting an AirBNB where the home owner lives on the property but Lauren is such a delight and didn’t make it feel weird or awkward at all! This was my first time in town so she was able to give me tons of recommendations for food and things to do. I got take-out while I was there and we ended up eating dinner together and talking for hours. She’s such a sweet soul!
She truly makes you feel welcome in her home.
The place is in a super cute part of town. The neighborhood is quiet and pleasant. It is street parking but I didn’t have trouble finding a spot at all (even with snow). The inside of the home is just as beautiful as the outside. Lauren is always making improvements to the place and the bedroom that you stay in is spacious and comfortable. The dogs are kept in the basement when guests are over and are super well behaved. I never heard them bark or run around wildly.
I would definitely stay here again! My trip completely exceeded my expectations and I even made a new friend 😊"
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I recommend Lauren’s place. The bed is sooo comfortable. The room is so clean and the bathroom as well. Lauren is a nice host and her dogs are so friendly (I love them). I’ll def come back.

2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed staying in her place the house and the room are amazing. The house is very quiet if you are looking for a good relaxing sleep. The bed is comfy and the washroom is clean. I really liked the house original wooden floors since it reminds me of my grandma house. The house is in a nice neighborhood and there is a free street parking. checking in and out of the house was really easy, smooth and convenient and Lauren is so helpful and responds very quick. I recommend her room if you are visiting Reading or somewhere close, I would do if I am visiting again."

2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lauren was a great host, who had no problem with my late check in, as to the long drive from Ontario. The room was beautiful and clean the bed was very comfortable the house was nice and quiet, very relaxing. Lauren is warm and friendly and she has the 2 most lovable dogs, that love any attention. Lauren was very helpful with directions and where to find the local Starbucks. Communication between myself and Lauren was very good with quick responses from Lauren.

She responds quickly and is incredibly gracious in making arrangements happen easily from check in to departure and everything in between and is just a short drive from the downtown Reading/Wyomissing shops & restaurants. I would stay here again in a heart-beat!"
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You can expect a clean private room and a hassle free experience, in a nice neighborhood."
2018-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Another great stay
2018-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is in a really nice house on a beautiful, quiet street -- birds chirping, lots of trees, wonderful. Clean, simple, spacious room. There are two dogs, so be aware of two things -- 1) there is a rather strong smell of dog, throughout the house, and 2) the dogs can sometimes be a bit noisy during the day, bumping around and playing . . . and one has a chew toy that really startled me at first (once I had established that no one was dying, or being attacked, and that it was just a dog very aggressively playing with a chew toy, I calmed down immediately). The dogs are very sweet, and they were very quiet during the night (I don't think I ever heard them after dark), but just be aware. For such a short visit (I was only there one night), neither the dog smell nor the sounds of bumping around and chew toys really bothered me (once I knew where the sounds were coming from), but if you're sensitive to smells or sounds, then this might not be the right place for you. Just know your own needs. I had a lovely visit, and I thought the room was great. Unfortunately, I never met Lauren, but she set it up so I got into the house with no problem and could find everything I needed. Overall, two thumbs up. Great deal. Thanks, Lauren!"
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Another awesome stay!! This time had the opportunity to sit on the porch and enjoy the nice night!
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Yes, and again! With the nice warm weather i thought i would try to use the nice porch setup she had.. pleasantly surprised that the chair rocks! So relaxing. The weather was too hot to stay out and read but maybe I’ll try later in the evening!"
2018-04-01,5,Stayed one night,She’s always working on her home! Came this time to a spruced up front porch!! Looks so relaxing if i had time to utilize it!
2018-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I would live here if i could!!
2018-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Yes, again! Another amazing stay! Lauren is always surprising, uber talented and so creative. Came back to see her growing her own amazing herb garden! How does she have time!?! But this place is so comfy and it’s such a nice feeling to see someone put so much thought and care into this home! So fortunate that she has allowed others to share and enjoy what she has created!!"
2018-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another happy visit. With the many options available, i will continue to choose this comfy place over and over! Lauren is awesome!"
2018-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lauren is such a sweetheart and super friendly. She was very quick to respond to any questions we had and our room was really clean. She is, like ourselves a dog lover so the odor of a few pups is present which didn’t bother us in the slightest but someone who has allergies or not a fan of dogs might not enjoy their stay as much as we did. Her place is really close to local shops and restaurants which made it nice for our weekend stay as well. We will most likely be back soon for another stay :)"
2018-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Another great visit. Going to make this a continual thing during my long work days in reading. It felt so comfortable to be able to unwind after work at her comfortable home. Lauren is amazing!
2018-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lauren is an amazing host! We had that crazy snowstorm and with a blink of an eye.. she paved a clear path where it wasn’t a problem at all! I was excited to be around dogs but when I arrived they were crated and so quite! I was only there at night and just needed a place to rest my head before another long workday and it was perfect! Thank you! Hope to get to know Lauren and those well behaved pups some more!
2017-08-01,4,Stayed one night,Nice room and cozy home.
2017-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lauren's home is a wonderful option for travel to the Reading, PA area. The neighborhood has lovely tree lined streets, a relaxed vibe, and is minutes away from restaurants and other amenities. It's a beautiful, residential neighborhood. I wish my schedule had allowed more time to take a walk and enjoy a closer look at all the historic homes.
The home is quiet, immaculate and charming. The bed was exceptionally comfortable and the bathroom large with lots of light and a good shower.
Lauren was exceptionally gracious and helpful during my short stay. Thanks!"
2017-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place is very quiet and neat. And Lauren is very helpful and nice. She have two dogs, while they are only allowed in the kitchen, and they are cute and quiet. Free parking is just outside the house, very convenient. I would highly recommend this place!"

2017-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lauren's place is located in a quaint neighborhood that is very family friendly, tree lined streets and plenty of free street parking nearby, which is not a problem.

2017-03-01,4,Stayed one night,Quiet and clean! Didn't have the chance to meet Lauren in person due to our schedules. She left a key for me and was easy to get a hold of.
2017-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lauren was awesome.She is a reputed karate teacher in the area.So if you break anything your first lesson is free.I am just joking .She is a very tender and loving person.The house was outstanding.
2017-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice , cozy and a great place."
2017-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Laurens place was great and quiet. I was in and out fairly quickly. The bed was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. The dogs are quiet and calm. Centrally located just a couple of miles from downtown Reading. If I'm in the Reading area again I would definitely stay again. No complaints at all.
2017-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay while commuting to my internship in Reading. Would recommend for anyone who needs a place to stay in the area!

2016-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I got to stay in Lauren's lovely home for almost a week and let me say it was a delightful experience. I was in town for a convention so I didn't spend much time inside the house, but sleeping there was quiet and cozy. I loved the decor and the space the house has. Communication with the host was smooth, very detailed and helpful. Look forward to doing that the same time of the year next year! Thank you so much for having me. Cheers!"

2016-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lauren was great. We got there way later then we thought we would, and she was really accomodating. Really easy to get a hold of, and even though we weren't there very long, it was a nice stay, for a great value, in a great neighborhood."
2016-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Lauren was very accommodating. Her rental just happened to be right near a wedding I was working, so the location was great. There are several eating options in walking distance, and the neighborhood's parks are delightful. Unfortunately I was unable to spend much time getting to know her, but what little direction interaction was very pleasant. She seems like an extremely active member of her community, and should have a lot of local knowledge for those wanting to learn more about Reading."
2016-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is very spacious, clean, and well lighted. The location and the host are awesome as well."
2016-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had a great experience staying at this place.

Paul Perreten"
2016-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lauren went above and beyond when it came to making me feel welcome. She was extremely flexible with arrival and departure times. She is a super-host in the making as she goes out of her way to do the little things that make an Airbnb stay delightful. She's got a very well put together home, and is willing to go the extra mile to make your stay enjoyable. If I was ever in the area again, I wouldn't hesitate to stay her with. Truly a fabulous experience and 5-star stay from a very warm and friendly person."
2016-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lauren was a great host. Gave us everything we needed for a comfortable, overnight stay. Thanks!"
2016-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely place, Lauren accommodated my need to arrive late, close to the highway, great price, well-behaved and quiet dogs that were kenneled at night, I'll be back!"
2016-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Lauren was a great host. I had a wedding in Reading so I just needed a place to stay for the night and this was perfect. The room was just as nice as advertised and she had fresh towels waiting for me with a nice note. I've used Airbnb a few times and this is a great example of why it's often a better alternative to hotels.
2016-05-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Lauren kept a key in a lockbox for us as we arrived late at night. She did not complain when we inflated the noisy air mattress for a 2nd guest. The neighborhood was quiet and beautiful to walk through, not far from stores and restaurants."

2016-04-01,5,Stayed one night,A nice place to stay. Would definitely stay again.

She left the key for us with a note wishing a good stay. Very nice little touch. When we got to the room everything was in great shape and ready for a great night's sleep! She even left us travel toiletries for the next morning. Great stay!"
2016-03-01,3,Stayed one night,"The host wasn't home when I arrived but graciously left me a key with a welcome note. She was a good host who was very generous with sharing her home. The room I stayed in was just enough. It was cozy and she left towels and toiletries that I found very kind. Two dogs that are super sweet and well behaved.
I very much needed a quiet stay with a very important morning to follow. The dogs were very playful which could easily be heard with their claws as they ran around the hard wood floors. Was easily solvable with ear buds that I luckily brought with me."
2016-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lauren was a lovely and accommodating host. The space was exactly as described, and unanticipated perks included access to the kitchen and an upright piano."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Charles & Abigail were amazing! They were so responsive to my multiple messages before & after check-in! Charles met us when we arrived & explained how to get inside. After that it was a breeze! Even our 8 & 10 year olds helped us get in & out! The place is absolutely beautiful ! They had a basket of goodies, eggs in the fridge, & water bottles. I was able to make pancakes & eggs our 1st morning there. Has every amenity you can think of! The beds were very comfortable. Water temperature was perfect (I like super hot showers)! I was even able to wash clothes before checking out. Charles & Abigail are just great people, which made our stay even better! They went above & beyond to help us. Definitely recommend this spot & would stay here again if we ever came back to visit!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This home was wonderful! The host takes excellent care to make sure you have everything you need.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is honestly one of the best places I have stayed in Reading PA. Place is very spacious and private. Hosts keep the place very clean and tidy. Hosts are also very friendly, responsive, and respectful. At first I was very worried about parking but parking wasn’t much of a problem with the parking across the place. If you’re looking to stay here I highly recommend!"
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place, loved the inside. Very nice tough with little welcome basket. The only thing that would be nice is one more couch, not enough comfy furniture for 4 people."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Look no further if your staying in the Reading area, its a must you book with Charles and Abigail. The best host equipped with an amazing and peaceful space. from the moment you check in you'll feel at home with an accomidating and relaxing enviroment, to the time you leave.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"a must stay, the best Host you could hope for. Super friendly and they go above and beyond to make you feel right at home, very comfortable and relaxing with all the amenities you could possibly need."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely fabulous. I spend a lot of time in airbnbs and this was one of the best experiences I have ever had. The photos do not do it justice. It is a very cool very fun refurbished brick “factory” hence the name. The apartment lay outs are phenomenal and the finishes are spot on retro chic, spotless. The mattresses and linens are super comfy. The best part was Charles the owner who was always available and had lots of great tips. Even though the apartment is on the first floor, it is elevated far above the sidewalk and we felt very safe. Love that all the shades work on remote AND the charming courtyard outback. Even if you live in Reading, just come stay here for a fun experience."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Charles and Abigail's place was a modern oasis in a residential neighborhood across from a school. The apartment has spacious common areas with an open kitchen and plenty of natural light. There was a nice Christmas tree set up in the living room when we were there over the holidays. The host was very responsive and helpful with tips about parking etc. The welcome basket included Hershey's bars and local sodas.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The space was very clean and inviting. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Hopefully we get the opportunity to stay at your place in the future. We enjoyed the personal touches throughout your place. Absolutely 5 star rating!
Calvin"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful air bnb. We will definitely stay here again when we come to reading. Amazing extra touches like the power shades and the cool lighting fixtures. We stayed here for a wedding in the area and it was so cozy and nice. Everything you need was provided.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,I have stayed at over twenty five air b and b locations and I truly appreciated the heart felt effort that was put into making our stay comfortable. They offered so much in the kitchen and the beds and pillows were top notch. I loved the high tech blinds and all the updated technology. What I love the most is that I could support a couple who is building there dream and living it. They took over this warehouse and put so much love into it and it shows. You will love it here and feel safe and cozy.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Bnb was just perfect for my weekend stay. We traveled from NYC to get away from the busy streets and relax. This place did it. As soon as we walked in we noticed several things. The space was well lit, warm, cozy and clean. The beds are just amazing. I would say it feels like you are sleeping on clouds. I will definitely love to stay the next time I’m in PA. Charles and Abigail are amazing host."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Charles and Abigail have a great spot. You can tell they pay very close attention to detail when it comes to ensuring a great stay for renters. Well thought out overview, nothing was confusing. Love the care they put into The Factory- definitely has an all inclusive type of feel. Toiletries (forgot your toothbrush? They got it handled), hair dryer, towels, coffee/tea, blankets. They left a little gift basket with sweets and treats which I thought was so kind of them, even had eggs and sausage in the fridge for b’fast! Really was not expecting everything they provided for us for our stay, it was very much appreciated. The apt itself is very modern rustic with exposed brick, amazing lighting and absolutely beautiful. On top of that Charles and Abigail kept in contact to reassure if we needed anything to not hesitate to reach out, but really was not needed as we had everything for us there! I travel to Reading on occasion and will definitely stay here again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great stay
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was extremely nice to stay in. The kitchen was well set up has every cooking tool you need and we used it a lot it was great. The beds were so comfortable and the whole place was very fresh and clean, the bathroom even had those hotel travel soaps."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Talk about the BEST air Bnb you will ever stay in. First, Charles and Abigail are ready to go above and beyond to make sure you are happy, I have never had hosts like them. Their place is beautiful, everything is so well thought out. CLEANEST air Bnb, with everything included (phone chargers, advil, razors, any cooking supply you think of, even eggs and sausages for breakfast, and welcome gifts of course).
Thank you for the best stay, we can’t wait to be repeat stayers!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The most beautiful Airbnb we have ever stayed in! We actually gasped when we walked in. The way the light from the windows enters the space is magical- the entire home is more beautiful in reality than even the photos. Charles and Abigail are wonderful hosts- very responsive and easy to communicate with and so friendly!! We felt so welcome. We loved the thoughtful touches- the coffee, the well stocked fridge, the toiletries in the bathroom, and toys in the piano room! Our toddler had an absolute blast and didn’t want to leave. This space is very comfortable for travel with a child- the layout is perfect, our toddler wandered all over without an issue. He loved the yogurt in the fridge! And was able to start his day with an egg too :) the beds and linens are crisp and clean, and the whole home smells amazing! If we ever come back to Reading, this is where we will always stay hands down. A perfect home away from home. Thank you again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"***MUST STAY****
Where do I even begin. My husband special requested that we rent a Tesla during our stay in Reading. When we discovered this listing that also had the opportunity to rent their car, I knew it was perfect. We stayed for the car but loved it for all the details and wonderful hosts. Charles and Abigail thought of everything. I enjoyed the electric shades, Alexa integrated lights, smart tv, wonderful hot shower with great pressure and very comfortable beds. After visiting New York for a few days we felt like we had made it to a home away from home. Not only was everything perfect, the hosts were proactive in making sure our stay was the best possible. They communicated quickly and were some of the best hosts we’ve had. You won’t regret your stay."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Excellent hosts, always pending and always willing to help and resolve anything additional that was required, I would gladly return"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow, I don’t even know where to start. I have only wonderful things to say about this air bnb and it’s amazing hosts. Charles and Abigail were most accommodating to our needs. :)
Communication was outstanding. Even before booking Charles never hesitated in answering my maaany questions, helping me to be sure i was making the right decision. We stayed for a whole month and had just everything we needed. I stayed with my two children ages 5 & 2. it was easy and definitely kid friendly. I wouldn't add or take away a single thing. Charles and Abigail truly thought of everything you might need during your stay and they even stock the fridge for your arrival, leave you a sweet gift basket with local goodies, and greet you to show you around the space! This air bnb is a hidden gem in the city. It is spacious, homey, beautifully decorated, with convenient remote powered blinds in every window, easy to use thermostat, robot vacuum, charging pads in all the bedrooms, dimmable lights, big comfortable beds, and more lovely features. The place is charming and wonderful down to every last detail. I feel so blessed to have found this air bnb and will definitely be returning in years to come. :)
Charles and Abigail are two of the kindest people I've ever met. We left the air bnb feeling like we made some pretty incredible friends here. cant wait to see them again when we visit next time!!
HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Charles and Abigail are great hosts! Very responsive and great communication. The place was beautiful and they went above and beyond with the complimentary breakfast items. It made all the difference not having to worry about breakfast. The apartment was spacious and we felt safe and at home. Being able to park at the school when street parking was limited was a plus. Overall a great stay! We would definitely stay again.
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful stay nestled in Reading, close to Santander Arena.
The grand piano was a gem that me and my boyfriend loved to play during our stay.
There was many accommodations and complimentary supplies which was super appreciated."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our experience at the Factory! Such a cool space that’s well-equipped with any toiletries you might be missing. Comfortable bed, big TV, excellent shower, nice adjustable lighting and shades, and fantastic communication from the hosts! We found the space sufficiently quiet on its own, no need for the earplugs, though we appreciated that they were available for us if needed. Parking at the school across the street was straightforward and convenient. The piano room and swing are elegant touches. We were visiting for our friend’s wedding, and would absolutely return next time we’re in town."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is such a beautiful home. Even though our family lived 5 min away this was our hangout spot, and we couldn’t be any happier with how our stay was!! Charles and Abigail also tried to help us with things that didn’t even have to do with the Airbnb since we aren’t from around the town. Thank you so much for opening your home for our family. We hope to visit again!!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This is a beautiful, fully modernized warehouse apartment. Charles was an amazing host. The location is central and easy to get wherever you need to go. The location of the warehouse itself is in a transitional neighborhood but we always felt safe. A gem!"
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"Such a cool atmosphere - the old industrial feel, but modern and inviting . Very clean and spacious - highly recommend for others looking to stay."
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,Loved itttttt !!!!!! ❤️
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A great place to stay! Very clean, modern, and had everything we needed."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This old factory has been turned into a lovely escape. It sits in a fairly dense residential neighborhood and parking can be a bit tight, but for an ex-Chicago resident, it wasn’t a big deal.
The apartment is huge and beautifully redone. My daughter and I enjoyed making up duets on the piano and we all had plenty of room to spread out. This was good because the weather was absolutely miserable this weekend.
Charles responds very quickly to any messages and he was super-friendly when we met him. Check in is a breeze and the whole experience was exactly what an Airbnb stay should be. If I ever need a place to stay in Reading in the future, I’ll hope this is available."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a unique space. Very cool. We surprised my in laws and they thought it was so awesome. Hosts are so wonderful! Highly recommend.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures do not do this home justice, it’s beautifully decorated with modern, vintage decor. It’s fully stocked with breakfast foods and beverages. It has charging pads in each room, the beds were so comfy and it had anything extra you think you’d might need. Not only was the stay amazing, the communication between the host Charles was outstanding. He fully accommodated every need and concern! It was great five stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Charles & Abigail's place is beautiful, very clean & unique!
We were in Reading for the Berks Jazz festival and the apartment was ideal for 2 couples. We found parking on the street except for 1 night when we used the school parking across the street.
The hospitality was great! We appreciated being greeted by our host who gave us a quick orientation of the amenities. We loved the welcome basket & treats! It was also convenient to have a refrigerator stocked with bottled water & breakfast items.
The outside of the building is deceptive as you would not expect such a modern & spacious apartment inside. We loved the remote powered shades & the Alexa controlled lighting & music! Most importantly the beds were extremely comfortable!
The piano room is awesome! Perhaps I could learn to play before our next stay..."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Oh, man! Where should I start… Since the very beginning without even making the reservation Charles was on top of making sure I was taking the right decision about the stay, he is very communicative and focused on giving you the best service possible which is REALLY GOOD. Getting to the place, it goes exactly by the instructions, parking is easy and there’s plenty of it, place is MINT CLEAN, kitchen is loaded with basic and they even have you with breakfast groceries so you don’t worry about it. Cozzy place, VERY comfortable beds and the way how it looks is awesome, we were amazed on a complete way… If you also want to, they have a Tesla you can rent and have for your stay for a very good price and trust me, this is a must try! Thanks Charles and Abigail for all attentions and for every detail! Me, my wife and our kids loved the stay and we definitely having a visit to you in the future! Stay safe and keep the good things up! Wish you the best on all your projects"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Charles and Abigail went above and beyond any previous experience I’ve had with other AirBnb stays. All ingredients for breakfast were there for us to have when we woke up. It was Christmas Day and they even had a tree. The converted factory space is unique and the design is so lovely. I found a new appreciation for this historic town. We will stay again.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything about this apartment is wonderful and all of the little touches are very well thought out. Thank you Charles and Abigail for creating this wonderful space!!

So many sweet little touches with hershey bars, reading soda, eggs and sausage in the fridge, toiletries…the list is endless! Would definitely stay here again!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"AAAAAAMAZING!!! Book them!! I am from Reading and I was not expecting to find such a beautiful place like this. Not only was everything clean, accurate and worth the money. They also went above and beyond with the small things such as extra food in the fridge and cabinets, first aid, waters, extra chargers, games, basic necessities one will forget when traveling. I never thought my favorite airbnb ever would be one right in my home town!!! Charles and Abigail were also extremely thoughtful and nice and I enjoyed speaking with them!!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was by far the best experience we’ve had with Airbnb.
Charles and Abigail were very accommodating and went above and beyond to ensure our families would enjoy our stay. The refrigerator was full of breakfast supplies and snacks.
They also included some local soda beverages, showing how much the owners support the community & local businesses.
The accommodations themselves were AMAZING!! The loft factory is a genuine blend between rustic industrial and modern high tech. Our families were in awe of how well the aesthetic combined and tried to get some ideas for our own homes! Wireless chargers are on all the night stands, lights are dimmable, curtains are all automatic and temperature is easily controlled thru a nest thermostat. The beds were extremely comfortable King size beds. Parking was deceptively easy to find, in an area that’s not known for that.
We highly recommend this location and we will love coming back!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A really beautiful space with great character.
Will definitely be staying there again."

2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a wonderful, cute, newly-renovated loft in the middle of the city. Charles was there to greet us, help us find parking, and answer questions during our 3-night stay. Quick response. All the amenities we needed, including lots of breakfast options in the kitchen and popcorn for a movie, so we didn’t need to shop right away. Even though it’s in a fairly crowded city neighborhood, the loft was quiet and very comfy to come back to. the decor and space has a modern, cozy vibe and even our teenager loved being there. Thanks to Charles and Abigail for a great airbnb experience!"
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,Will stay here 1000 times over. Amazing host. Amazing communication. Thank you for the vibes!

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Charles and Abigail were great hosts! This is a great place. It has been well remodeled and is very functional. We loved the brick walls and wood floors.

Very nicely decorated and also extremely clean. We will definitely stay here again. If you are going to be in Reading, you should definitely stay in this great apartment. Great job!"

2021-03-01,5,Group trip,"Charles and Abigail’s place is the most beautiful Airnbn I’ve ever been to! Seriously gorgeous and the pictures don’t even do it justice (which is crazy cause the pictures are already beautiful). It was so nice that even if you have no reason to go to Reading, PA, I’d recommend going just to stay at this place. Beautiful place, the kindest hosts, so many amenities. It really feels like an all-inclusive getaway :) 12/10 DEFINITELY recommend"
2021-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"Overall a great stay - clean, everything you need, and cute amenities! Definitely recommend.
A note of caution, if you're need a third bed, the extra futon isn't comfortable to sleep on, and won't fit someone taller than 5'5""."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I’m not sure where to even begin as far as describing how incredible Charles and Abigail’s Airbnb is! The space is absolutely gorgeous, extremely well designed, so cozy and super comfortable in every way! My daughter and I stayed for a week and could have very happily stayed longer. The space was very conducive for my daughter to work remotely at the stunning live edge wood bar facing the charming courtyard. Speaking of the courtyard, both bedrooms have windows with automated room darkening shades which face the courtyard for a lovely daytime view.
Charles and Abigail went above and beyond with the amenities. The fridge was fully stocked with breakfast items as well as thoughtful welcome goodies. We enjoyed delicious Belgian waffles for breakfast since all the ingredients were at our fingertips. The best Airbnb I have ever been to as far as the hosts thinking of EVERYTHING to make the guests stay enjoyable and comfortable. Can’t wait to go back! ¨̮"

The space is great and definitely somewhere myself and others in the wedding party would book at again."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great space, awesome city location! Charles and Abigail clearly love what they do, hosting out of town guests and sharing their cool design aesthetic with others! They went above and beyond with welcoming touches, a thoughtful gift basket, bottled water and breakfast items in refrigerator. Space was spotless, luxury vibe, Nespresso coffee maker for morning latte. Charles clearly has an interest in electronics as everything was high end tech, the lighting, sound, heating, phone chargers. Abigail is also clearly talented in design and the two together made for an awesome loft space in the City of Reading! Thank you for a great stay for my daughter and me!

2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Charles and Abigail's place in Reading was a great getaway. The place was wonderful, had a really great motif in a nice old factory, and had all the amenities we needed. We were even supplied with breakfast items such as eggs/bread/yogurt/coffee etc., which were super helpful for us since we came in later in the evening and did not pick up things to have the next morning. They were really helpful in suggesting things to do in the area and we were able to enjoy a lot of really great adventures nearby such as the public museum, the Pagoda, and the West Reading scene. Would definitely say there again if given the opportunity in the future."

They stocked the fridge with eggs, sausage, juice and yogurt - provided individualized toiletries (which, during COVID-19, is an outstanding touch) - and were very quick to respond to questions.
If you’re looking for a getaway in Berks County, this should be at the top of your list, if not your first choice. Don’t miss out on this space!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sorry a little late in reviewing...we were very pleased with our stay at Aaron's home in Reading while we attended Berk's Jazz Fest. Although the apartment is part of the home, it is in a private, quiet location in a residential neighborhood. Everything was as described in the listing. If you are attending events in Reading, it is only about 10-15 minutes away and very easy to get to. Aaron and Kay-Lynn are very responsive and it was only a matter of minutes before I received a response to any inquiries. When we had a challenge with the television remote, Aaron came by to assist within a short time. Thank you for allowing us to stay with you and we'll be sure to stay again if we find ourselves in the area."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and comfortable place. Aaron was extremely gracious when asked if I could have some extra time when checking out. I would definitely stay again if I get back to that area.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exceeded our expectations! Perfect for a few nights in town for a concert. Host and Co-Host was responsive and very helpful. Quiet town, lots of nice small businesses. We enjoyed the pagoda, watch tower and the farmers’ market! Updated (but still fun retro) vibes and the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on. Just outside of town if you’re looking for a fast Uber ride, but peace and quiet to sleep. We would stay again in the future!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is my 3rd time staying at Aaron's and won't be my last. His place is comfortable and cozy with everything you need and more. Within 5-10 minutes of some great food and attractions, so it's perfectly placed. Highly recommend!"

The hosts were very quick to respond and accept our request to stay last minute on our drive, which was why much appreciated. The space does not appear to be thoroughly or newly renovated, but it is cozy with sufficient heating, superb hot water in the shower, and the hosts have put a lot of thought into their decor and metro look. The mattress was quite comfortable for my husband and me. Although we did not use it, the fridge looked very cool, and they even created a lovely living room. Despite the short ceilings and few windows, the hosts have really tried to make this basement, in-law apartment comfortable for their guests. This is a nice place to stay in a nice area with lots to do and the hosts are wonderful."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a very cute little place. I'd recommend it for a quick overnight in a heartbeat, as that's why I needed it.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice place with very caring hosts. We really liked the fridge it had a retro vibe (with fun magnets to mess around with). The Airbnb was in a location with a lot to do but still private enough where it was peaceful. A very relaxing stay :)
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had a pleasant experience here. Parking was very easy to find right out front even with two cars. It was clean and as described. It was the quietest basement Airbnb I've ever stayed in. The bed was comfortable. Hosts were always responsive. The space is pretty large which is awesome. Only things to note is the A/C is only in the bedroom, and the shower is hard to adjust to the right temperature.
I would definitely stay here again. The price is fair, and I enjoyed my time here!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a wonderful weekend stay! We were in town for the PA USBC Open Championship Tournament, and Aaron’s place was in close proximity to both of the bowling alleys. There are a ton of restaurants and stores within a 5-10 minute drive too. (We loved Craft 2700 & Dino’s Wings)
Sleeping in a clean and comfortable bed, taking a hot shower, and feeling safe on the property are all important factors to us. This place checked all the boxes, plus more. It was easy to find and super simple to check in. We enjoyed the retro/mid century vibe, as well as the peace and quiet after a busy 2 days. We would absolutely stay here again!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,My wife and I enjoyed our stay at Aaron’s home. Very comfortable and just enough room for us. We also appreciate his allowing us to bring our recently born baby Yorky with us. We had a bit of a snag getting TV to operate but we were in town most of our brief stay so it was not that much of an issue. We would definitely book Aaron’s place again and recommend to anyone looking for somewhere affordable to stay when visiting Reading area.
2023-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"Nuce place, very quiet. TV was a bit hard to figure out , and was happy he had heaters un the rooms"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"In my experience, a lot of airbnbs look better in the pictures but Aaron’s place was even better in person! It was beautifully decorated, very comfortable, and super clean. The bed was especially cozy! He and Kay-lynn were wonderful hosts as they were extremely responsive and went out of their way to make sure we were had everything we needed. We are already looking for more events in the area just to come back and stay with them again!! Can’t recommend enough :)"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay. Aaron is a great host and the place was amazing. I’d definitely go back again.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were looking for a quick stopover and this was fantastic! Clean, quiet, comfortable. Would stay again!"
2023-01-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"It was a decent stay, but there were a few problems.
When the two of us checked in, there was only one cup and one bowl in the pantry. I asked for one more of each, but these were not provided over the two-night stay. Also, it was my understanding that any dirty dishes could be left for the host to clean and return, but this did not happen, which made eating out for dinner a necessity though we brought food to prepare. Though the bedroom temperature was comfortable, the living room was kept quite cool throughout the stay, without any obvious way to adjust the temperature. Finally, the bedsheets had some permanent stains on them.
I probably wouldn't stay here again."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic host. Would definitely recommend the place.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Home away from home. The bed is super comfortable. I was definitely in need of a good night sleep. Loved the fridge. Upon my arrival it looks really dark. Once you reach the driveway, it is well lit. Thanks for having us Aaron."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Best place you can find at the area, ngl."
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Aaron is a super host. very quick to respond and accomodate anything needed. The place is super cool and quiet in a great safe area. The only thing I will add is Aarons palce would be 5 plus stars if he added a kitchen sink and a updated refidgerator. A little difficult to prepare food and clean up as well as no freezer to store frozen items in.
Would highly recommend and would definitly book again"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great one night stopover! Quiet neighborhood and we loved the Cali king bed. We went to Saucony Creek Brewing for dinner and had an amazing experience highly recommend!
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great bang for the buck! Host doesn't bother you just come and go like home! Cool house, safe location, must try the Rt 61 Diner! It's a classic!
PS - The fridge was cool. I had a similar on a few years ago..."
2022-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Was super helpful when I wanted to extend my stay!!
2022-12-01,3,Stayed one night,it’s worth and very clean
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Everything you need for a quick stay if you are needing a place near Reading. They did a great job making the place as cozy as possible.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Aaron's apartment was the perfect place for our stay in Reading. It was clean, quiet, and comfortable. No issues at all—I'd happily stay here again."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was a short stay, but the location was perfect for our plans. Aaron’s place was neat and clean. The bed was comfortable and the surround sound for the tv was great!
There’s no kitchen sink, but the bathroom sink was just fine for our needs."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. Appreciate the quick response and willingness for a slightly later checkout.
2022-12-01,4,Stayed one night,"Stayed here for a couple of nights and it was perfectly comfortable as a place to crash while visiting family in the area. Worth noting that check out was 10am; a little earlier than most airbnbs and hotels, but it wasn’t a huge inconvenience or anything. The space and furnishings are a little dated but cozy enough, and logistically it was easy to find, check in, etc."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Aaron's house is spectacular! The location is great, in a nice neighborhood just down the road from downtown Reading. The space was clean, organized, and well stocked. Definitely a place to stay if you visit anywhere around Reading. Aaron is a nice guy who responds quick to all questions!"
2022-12-01,4,Stayed one night,"See my other review for notes—we stayed two nights, but had a gap in the middle so Airbnb treats it as two separate trips 🙂"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Being a holiday weekend, I tried not to contact the host for anything. I am a local, just needed a quiet comfortable spot, to hangout with a bestie I had not seen in many years.
The apt is convientiently located near 2 of our major highways, and just minutes from endless shopping and meal options.
The fridge is pretty spacious, so a stop at the Redner's on N. 5th St Hwy, on your way in would be a good idea. Bagged salads, rotissere chkn, or other fresh-ready-made, or simple to prep options that can be made in a microwave or toaster oven are a good idea.

I really appreciated the thoughtfulness of providing a water cooler with plenty of spring water!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,It was a very comfortable and clean place! Thanks!!!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I don't like neighborhoods that look like a museum with the silhouette of life sized cardboard cutouts posing by the window. But the actual apartment has eligible bachelor written all over it. It's amazing hoe attentive the host can be without bothering you. I normally like renting one room with everything in it, but it was nice to do the apt thing for a change. I recommend."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great communication from beginning to end; a beautiful location and most definitely an amazing stay!
2022-11-01,4,Stayed one night,"Aaron is a very kind and responsive host. He has put a lot of care into creating a well-decorated, welcoming environment for his guests. I'm sorry to say that there were some cleanliness issues, but Aaron was quick to offer solutions. The free popcorn and magnet letters on the fridge were the highlights of our visit :)"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is a very interesting mid-century modern home and we'd love to know more about it! The apartment itself is in a basement that opens up on ground level. It is up the driveway to the left, by the garages and NOT up the steps...our mistake! It is very convenient to the Reading & Northern Railroad excursions ... really within walking distance ... and there is a great diner up the street. Aaron is very responsive to guest' needs. We enjoyed our stay! Deano"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place for my work trip. Great neighborhood, parking was easy, the place was clean and comfortable, and Aaron was a wonderful host."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute cozy get away! The patio area is beautiful, great view especially at sundown. Check in is insanely simple and easy. Personally did not have any in person contact to review on but thats only because I had no issues, But Aaron kindly reassured us to let them know if we needed anything. I loved the free streaming services, it made it easy to catch up on some shows. So very thankful that there is an AC in the bedroom along with a vanity area which was very thoughtful. Overall was a wonderful experience and would come again!"

2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a great little getaway for us!
2022-03-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"The convenience of the location and the price were the best parts of this stay. My boyfriend and I were in town for a show at the Santander performing arts center. This airbnb is indeed a short uber ride from that venue. However, we were a little disappointed with the lack of cleanliness and with the hot tub. I eagerly paid the hot tub fee and looked forward to using it. but the hot tub has an issue (at least as of March 2022). One of the jets causes the breaker to short out. It was unavoidable to trip the breaker and turn off the hot tub altogether when trying to get the settings right since he made no prior mention of this beforehand. We ultimately needed him to come out and mess with it for it to finally work.
The space is also not quite as private as we expected and as the pictures sort of lead you to believe. Nonetheless Aaron was very pleasant and polite and is a responsive host. He offered to refund the cleaning fee, although I did need to follow up with him a couple times to get that squared away. Overall, it was decent value for the price. Very affordable, but expect what you pay for."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Aaron was a great communicator and easy to work with !!

2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Aaron was a great communicator. We liked the location- only 15 minutes away from Santander Performing Arts Center. Hot tub was worth the fee!

This time around, we did have an issue with the hot tub as it wasn’t working on our arrival. We were really looking forward to it, however, Aaron was very transparent and had let us know that it may not be working. We went anyways to get out the city and in hopes we can still use it. Aaron provided us with a cleaning fee refund and even offered us to come back. We definitely love coming here as a quick getaway and Aaron is beyond accommodating!
