2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Felt like home. I highly recommend Antiria’s place! I will definitely come back again!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Antiria’s place was exactly as it was described. Small, but perfect for a solo traveler. There was a full kitchen, so I was able to save some money by cooking there which I appreciated. She was very responsive - I extended my trip an extra day. The bed was incredibly comfortable as well and I slept like a baby."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,Very pleased with the stay.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wish I could live there! Perfect and gorgeous. Emilee and her husband did a perfect job. This was a beautiful and perfect spot to rest and recharge on our road trip down to Florida. I will definitely be back if we are ever in the area.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The home is beautiful, peaceful, and welcoming. No one wanted to leave, not even to go out to a restaurant! We had such a good time. The host was very gracious and hospitable. Thanks for a great stay!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Emilee was such a great host as I gave her short notice on a one night stay from Ohio to Florida. As far as the property it’s one of the nicest of not the nicest places we have ever stayed at. Lots of room for at least 6. I could go on and on about every little detail but all I can say is I had my wife and 2 kids tell me it was amazing and they wanted to go back sometime when we weren’t in such a rush.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,OMG!!!! This place is absolutely amazing. Couldn’t have ask for a better location. 5star luxury resort. Emilee was a wonderful host she didn’t hesitate to respond to any messages or phone calls.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Just as describe, perfect get away!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This house was very clean and comfortable. Emilee was very friendly and responsive. The house had a positive vibe and the outside surroundings & back yard created a peaceful getaway. I highly recommend staying here. We will definitely stay here again. Thank you Emilee 🙂
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,I had a smile on my face the instant I pulled into the driveway. This place looked great in the advertisement but exceeded expectations in person. The home and property are gorgeous. Inside and outside are immaculate. There is no lack of attention to detail with the layout. It has just about everything you could want in a secluded getaway. The host was always responsive and helpful. I had a very enjoyable time. This is the kind of place I would love to have when I retire. I would highly recommend.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was super clean. The design of the place was very nice and modern. Everything was as described, thank you!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"When we walked into this place it literally looked like we were walking into an HGTV dream home. This house is so beautifully decorated and impeccably clean. Pictures don't do it justice. Emilee provided soft linens & towels, super comfortable beds, state of the art appliances, and a serene outdoor living space. She also sent a personal text on our way there. Really nice touch. We loved it so much we wanted to move in. : )
We can't wait to come back!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"My brain can’t wrap around how perfectly designed and constructed this home is. They thought of everything and it is so perfect. Emilee and Tony are both two of the kindest, most welcoming people I think I have ever met. I stay at a whole lot of Airbnb’s, as I travel weekly, with my company. I have had a whole lot of great experiences, but these two, are simply amazing.
Everything is just perfect. I don’t know how else to put it. I can say that pictures, cannot do justice, to how this home actually is. I will definitely be back. Thank you Emilee and Tony.
I’ll never forget your kindness."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a wonderful place to stay. The cleanest Airbnb I have ever stayed at. Would recommend this home to anyone.
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"beautiful home , great location,"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"Absolutely a perfect place for a peaceful stay! The home, details, area… all were perfect! The actual home is even better than what you see in the pictures! We were totally pleased with everything. Emilee is an amazing host! Definitely will stay again when in the area!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Home sweet Home , this home provides all the boxes for a family , retreat, relaxation and peaceful environment. Everything was thought out and provided (without asking ) any and all your needs to feel at home and enjoy this home.
She was very helpful and available at all times. We enjoyed it so much we extended our stay and will be back what a romantic quite home. Kid friendly and close to everything we wanted to do. Again hats off we was welcomed and hated to leave .. we will be back. Soon if the unit is not already reserved. Hidden jewel for sure. 6 ⭐️⭐️⭐️🌟🌟🌟. 🏠"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Emilee was an amazing host for an amazing place. We’ll be back!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"PERFECT! This was an absolute perfect space! Clean, beautiful and homey! The entire house was spotless, gorgeous bathrooms and great outdoor area. The surrounding area feels safe and secluded. Emilee was extremely accommodating. Can’t recommend this place enough!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay! The layout is unique and fit the space well. Very modern and well kept. We look forward to staying here again!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely beautiful! Loved our stay and our only complaint was that it was too short of a visit. Extremely clean, cozy furniture, and a fully stocked kitchen with all the necessities (including kid cups and plates which was very much appreciated)! Emilee was wonderful and super accommodating. Could not recommend enough!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,New location with this same owner that we have stayed with multiple times. Roomy house and the best King bed we have ever slept in for sure. Owner always great and friendly and responsive.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It had everything we needed for our stay, will definitely be staying here again in the future!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing, I would not hesitate to stay here ever time I am in the area. It’s beautiful designed, the two beds give you an option of either soft or a more firm bed. Having back issues this was definitely a plus. There is a nice deck on the back, with a table and umbrella, some beautiful lighting other than the porch which makes a nice feel to have a nice dinner out there. I highly recommend this place. The host is an outstanding hostess and she has other properties which I have stayed at one of the other properties. And the condition of that other property is just as fabulous."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"What a fantastic home, well worth the money. So much more comfortable than any of the local hotels in the area. Very peaceful and the host always makes sure your stay is going smoothly. If this place is open all I can say is book we you can. I won’t hesitate to book here again if I am in the area."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Corey went above & beyond for my family. As we were preparing for the loss of my grandmother, he was extremely flexible with check-in and check-out. That relieved a lot of stress during a very stressful personal period.
The place was definitely a home. We felt right at home nearly right away. The kitchen has most of the modern needs. The air conditioning was great for days above 95 degrees F / 35 degrees C.
The host was extremely responsive before, during, and after our stay (left earrings behind). I highly recommend this location to any traveler in the area."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Booking and communicating with Corey prior to check in was easy and prompt. Corey's place was perfect for our weekend stay for my daughter's graduation. Wish I realized this place was avaliable years ago, I would've continued booked Corey's place instead of a hotel. The area was under severe weather warnings the day of our arrival, Corey took time out of his day that day to notify me. Many small things noted within the unit to help with your stay, snacks, travel size amenities if you forgot yours, etc. The only negative thing I can say is, it smells like cat pee when you first walk up. The unit itself does not though. Highly recommend."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I found Corey's place a couple of years ago, and it has become my family's home away from home when we visit my husband's family. The home is always exactly as I remember with snacks and candy waiting on us. I appreciate Corey's accommodations for our family - including last minute bookings. 😊"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the third time I stayed there. I must go to Americus every two or three months to check on a relative at Magnolia Manor and hope to make this place my home away from home on those visits.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Corey was an excellent host and very accommodating. I was in town for the Thanksgiving Holiday and the home was centrally located to everywhere I needed to go.

He responded promptly to all inquiries, and even assisted in the return of my daughter's watch that she accidentally left. Thank you Corey!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Corey's condo was exactly as described and is a great alternative to local hotels in the area. This was my first experience with Airbnb and it went very smoothly. Corey's communication was very clear throughout. There was a big storm in the area during my stay and Corey even checked on me to ensure my safety and comfort. The condo was super clean and the bathroom and kitchen were well stocked. I highly recommend staying here if you are in the area.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a peaceful, quiet, and cozy condo for the two of us. We felt right at home upon entering. We were pleasantly surprised with ground coffee and Kcups (along with a Keurig coffee maker), easily accessible in the kitchen. The bed was comfortable. The small dining area was cute with a coffee theme. The living room set up was nice, with the TV in a prominent location, along with an assortment of books.
Getting into and out of the condo was easy and safe, due to clear instructions. We did communicate with Corey A., and he promptly responded.
This was a great location to get away and enjoy Americus and Plains."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Good quiet place , good value , perfect prepared place for staying"
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Quiet secure area close to most everything. The unit felt like home. Even had the luxury of both kinds of coffee pots! Had everything we needed. Disappointed there was no ice maker only 2 ice trays so bring a bag of ice. Not handicapped accessible doorways. Owners very responsive and helpful.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really really enjoyed the stay!! The host was easy to get in contact with and allowed us a early check in when we arrived earlier than expected and requested it last minute. Everything you need plus more was available. The host provided many complimentary items such a bath wash, bottles of water, seasonings, condiments, snacks, and plastic utensils, and much more than I can remember. All things you normally forget that you need on a trip. Love the security the cameras gave me for my vehicle. Definitely a home away from home!!."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very convenient! I personally like that there were cameras just incase of anything happening with vehicles!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Always a cozy stay! This time my husband needed to do remote work, and the wifi was robust enough to keep up -- no issues. Corey checked in part way to make sure we had everything, such a thoughtful host. Thanks again!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We spent 3 nights in Corey's place while visiting Plains and Americus. It is roomy and comfortable in a great neighborhood. We enjoyed our time and would gladly stay again.
2022-05-01,3,Stayed over a week,"The condo is everything promised in the description. It was clean, located in a good area and had everything needed for a perfect vacation. I had one major issue that made my rating low. I am travel nurse and rented the entire unit for one month. I never had company and only left the occupancy to go to work and to get something to eat. I allowed another female travel nurse to stay for a little over a week as she transitioned to a new nursing assignment. Corey inquired about the occupant because he voted the cameras and noticed her car there. I explained the situation to him, asked if I needed to provide her information and told her that she would not be there long. He told me that this would be alright. She left for a weekend then came back to finish her last shift at the hospital. After looking in the cameras and seeing her car in the driveway again, he have me an ultimatum to pay an additional $1000+ or vacate the premises in 4 days. He explained that the increase in price was to cover him for liability of she was hurt on the premises or her car was broken into (both of which should be covered by insurance). He also informed me that he was aware of our comings and goings and had dates and time stamps on his camera. I am single woman traveling in a new city so I was very concerned to learn that my every move was being watched. I was also concerned about the increase in price when I clearly paid for the entire unit and not per person. I decided to take him up on his offer and leave early. He reimbursed my money quickly and contacted Airbnb to make sure that everything was resolved appropriately. I heard of people increasing prices for Airbnb for travel nurses but I never experienced this until now. I had to make other preparations to find another place to stay (currently a hotel) which was a huge inconvenience. Most concerning to me was the constant monitoring of the cameras, the unexpected price increase for a guest staying for a week and being asked to leave after I offered to give him the information on the guest when he initially asked for it."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Exactly as described. Space was clean. Much appreciated.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Corey’s place is charming and in the perfect location if you’re visiting Americus. The house is equipped with everything you would need when away from home.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great stay! Centrally located, comfortable with nice thoughtful touches. Would stay again if in the area."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This charming little suite is The perfect home away from home! It is cute and has all necessities that he would have in your own home. I was able to cook and meal prep my food for the week and that was a big plus for me. The refrigerator was spacious, there’s a washer and dryer; I was able to wash my dirties instead of carrying them around with me back home. The bed was super comfy, the temp was perfect I didn’t even have to touch the thermostat. Thank you Corey for a nice home away from home."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place to stay, beds comfortable."
2022-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Such a quaint and hidden gem in Americus Georgia. Close to everything.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Reserve it. Great place
2022-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is a roomy, attractive condo in a pleasant , safe area of town. It was well equipped with all that we needed. Their standard of clean isn't as high as some. The heater was very loud outside one of the bedroom windows."

2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,My stay was very nice and the place was cozy and clean. I would definitely stay again.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Two friends of mine and myself thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this cute little condo. Great location. Far enough ""away"" but still close enough to everything you need should you have to go out for anything. If you don't need anything, then this little place has everything you need and all the charm to make you feel at home while away from home. I will definitely look to stay here again when I'm back in the area ☝😊👍"

The lines were fresh and there was ample cleaning and disinfecting supplies available. This is the perfect cozy place to stay when you’re in town!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very quiet neighborhood. You will find everything you need to prepare meals in the kitchen. This is a perfect choice for a short or extended stay.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Place was great. Location was on a beautiful street lined with amazing homes. Large parks within walking distance. If your not against walking most everything is within a 10-20 min walk. Home has everything you could want and more- you’d want for nothing. Beds were little stiff for my liking but that more a matter of preference than anything specifically wrong with the place. Would definitely recommend and would definitely consider staying again whenever I plan another trip back to Americus. Thanks Corey!!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay in Americus. We were in town for Move In Day at GSW. The house was neat, clean and well equipped.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Excellent location, super comfy, always a lovely stay. We stayed for a little over a week and Corey checked in halfway through to make sure we had everything we needed. Very thoughtful host, already looking forward to our next visit."

2021-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The place was fine -- except -- that queen bed just isn't very comfy. Also, microwave didn't work. Mattress is one of the older style with interior springs and it made noise with every tiny little movement on my side. There were enough other pillows where we could substitute for the plasticized-covered ones too. Great location to see Plains, Providence Canyon, and Andersonville. We never met Corey or Edna, but communication was easy, check-in and out simple."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Condo was perfect and very clean and had everything we needed and more. Very quiet area and love all of the beautiful historical homes in the area. Will definitely be recommending to others. Thank you!

2020-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Even cuter than the photos! Location was excellent, quiet little nook off of Taylor. Wish I could have stayed the full two weeks we booked for, but travel plans had to change. Looking forward to the next visit. Thanks Corey!"

2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Corey's place is delightful! It is truly a gem in the middle of Americus. We could not have asked for a better stay.
The location of the condo is great. It is in a lovely neighborhood that is easy to walk. You are close enough to the downtown area if you're a walker and a about a 5 - 8 minute drive if you are not. And, you are also an 8 minute drive from the ""main strip"" where you'll find all of the major stores/amenities for the are.
The condo complex is quiet, and the parking area is more than enough for 2 cars. Inside the unit, the decor is simple and modern. Everything is just enough to make it feel like home. The kitchen is well appointed and includes a Keurig. There is a washer and dryer which is always a plus when traveling with a family. Had we stayed longer, we definitely would have taken advantage of the back patio. The condo is VERY CLEAN. As a picky mom, this was very important to me. The beds are comfortable. All of the basics are provided (e.g., towels, linens, etc.).
Corey is an excellent communicator. He was very responsive to all of my inquiries. He was even able to accommodate our late check-out. And, when I realized that I'd left a few personal items, he offered to mail them back to me.
Should we come back to see President Carter again or just for a weekend away from the hustle and bustle of Atlanta, Corey's condo is where we'll be when in Americus!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Down a narrow, unassuming driveway that opens up into a beautiful pecan grove. The sun was out and it was warm, in stark contrast to Vermont.

It was awesome to bring my pups along for the trip!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Farah and Brian offer a one of a kind Airbnb, and a one of a kind location, with one of a kind hosts!
The pecan orchard is such a serene and unique location, if you leave without feeling centered, and at peace, that’s own fault! 😂 they secluded sound of silent nature, the friendly flock of pasture chickens clucking around, a crackling fire in the orchard fire pit and the zip line in the woods… You read that right… Make for one of the best days I’ve ever had at an Airbnb.
Above this beautiful space, the accurately described and comfortable camper, the genuine customer service and plenty of room to roam around…I hope they don’t mind us coming back for an escape every time we can!
For fellow writers, readers, people/families trying to escape the grind or to just take a break to find a peace of mind, The Pecan Orchard is just for you.
Y’all save a couple weekends for us! ♥️❤️♥️"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The trailer was perfect for a one night stay. More than big enough! The surrounding area was peaceful among the pecan trees. There is a large bunk room to house 4 kids. Not big enough for grown adults. Full size couch which was comfortable along with a queen bedroom. There was an outside area lit up with rope and strand lights, but we did not utilize this area during our stay.
The bathroom is small (as with all trailers) and looks a bit intimidating at first. My husband says the shower was more than suitable to move around in. The water lasted awhile too.
Perfectly nice hosts. Came down to explain the trailer switches for lights and shower “booster heater” to keep the water hotter for longer."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"went to America's for my brother's funeral, was looking for something that would be relaxing and quiet after a couple of really rough days. I am first time Air BNB user so while looking for hotels that were pet friendly I got an Airbnb ad so I thought I would check it out. I am so glad I did.Farah and her family could not have been any better host. She went above and beyond anything we even imagined a host would do.
she and her family were very attentive to our needs, very nicely answered the millions of questions I had for her and was very gracious about it.
The scenery was beautiful and we loved the chickens that live on the property. this whole experience made a very sad trip quite a bit better.
I highly recommend the pecan orchard campground to anyone that wants to get away from all the hustle and bustle and noise and just enjoy the beautiful peace and quiet of the country.

Vontae was an amazing host and we were incredibly Blessed to be able to stay in her home~!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Vontae’s home is adorable, modern, and very welcoming. My family felt right at home. The location was nice and the neighborhood was quiet. The kitchen and open concept to the living area was our favorite part and we really liked that there were TVs in each bedroom. The dining table was the perfect place to eat family meals together and play the board games that were available. Lots of morning sunlight brightens the house very nicely. Vontae’s communication was awesome and extremely hospitable from the start. We are thankful for a great stay! I will definitely be booking here whenever I’m in town and sending future guests!"

The only suggestion me and my family recommend is one of the guest bedrooms had the plastic wrap on the mattress making it difficult to sleep and the sheets were loose fitting. Other than that our stay was amazing and we would definitely book again!!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,My wife and I have never felt more comfortable in a hotel/airbnb than we did here. It was immaculately clean and beautifully decorated. Dana was responsive and very flexible with the checkin/checkout times. We would 100% stay here again!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dana was amazing! We had change in plans for check and she was so accommodating! She even came and introduced herself! The house was immaculate! Everything you need or could ever want. Snacks and water upon arrival, the bathroom was stocked so even if you forgot something she had it! Every nock and cranny had a beautiful decoration and the outside was beautiful with flowers , swing and birds chirping!
Even though there was no WIFI in some parts of the house I could get some reception. Peaceful and quiet and so very relaxing. We came to watch some baseball at GSW and it took us less than 15 min to get to town.
Thanks Dana we will definitely rebook if we come back up!"
2023-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,Dana was very nice . The barn was smaller than expected but it was super cute and very clean. It was close to Dana’s house but they did not disturb us at all. Dana was very gracious and had snacks for us. It was extremely quiet and peaceful. Would love to have been there in winter as there was a cute fireplace . Dish tv was a plus . Wish I could have spent more time there and walked the massive property . It’s close to the city of Americus and not too far from Plains Ga the home of Jimmy Carter. Wish the property was a bit cheaper as I’d love to stay again.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our son was playing baseball at Andrew University a few miles away and the Chicken Coop made our stay wonderful. Definitely a gem!!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect little place with everything you need. Very close location to everything. This place was a little pricey but I couldn't find any other place due to a large Wrestling Tournament. Place was clean and check in was easy.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"It was very peaceful and calming, it wasn’t far from town either which worked out great because we did a lot of running back and forth for things. Mrs. Dana was very polite and even took it upon herself to check in on us. A very cozy place, would recommend to anyone who wanted to stay away from constant traffic zooming by (hotels) but not wanting to stay 30-40 minutes away from town to do so. It was also very easy to find and just a few simple roads so no worries in getting lost."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Chicken Coop was just as described & as seen in the photos… even better in person! Dana & her husband did an amazing job with renovating the space with such detail, quality of work & so many accommodating extra touches.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a perfect little place to stay for the weekend. Our host was so gracious and kind. She answered all my questions before booking and once we were there in a very timely manner. She even worked it out to let us have a last-minute early check-in. It was affordable, cute, comfortable, and homey. The temperature was excellent inside, not hot at all in the summer heat. (I get hot easily and was worried when I saw a window unit, but it stayed very cold inside our entire stay!) It was a pretty good size too. We will definitely stay next time we're in the area. We can't wait!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and neat. Small back yard to walk my dog around. Margaret was so accommodating with late check out and so responsive to any of our needs. Close to downtown and restaurants. 5 minutes to GSW.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Everything as described and host was great. Only thing was you may want ear plugs if a light sleeper as was in a semi commercial area between two main thoroughfares so had some road noise late at night. Not the hosts fault at all. Went to CVS for some and slept fine. Comfortable and cozy. Felt safe and secure. Was very clean and had everything you need to prepare meals. Good wifi and cable . Will book again for sure next time we travel to that area
Host very responsive and friendly to all questions. Thanks again S. Margaret!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,I would agree that this place is a Diamond in the rough but it was fairly quiet. The only noise I heard was from the road with trucks or motorcycles going by. I would totally stay again.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as described, location is great for getting downtown."
2022-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at Diamond in the Rough. Kitchen amenities are top notch. It is a work in progress so if that isn't your thing you may want to stay elsewhere.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was in a bind since I was on call for the hospital and there were no hotel rooms in town. I pulled up and second guessed myself. The outward appearance of the place having renovations makes you think you are in for a mess, but after entering the apartment your fears are relieved. The place was very comfy and roomy. My call night was great in her wonderful place. I’m staying again tonight!!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Fantastic people and they offer a clean comfy stay at a great price.
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This little apartment is comfortable and roomy enough. The interior is as advertised. Kitchen is well-stocked and has a stove and large refrigerator and sink. Wifi is strong. Bedroom is very roomy. Bathroom is also fine except it takes time for the hot water to come out. Bed is comfortable. Bedroom could be better with a bedside table with reading lamp. I also gave Margaret some feedback regarding the outward appearance from the street.
I came here because I wanted to visit Plains, President Carter's home and birthplace. It is just 10 miles away so Margaret's was a perfect spot. It is also not far from Andersonville, a notorious Confederate prison during the Civil War. Worth a visit if you are into history. There is also a good Mexican restaurant downtown.
Overall a very good value."
2022-09-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Space was nice and clean. Location was a plus for us since it was near our event in Americus. Host was very accommodating regarding check in and check out. The pre-check in video was cool. The small courtyard out back was nice, especially since the weather had turned cooler. Great for our short weekend stay."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always great stay!
2022-09-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely cute one bedroom place to stay. The owners are great communicators and the place was very clean. The outside of the home is still in renovation phasing, so don't be surprised when you drive up. Would definitely stay again when back in Americus."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I really enjoyed our stay. It was so nice to be able to visit our daughter at GSW and bring our puppies. The home is lovely. Very clean and comfortable.
I was a little worried that the window AC unit might not cool the bedroom, however, it was not an issue at all. Even in August, the place was very cool and comfortable.
We felt safe and we were close to town and the university. Margaret was extremely nice and very responsive. We would definitely stay again."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great stay. very convenient. Margaret was an excellent host.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Such a lovely place, I want to keep it all to myself. Complete privacy despite not being out in the middle of nowhere. I felt comfortable enough to take my dogs out in my pajamas and I wouldn’t see a single soul. The host is so thoughtful, she provided 3 different color wash cloths for 3 people so we could tell them apart. The only thing I could wish for was a bit more paper products but otherwise it was a perfect stay. It had everything you could wish for."

Will stay here again!!!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The place was cleaned, easy to find (albeit a dark road so be on lookout at night) and a quiet area. The backyard is not fenced, but has large trees creating a sort of tree fence. It’s private and the neighbors were also quiet and to themselves. Very close to the downtown Americus area, so certainly check that out! The location is about 1 hr to providence canyon state park, 1hr 20min from Columbus Ga, 1 hr 45 min from Macon Ga…. So lots of places to visit from this location!! Lovely place."

2021-07-01,3,Stayed a few nights,The host is exceptional and very coperative. Initially we thought it was rough in diamond but we were proven wrong. Its a nice place and does have lots of scope of improvement. Diamond can be polished more. Its good for short stay only.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This place was more than suitable for my weeks stay. It was extremely clean and provided everything that one would need for a short stay. It’s location is close to downtown Americus but is tucked away in a quiet lane off the Main Street.

2021-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"A define work in progress, perhaps more rough than diamond as of our date of stay, but Safa's heart is in the right place, she will get to diamond phase with more time. We stayed one night and worked out well as a base to explore Americus and its many architectural offerings."

Even though it's not completely done I would stay there again. Its not to far from downtown and with restaurant's and a little coffee shop we enjoyed.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Safa has excellent communication. Super quick and available to answer any questions you may have! She is very strait forward in her listing, but it was better than I had expected. It is a work in progress but you can tell she is off to a great start!
It’s obvious she and her husband are excited to transform an older home into a lovely updated home away from home. We look forward to staying here again and seeing how the whole house transitions into something beautiful.
We had all of the basic necessities and even got to try a new latte! The place was sparkling clean. The newly installed flooring and stainless steel appliances also made it feel extra clean."

2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"the house is very cute, well decorated, beds are comfortable, and home was clean. vacasa property management company is not my favorite to work with. they are very rigid. this is my second time staying in one of their properties. both times the property was in a questionable neighborhood. in this case the door code was wrong when we arrived very late at night. local person did respond and apologize.
my first experience with vacasa, when asked for assistance with a potential left item I was met with extra fees and no personal touch. $25 just to look for a pair of headphones. during this last experience I tried to change the dates of our stay by one day and was immediately told that that was not within their allowable rules. as I said, quite rigid. not what I am used to with most airbnb hosts. otherwise a good experience."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jennifer was a great host. Very nice and responsive when we had any questions or concerns. Everything we needed was provided for us, plus some.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jennifer's place in Preston was neat as a pin and very clean. It was in a great location for our sightseeing in Providence Canyon, Plains, Americus, and Andersonville. It was very cozy and felt like home away from home during our stay. The kitchen was well equipped and we made use of it for our evening meals. There aren't many eating establishments in the near vicinity but two stores very close by if you need groceries, etc. Jennifer was great with communicating what we needed and very responsive.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time on our two nights stay. Jennifer was a great host and the place was clean with plenty of towels and extras. First night we loved using the fire pit to roast hotdogs and marshmallows. We brought our own wood but there was a huge stack already available. Next day we went to Providence Canyon (the reason for the trip) and it was a quick 25 minute drive. A most do, it’s beautiful. On the way back we stopped by Richland Rum Distillery and did a tour and tasting. Loved hearing how the rum was made and of course the tasting was great. The best part about this place was waking up in the morning and sitting on the back porch with a cup of coffee. The view is beautiful and relaxing. Oh and the beds were super comfortable too. I recommend Jennifer’s place. Looks just like the photos. I would come again if visiting this area."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Clean and quiet. Great yard for a dog. Close to the canyons. Would stay again!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,Jennifer was a fantastic host
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had a great time at Jennifer’s place. Communication was super easy and quick and the place looks exactly like it does in the pictures. The neighbourhood is very conveniently located! Would absolutely recommend staying there!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Jennifer was a sweetheart and allowed us to check in early. I’m a big foodie so the only bummer for me was having to drive to find places to eat. Definitely will get your small town living experience! Quiet neighborhood and has a cute back patio to sip on your morning coffee. Not far from the Canyons which were a lot to fun to explore and hike. Thank you again Jen for opening up your place for us 🐾
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Jennifer was a great host. We had a wifi issue due to a storm that had just passed and she and her husband came by to help trouble shoot, call the Internet Company and it was all up and running in a few hours. Wifi worked amazingly well after that. House is super clean and has everything you need for your stay. Only thing that was a bit annoying is that there’s a lot of flys and bugs but that’s not her fault. We are in the middle of Summer and that tends to Happen around this time of year. We got to see deers from the back porch which was super Cool and a must do is the providence canyon. IT’S HUGEEE!!! Very beautiful scenery. Thank you Jennifer for great stay ❤️"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time we've stayed here ! The host is very friendly, the house is always clean and the area peaceful . We will definitely be back. 😊"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,As always Jennifer’s Airbnb was perfect! We have stayed in several of her properties and they are always exactly as posted. This one was quiet and private. It was clean and charming. We used the fire pit out back and it was perfect to sit around the fire and talk and watch fireflies. Thanks again Jennifer for a great stay!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Husband, two furbabies and I did a road trip that included a brief stop in Providence Canyon. It was very hard to find a clean and affordable place that allowed dogs. Every place we checked and allowed dogs had very questionable reviews and pictures on the cleanliness and it was super small for the price. That being said after weeks of searching somehow we came across this gem. YES A GEM! The place is as described, SUPER CLEAN and the host provides plenty of towels and cleaning supplies for your comfort and more essentials that you can take advantage of. The location is secluded as expected. We finished exploring Providence Canyon quicker than expected and needed something to do. I reached out to the host and she GUIDED ME in the right direction. We had amazing and TASTY peanut butter ice cream, and boiled peanuts, we visited the Rum Distillery and ended up eating at a Mexican Restaurant. If you are looking for somewhere to stay in this area stop looking this is exactly what you need."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,10/10!!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our experience was great! Good location, only 30 minutes away from Providence State Park."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I go to AirBnBs quite regularly as I love to explore in my free time and I also have a job that requires travel very regularly.
Usually, AirBnBs will be set up similarly to hotel rooms - they will have Towels, ToiletPaper, Coffee, AFewMugs, AFewPlates, and a SetOfLinens.
This AirBnb is nothing like that. This place feels like a house that is meant to be lived in. It is fully stocked in every way. Additionally, there were many accessories in this AirBnB that I have never seen in others - like placemats, coasters to set hot pans on, and a hook by the door for keys.
The home is immaculately sealed, as I did not see a single bug or fly or any creature otherwise during my entire stay.
The vibe is more like staying at a family member's home while they are out of town, as opposed to crashing in a motel. Truthfully, it is perhaps the most well thought-out AirBnB I have ever been to. The host is prompt, kind, and very informative. I have no complaints!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,loved the wildlife!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My son and I came up for father’s day trip from Pensacola to hike Providence Canyon and to visit the POW Museum at Andersonville. We found our accommodations just as described. It is an older manufactured home, but don’t judge the book by the cover! Inside was clean and well-supplied, all the stuff works, and it was very comfortable. Kitchen was stocked with coffee(!) and condiments, and toiletries were provided. We really enjoyed sitting out on the back deck, it’s totally private and faces a farm field, where we saw deer and a variety of birds. We were very happy with the place."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place for my family and dogs. Perfect size and plenty of yard to walk the dogs. Very quite and relaxing. Great value
2023-06-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"The place was clean, UT the terrible mold smell in the entire house, and the linen closet was insane. I booked it for 3 days, and if I slept 8 hrs from the entire trip, it was a lot. The host told me first the smell, probably from the old wood from the trailer being that its old and vintage and then told me they had no idea. Between candles and febreeze, it made a difference."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer is an absolutely amazing host, she is very responsive and easy to communicate with. The house was very clean, modern, had everything i needed to feel at home, and was an easy walk to all the local stores. Also close to a grocery store which was handy. I would highly recommend this wonderful place and look forward to my next visit."

The icing on the cake was flavored coffee cream in the fridge chilling. That was awesome. The place had a charming Georgian feel as we experienced the sunrise on the back porch. She also provided a battery boost when our truck battery died as we were getting ready to leave, without a long wait. I recommend this place to anyone coming through this area and need a place to stay that is quiet, warm, and welcoming. Thanks Jennifer you are a super duper host. We will be back."

Highly recommend if you are looking for a stay in Preston or if you are visiting Andersonville Prison National Historic Site. It was only a short drive away.

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I enjoyed our stay here! Jennifer is a great host and is very quick and clear in communication. The home doesn't look like much on the outside, and we were a little thrown off because the spaces next door to the house are abandoned. Inside, however, the place is nice and well-maintained. You can tell that Jennifer puts in a lot of effort to create a comfortable, efficient, and clean space for her guests."

2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is the second property of Jennifer's that we have stayed at and each time has been a great experience. We had a hiccup with a breaker, but she is such an accommodating and sweet host, she was able to fix our living situation. Her house is cozy and comfy and our favorite was definitely the front porch me and my children loved sitting outside and listening to the rain on the tin roof. Everything was clean and everything we needed was there. Jennifer herself is just one of the most pleasant hosts I have ever experienced, she goes above and beyond to make sure we are settled and have everything that we need. She definitely gets an A+ for her kindness. I highly recommend Jennifer's place and will definitely stay again!! 😁😁"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place will always stay here when I visit
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy place that had everything and more than I could ever need. The place was spotless and Jennifer was kind enough to leave the lights and AC on for me because I was arriving late in the evening. It was very easy to find. It was about 20 minutes or so away from my son’s college- all country roads, so no traffic. Do not let the look of the yard turn you away. This place is well worth staying at. The backyard is surrounded by beautiful woods, and there is a nice front and back porch. I was in and out at night and never saw any of the neighbors. I’m hoping to stay there again when I find out, for sure, when my son’s school is having parents weekend. I was going to stay at a hotel right down the street from my son’s school , but ended up having to take my mom’s dog with me because she was hospitalized. There was plenty of room for the dog to go about his business. You could even park a vehicle pulling a boat in the yard if you needed to. But, plan on taking groceries with you because there is nothing open nearby as far as restaurants/pizza in the late evening. But, hey, it’s out in the country, what else would you expect??!!"
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,Great place Jennifer is a great host

I recommend to anyone looking to escape the insanity of the big city!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,All the comforts of home!! This place is perfectly located for a trip to explore the area and there are some wonderful places to explore. There are so many wonderful all-American towns nearby to experience and don't miss hiking Providence Canyon State Park.

2024-03-01,4,Group trip,It was good just need to note that renters need to bring wash clothes and towels but everything else was good
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,House was very cozy and warm. A lot of space and could sit on the back screened in porch to relax.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Have stayed here more than once, it’s a very good place to stay!"
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,thanks!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and spacious.
2024-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Lots of space to spread out in this home! We appreciated the extra den separate from the bedrooms. There was a fair amount of noise at night from the neighborhood dogs. I would note that there is no dishwasher, and not a lot of dinnerware provided, so you may consider paper and plastic. Overall, very basic kitchen items provided— we did not see a toaster provided. There were several lightbulbs out upon arrival along with used, wet washcloth and towels in the kitchen. I’d also note that the carport pole on the ground along the front sidewalk was a tripping hazard, especially at night. A reflective strip may be helpful."
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,This is our 3rd stay at Keena’s house! We love renting it because you can really spread out and enjoy the entire home. I’m sure we’ll be back soon!
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Me and my co workers enjoyed staying here while working in town! Keena is wonderful to work with

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home wonderful host
2023-07-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The house is a great size with lots of space. If that is what you are looking for then this is good. If you are looking for the air bnb that has the cute little added touches while being far from home, you will not find that here. I think with a little more work this will be a great airbnb , its just not there yet. We unfortuately had a storm while we were there and lost electricity for more then 24 hours, there were no flashlights which put us in an uncomfortable position. We lost the food we had in the fridge and had to find somewhere that had power so that we could shower. Because we flew into the area we did not travel with household items and were a little taken back that you are responsible for your own trash bags, I think knowing that you should come completely prepared we would of stopped before getting there, overall the house is nice, just missing some essentials. I will say that Keena did respond promptly whenever I sent her a message."
2023-06-01,4,Group trip,Our stay was good but the beds were not very comfortable and the house was not very clean.

2023-06-01,3,Stayed with kids,"As Airbnb goes, it was ok for the town, but dies need some tlc."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We visited Americus as the last stop of a long, two-week road trip. We needed a place to unwind and relax, and this rental fit our needs nicely.
It’s also central to the two locations that we wanted to visit, namely the national historic sites at Andersonville and Plains (Jimmy Carter’s home).
The host responded to our questions promptly and helpfully with cheerful, accurate information. We don’t know when we might be back in this area, but if we are, we’d consider seeking out this rental again. Thanks very much!"
