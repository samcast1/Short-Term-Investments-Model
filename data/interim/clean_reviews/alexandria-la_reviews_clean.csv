2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Barrett’s apartment was comfy and cute! It was close to the freeway and in a walkable neighborhood with my pup. The bed was super comfortable and Barrett was very responsive. We stayed just one night on a road trip but we’d definitely stay again.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great little place! I only spent one night here during a road trip, but I will add it to my list for longer stays. The neighborhood was very quiet and peaceful (with friendly neighborhood cats!) and with easy access to the interstate. The unit was comfortable and cozy and made great use of a smaller space. The bed was incredibly comfortable, too! I don't usually sleep well in unfamiliar places but the sheets were so soft and the pillows so fluffy, I fell asleep immediately and slept well. Priceless after a long day on the road. Definitely recommend for an affordable stay in Alexandria!"

2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The small apartment was adequate for our needs. We appreciated the way ￼Barrett responded quickly to our request for information and went the extra mile for us to do what we needed to do for our grandchildren. It’s not easy to meet the needs of special needs grandchildren, but Garrett helped make it do-able. Clean place, safe place to spend the night, with a nice tv, bed, bathroom, and kitchenette."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I loved how nice and clean Barrett’s property was. The furniture and appliances were well placed as well. Having a toddler I ALWAYS notice outlets and always bring extra outlet covers to ensure my child’s safety and was impressed that I only had to cover 2 electrical outlets because of how well everything was placed. The barn doors were adorable and I immediately felt at ease. I REALLY liked that there were not many breakables placed around too. Very family friendly home. We will return.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a lovely home/apartment. The pictures really do not do it justice.
Check in was a breeze.
It is in a good location, wasn’t too far off the interstate. I felt safe here.
The only thing I did not like was the door that separated the bathroom from the kitchen. It was a flimsy plastic folding door. It did not shut well.
I would stay again!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was wonderful. Everything was very clean. The space is cozy with a comfortable bed and a nice living room area. The gum ball machine was very unique as well. There is a kitchen if you wish to make a meal or restaurants are a short drive away. Barrett was extremely responsive to an issue we had and fixed it right away. We definitely recommend this place if in the area.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Stayed here for the second time and had a good experience! Place is as described and portrayed in th pictures.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My husband and I along with our 19-month-old daughter stayed here for a night on our way to Mississippi from Texas. It was perfect for what we needed! Barrett provided a pack n play and a high chair for our daughter, and it was great that we could have our daughter sleep in the bedroom and we could close the door and stay up later in the living room. We ended up sleeping on the pull-out couch just to avoid the risk of waking our daughter by going into the bedroom, so it was great having that option! Our daughter also loved the gumball machine!
Overall, it was a great stay, and we look forward to staying there again on our way back home!"

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The apartment was very clean and cute BUT the bed was terribly uncomfortable and there were plastic coverings on the mattresses which I understand for cleanliness but it was so noisy and HOT. I'm always cold and I ended up putting the air as low as possible to make up for the plastic sheet under me that was generating sound and heat like you wouldn't believe. None of us slept. Also the gumball machine requires quarters so if you have children, be warned."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Larry & Michelle place exceed our expectations. It felt ""at home"" everything was nice and comfortable. When I am picking my Airbnb I always look for ""Guest Favorite"" or ""Super Host"". Let's just they need, Super Host, rare find, guest favorite, 5 stars, etc under they name because they are all that."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Larry & Michelle place was absolutely beautiful 😍. I felt right at home the moment I walked in. I enjoyed the peacefulness of this home. The house is beautifully decorated and I absolutely loved the porches and enjoyed just sitting outside and enjoying the sunshine. This house felt like my home away from home. And Larry and Michelle made me feel so special while staying here. The pound cake was so amazingly delicious I think I ate half of it by myself lol. For Mother’s Day I was presented with home made treats and flowers 💐. Which was so unexpected and but greatly appreciated. Let me just say the cheesecake treat is to die for. If you’re looking for a peaceful and beautiful home to stay in while visiting Alexandria you want go wrong staying here. Larry and Michelle was an absolute pleasure to work with and talk to. They will make sure that you have everything you need to enjoy this beautiful home. When I come back to visit I will definitely be staying here again. God bless you all!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a perfect location for a couple of country folks. The house is located close to the airport and good restaurants along MaCarthur Dr., at the same time it is hidden along a quiet country road. The hosts were mindful answering a few questions and they checked in a couple times to make sure we were comfortable. The house was extremely clean, neat and well supplied. We considered a hotel but for just a few dollars more you can have a whole house instead of a large room. Also, I am not a cake eater, but the cake they supplied was delicious! When we visit friends in Alexandria, we will center our travel around the availability of Compass Point."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,WOW!! The Compass Point Cottage is absolutely AMAZING! I have stayed at many AIRBNB's and Larry & Michelle's place was by far the best place we have ever stayed at. They are the most incredible hosts. The house was beautifully decorated and feeling of home hits you immediately. Then there is the homemade pound cake they made for us that was waiting for us when we arrived. Truly the most comfortable and welcoming home away from home. I highly recommend their place to anyone who is looking for a place in the Alexandria area. The location is perfect. Country setting but just minutes from the main highway in Alexandria with many restaurants and shopping places.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Compass Point Cottage provided a comfortable place to stay while visiting the area. The home was in a quiet and peaceful location away from the busyness of the city. Recommendations were given for local restaurants and activities which were so helpful and appreciated. Larry was quick to respond to our messages, and he checked in to make sure all was going well and we had everything we needed. We definitely recommend Compass Point Cottage!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the second time staying here. We scheduled a job in the area based on the availability of this home. That’s how great this place and hosts are.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I don’t usually write reviews. But, they really make you feel welcome. From check in to check out. I felt like I was staying with a relative. Their home is clean and comfortable. Everything was as described. Better than the photos. If I have to go back to Alexandria again, I will schedule it around their availability￼."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Possibly the best cake I’ve ever had!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,One of the best airbnb that’s I’ve had the pleasure of renting. It had everything we needed to feel right at home! Very clean and organized. Michelle and Larry were very responsive and kind. Thank you for letting me and my family stay and will definitely be rebooking.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is by far the best Airbnb we have ever stayed in! So beautiful, so clean, so very comfortable! Larry & Michelle were truly great host and quick to respond to any and all questions! I would highly recommend this place!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"From start to finish my stay exceeded my expectations. From the moment I made the booking, the communication with the host was prompt, friendly, and informative. Upon arrival, I was immediately impressed by the cleanliness. The home is beautifully decorated, well-maintained and equipped with everything needed for a comfortable stay. The hosts put a lot of thought into creating a welcoming and cozy environment. What truly set this Airbnb stay apart was the host's exceptional hospitality. Larry and Michelle went above and beyond to ensure my stay was memorable. From being welcomed with a cream cheese pound cake complete with strawberry topping and whip cream in the fridge to the hosts remaining accessible and attentive, they truly made me feel like a valued guest. They have set the bar incredibly high for future Airbnb stays. Five stars does not do them justice."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an amazing place. It has the charm of a country cottage with the accessibility to everything you need in town. Larry and Michelle were more like friends than hosts. They anticipated our needs and did all they could to meet them.
This is the best Airbnb I have stayed at and have shared this with those in the Alexandria area and those interested in going there!! I am somewhat reluctant to say that because I don't want to lose the option to stay here in the future by having others book it :).
Don't miss this gem and the chance to wake up to a beautiful sunrise."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Third time staying here and each time is better than the last! Larry & Michelle are wonderful. They make sure you are comfortable and enjoying your stay. The home is immaculate and so comfortable. You will feel right at home. I've said it in previous reviews but if you're in Alexandria and need a place to stay - I highly recommend! 10/10! Best AirBNB experience I've ever had.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved it so much the first time I stayed a second time! Best AirBNB experience I've ever had. From the wonderful hosts who do whatever they can to make you feel at home - to the gorgeous and spacious home and all the little details. I highly recommend CPC for anyone traveling to Alexandria or needing a place to stay. Comfortable beds, spacious chef's kitchen, cozy living space - you name it. Thank you Larry & Michelle!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The cleaest Airbnb we have ever stayed in. The hosts were so friendly and we felt right at home. The house is located within 10 minutes of everything. We hope to make this a yealy tradition we had such a grea time!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"By far the nicest AirBNB experience I've ever had from start to finish. Larry and Michelle (hosts) are friendly, responsive, and incredibly thoughtful. From the handwritten notes to the cream cheese cake and strawberries left for me and my family to enjoy, everything was perfect. The space is clean, private, quiet, peaceful, meticulously maintained and very cozy. The location is peaceful yet convenient. You can see the stars so brilliantly at night from their property, even see a horse trotting down the road... yet you're close to all the conveniences you need. I highly recommend to anyone looking for a weekend getaway or a longer stay - you won't be disappointed."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I found compass cottage point online and secured the dates requested. My family and I were in town for funeral and needed extra space for my aunt and uncle.

2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed our stay very much. The grounds were beautiful and it was a quiet peaceful retreat. The house was very clean and a historical treasure. We were happy that the AC was very efficient given the age of the house and the Louisiana heat! Our only recommendation would be to better equip the kitchen. We tend to do a lot of cooking when staying at air bnbs and found it a little difficult with the supplies on hand. Hope to visit again soon.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I think that the pictures does not do enough justice. The perfect cozy home ambience can’t be described. But I will do my best.
Staying here you will feel right at home, because this isn’t room sharing. It’s like having your own home. Friendly neighbors are always a plus
When you come in you will always find a handwritten note from the host. Giving you crucial information as well as their contact number. While welcoming you to Alexandria
This place has more than enough space that I need..it’s always just me when I visit but I can see how I can comfortably add more people & not feel like we are on top one another.
Location, Location, Location. This stay is located near a main road in Alexandria. So traveling is breeze. Also a one minute drive to a shopping complex
Perfect for someone visiting
I don’t want to forget the kitchen has everything you would need to cook if you prefer your own cooking. Pots Pans Toaster and more…Already Provided.
Stayed Here Many Times
& Booking Soon"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,this place is just advertised and we thoroughly enjoyed our time here and hope to return.
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"We wanted a house to keep our family, niece and nephews under one roof so we could maximize our time together. It was perfect! From sitting on the porch enjoying coffee to game night in the spacious den. Only wish our trip was longer!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Amazing place! We were very comfortable and Sharnael was a great host!
Perfect place for our group. The house has enough room for multiple guests with private rooms."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Oxbow was awesome!! Everything provided was above & beyond the items listed. We enjoyed the peaceful atmosphere, the wrap around porch was enjoyable and the neighbors were friendly. The home was spacious and we were able to gather comfortably and reconnect. The staircase and flooring was very nice! The hosts were responsive when we needed assistance and very helpful. They provided more than the basic essentials for the kitchen found in most homes. The sunsets were beautiful! We truly enjoyed our stay and would certainly stay here again! Very nice property!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,This place is Awesome. The view was beautiful. Very spacious and comfortable beds. My family and I enjoyed every minute of or stay. We are already planning another trip.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The place was exceptional clean and very accommodating. Would definitely recommend staying here. It’s beautiful
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Overall a very nice place to stay! Would be perfect in the summer. Only comment is that the office room had a slight smell (most likely just from wood) so would let it air out if planning to sleep in there! We left some things behind and they were very helpful letting us get them back.
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"It's really really nice!
I can imagine a lovely young couple getting married on the dock and hosting an amazing dinner party in this lovely space with the new family. It's huge... and has so much beauty in its woodwork and the surrounding nature. Thank you for being such a wonderful and responsive host!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"We were caught in the awful freeze. Every road was iced over and we were stranded in Baton Rouge.
I’m sorry I didn’t know exactly how to do this review.
We had to cancel our stay, but Shanael and Airbnb support were so good at helping us!!!!!
We were so exhausted from driving from New Orleans!!
Shanael was outstanding in helping us get through this.
She is very kind and helpful throughout the process…"
2024-01-01,4.0,Group trip,"We booked this place last minute when inclement weather affected our other plans.Sharnael & Bethany were quick to respond & were clear in their instructions for the house. However, having booked many other much busier locations, we were surprised at the lack of flexibility with check-in time.
The house was clean and as described on AirBnB but scantily furnished compared to the FB listing. It appears rather neglected outside (overgrown & dead landscaping around the house) but inside was well maintained.
It’s a beautiful & spacious house with a well stocked kitchen.
Important to note, however, that all the beds but one had thin very uncomfortable mattresses. The downstairs “office”/extra bedroom had no lamps or side tables so if you use the sleeper sofa it’s either full overhead lights or nothing. Same for the living room.
Overall, under the circumstances & the time of year, this property worked for us in a pinch.The beautiful lake views would definitely make a summer visit worth it."
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Sharnael was great, the house was absolutely beautiful and it accommodated my family well. I loved the view of the lake. We had our twin boys , one of their wives and a nephew stay with us and we had plenty of room and bathrooms. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to stay in a beautiful and very clean house. We live in ATL and our boys live in Houston and we truly enjoyed staying here."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We stayed here when we came in for a wedding. It was so nice to have a calm and peaceful place to return back to. We are definitely looking forward to visiting again during the summer!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a great place to celebrate with family. There is a large open area, 2 refrigerators, and a lot of space around the house. The kids were able to play board games in one room while the adults spent time catching up in another.
The mornings were great as we were able to take in the beautiful sunrises over the water."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place on the water
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying here. The views of the water were so peaceful and it was so quiet at night, made for great sleeping. We had 4 couples and one 2 year old and the place was just perfect for our needs. The two refrigerators were a definite plus for Thanksgiving day leftovers. I would definitely book this house again for my family."
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful spot for a large crew! Great stay!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The place was outstanding and it made us feel right at home and even more. Being able to go out in yhe backyard and catch fish was great. I will be booking with them again many times over!!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was great for our family gathering. The back porch is always in the shade with a nice breeze. Two bath towels per bathroom is not enough for two people. We loved the kitchen. A TV outside would be a great extra! Will definitely stay here again.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place and setting, would highly recommend and look forward to staying there in the future"
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Neighbors and community was very welcoming and friendly. Locals were great people really went over and beyond to make us feel at home.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,We loved how large this house was for our large cousin gathering. We are cousins who wanted to reconnect with where our parents grew up. The house was open and had enough room to accommodate us easily. The river was beautiful and we enjoyed the porch. The only problem was the heat and that wasn’t anyone’s fault but Mother Nature! We talked about using this home again in a couple of years for the same thing.
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Setting and home was nice - Outside yard and porch could use chairs and spray for ants and wasps.
With outside treated, can be a nice place! We loved to privacy and boating on the Red River!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,If you are looking for a place to kick back in the afternoon and enjoy yourself this is the place to be!

2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,This place is amazing. Perfect in every way. Highly recommend it
2022-11-01,4.0,Group trip,"We enjoyed our stay for our girls trip. House was as described. The breaker tripped in one of the rooms that controlled the hot water heater, but once we figured that out (our host did very well with keeping in communication) we were fine. Only one of us took a cold shower😁As I read on another review, make sure to get your snacks or anything you need beforehand as it is a little ways out. Beautiful spacious home!!!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,This property is great for any family event or occasion! We were very pleased with the house and the surrounding area. The host was very pleasant and helpful.
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing lake view! The house is somewhat difficult to find and food/amenities are in short supply once you're there so be sure to pack for your meals. The kitchen is fantastic though: well stocked with cooking supplies and certainly spacious enough to cook for the masses. The porches are phenomenal--wrapping around the entire house and overlooking the gorgeous lake--but you might want to bring additional folding chairs to enjoy. The charcoal grill was great for outdoor cooking.
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,beautiful property
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"The Oxbow Retreat was truly a retreat! Amy, was very easy to communicate with prior to checking in, during our stay, and upon check out. The home is exactly as the pictures show. The kitchen is a chef’s dream! The cooks in our group loved how large it was to have someone cooking and someone cleaning dishes while others could pass through without ever getting into each other’s way. The openness of the living room, kitchen, and dining was large enough to accommodate our guests comfortably without ever feeling crowded. Each bedroom had an en suite bath, this was a plus for our group!
The boat dock and launch were a nice feature. We enjoyed several kayak adventures during our stay. Although the weather did not cooperate with all of our planned activities, the massive wrap around porch and open living kept us dry while still being able to enjoy corn hole and yard Jenga. We are looking forward to our next stay at The Oxbow Retreat!"
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The house is absolutely beautiful on a gorgeous lake. My family were the first guests so there was some room for improvement. Bring a fishing pole, boat & rafts!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Friendly text:
Hey there!
lhad a fantastic week-long stay at the Queen B.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Dealing with William was so easy !! He responded to every text or question I asked. Place as described, very large shower detailed instructions & a very nice ""welcome letter"" posted in kitchenette. Asked for any & all suggestions or critiques for improving his place for future guests.I ran into bad weather at the vendor event I was in area for .He answered late texts & understood that I'd be very late due damage to my tent & packing up at event .Gave me extra instructions on parking in drive& area as he knew from my texts I was a bit overwhelmed from damage to our set up. His entire block is lit up blue with porch lights & is either a law enforcement supporting neighborhood or all owned by law enforcement which was comforting as I'm also a retired officer & felt my vehicle full of my art and fixtures in an open bed pick up was safe & sound . I have shared his info on several of my artist & law enforcement social media pages and given him an extensive recommendation Thanks again! D"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Tiny home newly renovated ,spotless,felt very safe off street parking well lit Welcome letter in kitchen asked for any feedback or suggestions to make stay more comfortable. Host answers all texts almost immediately. Assisted me when I made incorrect reservation with company to correct my mistake& made sure I was refunded for the incorrect reservation!Highly recommended!!If I return to area will check unavailability.I arrived late at night was nice quietly area easy to find and parking was literally 5 feet from the homes entrance. Shared on all my social media and recommended to friends and coworkers!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cabin was small and modest, but it was exactly what we needed and was fairly priced. Property had everything we needed for a simple weekend, and communication with the owner/host was great. Wouldn't hesitate to book again should the need arise."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Ambien Host myself I stride myself on taking pride in the things I do in the places I stay. This was by far a five star stay not only did WILLIAM have a conversation with me before I actually started my stay. He allowed my service pets to be there with me. Being that I’m going through a bad domestic situation. This place was really like a second home to me. I appreciate the fact that I was given an opportunity to stay here. If in the future, I am ever in need of a place to stay. This definitely will be by far my top choice. This definitely had all the bills and whistles that I was looking for which made for great stay."

Easy to find and the perfect place for my husband while he was in the area for business.
The laundry room was an added bonus!
If we are ever in the area again, we will certainly stay here!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was not familiar with the area and traveling for work. Read all the reviews for the hotels in town and was not impressed at all especially for the prices of those hotels. Found this tiny home listing on air bnb and all the reviews were great! After staying there I know why, it’s exactly as it’s pictured in the add and described perfectly it’s quaint and subtle and comfortable. It’s perfect for somebody traveling for work by themselves or for a couple looking for something small to stay in and have privacy that hotels don’t have, and the price is very affordable and you get way more than you pay for with this place from all the amenities that are offered and the comfort of this little home. William was a great host and any questions I had responded very quickly and told me any issues I had or anything I needed to don’t hesitate to message him. Will definitely stay here again when I’m in the area!"

We were staying for my daughters softball tournament & originally had booked a hotel room for the same price as what we paid for Rory’s place. So when we found Rory’s for same price but bigger, nicer, homie vibes plus a kitchen to cook instead of take out, I knew we had to cancel hotel immediately and stay here! So happy we did &if we are ever in the area again and Rory’s is available we will without a doubt be staying here! Everything you need plus more. Also would like to add that the day of check-out we needed an extra hour so instead of check out @11 we requested 12. Rory was very friendly and let us without a problem! This was extremely helpful to us & we are thankful for such a nice stay with nice, helpful, friendly host! Easy check-in, nice home, quiet neighborhood, &friendly, helpful host!

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The condo was very nice and in a great location. I felt safe getting in late at night. However, it wasn’t too clean. The stove top was dirty. There was dog hair on the throw pillow. The fridge/freezer were not cleaned out. There was open liquor and other alcohols in the fridge and cabinets(that my 5year old found). The shower curtain was stained & the tub wasn’t wiped down too good. I messaged Rory and he apologized and offered to come the next morning to clean, but we went ahead and just cleaned it.

The cons: There were some amenities shown on the listing that weren't actually provided (i.e. , body wash) as well as some amenities that weren't listed that I think should be provided (i.e., paper towels). I will mention more of these items to Mickel privately.
I would highly recommend this place if you need a sweet home away from home.😊 I believe any necessary changes will be made to make this airbnb stand out even more!"

The house is near the local hospital & ideal if you have a loved one in the hospital. It is close to department stores. We will be back.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Chloe’s place was just as pictured. She allowed me a last minute early check-in which I greatly appreciated. It was Valentine’s Day and she left me a nice plant as a special gift. The house was even better in person. I will definitely will be staying here again. The location is perfect.

Any time I am in a strange place, I do worry a little so having the alarm to set at night was relieved a lot of stress. It’s an older home that has been tastefully remodeled and has everything you could need. If we are ever back in the area, we will surely stay here again!!!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"5 STARS ISN’T HIGH ENOUGH
Stayed for a week+ for our granddaughter’s HS graduation. The property is absolutely beautiful—welcoming, super clean and comfortable. Well stocked—multiple sets of linen/towels—more than enough soaps etc…every type of cleaning supply you can imagine. Check in was a breeze and Beth was always available if needed…we had multiple changes in plans and Beth was more than accommodating and helpful.
For a weekend/a week or longer if in the area this should be your ‘go to place’—you won’t be disappointed. Am what some consider a hard grader—this is truly a 5+.
Thanks so much for a great week….
Tom and Pat"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and nice cottage. Disappointed the outside furniture was dirty. Also, the bathtub could use some TLC. Otherwise, we enjoyed our stay."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was clean and beautiful, exactly as described."
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Accommodations were fine, the bed in the master bedroom was very comfortable, however the one in the other bedroom was not. It is prob ok for kids or teenagers but we are all 60+. The televisions were somewhat hard to figure out, might want to leave some instructions for using them. All in all, though, it was fine for a weekend stay."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice and clean!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beth was a great host! Easy to communicate with and location was easy to find! House was very homey- and had a lot to offer. The booking was last minute for us, so we we’re definitely pleased upon arrival to a cozy home for a few days that had everything we needed! Our internet also didn’t work, but Beth tried everything she could to help the situation. Overall it’s a great home, great location, and can be an excellent stay with some minor tweaks. I would stay here again."

The house is very charming. We had a minor issue with the dishwasher but it did not affect our stay at all. We would 10000000% stay here again!!!!!! Thanks Beth!

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful stay at Beth's cottage! Located in the heart of The Garden District, there are lots of beautiful oak trees and you're close to many of the local spots / coffee shops downtown! She was a wonderful host and communicated well :)"
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Beth’s place is a sweet little cottage that has been renovated with nice finishes and is decorated with lovely art and comfy furniture. The location is truly convenient to everything, including the Interstate. That said, it’s by no means in a “bad” neighborhood but it’s certainly not in a great one so the security system added some peace of mind. Beth was friendly and responsive whenever we had a question or problem (small issue with the Wi-Fi, quickly resolved), and her checkout procedures (i.e. stripping beds, emptying trash, etc.) are pretty minimal compared to other Airbnbs that I’ve stayed in. It does only have one bathroom so if you travel with teenage girls like I do, this can be a challenge. Overall, we had a nice stay."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Description has described! Neat little neighborhood and super clean house! Security system a plus!

2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beth’s little BNB was fantastic! The neighborhood is charming, well lit and safe. The house has a security system and keyless entry as well. We were attending an event at the Coliseum, and it only took about 10 mins with a little traffic.
The old wooden doors and floors are beautiful. She stocked us up with plenty of toilet paper, towels, tissues, hand soaps etc for our group of 5. The bathroom had soap, shampoo and conditioner in case you forgot them. She had hangers and extra blankets and pillows. I slept in the master bedroom. The bed is AMAZINGLY comfortable. Seriously, I slept like a rock. The kitchen has been updated and was great for cooking up breakfast and brunch. Plenty of cookware and dishes. The gas stove is awesome. If you plan on cooking, bring a cutting board. We found one, but it was very tiny.
The bathroom is roomy, but has the only mirror in the house. If your traveling with several girls like I did, bring another one 😹
Beth kept in touch during our stay and is super hospitable. I definitely recommend her place! We had such a great time!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was located in a great quiet neighborhood close to everything! It was super spacious and the beds were comfortable. The only thing the house was missing was a mixing bowl, but we improvised with a pot. Would definitely recommend!"

2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,This is a nice find in Alexandria. The home was very comfy and in a great location for us. Restaurants are not far. Quiet area. Overall a good choice. We would definitely stay again. Host was easy to get ahold of. Very welcoming!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was such a great find in Alexandria! The house is full of character and is well located to everywhere we needed to go! The house is well stocked for everything and was very comfortable for a family with small children. I would definitely stay again for any future visits to Alexandria!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a very enjoyable visit. The house was cute and well stocked. The beds were comfortable and the shower was hot. The location was convenient and I enjoyed looking at the surrounding architecture of the houses. Host was very responsive when we were trying to find the correct wifi to which to connect.
2022-01-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"The master bed was comfy. The kitchen was beautiful, although it lacked a few key things if you plan to actually cook. The house was very charming. BRING HOUSE SHOES if you’re staying during cold weather as the floors were freezing due to the elevated state. The heating, though uneven worked great if all doors were left open. The bathtub did look sketchy. Krud Kutter or magic erasers would probably clean it deeply the way it needed. My family sneezed the entirety of the stay possibly due to the filthy vents and ceiling fans. The trash drawer also had food from previous stays in the bottom. Although gross, I could see how this might be an oversight. I asked for a late checkout, and it was unavailable (understandable). However, we were still loading the luggage that had been moved to the porch when the cleaners arrived. We were completely off site by 11:15, but still asked to pay the $50 late fee. So, there is no mercy there. Pack up & get out on time to avoid that. Overall, we did enjoy the cottage."

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable and cozy. The house was clean and equipped with everything we needed. Highly recommend for your stay in Alexandria!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Cottage home offered me the kind of warm and cozy home I was looking for on my retreat. I found the space to be very relaxing and I loved the personal touches throughout the cottage. The kitchen was probably my favorite place in the cottage as it is so bright and inviting and well stocked with coffee, creamer, sugar, and spices, although some water bottles or small cereal bars or snacks would have been appreciated for extended stays. I wasn’t a huge fan of the jazz decor, but I was glad the space was decorated and not just plain or empty feeling. The bed, pillows and linens were very comfortable. The shower was hot, there’s a tub, but it’s shower only, so I couldn’t soak and relax in the tub as I hoped to. I couldn’t figure how to cut the living room tv on regular or how to cut on the ceiling fans as there are multiple remotes and buttons to figure out. The wifi works pretty good, it just doesn’t work in the backyard, but it’s better on the front porch. I enjoyed my cup of coffee on the front porch each morning. I had an extended stay and had more peace of mind with the alarm. I did great setting it and arming and disarming it, all but once, and it went off loudly, until I could figure how to reset it. The neighbor was friendly, but some neighbors played loud music and worked on cars, houses and yard work which was noisy. The neighborhood is okay, but assuming Garden District, I presumed it would be somewhat better. The street had a mix of people, some friendly, some loud and off putting and a couple streets over is dilapidated houses and not the best areas as I seen when venturing out to the store. The house was overall clean, but the fridge, floors, microwave and tub could’ve been cleaner. It was comfortable and clean, just not quite sparkly. At checkout there is a list to follow, so linens stripped, dishes washed, garbage taken out, thermostat and alarm to set. I checked out a day early and headed home on the last evening after a four day stay. I miss already the coziness and peacefulness of the cottage, it felt like my home away from home. I would stay here again on my next stays in the area, because the cottage is warm and cozy and the hostess is really sweet and friendly."

I enjoyed the neighborhood as it oferred an appreciation of the great diversity of life styles and a reflection of the world around us.  The homes that did stand out in their historic glamour were so beautiful and fun to see.
The cottage did have so many extras that afforded you with day-to-day conveniences that were very much appreciated.  Having a back yard was very nice and a lovely porch to relax on in the evenings was a plus.  
I would recommend Beth's cottage to you for all these reasons and then some."

There is plenty of parking but keep in mind you share a driveway so must stay to one side but there is plenty of space for that. Back to the cottage...The kitchen is beautiful and well stocked. They have noise machines you can use in each bedroom. The bathroom is spacious and was easy for us to share. Check in and check out was easy and not complicated.

See you soon! Greetings!, Manuel Navarro"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,If you are looking for a place to stay in Alexandria look no further! House on Hill was amazing and exactly as pictured. Loved all of the details throughout the home. If we ever make it back to Alexandria we’ll know right where to come to.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We GREATLY enjoyed our stay at House on Hill. I loved the older house and found the small vintage touches (books, notes, photos) really neat. I thought the pic of the house in the 20s/30s in the kitchen was very cool. My 18 month old loved playing in the spacious, fenced in back yard and I felt at ease letting her play. Justine had even thought about the needs of her guests and placed eye masks and ear plugs in the drawers to accommodate guests. I definitely used the eye mask, but did not need the ear plugs; little details like this make me appreciate the host and their home that much more. We encountered a small issue while there and let Justine and Kenneth know about it (before bed) and it was taken care of immediately the next morning with no disturbance or hindrance to us during our time there. Will DEFINITELY stay again on our next visit. Lovely home, peaceful environment, felt safe, and my little had a blast (thanks for having games)."

The place is nicely kept, clean, modern and has nice high end finished touches.
We had a wonderful stay and would definitely stay with Justine during our next trip.

The kitchen had plenty of plates, cups, and utensils to accommodate my group. The bedrooms are spacious. The neighborhood is very quiet, although conveniently located to dozens of options for shopping and eating. Check in/out was easy; Justine and Kenneth were responsive and detailed with helpful instructions. Such a great value for this space!"

2021-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is a duplex, behind an apartment complex. The area is quiet. It is nicely decorated with a beachy feel. There are several restaurants near by. The neighbor smokes and the funny smelling smoke fills the rental often. Connie apologized and is aware of the neighbor's habit and offered additional air freshener. The wall is thin between the duplex, as we could hear the neighbor's TV, microwave, and he and his guests talking.
When we arrived the bathroom was not clean, tub had hairs in it, wash clothes had long hairs in them, the hand towels were stained, there was food particles in the kitchen sink and the dishes had not been put away. The issue was resolved while we were out for the evening. We did request for all towels/wash clothes to be swapped out and for additional towels as there were only 3 for our 4 night stay and were advised there are ONLY 4 towels for the unit, but that they had been freshly laundered while we were out. We went to Walmart and bought our own. Bring extra toilet tissue so you don't run out at 11pm like we did, ;0) as there is only the 1 roll provided. The king bedroom has a door to the outside with built in blinds, no curtain, for those like myself who are light sensitive. Despite the welcome book stating there were additional linens in the master closet there were none. The large box of half&half was 6 months past it's best by date and upon notification she replaced it that afternoon with creamer.
Connie responded to my messages in an hour and did provide a refund of the cleaning fee and the first night's rent since the apartment was not ready when we checked in. She did allow us to check in at 2. She suggested the bathroom had been overlooked and that the turn around was a little tight because of our early check in, but that that wasn't an excuse for it."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great space with convenient access for hitting the ground running while on the road
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"My girlfriend and I did an extended stay at Connie’s place for a work trip. Connie’s duplex was extremely clean, bigger than expected, and she was extremely responsive. We asked for a deadbolt key to for more security one weekend we were out of town and she provided us the key the same day. The location does look a bit sketchy, but it was in fact extremely quiet and pleasant during our stay. 5 stars on communication."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Very clean, well maintained. Great host. Barrett responds quickly."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean and comfortable. An old house with many great features. We didn't have cell service (T-Mobile), so didn't have instructions to get in. Had to use a neighbor's phone to contact Barrett. He was very accommodating, and we were able to get into the house easily after the call. Had cell service ""downtown"", just fine. Driving in from the south is a little disconcerting with the condition of the neighborhood, but driving out the other direction is a beautiful neighborhood."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything was great.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"A solid place to crash. Clean, quiet, convenient charging nightstands. Comfy. The bed is low to ground, but comfy. Parking is good if your car is not too low, otherwise park on street. We've stayed at both properties and had no problems. It's our go to place to stay."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Enjoyed our stay, however it would have been nice to know that the unit was shared within one home. If someone was walking on the other side of the house or talking we could hear it. That is my only compliant is that i wish i had known that when booking. Besides that the stay was great, perfect place to just rest our heads for the night. Everything was clean, Barret was very responsive. I think this place is a great stay for one night or two, if youre just passing through. There was also a mother cat outside our window, we didnt mind her and when we reported it to Barret, he said he would check on her and that meant a lot to us. We still think about the momma cat."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place for tired traveler to settle over night.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was incredible experience and super cozy
2024-03-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was as advertised and I should've paid closer attention. The bed is extremely low to the ground and didn't have a box spring. For what I paid it was as advertised. I ended up booking a hotel on 4th Street.

Everything was as described. Thank you!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful, quiet, little, cozy place with all the reminiscences of home. The location was wonderful & in good proximity to most places. I had a few questions prior to our arrival, messaged Barrett, & he responded quickly & helpfully. Check-in was a smooth process, and we had no issues during our short stay with anything except getting in and out the driveway (which Barrett did forewarn us about). Check out was as smooth as check-in, so no complaints about that either. If we are ever back in the area, we would totally try to stay again; however, we would bring a higher riding vehicle for getting in and out the drive."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great host, easy in and out experience."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot say enough good things about this stay. The location is on a quiet street, the apartment was spotless, and very comfortably furnished. One thing we are always concerned about when we travel is the bed, and my husband and I both loved how soft and comfortable the bed was. We also loved the nostalgic touches of a video game machine and the large gum ball machine along with a very varied selection of reading materials.
We experienced a small issue with the shower hot water due to very low temperatures in the area (very abnormal for this area), and while it was absolutely no fault of Barrett’s, when we reached out to him about the issue, he responded immediately and moved us to a different unit. We also had the pleasure of talking with Barrett during our stay, and not only were we impressed with what a great host he is, we were also impressed with his character. We are already planning to stay here again our next trip!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice place, especially for a couple looking for a private getaway. Barrett was very nice and responsive as well!"

Barrett is a wonderful host."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay! My only warning is that the drive way was very steep and so we weren't able to park in front of the place. The AC is also pretty loud next to the bed for those that are light sleepers. Other than, Barrett communicated with me when needed and the place was spacious enough for two people and clean. Would stay again if we needed to in Alexandria again."

Available washer and dryer, clean rooms and bathroom, with a soft bed after traveling long hours. Definitely recommend."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here for three nights and it was just what we needed for the middle of our trip. The amenities are great, we were able to do our laundry (detergent provided by host). And do our dishes in a dishwasher. Spotless bathroom and cute fully equipped kitchen. The place is just nice, and the parking space is private and safe. The arcade gave the place a nice vibe and with two AC the temperature was just right!
Thank you Barrett for your hospitality!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect and Cozy!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a very nice little place! It was nicely between the downtown area and the wedding venue Bayou Haven, which is probably why a lot of people would be visiting Alexandria in the first place. Barrett was a great host too."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Awesome I loved it even tho I didn't get to spend as much time as I wanted here I definitely plan to book again when my schedule is not so busy
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great, private, little quaint place with a lot of amenities at an amazing price."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Barrett was very friendly and responsive. The check in and out was easy and convenient. The actual apartment was extremely clean with lots of windows to look out onto a Garden District backyard with lots of trees and nature. However, the apartment is on a neighborhood street behind a house so you get the city and country feel at the same time. It is very centrally located to Jackson Street and many popular restaurants etc., I love that he allows pets and was very understanding when my accident prone kitten got herself stuck somewhere she wasn’t supposed to be. All was well!
Oh.. and a comfortable bed, sofa, huge Tv and a washing machine and dryer should you need it…. Everything you need at an affordable and reasonable price!"
2023-02-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little apartment was clean, cute, and very quiet. We loved the well lit functional kitchen with laundry facilities, and parking right outside the door. It took us a few days to figure out how to work the heaters properly so we were quite cold for the first two nights. We were not able to get the heater in the kitchen working properly. Our host seemed conscientious - was responsive and friendly."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I want to start off with saying that the Host is a very helpful person! Amazing place for a out of town trip for two people if you need a place to stay. Everything including stores and restaurants were less than 10 minutes away, on top of that the neighborhood was very quiet. I definitely will be coming back, thanks for Hosting me!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is truly a gem. Cute little place in Alexandria. It’s homey and has enough space to not feel cluttered. Bed is super comfortable, and you have everything you need. The host is truly a great guy! He is super friendly and helpful. He answers questions and gets back to you quickly. He created a cool space. Location is perfect because it’s in a small cute neighborhood. Quiet and safe to walk around. It’s pretty centralized so you can get anywhere in like 10 min."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The apartment was just as described. It's small, but it had everything we needed for our stay. Barrett provided detailed instructions on how to work everything. We didn't have any issues. We would definitely stay again."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Barrett’s place was comfortable and quiet! I enjoyed my stay.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Barrett's place was perfect for me. The area felt safe. It is small but can easily accommodate a couple or a person traveling alone. He gave step by step instructions on how parts of the home operate. The home was clean and well-appointed with dryer, toiletries and even detergent for the washer. I had some cold weather and the heating in the house is supplied by the all in one air conditioning units. There were portable heaters which were great for getting immediate heat and then of course shut off for the night. The bed was comfortable. This is a big deal to me as I have trouble sleeping. I loved the parking area as you can park right in front of the door to unload. One thing to note is that there are three stairs to get into the house with no railing. This only matters if you have mobility issues . It is in no way unsafe but just a notation. The shower was nice and hot with great pressure. It's an older home so the bathroom sinks water needs a little time to heat up. Loved my stay."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Clean place, very easy to deal with Barrett, he responded fast to all questions and was very informative."
2023-01-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"My stay the location was good. It started off a little rocky with a miscommunication about check in but after check in, the stay was peaceful. It has the basic amenities ( stove, washing machine, dryer) and we'll maintained.

Quiet neighbourhood and Barrett’s place was private from the main road. Parking was great, round the side of the property.
Another massive positive was how hospitable Barrett was; we were able to ask for dinner recommendations and local activities/points of interest, even able to lend us a screwdriver! Great person with a great little property."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Everything was very clean. Chips and water were available upon check-in. New modern appliances, older building. Great value.
The host was great with communication and instructions.
I do want to point out that the bed is on a very low platform. I'm 5'4"" and the top of the mattress was under my knee if I stood next to it. It was leg day at the gym earlier that day and it was a little difficult for me to get up and down. If you have bad knees, weak legs, etc., this could potentially be an issue.
Older neighborhood but seemed safe and it was very quiet. Conveniently located to the highway and Louisiana College.
Thanks so much!"

Wait d for response when he woke up allowed us to check in at 8 AM he allowed he also allowed me to stay a little bit late because we did wake up a little off time which was wonderful Barrett had everything you need to cook. We did a seafood boil. We cooked breakfast daily air air conditioners were wonderful three and a entire home kitchen living room bedroom per Louisiana Alexandria you would need that very responsive when I sent him a text message asking for a combination for the lock that had the extra tissue and paper towels, which was very appreciated, very quiet we slept there majority of the time but we’re gone during the day in either daylight or evening. It was very peaceful and next time I stay, I may try to do a little small barbecue with my small family in the backyard because it’s very spacious parking was amazing. Lights were very lit outside for us towels wonderful set of towels had extra already set up clean washer and dryer refrigerator. got everything code froze to the right temperature. overall Barrett was an amazing host and for me not being from Louisiana but I used to live here a year ago being able to come back and be comfortable in a home was wonderful. There is no bugs, not even walking in and having the flying a little flies around porch light. It was wonderful amazing experience especially knowing when Alexandria u could come to town and have to stay with family or a hotel this is a gem don’t pass it up."

We enjoyed the multicade & the space is more roomy than it seems in the photos! Barrett has really thought of everything in advance, there were a few waters & chips waiting for us. Plus some soaps and lotions! In the closet there are fans & heaters! And I like that the door has a pin code. It really is a nice fun little space! We mentioned the water pressure seemed low to us at the end of our stay, and he was quick to check it and let us know he noticed it as well and was going to fix it! He messaged us to see if he could mow the back yard! He was very thoughtful and we appreciated that!! Before we booked he was quick about answering questions about the WiFi because my husband works from home and we just needed to know it was with a decent trustworthy service provider & it had a solid connect (which it did). Overall, when we’re back in Louisiana we will stay with Barrett! And we recommend this space to anyone looking! It’s worth it!"

The host was so great and proactive - promptly replied to every message and addressed our questions. She went above and beyond to make sure we felt welcome.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place!
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"It was such a cute home, and it felt very cozy and welcoming. I appreciated the snacks that were in the basket and the ease of finding what we needed inside. As for my companions traveling with me, they had an issue with the shortage of outlets in the rooms and one of the outlets was “touchy” and didn’t always want to charge her device. The other complaint was how easy it was to hear everything in the house. I grew up in an old home and so none of this bothered me, but that was their chief complaint. I enjoyed my stay overall, the short time each day I had in it. I would definitely recommend this place to rent for events in the area. Thank you for such a stress-free experience and making the work we had to do possible."

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"During my assignment as a travel nurse, I had the opportunity to stay at Linda's place. I always felt safe and secure when I was there. She and her husband Paul are wonderful hosts. Linda is a great cook, and Paul is a talented musician. They considered me a family member. Besides delicious dinners I got every night, I received plenty more from them, whether it be some extra blankets, useful advice, or an extra hand when needed.
When my car was totaled because of the flood, Linda drove me to places, such as grocery store and the airport. She also showed me how to crack pecans and gave me some to take home as a gift. Paul let me use his computer to work on some modules for my assignment. They also found ways to entertain their guests, such as playing spinner, coming to Paul's performance, and playing frisbee at the park. I am thankful to have found their place and I recommend everyone to try it if you have a chance to visit Alexandria."

2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Staying at Linda's was much more than simply having a place to stay while traveling. My stay was a very pleasant cultural and culinary experience. I met people from different parts of the country and the world and together we enjoyed fellowship and traditional Cajun cuisine. Linda truly has the gift of hospitality and provides a warm and comfortable home to stay in while traveling on business or leisure.
2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Southern hospitality at its finest! Linda went above and beyond any expectations I had. She is a warm, kind and generous woman and I can honestly say I felt at home the moment I met her. A lovely home, excellent home cooking, a game of Spinner and a house mascot, Felix, the cat, all add to the charm of staying at Linda`s. I would wholeheartedly recommend anyone to stay for a while."

She even left the porch light on for me. Ms. Linda is a great host and you certainly can't beat the value. Fresh home cooked meals, a comfy bed, HOT shower, and great friendly conversation. No wonder she ended up being showcased in the paper. Thanks Ms. Linda!"
2017-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Linda made me feel comfortable as soon as we met. The room is very clean,the bed very comfortable and the house has everything you need(fast internet etc.).
Linda's cooking introduced me to Cajun cuisine, something I had never tasted, and was very delicious. We had many interesting conversations at dinner time. But when I needed my private space to work. Linda was never intrusive. Highly recommended."

2017-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ms. Linda's home is everything she writes and more. I've been roadtripping for 10 days and she made me feel so welcome and cared for-from greeting me at the door and helping me with my luggage to her wonderful LA home cooking (jambalaya and green beans and sweet potatos). Her come is cery comfortable and she makes everything easy from accessing the wifi to finding towels to snacks. I slept so well here. On top of all this she was a wonderful communicator and I lucked into her weekly game night with some other local ladies. If you're in the area and looking for a great experience with a local, this is the place to stay."
2017-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A wonderful stay. I wish I could somehow take this one with me on my travels, so I could stay here every night!"
2016-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Ms. Linda was warm and welcoming from the minute I entered her home. The house is extremely clean and was exactly as advertised. Ms. Linda is a great cook and is very interested and willing to accommodate guests' palates. The room I stayed in was very clean and comfortable and at no time did I feel like an imposition. Ms. Linda genuinely enjoys her guests and that is evident in the way she ensures that her home is your home during your stay. Highly recommend.
2016-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mrs. Linda is a wonderful host. I was met with a friendly smile and a cute little welcome basket. When I came home everyday, it was so nice to come back to a delicious homemade meal and great conversation over dinner... vs fast food and lonely hotel room. Everything was very clean and comfortable. Definitely will return again."
2016-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Linda was very kind and welcoming. The house smelled wonderful when I arrived, as she had dinner cooking. She even made it vegan for me! The accommodations were as described and I had a restful stay."
2016-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I went to Linda's splace as I didn't want to say alone in a hotel this week, and I found a marvellous place. It's big, very clean, and you also get to enjoy her delicious dishes, and nice conversations. You are also welcome to pet the cat when it's around, and meet other very interesting guests if there are. I can only recommand this place, as a place of heaven in this nice neighboorhood!"
2016-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Linda is a fabulous hostess, there is a very high level of respect and it shows. Her house is warm and welcoming and always smells great. My linen is always clean and the house always so fresh and inviting weather visiting for a few days or multiple days, this is a much better option to a Hotel room. This is my favorite spot to stay! This was my first experiencedddfffdd"
2016-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Linda clearly has her act together when it comes to hosting guests...right down to the smallest details. An awesome healthy meal, intellectual conversation, comfy bed, very clean and neat house, Linda made me feel like a very special guest! What more could one ask for!"
2016-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Once again my travels had me staying at Ms. Linda's. And one again I felt like family in her clean and inviting home. I noticed new carpet and paint in the room. Also being close to town the neighborhood is very quiet which yields a nice peaceful nights sleep. I've tried other homes in the area and none come close to hers.
2016-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"What a wonderful person Ms. Linda is! This was my second stay at her lovely home, and she welcomed me back as though I were family. Ms. Linda keeps an immaculate home, and is a superb chef. Before writing this review, I re-read her listing, and can verify it to be accurate. If anything, she understates the warmth and comfort her listing offers. Ms. Linda regularly went out of her way to accommodate my hectic work schedule, which had to have been an imposition on her. But I would never know it. She handled me and my drama with the utmost grace and compassion. I have developed a true affection for Ms. Linda, and highly recommend her to anyone looking for a safe haven in Alexandria."
2016-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Staying at Linda’s guest house was like staying with family. She went above and beyond with being an amazing and attentive host, while still completely respecting personal space and privacy. I hope to have an opportunity to stay with her in the future. Linda has a true gift for hospitality and knows how to spoil her guests. She started with excellent communication prior to booking, and with her providing detailed directions to her home.



Her greeting was the warmest of welcomes. The home was lovely, and the room was perfect. She is fully equipped with everything you could possibly need. The bed was comfortable; the shower was like a spa; the space was inviting and cozy; and she allowed the use of her washer and dryer. She allowed the freedom to be private, but also offered her company, as well as that of her most delightful group of friends. Linda is one of the sweetest people anyone could hope to meet. She was friendly, generous, and really interesting to talk with. Moreover, she is a phenomenal chef – what delicious food she prepares and offers!!! Truly a refreshing stay that is most highly recommend.



Merci pour tout!"

2015-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"My recent stay with Ms. Linda was great. She took me in like I was family. Her cooking was great and she keeps a very clean house. My sons came over and ate dinner a few nights also and she also allowed them to help her put up and decorate her Christmas tree. I would recommend Ms. Linda to anyone who would like to experience true southern hospitality. Thanks for everything you did for my two boys and myself, Brock"
2015-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mrs. Linda was so kind and accommodating! I was driving through Alexandria on my way from Mississippi to Houston. I hadn't slept well the night before my trip and was in desperate need of a place to stop for a few hours to rest. I contacted Mrs. Linda, and asked if I might be able to stop in for about two to three hours in order to nap, and she immediately responded ""yes!""
This was my first Airbnb experience, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but everything was fantastic: clean home, southern hospitality, and plenty of snacks and food!
Mrs. Linda had a sweet little welcome basket filled with plenty of goodies and the nicest card in it, stating ""you're family now."" She even called me later in the evening to make sure I was home safe with hurricane Patricia making her mark on Texas. This is above and beyond. She genuinely cares about people, and it shows in all of her thoughtfulness. Can't recommend her enough.
The bed was comfy, the room was quiet and well cooled, and the black out curtains worked great as I arrived at 11 a.m. for my nap.
Thank you for your hospitality, Mrs. Linda!"

The home was in great condition, meticulously clean, and in a very good location. I had a TV in my room and WiFi throughout the home. I am a business traveler and had much work to do and this home was very convenient. Also, bathtub has been replaced with a huge shower with great water pressure--probably the best shower I have had in a year."
2015-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Now I know firsthand why Linda has such glowing reviews!!! What a wonderful hostess, and she immediately made me feel welcome and a part of her home. From the generous offer of a ride from the airport after my rental car reservation snafu to the delicious welcome basket of sweets and pecans waiting for me in my room, it is obvious that Linda puts the comfort of her guests to the top of the list. I would definitely recommend staying here if your central Louisiana travels put you near Alexandria for the night."
2015-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Although my flight was cancelled, all of my interactions with Linda were pleasant. She was very accommodating, warm, and flexible with all that I had going on.

2015-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Linda was the perfect host and if your looking for down home warmth and care, you'll find it here. She loves to cook for you and has a very caring nature.

Heartwarming! the WiFi was great and the neighborhood had kids riding bikes and playing outside which I haven't really seen anywhere for awhile."
2015-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Felt welcome .
,,,"Spent to much for the stay that was uncomfortable.
The beds were uncomfortable as well as the pull out couch.
I only ended up staying one night and leaving the next day because no one wanted to stay do to the beds and the bugs
So I lost out on one whole day of my stay
And was not compensated for only staying one night.
Will never stay there again."
