2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"While I selected ‚Äúaccurately described‚Äù, Amy‚Äôs place completely exceeded our expectations based on the listing. This is a small 1 bedroom place, but the organization, amenities and lack of clutter make it feel spacious. The kitchen is larger, better stocked and more functional than many places twice the size, and the open floor plan with large island is perfect for meal prep and eating. The entire place was absolutely spotless, and was also amazingly quiet in spite of being close to the airport. We will definitely stay here again!"

The home is charming and well appointed and I wanted for nothing. The Nespresso machine in the kitchen was a nice surprise. The washer/dryer worked well and helped me pack a lot less than needed. The home is conveniently located near the airport, MSU-Billings and Downtown and is a short drive to the West End of town. I slept peacefully each night- the neighborhood and surroundings are inviting and the fresh mountain air was invigorating! Close to the Rims, Swords park and the new running/hiking trail. I hope I find myself a guest in the home again for my next work visit to Billings!"

I was worried we‚Äôd hear planes all night but I didn‚Äôt hear any! Not sure if that‚Äôs because I was so tired or if the house is tucked next to a rock wall that blocks the noise.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Mini Mountain View is a great AirBnb. The house has everything you need and was on a quiet road. You can easily get around the city from this spot as it is close to everything. The kitchen was fully stocked, and that made it easy to cook in (which is what I did for the entirety of my stay). There is also a great viewing spot of the city just a short drive away up on Rimrock Road. I would highly recommend this AirBnb if you are in Billings!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This Mini Mountain View Getaway is amazing. In the shadow of Billings Rim Rocks (sandstone cliffs that boarder the northern edge of the city), this ADU is new, modern and lovingly built by the owners. I used it as ""home base"" while rediscovered my hometown after a 54 years' absence.
It's a walk to MSU and just a few minutes to downtown. I saw a deer, a duck (and other fowl), and numerous rabbits who make the outskirts of Billings their home. It has a small but nice view of the Rim Rocks south of town, and I was able to watch distant thunder storms from the front porch. All-in-all, a gem of a place to stay while in Billings."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our favorite place to stay in Billings - so clean, peaceful & cozy.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"STAY HERE! Super cute. Walkable (no side walk for part of it, but totally doable), nearby lots of stuff, and overall a great location at the end of a neighborhood road.
The inside is amazing. The kitchen is perfect- dishwasher, full size fridge, dishes, cookware, and basics like pepper.
The bathroom is great too. Full-size products, a great blow dryer, and a full size washer and dryer.
The couch is comfy and the bed is great.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a cute little place, I lived listening to the crickets and the birds win the evening and first thing in the morning. right by the house there was a walking path with a view, it seemed pretty popular with the neighborhood. Amy has such a good style in this home. It was also nice to be able to pull my car off the road and park it somewhere safe. This home is down the street from Montana State University Billings. It was quite, tucked back, yet it was close enough to walk to the Main Street to get a bite to eat or a coffee, or walk thru some of the campus.
I highly recommend staying here!"

The location was fantastic. Really close to downtown, the medical center, the college and the airport. I was able to easily walk from the place to my doctors appointment right down the street.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little place was super cute inside and out. Easy to find, the driveway/parking is a bit tricky, but not bad at all. The decor and extra touches were beautiful. I love the colors, finishes and charm. It was pretty clean. No smells, enough supplies to grab food to cook and make coffee. We enjoyed the two large TV's for movies. It was 62 degrees on arrival and did take a while to warm up. By the second day it was pretty comfortable, we also had a snow storm so the weather was nasty cold. If you go in the winter, bring some warm slippers and an extra blanket if you prefer warmer temps....it is MT! Cute little book of memories for guests, would definitely stay again! Oh, it is really close to campus, airport (which multiple planes did wake us up at 5am Friday), Billings clinic, grocery store, and some great restaurants. Only a 15 min drive to more shopping. :)"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay at one of Jenna's properties. The first was great, this one even better! The aparment was exactly as pictured, well stocked, and immaculately clean. Nice, quiet location with easy access to all of Billings. LOVED the coffee shop downstairs!! The only small issue we ran into was difficulty locking the balcony and exterior building doors. Initially was told by co-host Crystal, that this was a known problem and couldn't be fixed, which was discomforting, but a quick follow-up response from co-host Josh with the ""trick"" to get them locked saved the day and made us feel much more secure. This was addressed within 24 hours, and there was never an issue securing the door leading directly into the apartment, so I wouldn't consider it a major secuity problem. I would suggest informing future guests in advance of the issue and ""trick"" though. Overall, both my travel partner and I felt very comfortable here, and I would absolutely recommend and stay again!"

The house is beautifully decorated, and we enjoyed all of the little touches like how the towels were laid out for all of us! It felt so welcoming.
We had a great night's sleep as it was so peaceful and quiet!
Since the area is so new, Google directions brought us to a closed road. As the neighborhood is being constructed, I would recommend driving to the house via Elysian Rd.
I really like that there was a washer and dryer! If you would like to do laundry, bring your own laundry detergent."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amy and the other co-host (I can't remember his name) were phenomenal!!! I've never had such clear expectations and proactive communication with any previous airbnb stays. I LOVED that the check-out process was easy! No excessive ""pre-checkout"" requirements other than doing the dishes (which is 100% reasonable, in my opinion). The house was adorable!! We LOVED the fire pit out back! The price was totally spot on! I 100% recommend this place and will definitely stay again when coming through Billings!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,We loved our stay and would go back!
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great space and even has a washer and dryer. I hope the cleaning gets a little better. There were hairs in the bathroom drawers and hanging out of the bathroom cabinet. There was a slight odor as if a 420 smoker may have stayed before me. Water was cut off the first night due to construction. The city sent the host a written notice almost 2 weeks prior (at least that‚Äôs what the city said when I called in) but the host didn‚Äôt pass that to me. After a long work day, getting in late and not being about to shower was a bummer. Overall a friendly host who adapted to my changes in dates and was so friendly. I would consider staying again, but some more thorough cleaning would be nice to see."

2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The negative of our stay was the dogs of the tenant upstairs barking. We contacted Jenna on Friday and she responded immediately. She talked to the tenant regarding keeping the dogs from barking and offered to refund the remaining days of our stay if we wanted to find another place. It was Memorial Day weekend and finding another place would have been hard. Jenna stated that the tenant planned to be gone for the weekend so we decided to stay. Our niece was graduating so we would be spending alot of time with her. However, the times we were at the apartment the dogs did bark. We don't think the tenant was gone for any length of time at all. In fact on Monday afternoon we think the tenant was gone and the dogs were left inside barking. Also, there was alot of road noise on Grand."

There was also a great sitting area in the backyard with a fire table, but we didn‚Äôt use it as it was cool outside being the 2nd of May. The kitchen was well equipped and stocked with all kinds of extras such as spices, oils and Saran Wrap etc. . A Keurig was supplied along with lots of coffee pods. A nice touch was the Welcome binder with local information for things to see and do and contact information. The snack basket including popcorn and cereal bars and treats was also a plus. Location was great as well, being just off a main drag, it was very quiet and still close enough to walk to stores for shopping or lounges. The touch keypad to entrance was also nice, no key needed. Hosts were very responsive and enquired if everything was to our liking and if we needed anything else, which we didn‚Äôt."

It‚Äôs close to a busy street but I was surprised by how quiet and peaceful it was. Jenna (or Connie) responded quickly to any questions I had. One of the better places I‚Äôve stayed. I plan to stay next time I‚Äôm in town. You won‚Äôt regret staying there!

2024-02-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good value, clean, and comfortable. But selecting this unit has reminded me why I appreciate whole homes‚Ä¶lack of noise. The adjoining unit, which appears to be rented on a long term basis, was noisy. Barking dogs, loud conversations and television. Normally, this wouldn‚Äôt be much of an issue, except the two units have an a connecting door that you can hear everything through. If you prefer a peaceful stay, I would look elsewhere."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"What a cozy, comfortable, clean place to stay for my visit with my Mom and Sister. I couldn't believe how close I was to my Mom's assisted living facility, right across the street and my sister just down the road not far at all. A grocery store and gas station less than a block away and other shopping not that far away. It took me a little bit to figure-out the keypad on the door since it was dark when I arrived but so easy to get in and to lock the door after. Jenna was very nice and responded quickly when I text her. I got an added bonus: a gentleman had the driveway cleared of snow and even brushed the snow off my car before I left for the day. Thank-you for the kindness! I am hoping I will be lucky enough to be able to stay with Jenna at what is, ""The Best 1 Bedroom in Billings!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This adorable one bedroom 1 bath stay was just perfect! Great vibe, so peaceful and serene‚Ä¶ great price, great hostess, very clean! I‚Äôll definitely will stay again! Thanks Jenna it was just perfect!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was my third time staying at this place and it‚Äôs perfect for me. It‚Äôs always clean, has all of the amenities and it‚Äôs super convenient to everything and close to where my mom lives. I also like the warming touches they add for my visits which is usually around the holidays. There was a sweet lighted Christmas tree, and little holiday decor touches throughout. I also like that there is a full kitchen with large fridge. Someone lives upstairs with dogs so you will hear them sometimes but it‚Äôs not that often. The host is always very communicative and the privacy and ease of getting to and from is great. I will definitely plan to stay here again!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Instead of five stars, there should be 10! Jenna is much better than a super host! From the time that we walked into the house, and saw the lit Christmas tree and decorations, you could see how well prepared it was. Little things like more Kerigs than we could use, fluffy, comfortable, bathroom towels, a cabinet full of spices, whatever we needed to cook, or eat, a bathroom stocked with anything that you could need. Every time you opened another cabinet or door you found something else That Jenna had thought you might need. This was a wonderful place to stay at, and we would recommend it to anybody."

It was a perfect location and when we checked in on a cold night, it was nice and warm and welcoming. It had everything we needed to enjoy our time together. The beds were so comfy and my sister was threatening to steal one of the pillows lol. Everything was what we needed. We enjoyed a full size fridge, with water bottles. There were 3 TVs and we enjoyed a Netflix movie one night. Because of the weather we needed to move our reservation up a day and because of the weather we needed to add a day. It was all done very quickly and respectfully. We all agreed we would stay there again as it was so close to everything and we felt safe."

2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"For the price it was fine. The kitchenette is mostly a laundry room with a full refrigerator, microwave, small coffee pot, and toaster. The bathroom toilet is very tiny and should probably be replaced with a normal height toilet. My husband it 6‚Äù2 and felt like he was sitting on a small stool. There is mold growing in the shower caulking that is unpleasant to look at, and there is low water pressure when taking a shower. It is noisy from the upstairs in the mornings.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very great stay, esp if you are a traveler passing-through like us. Simple & well-stocked. Very quiet neighborhood, so you'll get decent sleep. Bedrooms are much more spacious than they appear, which is great if you need to sort yourself & things out after or before pursuing the outdoor activites like Yelllowstone, Badlands, etc. surrounding Billings. As road trippers the well-running washer/dryer was our fave amenity; w/ the large TV & fast Wifi a runner-up. Kitchen isn't necessarily set up for standard home cooking - no stove or oven. But there are a lot of appliances to be able to heat or ready-made foods. A solid, graciously affordable stay - would recommend."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"If you are looking for a beautiful place to stay both inside and out look no further! From the moment we stepped out of our car all of the holiday stress melted away and the relaxation set in. The home was cozy and tastefully decorated. It was spotless and well stocked. The linens and towels were high quality and the beds were comfortable. We were lucky enough to be there during a lightly falling snow that perfectly flocked all of the trees. It was magical! We were glad we had a vehicle with 4-wheel drive. The area was secluded and safe but only a few minute drive to interstate. One of our top 5 Airbnb‚Äôs! We will definitely be back! Kelvin was very accommodating, due to weather we had to come a day early and stay a day later than expected."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Second Stay with Kelvin and was not disappointed honestly the toughest decision with the entire booking process was deciding which of his rentals we liked the best. The decision was both!! They are both so unique you can‚Äôt go wrong which ever one you choose. But I highly recommend multiple trips staying in each one!!!
We are already looking forward to our third stay with them early next year!!!!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a beautiful place! Loved how private it was and how close it is to town. Kelvin was great at responding to my messages! Definitely will be back! 10/10!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is absolutely breathtaking. I can definitely say that it is worth the money. The place was very clean and the outside area was very woodsy and fresh. The pictures do you not even come close to how beautiful it is out there. The directions were spot on and very easy to find even though they are small back roads. The hosts were very responsive the moment we arrived and the house looked lit up and beautiful. Every light fixture and any lights that are accented, is labeled perfectly. I wish all houses would do that. It was a wonderful stay and we look forward to going back."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is beautiful, absolutely spotless, and tastefully decorated. Beds and bedding were very comfortable. We had everything we needed. We will plan on coming back. Just a short drive from downtown Billings. 100% recommend."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a great place! So clean and cute! Would love to come back!!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a gorgeous home right at the top of a cliff in the forest. We LOVED it here. The decoration of the house was terrific. It was quiet and while you were only a couple of minutes from humanity, you didn't feel that way at all. It was quite scenic and we loved seeing the wild life that came by. We would HIGHLY recommend this location. We will stay here again if back in Billings."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Gorgeous place
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was convenient from the highway. Directions to the place were spot on. The secluded and private feel was nice. Everything here is brand new with beautiful decor and had everything we needed to feel like home...better than home, actually. The deck provided a great respite and morning views of the sunrise. Very relaxing and very soul nourishing for us. It would be great to stay longer next time."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved the peaceful setting being into the trees but being just miles from stores and restaurants. Loved the house itself, outside patio and indoor fireplace was our favorite to make it feel like a very luxurious home."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The only downside I have of staying here, is that I could only stay for one night. Absolutely beautiful home and property, peaceful and perfectly placed just right out of town. I will 100% book another stay at Pine Place Resorts and so should you."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The morning sunrises off the deck were gorgeous! The home was comfortable and lovely. The beds were like clouds. Such a lovely place, I highly recommend."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good place to stay, great location with nature around!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a beautiful place! We were only there overnight, passing through‚Äî but it was clean, beautiful, and super charming. We felt right at home after having drove over 500 miles.
Only thing I would point out is if you plan to get a cab somewhere this address is not on any gps so it was a little complicated getting a Lyft but we still worked it out! Amazing stay overall!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Simply put, this is a five start experience. Everything within the listing is accurate, and really, some of the pictures (which are excellent) don't do the place justice. Everything is new and clean. The hosts are friendly and responsive. I recommend this place to anyone, and I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. Great experience."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place a a ""one of a kind."" There aren't sufficient words for the serenity and beauty of this place. There were amazing amenities. The host is very helpful with questions and the guidance and directions were very helpful. We would love to stay again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay with great host. Would
recommend to anyone"
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed over a week,"If you‚Äôre only stopping by for a few nights and need a place to crash then I‚Äôd recommend it. There‚Äôs just too much road traffic during the day and wouldn‚Äôt help if you‚Äôre a day-sleeper like I am. Also, a lot of foot traffic at night and shady characters walking late at night."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I couldn‚Äôt ask for a better value; convenient location, clothes washer and drier, coffee, filtered water, and remodeled with high-end finishes."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice and clean. We will stay again
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent place to stay
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very great space for the kid and myself, very small, but I did expect that. Loved that the home had washer and dryer, my only issues were the t.v. Wish it had updated networks.and the pull out bed was a bit hard to pull out and get back in."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I felt right at home from the moment I booked with David. He gave helpful advice during the extreme cold and made me feel like I was not just a guest. I would recommend his places to anyone traveling with 1 or 2 people.
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"When I arrived, I was a little confused because this property has multiple units and I didn't at first know which one I was staying in. Finally figured it out after going through emails from AirBnB and David. Once inside, I was very pleased with the room/apartment. Small, but very comfortable for 1 person. Was very pleased to see such a well stocked kitchen and recent renovations. I was able to settle in right away, and when my circumstances changed during my stay, I was happy that David allowed me to extend my stay, twice. Now, the negatives, which David has absolutely no control over. I had been warned by my siblings before my arrival that this is in a ""sketchy"" area of Billings, but I have to say I never had any problems at all in this regard. Parking is on a side street near the room, and this street intersects with a VERY busy street next to the room. Lastly, I had to run the hot water a long time before any hot water would come. Final thought, I would stay again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our first contact was asking about parking - we have a dually that can be hard to maneuver downtown. The host was quick to respond, directed us on how to park, and would be available if needed , for our late arrival.
At first glance, we saw homeless coming up to the property. The outside of the property buildings were older and run down. When we got to our unit, it was easy to get into, clean and tidy. There was information available about our room and safety information, giving us some confidence that our vehicle would be safe outside. We did appreciate the black out window panels for added safety too.
Everything in the unit was working properly, lots of hot water for a few showers, tv worked great. Similar size to a hotel room with all the amenities of home.
It was a great place for the price, especially if you wanted to be close to downtown, like we did. For light sleepers, be warned that the street next door can be loud.
Exactly as advertised and we were happy."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Overall, great experience. Plenty of room, all the necessities you ever would need and the place was spotless, comfortable and updated. Area is a little industrial but I had zero issues at all. If you are on the main road it is a bit loud during rush hour traffic but nothing to complain about. Great experience, thank you David for having a well priced, nicely updated and maintained place for me to stay in. I felt safe and at home!! Well done!!! JL"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super easy check in and the unit was very cozy and had everything we needed! Would stay here again if I ever make it back to Billings!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place to stay. Outside a little sketchy and noisy with traffic. Worth the money spent, would stay again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very helpful. I needed 1 extra day when my booking was up and was accommodated very nicely. Much appreciated! The location and exterior are nothing to write home about but the interior was done very nicely, clean and modern with a washer and dryer. very convenient. What you get is definitely worth what you pay. probably wouldn't stay here with children but a single person or a couple works great."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a good stay. Nice and quiet.
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay for the price and a convenient location. Very clean and well cared for, with lots of amenities. It was on a busy road with lots of traffic noise so I didn't sleep very well. I never got to meet Dave during my stay, but it is clear that he takes great care of his property."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Our stay was great. Anytime we had a problem it was taken care of quickly. David and his maintenance team are very friendly and accommodating. There are bunnies that run around the property outside that are very cute.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The description about this BnB is very accurate. They‚Äôve done a great job with renovating. My gf and I drove 16+ hours to visit family so this was a really nice home away from home. We didn‚Äôt need anything that big and the price was perfect. I would suggest any visitors bring a Roku or anything that hooks up to the tv, otherwise everything else is supplied!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Outside is rough as stated in the description but the inside was clean with newer furnishings. Fully furnished kitchen and bath, nothing was lacking. Would stay there again."

The host was very responsive to issues."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cool spot for a busy weekend but bring your own entertainment.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Nice and cozy studio apartment. In my 5 month stay, this apartment handled very well in the extreme cold (Below Zero) and scorching hot weather. Apartment was extremely close to downtown and not too far from other attractions. David and his team went above and beyond whenever there was an issue. Security cameras at the location are a bonus. I would book here again if I go back to Billings."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"David and his team were absolutely amazing. My new husband and I needed a location for our honeymoon, and when we needed different accommodations, David was quick and pleasant to work with us and get us this wonderful space. The outside looks a little daunting, but once youstep into the apartment, all doubt in the space melts away.
The apartment is small, but welcoming and comfortable. it was the perfect size for my husband and I. The only hiccup was when nature threw a quick freeze at us and froze the pipes. But when we contacted David and his team, in the same hour they had our water back up and running with no issue. this is a wonderful space hosted by amazing men who really care about hosting. Super affordable, cozy, and comfortable. thank you so much!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,really close to downtown. easy walk to a lot of restaurants and shops. hosts thought of everything.

Place is pretty cramped and the pull out couch is very uncomfortable -
Adequate for the price"
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This AirBnB is quaint, affordable and adorable. The host is quick to respond and adds some extra amenities to your stay. Access to the kitchen was a plus to prepare some of our own meals. Bring or buy your own spices and enjoy your downtown Billings experience! A local grocery store is within walking distance."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great Flat! Walking distance from City Center. David helped me with questions I had about the area and the flat (home) itself. A recommended rental.

The bed was really comfortable and it had a bathtub and after a long day it was great to lay back and relax with a book. Would definitely stay again.
2021-03-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"David was very quick and responsive. The inside of the place is nice, even if the outside looks a little iffy (as others have said in their reviews). The front-loading washer and dryer were wonderful additions. It was cozy, and the inside is well-kept with great updates and touches. The value and location are great. If you have any problems, David was quick to respond and helpful. The bed was also very comfortable--which I think is pretty important!"
2021-03-01,3.0,Stayed over a week,"It has all the amenities, and great response time on the app or by phone.But I had a homeless man sleeping inches from my door step one day, and the dishwasher over flows the kitchen sink, and there are aggressive ants everywhere. So, I wouldn't book here again"
2021-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,it's a cute smaller place to stay.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Face is amazing! His place is clean. He is easy to talk to and has a beautiful home!! Absolutely love it!

2021-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Good place to rest if you have someone in the hospital. It is small and not set up for much food preparation. But has microwave and kuereg coffee. Nice sized washer and dryer.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,David and his team were so very helpful and kind! Responses were very quick and any issues were taken care of promptly.

2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I spent about 10 weeks at David‚Äôs place in Billings. It was just what I needed and had all the essentials for a longer stay.

2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Amazing is all I can say here on work made me fell like I was at home the out side is under construction but the inside is what counts anything u can think of that you need for your own house is inside it's perfect

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The inside of the unit was exquisite. David had it spotless with newer appliances along with the needed tools to cook. David went above and beyond by moving in a hide away bed for us. I really liked the design of the bathroom. I would stay there again.
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,David‚Äôs place is in a great location and very clean. The outside doesn‚Äôt do the inside of it justice. I had a great time there and was very comfort.
2019-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Comfy little place. The three of us were satisfied besides a few things we thought could be cleaner. Our apartment was on the end and right next to the main avenue. So if you don't mind the constant traffic noise (we didn't) its perfect. Best part was all the bunnies.
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Very nice studio. The out side doesn‚Äôt do it justice.
2018-12-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"David was a great host! We contacted him at the end of our stay and he was quick to respond.

We highly recommend this nice and cozy place!"

2018-08-01,3.0,Stayed about a week,"The studio is OK -- it has all basic amenities (though wifi is slow and spotty), but it needs a little attention (thorough cleaning and regular maintenance). The host is responsive and attentive -- prompt communication."

2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Was a little nervous about the area but I had a great stay. It was perfect for my son and I. Very clean, loved the washer and dryer, and really had everything we needed. Anytime I messaged David, him or Alfredo were there to accommodate us. This was very last minute for me and I was really tired of being in a hotel. It was cozy and comfortable. Would definitely stay there again. I would recommend for sure."
2018-07-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,This is a very nice place to stay for a couple or small family. We will consider this our home away from home when we are in Billings.

I will recommend this stay for anyone and will return myself! Thank you Michael and Erica!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,awesome place to stay was very comfy
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great host, very responsive, above and beyond providing amenities. Walking distance to restaurants, Yellowstone art museum. The neighborhood doesn‚Äôt look like the best, but nobody bothered us or our vehicle. Would definitely stay here again"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Was a very comfy, clean, well stocked and decorated place! Highly recommend for one or two people! Super nice."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I‚Äôve been doing turnarounds for the past 30yrs. I‚Äôve stayed in just about every hotel chain known to man. Here in the past 15yrs I‚Äôve been using Airbnb as alternative to hotels. This has been a 3 month stay for me in Montana, that‚Äôs pretty long for turnarounds. I‚Äôve listened to all the complaints from coworkers about there hotel stays throughout this job. This by far is the best stay I have ever had on a job. The convenience of the amenities, location, and surrounding stores were hands down the best experience I‚Äôve had for a out of town job. I would recommend this location to everyone in my Industry that is going to work in Montana. I will also be coming back and staying at this same location for the next turnaround as well. You can‚Äôt ask for a better host in Mr. David for everything he has helped me out with."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great location. Close to restaurants and attractions. Very clean and decorated nicely. Amenities as listed. Instructions printed out and available in room upon arrival. David was very responsive to all questions and was willing to assist when needed. Would definitely stay again!
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"I stayed for 13 weeks and it was what I needed for the time I was there. It is on a main road, so it was very noisy. But, it was easy to walk to great options for food and drinks. David was very responsive to any questions I had."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place may look ghetto but your in for a surprise. Clean, comfy, and way accommodating. Greatplace for an over night knocking boots room. a secret get away or a week hideout. I'll be back."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,the place was nice and new
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This place was super comfortable and had everything I needed. I really appreciated having a washer/dryer. It‚Äôs a short drive to downtown but not in the greatest location for walking around (which I was fine with). I was happy with my stay.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was very clean . Communication with David was very good . He responded to messages within minutes ‚Ä¶ I would book again

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I stayed here for one month and I really liked it. This location is truly 5-10 mins away from anywhere downtown.
The unit was clean and staff very helpful. They r under construction so the outside may not look appealing, but the inside is very nice. I love the rabbits!!!
Thumbs up to David and staff!!!!!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great value. Great location. Comfortable and homey.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Hospital internship for 5 weeks. 2 minute drive to Billings Clinic. Worked perfect.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was pretty close to the city area to walk to. We did not have a car as it was being repaired in the shop so this was a big deal to us. The neighbors in the complex were also friendly.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Exactly as described. Perfect for two.
2022-02-01,3.0,Stayed about a week,Very nice tile work and interior decorating. They are working diligently to update all the units in this complex.

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The unit is very comfortable, and has all of the amenities a modern business traveler could want. Being located less than 1/4 of a mile from a grocery store, and within walking distance of a few good restaurants was an added perk. Highly recommended."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I travel to Billings frequently for work, and David's units are always my first choice. The spaces are cozy, comfortable, and have absolutely everything you need. The location is great too, walking distance to Albertsons for groceries and across from a nice park where I would take walks most evenings. I'll definitely be a repeat customer whenever these are available!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a great place to stay! The AC worked fantastic, the area is a little rough but the inside was fully renovated. Any questions I had David responded within an hour."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The exterior may make you wary, but the inside is quite clean and comfortable. This is a very cozy place in downtown Billings! However, I would recommend being careful outside at night.
I really appreciated being able to use a full-sized fridge, washer, and dryer. There was also a mobile island that I could use for cooking purposes. One thing to note is that the oven is a bit outdated, but otherwise, I enjoyed the amenities.
This was better than what any local hotel would have provided. I would definitely come back!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great host, location, and apartment! David was very responsive when we had troubles getting into our room, and sent over assistance immediately. If we are ever back in Billings, we hope to stay here again!!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Everything I could want was in this wonderful unit. Wonderful bed, all the kitchen needs were there. Everything was new including the kitchen and bathroom and in perfect working order."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! Cute studio apartment, nice kitchen space, nice washer and dryer, very stylish and clean. Great option for traveller's. I felt safe and comfortable the entire stay. The whole apartment has been taken care of very well!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Incredible spot! Legit close to everything, 5 minutes from Montana street which has a bunch of great places for food and drink. Would 100% stay here again."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"great apartment, close to everything and exactly as described."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was an awesome stay! It was beautifully renovated and the amenities were great. Bed was extremely comfortable!
The only con was how loud the AC was. But it was great to have with how warm the weather was! Would definitely stay again"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The host and the place are both amazing !!!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"It‚Äôs a great location, and I never felt unsafe walking around it."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bed was really comfortable. Place was clean and had everything I needed. We asked for an AC and within a few hours they had one ready for us. There is a lot of street noise from cars passing by, but if your not bothered by that. This is a great place to stay."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,exceed my expectations a very complete mini studio I recommend it
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I have stayed twice with David. He is very accommodating and offers a great place
2021-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice but in a bit rougher part of time
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you!
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"David‚Äôs place is a 5-10 minute drive to both hospitals, downtown restaurants, shops and some museums. Perfect place for travel nurses who need a month to month place that is furnished. The unit I stayed in had a W/D/DW/R and Stove. David and his associates were always quick to respond to questions and a couple of small issues with the heat. Snow was cleared promptly from the sidewalks and walkways."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I loved this airbnb. It is a perfect space for one person. I'm a travel nurse, and this place was conveniently located to both Billings Clinic and St. Vincent. The area on the outside looks a little unsettling but I didn't have an issue the entire month I was there. David and his associates respond very quickly and are super accommodating."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The inside is amazing! The interior furniture, decor, tile work, and use of space are impressive. Comfortable, clean, and fresh inside. More than makes up for the outside!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Im a medical traveller, and it exceeded all my needs...both hospitals are within walking distance. I will be back next year for a 6 month contract, and will look to book here"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Don't let the exterior of the building fool you! This place is fully renovated inside with all the amenities you could need for short or longer stays. The location is not only close to the airport, but also at the heart of the city. Stores, restaurants, parks, and attractions are only a block or two away. David is a great host and helped make our visit to Billings comfortable and worthwhile. Would highly recommend."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little space near downtown Billings. The inside is very stylish and modern with thoughtful touches such as coffee, soap, shampoo etc.
We were beyond grateful that the air conditioner was turned on when we arrived, it would have been very hot and stuffy without.
It is true though that the outside and immediate seems a little edgy and off putting. But I felt safe while inside the apartment. There is also a colony of rabbits in the complex very fun to watch!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,What a find! Awesome place to stay. Great amenities and close to everything. David went above and beyond to accommodate our stay. He also is very prompt with responses. Will definitely stay again if ever in Billings!
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"David was a great host! Communication was immediate and having Alfredo on site they could fix things same day. I am a travel nurse and stayed with David for the 3 months during the Covid 19 crisis. In such uncertain times it was comforting to know I had a safe and clean place to come home to. I knew I could rely on him if I needed anything. He asked me several time if there was anything he could get for me or do to help me during the pandemic. The apartment was exactly as described and served all my needs as a travel nurse. Having laundry, full kitchen, cable/wifi and a nice updated bathroom made my day to day functioning and 15 weeks of straight overtime easier. I'd highly recommend for any travel nurse working at Billings Clinic or St.Vincent's as you can walk to the hospitals. I chose the location because it was close to downtown and I could walk to several very nice bars and restaurants. I also ran in North Park everyday."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Excellent service. Great communication. Perfect spot for someone traveling for work.
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute little place to stay!!
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Awesome place I would definitely stay again
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,David is awesome I wish I could‚Äôve stayed longer I see why this spot is in such high demand
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is such a great location and so cute inside with absolutely everything you need...and then some. Nice and clean, efficient and comfortable. This is a little complex and it was a bit difficult to figure out which unit was ours and where to park and the outside looks really sketchy...really....but totally safe and secure. I plan on staying in that location again."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,In town for a conference downtown and this was a great spot to stay!
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place. Enjoyed my stay.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"As honestly advertised, this unit is in a bit of a rougher part of town; however, I had absolutely no issues. Walked to and from the hospital every morning and evening without incident. The unit is cutely decorated and has nearly everything you will need. Only thing I could have used is an iron. David was a great host, super responsive and upfront about the accommodations. I would stay again and would recommend this spot to others."
2019-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a diamond in the rough. We were forewarned that there was hail damage to our room, and we were a little concerned about the area when we pulled in. They are in the middle of remodeling, so the outside does look a little worse for wear. BUT the room was really nice inside. The bed was comfortable and the room was clean and modernly furnished. We enjoyed our stay. The WiFi was having issues, so if you‚Äôre relying on quick internet for your stay, be aware. Overall, a great room for the price!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This unit had everything we needed. It is located near downtown restaurants and breweries, but also has a full kitchen if preparing your own meals. Laundry is a huge plus! The bed is comfortable and the TV has cable. As others reviews have said, the WiFi isn‚Äôt the best, but it suffices. Street parking is only steps away. All in all, a great place to stay in Billings."
2019-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The outside really needs some work, but once we got inside it was clean and updated."
2019-08-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"The outside of the apartment is very rundown, but the inside is beautiful. Expect a small studio apartment located downtown next to everything, but in a transient neighborhood. David is good to work with. Charter makes the internet connection here spotty at best."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,üëç
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I really enjoyed my time at David place. It was close to the hospital and downtown. I stayed for a month and had no issues.
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable and very close To restaurants! Easy to check-in and David is very responsive.
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Cozy apartment right in the middle of Billings. The outside of the building could use some TLC, but the inside is pretty nice, quiet, and comfortable. The area always seems to have a few homeless (and large rabbits?) wandering around as there is a youth shelter and a a block over is an adult shelter and soup kitchen. But I had no issues coming or going beyond just a few people trying to panhandle me when I walked a few blocks to the store. I never felt unsafe, but I did make sure to lock my car and just be aware as you do in any city. Washer and dryer was handy, kitchen had plenty of space, tv was fine, and the bed is very soft and comfortable. The fridge is full-size and the bathroom, while small, had good water pressure and hot water. My only complaints would be the wifi is not the greatest but did eventually work okay, and maybe the bed linens could be improved. But overall for the price this was an excellent stay and I would recommend it to anyone."
2019-03-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,Is was a nice place for the location overall. And David was nice.
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Where should I start! It's a great airbnb and I highly recommend if you need to stay in or around Billings. I stayed at the apartment for 3 months- the location is absolutely perfect if you have work at the hospital (well the location is perfect for easy access to everything in billings). Everything in downtown billings is in walking distance, uber is also a good option if walking isn't your thing and you don't have a car. There is a parking area on the side of the apartments or street parking is free (I always parked on the street- never had any issues). Microwave, dishwasher, washer, dryer, kuerig all in the unit! The bed is heavenly! Other reviewers said the wifi was spotty- recommend sitting on the couch next to the window or at the foot of the couch (wifi is more reliable in that spot) OR they are many amazing coffee shops near by with absolutely fantastic coffee and free wifi. Others also mentioned the outside looks worrisome/ sketchy-I never had a single problem or ran into any trouble and I worked night shift- so I would go to the anytime fitness or the 24/7 Walmart at 2am and never had any issues. If I had a question about anything David would respond within minutes and alfredo was right there to help. All in all- stay here! Highly recommend!"
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Dont let the outside appearance fool you. The inside is all new and very clean. Quiet and cozy, we enjoyed our stay."
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,David is an awesome host. The place is exactly as described.
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The apartments are awesome and close to downtown. The bed feels like home and I have stayed three separate times in three separate units. This is an awesome place to stay!
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is a great value. I knew that the exterior might not be great from reading other reviews but the inside was perfect and just what I needed for a couple of nights. Had one issue when I checked in that was quickly resolved with very prompt communication. Absolutely no complaints!
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"i was happy to stay in David's comfortable unit. It was convenient to the places I wanted to visit, affordable, and was abundantly comfortable. David was communicative and direct."
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome spot and if you're trying to go to breweries then this is the spot. You're only a few blocks walk to everything you need. The gritty looking location isn't actually gritty at all. Ultra responsive host who will help you immediately if you have any questions. The only place I'll stay in Billings
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place had everything we needed in terms of furnishings and kitchen ware. Washer and dryer right in the unit was awesome and unexpected. Place was just as described in terms of a rougher location but we had no problems at all. It is by a busy street so there is traffic noise most of the time. It kind of became white noise after a few days though. Recommend a cellular WiFi connection if you need it to work consistently though. Overall, place had everything we needed, very little we did not need and was a good value!"
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This indoor space is wonderful! It was clean, cozy, and will all the desired amenities. I was a bit hesitant when I first pulled up as the condition of the outside complex is a bit run-down, but as soon as you step inside the unit, it is beautiful! There is also some street noise at night if you‚Äôre sensitive to that. It is in close proximity to downtown which is convenient. I would stay here again if I visit Billings!"
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"David is super responsive and helpful if you need anything during your stay. The apartment itself is beautiful on the inside, and it‚Äôs only a short walk to downtown. Definitely would stay again."
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed the weekend in Studio 2 and after a couple of days in the horrible Best Western Clocktower, returned for three nights in Studio 1.
Simply put, you can transplant the interior of each studio to any major city or vacation hotspot in the world and it wouldn't feel out of place - the furniture and accoutrements are all comfortable and contemporary.
If you care to save money on accommodation, I wouldn't hesitate in recommending David's Airbnb over any of the ludicrously over-priced downtown options."
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute place, has everything you may need."
2018-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The inside of the space is very lovely, but the outside was awful. It's hard to get past first impressions - my Lyft driver was hesitant to even drop me off - he walked me to the front door. I contacted David who was very kind/communicative. He assured me that it is a safe building and even dropped by - which I appreciated. But although walking to and from downtown was convenient - I would have rather stayed in a different area and walked/ubered/rented a car. There is a facility for runaways next door - so you have to pass a bunch of smoking teenagers that are covering the lawn - each time you go into town. I just never felt comfortable - and I lived in Downtown Atlanta for 12 years. I appreciate all of the care that went into the inside of the apartment - perhaps I would stay there if I wasn't by myself."
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Would definitely recommend this place to anyone.
The one negative was the location, I was intentionally frightened when I saw the location, but was amazed by the beauty of the studio once I walked. I felt like I was transported some place else! The location ended up being fine. Looks like there would be drugs/sketchy people around, but I saw no one. It was quite besides the occasional car. I ended up feeling very safe.
Now the good part, the studio is gorgeous! Everything is updated, there was cute decor, all the appliances needed with a long trip even though we were just there a weekend.
The WiFi was touch & go, but unless you NEED it, that wasn‚Äôt really an issue for us. I would definitely stay here or in another of the locations without a doubt!"
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome little place close to downtown. Great updates and amenities!
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"David‚Äôs place is super cute. Very chic and trendy decor, clean space, cold AC. The complex itself was a little rough looking, but the apt is gorgeous. If given the opportunity to stop in Billings again, we would totally book this spot again!"
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I stayed at Davids place for 2 days, at the beginning of my trip, but had previously booked other accommodations for about 5 days. I came back to David place for the entire 2nd week of my trip.
The location could not be better! EVERYTHING you need is literally within a 2 or 3 block radius. And being in town without a car it was perfect for my needs. I could walk for 5 to 10 min. and get to 3 popular Fast food chains, 2 Diners, a grocery store, a pharmacy, or a 24 hour gas station with a mini mart. There is also a neighborhood sports tavern right up the street with food and drinks, where you can watch a game on one of the TV's or gamble a little.
I understand that this kind of easy acccess and convenience isn't a priority for everyone. But there is a reason I didn't tell you about the laundromat that is practically across the street! And thats b'cuz Davids place has top of the line appliances, like the full sized, stacked, front loading washer and dryer! The new microwave and The Keurig coffee maker and a smart tv! There's even a dishwasher!
I could go on about the 2 foot thick memory foam mattress, but its starting to sound like I'm making it all up. But its all the truth. David you nailed it!"
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved this studio! It had everything I needed, and was in walking distance to anything else that I might need. I enjoyed privacy that I was given with the self check in. But the moment I had a question, the response was prompt and friendly. Everything was immaculate! The appliances were top of the line, with front loading stacked washer and dryer!
I intend to stay here next time I come to Billings. Thank you for making my stay so comfortable and pleasant."
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was very comfortable and stylish made my 2 night stay very relaxing. I am definitely booking again. David was very welcoming and informative
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, great people."
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"What an excellent first experience using Airbnb. I stayed at David's place for two months and was surprised to find the place more thoughtfully accommodated than my apartment back home. It sure beats any hotel room at least. I brought up two or three fairly important concerns throughout the course of my stay, and they were all addressed within a matter of hours. Overall, my communication with him was laid back and hands-off, which I particularly appreciated because I was working 80hr weeks on night shift. If you're visiting Billings for any reason, staying at one of David's units is a no-brainer."
2018-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super cozy and comfortable
2017-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The studio was centrally located to the people we were visiting. Near downtown and all the amenities. David answered our questions via texts in a timely manner. It sufficiently met our needs and the price was right.
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super comfortable bed and couch and really clean space! Also had a great ac which is always nice in the summer. Easily accessible and in a good part of town.
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Excellent Stay!!!!
From the moment I contacted David the communication was excellent. This was my first experience using Airbnb. I was nervous and didn't know what to expect. I have only one regret, that I didn't stay my first week in Billings at Davids place. First, David takes pride in what he provides for his guests and goes out of his way to accommodate his guests. He wanted to make sure our stay was comfortable and we were happy. The studio we rented was beautiful inside. The entire place is brand new. The studio was spotless, clean, and cozy. The bathroom tile is gorgeous. The shower is perfect with lots of hot water. The color scheme of the studio is professionally decorated from the tile to the color scheme. The bed was clean and comfortable. My 11 year old slept on the coach and his exact words were, ""Mom I don't want to get up this coach is so comfortable."" David was so nice to accommodate us with extra sheets, pillow, and blankets for my son.
The kitchen was well stocked more then we expected. In fact the entire place was stocked with hair soap, hair dryer, etc. We were able to cook every night instead of spending money to go out to eat. The best part was the laundry machines which made it so convinenant for us.
The studio is located close to downtown and convinenantly close to the highway. We felt very safe and secure in the studio.
There isn't enough good to say about this experience. If you plan to visit Billings this is the place to stay."
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Your attention to detail in my room. Was amazing . I thoroughly was impressed with your presentstion.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Megan‚Äôs home was in a wonderful neighborhood. We felt extremely safe and the home was even more beautiful than in the photos!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was a hit for us 4 siblings. They hadn't experienced Air BnB before and now really would love to do it again. Really relaxing family experience, got our business done and got to relax! The best."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I would easily stay at any places hosted by Megan
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The host Megan was wonderful. She had info of interest area the area. Had a great page of beautiful walking trails. Megan was very easy to get a hold of if needed! She also texted to let us know why there was no electricity‚Ä¶ she gave us the why and when of the outage. Would definitely book here again when we return to Montana!!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The value for the money would have been 5 star if he second bedroom had at least a queen instead of a day bed.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We just stopped to sleep on a cross country trip, but the house was very comfortable and clean. The bed was comfortable and they had provided lots of extra linens and blankets if you need. Happy there was shampoo, conditioner etc in the bathroom, and snacks in a little basket in the kitchen. We have stayed a lot of places and always appreciate these little touches!
The house feels very new and is very clean. The garage is easy to park in and also spotless. Easy to get back to the highway if you're passing through town."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Megan was a fantastic host and very accommodating. Communicated fast and efficiently. The property was great and had everything I could have needed. I loved the electric fireplace and the kitchen was nice, as well. The full length mirror is a nice touch, most places don't have one. The closet was huge too. I only wish the living room window and kitchen window had shades or curtains! Other than that, was a great stay. Would stay here again. Thanks Megan!!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was very comfortable, clean, and in a safe neighborhood. Megan was a wonderful host and I would definitely stay there again."

I would highly recommend this airbnb."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This house was just perfect for a week in Billings. The neighborhood is large and pretty populated, but it was super quiet! Easy to get to restaurants and grocery stores. Took full advantage of the well appointed kitchen and prepared meals most days. Super clean and tidy beyond my expectations. Would highly recommend Megan‚Äôs place especially for a week or longer."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great stay- great place for kids
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Unfortunate circumstances necessitated our protracted stay in Billings with some unique mobility needs. We searched many places for reduced steps into the house, a walk-in shower, and open and single level living spaces. This was exactly the right place. There are two steps up from the garage, which were manageable. The garage itself meant we didn‚Äôt have to worry about loading and unloading in uncertain conditions. The kitchen was the best stocked AirBnB kitchen I‚Äôve ever seen! We also have two young children, and stays can be a bit nerve wracking if there are excessive decorations. Here everything was tastefully done but without dangerous fragility.
Another best-of-AirBnB qualities was our host, Megan. She was so responsive and kind, and genuinely cared about the quality of our stay. During a completely stressful time, she was a calm and steady reassurance. We just had nothing to worry about when it came to the basic and fundamental need for a safe haven. Thank you, Megan üíó"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is my second stay here and I look forward to staying again. Incredibly clean and comfortable, and only a few years old. Every detail is covered ‚Äî we loved the fully stocked kitchen, bathrooms with all amenities (shampoo, conditioner, body wash, cotton balls, Q tips), and attached two car garage with opener to put in your car. Incredible value especially when compared to a hotel room."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great stay. Super comfortable bed and sofa. Well appointed rental.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This was a welcome retreat while babysitting our grandson. A wonderful front porch and a fire pit outside!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was a quick trip, but Megan‚Äôs place was perfect!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is the most well-appointed ABNB we have stayed in. Everything and I do mean EVERYTHNING was perfect. The furnishings, linens, appliances were amazing, the kitchen was so well stocked and can't say enough about the whole experience. If we find ourselves coming back to the Billings area, we will definitely hope to be able to stay here.
Thank you for such a beautiful experience."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This home is absolutely beautiful. It is clean and comfortable. The home has a large couch for sitting and the fireplace is a nice touch. Rockers on the porch made a nice place to sit in evening air. The neighborhood felt safe. A small fenced in yard space allowed for privacy outdoors for a meal. The host is friendly and responsive to any questions we had. The location is minutes away from stores and about 15 from downtown Billings.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"So comfortable, felt just like home. The home made our girls weekend so much better. Didn‚Äôt want to leave."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Megan's place was absolutely perfect for us. We scheduled the last minute and she was very accommodating. The area is up and coming. There is a wonderful coffee shop called Maple Moose it is within walking distance . Along my walk I saw a very nice playground and seating area. All the homes are beautiful and quaint to look at.
The home is very clean, the master suite has a walk in tiled shower with wonderful soothing water pressure. The beds were so comfortable. Love the trundle bed that is a great idea! The living room was so comfy and we fell in love with the couch and are now looking for one for our house. The kitchen was perfect. We were only there 1 night so we did not need to use all the kitchen amenities that were provided. But is it well stocked. Megan thought of everything! Being able to use the garage was an added bonus so we could unload our vehicle from the garage instead of the street. We will defiantly be back and will stay longer."

Would love to stay again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very nice place. The hosts were proactive and responsive. We would recommend this house and for sure would stay again.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was an exceptionally clean and comfortable house. Definitely one of the nicest Airbnbs I‚Äôve stayed at. Having an attached garage w garage opener was key.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Gorgeous, spacious, new house right off the highway. As photographed/described and immaculately clean. Having the attached garage to store my car full of belongings as I drove cross-country was a major plus! I‚Äôd definitely stay again if in the area."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was lovely, and clean. It was stocked nicely and had everything we needed. We only wished it had been in the heights as that's what I searched for, but very comfortable nonetheless."

The house is well put together and was pretty child-proofed so we didn‚Äôt have to walk around hiding things from my two-year-old. The AC worked well and the beds were very comfortable (I love a soft and supportive bed and had a great night‚Äôs sleep). We also enjoyed having the attached garage and the side yard with the grill!

Be sure and head down the street to Maple Moose coffee & more- great place with friendly employees and lots of choices besides coffee, including Wilcoxson‚Äôs ice cream and custom soda pop drinks."

Finally, the beds were super comfortable. They even have a portable fan. Great stay and thanks to phenomenal hosts."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Kelvin's place was quite possibly my favorite Airbnb that we have ever stayed in. Beautiful surroundings and private. The home itself was a gem. You can tell they put massive amounts of thought and effort toward making this place one of a kind. The price for what you get is more than worth it!! I would highly suggest staying more than one day - that's our only regret. We will be back!!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful little cabin with the best views from every window. Loved laying in the bed watching the sunrise. Truly felt like we were in a tree house.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kelvin‚Äôs place was extremely cozy and we felt right at home. We adored the aesthetic and design of the house and are now inspired to have something like Kelvin‚Äôs house.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at the Bungalow. We hardly spent any time inside, as the surroundings were beautiful. The space was exceptionally well-kept; we almost felt bad living in it. üòÇüòÇ Despite the relatively secluded location, we didn‚Äôt have any trouble finding it. The host offered flawless directions that we used on our way in and out. We were very pleased with the amenities provided, particularly the water pitcher and the heated flooring. We‚Äôll definitely be looking at staying here again. üëçüèº"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We stayed here with our 8 month old. We were able to let him crawl around without having to worry about him getting into anything and with the garage door we could let him explore outside. The Airbnb was beautiful and hiking the property was peaceful. Kelvin was very responsive and helpful. He gave us many recommendations for the area. We look forward to staying at this Airbnb again!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I stayed here for our 1 year wedding anniversary. It was so peaceful at the bungalow. The location is pristine as everything is within a 20 minute drive. The kitchen is great to cook in and the bed was extremely comfortable. Out on the deck was peaceful being able to look at the stars at night and have breakfast in the morning. The firepit outside kept us nice and toasty. A real nice treat was having heated flooring to walk on when waking up in the morning. Quite nice when you get ready to take a hot shower! While we didn‚Äôt get to see much wildlife close to the bungalow there were a good amount of deer on nearby property on the road up to it. Kelvin and his family were kind enough to let us visit and help feed their cattle on their property above the bungalows too! This made my wife‚Äôs day! We keep gettin surprised with every air bnb stay we have thinking it would be impossible for a stay to be better, but this place will be hard to beat. It is literally perfect!"

The deck was so serene with its woodsy setting. These hosts thought of everything when they stocked this Airbnb. To my dismay we forgot floss, and they had us covered. All of the linens even smelled amazing. It‚Äôs the little things that stood out to us, but as a whole I‚Äôm blown away. We wish we would have been staying longer so we could‚Äôve enjoyed the peaceful atmosphere to the fullest extent. This was the best! 10/10 highly recommend.

I would definitely stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This tiny house packs a mighty punch! Its remote location provides peace, yet you are less than 15min away from gas/food/stores. They put so much detail into this tiny house, and they thought of everything! From the clean and stocked bathroom and kitchen to the garage door and deck! I fell in love with Montana and the minimal lifestyle of Billings and this house sums it all up. The host had very good directions to the house, and kept in contact the entire stay for all my questions. We left feeling well rested and at peace. When we come back to Montana, we will definitely stay here again."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Heather was very friendly and helpful. Her place is in a great location. You can hear the traffic, but it is a suburban area, so it was to be expected. The street isn‚Äôt a busy one. Heather communicates well and is proactive. If we are ever in the area again, we would definitely book this home."

My only complaint was that the window AC doesn‚Äôt cover more than just the one bedroom. The house is hot but she did provide some fans to make up for that.
We‚Äôll be back next year!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cute house in Billings, MT! Definitely an older home, but the furniture is updated and it‚Äôs still a comfortable stay. There was a fenced in yard for the dogs to run around in and a washer/dryer available. There isn‚Äôt any AC, but with being in MT and using fans during the day to circulate air through the house it never got uncomfortably warm inside. We would stay here again!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This vintage home has living space to spread out and stay as long as you'd like. It's located in a neighborhood of older homes on a fairly busy street, but we found it very quiet and restful. All the listed amenities were available and Heather was immediately responsive whenever I reached out. What stands out most is the loving care and design style with which Heather has retouched and redone various areas -- most notably extensive modern tile work in kitchen and bath and refinished wood floors throughout.
This is an older home and it shows its age in some spaces; for example, windows are painted shut and generally hard to open if you like fresh air. The bathroom is tiny and not easy to use."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"It was as described. The window air conditioner was quite small and only cooled the bedroom and living room a little. The bathroom was very cramped. If you are full figured, you will find the bathroom inconvenient. The bed was very comfy, and everything else was as stated in her description."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay at the little red house. We were able to walk through a nice neighborhood to a downtown restaurant. It was just a little over a mile. Check in and check out we‚Äôre very easy.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Heather's place was perfect for my short stay. It was clean and comfortable. The yard is fenced which made it easy to let my dog out. It's in a cute neighborhood that was easy to walk around. Heather was very proactive in checking in and giving clear instructions. I enjoyed my stay and would book again.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was absolutely adorable and in a great central location. It was comfortable and the internet was very fast.

,,,"This place seemed, at first, to be a bargain. However, these use to be efficiency low income housing. They are in a dangerous and unsafe part of town. There were homeless folks walking around asking for money everytime we came back. They are located on one of the busiest streets in Billings. We heard traffic all night long. We had to buy ear plugs to sleep. The inside looks nice but very small. The second night the heater went out and we had to use a cheap electric space heater to keep warm. We went to wash some clothes and the washing machine smelled so bad we had to open the window and door to air it out. We tried to clean the washer but it was no use. Lastly, my wife had morning sickness and wasn't feeling well so we were about 30 minutes late checking out. I explained this to the cleaning person and he just snapped at me. The owner called and told me we had to get out. I explained what was going on and he just said check out is at 11 your late and I should charge you another day. Wenever asked for a refund for having to sleep in the cold or not being able to do laundry and they were all extremely rude. I would find some where else to stay"
