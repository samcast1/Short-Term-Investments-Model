2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We could walk to great restaurants. The small town was beautiful. Couldn’t ask for a better place to stay.
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great location and friendly hosts! Parking can be a pain because daytime parking on the street is limited to 2 hours and the nearest public lot is a 2 minute walk away.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Central location, comfortable and clean. Enjoyed my stay!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location for anything downtown.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Second time staying here & will definitely be back. Love the location downtown.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,A wonderful place to stay!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tracy was an awesome host. She answered our many questions and was accommodating to our needs
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stay at a boondocks BlackHills cabin, with solar lights and little else, so we really appreciate Tracey's sweet apartment with hot water and super fast wifi, for a quick clean up and connect. The kitchen has everything you need (cooking in is mainly our style, although there are several restaurants within walking distance). We stay every year, and everything slways goes super smooth (even the stairs, lol). Easy to park, check in, very clean, and communication with Tracy is always excellent. Thanks again for another wonderful downtown historic Spearfish experience. Aloha, Rebecca&Dave"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Well maintained & furnished. Nice big windows facing Main Street. Easy to find.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was one of my favorite AirBnBs we have ever stayed in. Comfortably appointed and extremely conveniently located. I loved the vaulted ceilings with pressed tin tiles, and the big soft bath towels and cloths. We had a blast teaching our five year old how to play Monopoly with the local edition, and the brewery two blocks away does a great beer flight. I highly recommend this lovely downtown loft."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome stay at the Spearfish Loft! Thoroughly enjoy the historic building with modern upgrades. Great location and views right off Main Street. Plenty to do right outside the door while peaceful and comfortable inside. Would definitely stay again!
Tracy and Nathan were great hosts being quickly responsive and considerate of a need that came up during my stay."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Easy. Great location and Tracy was easy to communicate with.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very convenient. Cozy. Host is quick to respond and accommodating. It was a fun place to stay!
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This loft was a cute downtown night on our long trip.
They do not want pets because of the lofts gorgeous original hard wood floors.
Place is spotless and cozy.
The bed is old and losing comfort.
Parking situation is my only true complaint and the property cannot do anything about that. You can’t street park overnight so then your stuck in a parking lot you can’t see by a sketchy motel… did see quite a bit of sketch people at night. And a crotch rocket woke us up from a dead sleep in the middle of the night. Scared my whole family to death. If you want a quiet oasis.. this isn’t it. If you want a weekend down town and plan on going out and staying up this is for you.
The owners are amazing and responsive. The loft is cute and clean!!! Just know what your getting into."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay in fun downtown Spearfish! Tracy was great to work with-I highly recommend!!!
2023-07-01,3,Stayed one night,Cute little place. Sleeping space is definitely geared more for a couple than family. My adult child said the pull out couch was uncomfortable. The king size bed was way to firm for my liking. Was super excited to see a fridge with ice maker! We drink tons of ice water.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The Downtown Loft East was a great location for us to stay at! It was close to our relatives house, restaurants, bars and shops! It was even right on the parade route for the 4th of July as well as the Downtown Friday Nights Event.
Although it did come with a set of knives, a knife sharpener would be a handy thing to have.
If there was something we needed for the loft, we called the number listed and help was minutes away.
Thanks for a wonderful Spearfish experience!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,You will not find a better location in downtown Spearfish! Would absolutely recommend Tracy’s place.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved this spot!! Will definitely stay again.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved our stay. This loft was absolutely perfect for our little family. We arrived just in time for the Lights Parade, then walked to a restaurant for dinner and to a coffee shop the next morning. This is the perfect location to walk anywhere downtown! The loft it’s self was exactly how pictured and described and even better in person: even the couch, blanket and towels were soft and cozy! We will definitely be back. Thanks again for letting us stay in your historic building!!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved this place! I've stayed many places in Spearfish and this was my favorite especially the history of it. It can get loud on main at night and I like a window open so if you're a light sleeper its maybe not for you. The location is perfect!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tracy’s place was really neat! I don’t think you could be more centrally located and it seemed really unique! It had everything we needed, was nicely decorated, very clean and Tracy was very responsive and helpful. I would happily recommend this to anyone looking to stay in the area. I can’t wait to bring my husband back to this place!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our second stay at Stacey's apartment, and as the last time very clean and neat with everything needed for cooking, lounging and watching football! We stay at a remote cabin when we visit the BlackHills and then take a couple days in historic Spearfish which has a very chic clean downtown. Love staying at Stacey's and plan to be back soon! Thank you & Aloha,

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our AirBnB in Spearfish! it was a great size, quick walk to restaurants and breweries and (bonus points) a really cool, historical building. Wish we had more than 1 night."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The loft is right in the heart of downtown Spearfish so it was great to be able to walk to many places and not as touristy as other nearby towns. There is street noise but not late at night so it was worth it to be near restaurants, etc. The loft is spacious and was perfect for my husband and I. Would definitely stay here again!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and modern with historical touches everywhere. Great communication with the host(s). Expect traffic sounds. We used a small fan for white noise to sleep.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tracy was a great host! We asked for restaurant suggestions and had a quick reply! The place was nice and clean! It was a great location within walking distance of bars, food, boutiques and coffee! We would definitely return given the chance."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This loft is super clean. No parking on-site, unless you are on the street. We parked about a block away. There is a good amount of steps to get up too the loft, but that was no issue for us. We loved the Friday night downtown band and food trucks. We we would definitely come back. Tracy was super quick to reply. Wonderful experience."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tracy and Nathan are the best hosts! Their communication was fast and they were ready to assist when we got a flat tire on the way to Spearfish! The apartment is the perfect location downtown and they decorated it beautifully. They even have vibrating/massage recliner chairs that were amazing after a day of walking.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cute place! Great location for everything downtown Spearfish 😊 there’s many options for parking, even with us hauling dirt bikes. Tracy communicated quickly with us when we needed assistance and was a wonderful host. We will for sure be back again!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Fun little place right in the heart of Spearfish! Easy to find, comfortable and the surrounding area has plenty to offer!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a beautiful place in a perfect spot. Very clean and beautiful!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place - we loved the floors and history! Location was perfect. Great boutiques and restaurants within minutes. Agree it’s on the louder side (especially with the summer Friday festival), so just note if you have littles - we travel with a sound machine so not a huge deal."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, lovingly cared for historic apartment overlooking downtown Main Street, Spearfish. Modern upgrades with 1900's main wood flooring present. Comfortable open concept kitchen/living area, with separate bed and bathroom (shower head is tall with great pressure). Perfect couple size. Easy to enter off the street with 24 steps to your abode (get that workout in each day!). Shops and restaurants are within walking distance, but we appreciated the full kitchen and cookware for dining in. Thank you Tracy for your hospitality!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tracy's place is very cute! We loved the feel of the historic building and the touches such as the original wood floors. The apartment was well stocked with anything we could've needed. You can hear the street noises which we knew before arriving, but it didn't affect our stay. We would definitely stay again."
2022-06-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Location, location, location! Pros: close to everything, you can walk everywhere, so many restaurants, bars, and coffee shops nearby. Cons: you can hear everything, music from the bars, people talking on the street below, loud vehicles, parking is about a block away in a public lot.
The place is very cute, well maintained, clean, and comfortable. The kitchen was well stocked with olive oil, salt and pepper. Tracy is a great host with good communication and quickly resolved an issue with the lock system."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very Clean. Right down town. Beautifully decorated.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,A fun slice of South Dakota hospitality. The old downtown buildings were interesting and a great history lesson. The loft is very clean with nice touches. The bed was extremely comfortable and the linens and towels were thick and soft. It’s a great place to stay! Thank you!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We recently visited Spearfish and the Black Hills and thoroughly enjoyed our stay! The loft was beautifully historic and cozy (the extra blanket to snuggle with on the couch was a nice touch). We couldn't have asked for a better location - right downtown in historic Spearfish with easy access to many restaurants, breweries, coffee houses, and local shops!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Awesome location, price, communication and owners are very accommodating. We have stayed here multiple times and live it. One small downside is because it’s right downtown and on Main Street the road noise can be a little loud."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tracy is great! The downtown loft suite was perfect for my stay in Spearfish. I liked the 1900's building location, comfort of the suite, and friendliness of the host. I would stay there again. Thank you!!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a cute place to stay and it's so convenient with being on Main St in downtown! My girls & I stayed here the night before my wedding and it was so cute and cozy! Has a great view of Main St!

2022-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"What a cute, cozy loft apt. in a great location in beautiful, downtown, Spearfish, SD. We recommend your place to everyone. The price was right, the location was perfect, it’s surrounded by coffee shops, great shopping, wonderful restaurants and only a few miles from Black Hills State University. The accommodations were comfortable and the hosts responsive. What a perfect place to stay the weekend or for an extended stay like ours. I hope all your other guests will enjoy it as much as we have.
Jhett and Kathy"

2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,I beautifully set up apartment overlooking main st with plenty of restaurants and a natural foods grocery within walking distance. The apartment has everything you could need for a short or long stay. Tracy is quick to respond and check-in was a breeze.
2021-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,If you plan to stay on a weekend night then be prepared for lots of yelling and screaming between 1:30am-2:30am. Not owners fault but there are lots of drunk college students leaving and walking from the bars. Location otherwise is excellent. If you have any back problems or just need a nice mattress for good rest then this spot might be an issue for you. Other than those things the place is beautiful and very well stocked!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Small charming historic place with high ceilings and a super convenient location. Floor boards are a little creaky but this place is clean and comfy and perfect for one or two people to get away. Leave your car behind and stay downtown for a few days, everything you need is walking distance."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This airbnb was exactly as the pictures indicated! It is spacious, adorable, and comfy!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,This is hands down our most favorite place to stay. The hosts are great and extremely helpful. You will not regret staying at either the East or the West Loft.

2021-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great communication! Well equipped kitchen. Close to restaurants, night life and groceries. Great natural light!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,Beautiful place…clean and great location. The kitchen and bath is well equipped. Great for a long stay. Tracy was so quick to respond to any questions.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Historic charm, super clean and absolutely the best location! The Host was a joy to work with.
If you are a light sleeper like me I would recommend a white-noise app on your phone as there is some light noise from the street below.
You won’t regret booking this lovely loft."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, and very clean"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Huge place and kitchen! Everything was clean and comfortable. The locks and all controls were really nice and easy to use. There were also massage chairs.! Great spot! Ty!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a stunning space and location. Beautifully furnished and super comfortable, we had a terrific time being in the center of Spearfish in the loft. Highly recommend it!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are going to spend some time in Spearfish or in the larger Black Hills area, Tracy's place is just perfect. Everything you need (restaurants, coffee, grocery, drinks) is literally a block or two away. The building is a restored historic landmark building and it perfectly balances old charm with new conveniences. It's very secure and very quiet for sleeping.
Only comment to make is that you do need to climb a floor of stairs to get to the apartment in case this is an issue for you. It was not for us but maybe would be for some older visitors."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing little gem, very clean and easy access. One of the best air bnb experiences I’ve had….also great restaurants in the area!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location, had everything we needed."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Conveniently located downtown for coffee , food and shopping! Modern amenities that made our stay easier! Loved the wooden floors and the massage chairs! Definitely a great choice when exploring the town of Spearfish and taking in the scene! We would recommend this downtown loft location to any of our friends and family!"
2021-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Overall great location and modern updated furnishings downtown near shops and restaurants. Good communication with host.
Downsides: Very steep stairs to second floor, no laundry and no bath sundries so bring your own."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,You will not find it more accommodating host or convenient place in Spearfish. We loved it! Very clean.. Very hip.. Would definitely recommend
2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is a beautifully renovated upper flat.
Everything is as pictured and described. If you do not like stairs, this is not for you. To me it was worth it….the Historical building was just amazing. And the view to the Street was so great!
Thank you Tracy we hope visit again soon."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Tracy’s loft was the perfect place for my family to stay. It was a unique location in a fun area and we couldn’t have loved it more. Highly recommend!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"LOVE It!!! The place exceeded my expectations; specious, well decor, kitchen was fully equiped for cooking my own meals if i wished (and I did). Tracy was a great host, available to answer any questions and promtly! I also had fun during Downtown Friday Night festival on Main Street. The place is located walking distance from a grocery store and a number of eateries. Fun times!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Superb host and property. Communication from start to finish was excellent and the check-in/check-out process was efficient and simple. The property was immaculate and the overall experience was fantastic. A+ host!
2021-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Tracy's place is a lovely and I believe the best available spot in Spearfish. I appreciated the very easy self check-in. While there is no designated space, parking for us was quite easy -- we arrived on a Friday afternoon, a spot was available in front of the apartment and due to our time of arrival, we didn't need to move the car after the two hour time limit. The bed was very comfortable and the shades do a great job of blocking out the light. You are in downtown Spearfish (adorable!), overlooking the main street and there is traffic noise. However, the thoughtfully provided fan provides the white noise needed to make sleeping easy. I appreciate the high quality linens for the extra mattress or couch -- my daughter was very comfortable. The photos represent the apartment very accurately. Rugs would go a long way in making the space cozier and there are only two (mismatched) wine glasses."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location!!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I would highly recommend this apartment. It is very spacious, clean and near to a lot of attractions. There was a little noise from the street traffic, but Tracy had a fan available in apartment that helped block out noise. We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loft was clean, super cute and in a great location!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just a really nice and spacious apartment. Clean, well appointed, and fantastic location. Tracy and her husband were great and very responsive to our questions. Super recommendations for food and local things to do. We’ll be back for sure!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place and a great location.
2021-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Adorable loft. Great location! Very clean.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exceptional clean, comfortable loft. The parking was a bit inconvenient but manageable. Tracy was extremely responsive and accommodating. Highly recommend."
2021-06-01,4,Stayed about a week,"The studio was big, clean, had lot's of useful stuff and located near everything we could want. We loved Spearfish. It's a great little town with great restaurants, shops and friendly people. Tracy was super responsive and very friendly. Thank you!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, secure, and clean! It was perfect for my stay!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is so cute and cozy! Right off main street and so easy to navigate getting to and getting into the place with the directions. Tracy was so helpful and kind. I would definitely recommend. The only advise I have is that it is on the second floor of the building so you do have to take stairs up to the apartment, so if you or anyone you are staying with has a disability, getting up the stairs might be challenging. But the stairs weren’t an issue. So clean and perfect! Highly recommend!!!!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place!!! Location is perfect.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Simple, clean, and easy to check in and out of! Everything an Airbnb should be!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great Main Street location in the upstairs of a historic building! Perfect for our needs
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family stayed at Tracy's charming loft for one night during our cross-country drive, and it was awesome! The loft is beautiful, stylish, and well considered, and the downtown Spearfish location is great— less than a block away from a wonderful natural food store (Good Earth), a yummy Italian restaurant (Nonna's Kitchen), and a fantastic breakfast/coffee/tea spot (Blackbird Espresso). Our daughter slept on the pull-out sofa, and I was happy to discover it had a much nicer mattress than the average sleeper. We also loved having a bathtub and a comfy king bed. All in all, it was a very enjoyable stay, and I cannot imagine a better spot in Spearfish (though I am sure her other loft is just as lovely). Thanks, Tracy! :)"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful Loft! It was the perfect place to rest after seeing the sights. So clean, perfect location, and kitchen supplies available. Tracy and Nathan were so awesome and very responsive."

Thoughtful touches throughout. Well equipped kitchen.Spotless."

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and location !
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This downtown apartment is cute as it can get. Old hardwood floors, great windows overlooking Main Street, full functional kitchen and cozy bedroom. We loved the space and the location. If you stay here, make sure to check out The Atomic Pizza Cafe right across the street (unbelievable pizza) and the cozy coffee shop -Common Grounds- one block up. We will stay here again. Will be our “go to” place to stay while in Spearfish."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Better than expected! We wish we would've have booked the loft for our entire stay in the Black Hills and made it our basecamp. If you stay in, the loft is super comfy and a great space to hang out in. If you venture out, you have lots of fun options in within a two block radiance, including restaurants, shops, ice cream, grocery and a brewery."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a perfect getaway located in the heart of my most favorite city in the Black Hills ♥️ Tracy’s home oozes charm- the perfect balance of historic and modern aesthetics.

2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,great loft
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"ATTENTION: Only stay at this place if you want to be absolutely blown away by an incredibly charming and characteristic apartment overlooking the quaint Main Street Spearfish has to offer. In terms of location, this place is exactly where you want to be: walking distance to cafes, bars, parks, etc. This was a very secured apartment, exceptionally up-to-date & modern while at the same time, rustic with some unique character. The tall ceilings and huge windows gave this 2nd story apartment a great open, airy feeling (don't worry, the beautiful windows had black-out shades if you are wanting some seclusion). Everything was remarkably clean and it felt very comfortable. I honestly don't believe I could ever speak highly enough for this place. If you EVER have the chance to book this place in the Black Hills, DO IT! Thanks again Tracy!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The east loft was comfortable and had everything needed for a great visit to Spearfish. The location was ideal for taking advantage of the downtown amenities.

2020-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay in downtown Spearfish. Really nice loft apartment with all the modern touches in a beautiful historic building.

2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This loft was truly such a beautiful space! It was in a perfect location right in the heart of downtown and literally a block away from our favorite coffee shop Blackbird! We booked super last minute and Tracy had everything ready to go within minutes of us booking and only a few hours before our arrival! There was a minor problem with the heat and Tracy was so quick to come and fix it and made sure we had other heat sources at our disposable. We spend quite a bit of time in the Black Hills each year and can honestly say that this is one of the nicest Airbnb options for the area and we would 100% stay again!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing and beautiful AIR BNB! Tracy & Nathan the owners helped me surprise my girlfriend with an incredible engagement proposal! I couldn’t have hoped for a better experience with such a spectacular view of downtown Spearfish!

It was super clean , modern touches while keeping it historic and cozy! We loved it so much we extended our stay for an extra month. We loved being able to shop at the cutest boutique right below us called 2BG so much fun stuff as well as walk to our favorite coffee shop Common Grounds. We will definitely be back especially at such an affordable price point.. definitely worth every dollar!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved staying at the Downtown Loft East. It’s such a perfect location, surrounded by adorable local shops,
amazing restaurants and very close to the beautiful Spearfish City Park. Tracy and Nathan are incredible hosts and they thought of the smallest details to make our stay very comfortable...from the biggest and softest towels to the cutest coffee mugs made by a local artist. If you’re looking for charming spot in Spearfish, this Loft won’t disappoint. We definitely found our new favorite place to stay at!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the place to stay when you are looking for history and peaceful comfort. The home is amazing! The ladies who manage and take care of things are superior and so responsive to issues. You can't go wrong here. We keep coming back because it is so good.

2024-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,This newly wed couple had just moved back to town and needed a peaceful welcoming home like place to recover from their months of struggles.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an amazing getaway! As a travel destination or a local night away with a significant other. I was in the rose room, and I could not have been happier. even the period type sink was in the bathroom next to the modern option. The bed was also amazing to sleep in. everything was clear to still be able to use the hot tub!! I would definitely stay again. The owners are wonderful and very friendly. could be rented for groups of 6 or couples."
2024-01-01,4,Stayed one night,"Sonya was a great communicator and her place is a true gem. The rose room does heat up in the winter since it is a beautiful historic home, but Sonya gave us permission to crack the windows which helped a lot! The hot tub and amenities alone made it worth our trip! Thank you & happy new year!!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spent four peaceful nights in the Secret Garden's Rose Room. I came alone to explore the Northern Black Hills, and the Secret Garden in Spearfish was the perfect base. I wanted a quiet and comfortable room with private bath. The Rose Room was perfect as it is upstairs facing away from the back garden, so very quiet. It has a large private bathroom with a sink, toilet, tub and shower. Plenty of towels. Big comfy bed and a big couch. There is even a little gas fireplace! No ceiling fan but there is an A/C unit which kept things nice and cool. The host Sonya was awesome! There is no curfew. Bicycles are available (I chose to walk). After my first night I discovered I was the only guest in the house...it was nice walking around in my (provided) bathrobe! I enjoyed using the extremely well-stocked kitchen to make breakfast and dinner. Each room has designated space in the refrigerator. The hot tub was CLEAN and HOT!! Really enjoyed my stay, recommended!!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our time here was limited so having a clean, comfortable environment was appreciated. The modern decor and placement of rooms made for a comfortable stay. The pictures we saw were an exact match of what we saw when we entered. The only downside, which is out of control of the host, is the traffic on the street can be a bit obnoxious at times. We will look to rent again when we are in the area!
Thank You!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Property was very clean and beautiful. Great experience. Will stay again.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was Awesome. the location from the BHSU game was great and we just walked to the game. The place inside was beautiful and I would recommend to anyone. I've stayed and many Airbnb's and the place ranks right at the top.
We had three couple and all were very happy! Thanks Michael for a wonderful time."
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"Such a beautiful, clean space! Perfect location near BH campus. Access to a garage is a plus. Landlords are super responsive and kind. Will definitely be staying again in the future!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was exactly as listed and clean, comfortable along with perfect location. Would 100% book again!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful rental! It was very modern, spacious and comfortable. A lovely surprise was the thoughtful and creative rental guide book they provided. It cleared up any questions we would have had and gave us information on the artwork in the apartment. AND it provided suggestions for places to visit in the spearfish area… something very helpful for those unfamiliar with the town. We will most definitely stay here again!"
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,Loved this place! Everything was great!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place!!!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Highly recommended.
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"John Michael is truly the type of host you wish you can find every time on AirBNB. His communication as we planned our stay was thoughtful and timely and it’s obvious that great love and care was put into the renovation of this space. The loft has the look and feel like a modern high-end hotel suite, we really enjoyed all it had to offer.
Thank you John Michael!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a new and very clean property. It is very homey and comfortable and spacious, especially the bedrooms. However, be prepared to haul your things up about 20 stairs to get to the main floor. We were a family of 6 adults with a 2 year old and it was plenty of room and it is close to everything. The amenities are great and we had all the comforts of home. We would definitely book this property again."
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very pleasant stay. The condo is very clean, comfortable, well stocked, and nicely decorated. It's well located to anything you might want to do in town. It's also a quick drive to any highway you might need to access. Located on a rather busy corner, the traffic noise is not too bothersome once you're inside, and I'm very sensitive to that type of noise. All in all, a great option for travelers preferring 3 bedrooms."
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,This place is so beautiful and so tastefully decorated. They thought of everything!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This Airbnb is fantastic. The location is relaxing and convenient. The cleanliness is beyond clean, and it is very comfortable. We were so happy with this home away from home for our family. Thank you!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely place, perfect for our group of 4. Clean and bright. The beautiful art photography by a local artist is delightful. A perfect place to stay in Spearfish!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place for our family to stay on a Black Hills vacation. Even better than the pictures. Accommodating host.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Best AirBnB we've stayed in! The layout was fantastic, the rooms were all nicely decorated and comfortable. The personalized book with recommendations of things to do was an especially thoughtful touch!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful property. Fantastic location close near all the things you need and about an hour from all the things you want to see in the Black Hills from Devils Tower to Custer State Park. The D. B. Booth fish hatchery is very close by and we strongly recommend visit there. If we are ever going to be in Spearfish again we will be booking here. Thank you so much for a lovely location to call home for a few days.
2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay. Your place is convenient located, clean, and nicely decorated. We missed having chairs to sit out on the patio. You have a great place and you are a friendly and helpful host. I know you will thrive in this business."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This spot is perfect for a Spearfish stay. It was incredibly clean and perfectly cozy - a beautiful and easy-to-find stay. John Michael was very helpful, quick to respond. Thanks so much!"

2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is a great place to stay. The location is convenient. The rooms were spacious and clean. The neighborhood was quiet. You would not regret staying here! We will come back.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This is one of my favorite places to stay when we need a quick get away. Absolutely love the space Cappie has created! ❤️
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great setting, and a perfect spot for an extended weekend"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We love to stay at Cappie’s for a little staycation in the hills. It’s quiet and comfortable and never disappoints!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"very unique and beautiful, friendly hosts"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Granny Flats is not your typical Airbnb - it makes an impression. The house was incredibly unique and cozy. It’s amazing to be in the middle of town, in your own oasis. Cappie and Candace were incredibly responsive and kind. I’ve stayed in Airbnb’s around the world, and this was my favorite. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a slice of zen. Love it!!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was absolutely a one of a kind stay. Beautiful place, well-kept and clean. Hosts were responsive and welcoming!
We loved the atmosphere too. The sauna is also one of a kind! We would love to return."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place to stay. Would definitly go back. The sauna is incrediable. The house was super clean. Very nice shower, the wood burner to heat is a nice touch. The place was super easy to find and easy to get to."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was so perfect! We took advantage of the location and were able to walk to one of the local trails. The woodstove was a new experience for us, so naturally we had questions, and we received a very quick response. The rental was exactly as advertised and exactly what we were looking for. Next time we visit Spearfish, we're hoping this rental is available again. Awesome house and awesome host!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Took my girlfriend for a Valentine’s Day retreat and it exceeded my expectations! Will be returning.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Felt relaxing being in the home built with natural materials. The building temperature is surprisingly consistent, and the wood burning stove was easy to use and created a nice atmosphere. The huge cave-like sauna was a nice bonus, in addition to the great home and interesting property."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay highly recommended
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cappie’s pace is a bucolic respite. The hay bale cottage takes you back to a warmer, cozier time-(the efficient woodstove of course adds to that atmosphere). The neighborhood is quiet yet a five minute drive to town. It was a perfect home base for exploring the Black Hills. We will be recommending the cottage to friends and family."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place! Thank you!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This cottage was absolutely lovely. Such a nice little retreat within Spearfish. Cappy and his team were great as well, always quick to respond and eager to help."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing cabin, grounds, and hosts! Everything looked just the like pictures on the post and lived up to our expectations. Only issue we had was the hot water not working. After a quick message to the hosts it was resolved a couple hours later. No fuss! Would stay again for sure!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Booked a stay here for a few days after getting married, and liked it so much that we extended the trip! We were here in December, and had an extremely cozy time no matter the weather. The house is beautiful and handbuilt in very thoughtful ways, and is a beautifully warm space. I'd recommend this to anyone wanting to stay in Spearfish!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My favorite place to be. Can’t wait to come back!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean, private, and peaceful! Check-in was very easy. Comfortable stay, we had everything we needed."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was looking for a unique stay to celebrate my husband’s birthday. This house exceeded my expectations. I would highly recommend this house. Easy check-in, easy check-out and private and quiet location."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The natural materials cabin was so beautiful and homey. Perfect for a couples weekend. The furniture was all very comfortable and at 7 months pregnant, I slept amazing! We would definitely recommend this place to others."
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The place was as described and was extremely comfortable. The wood burning stove in the evenings worked extremely well. it is a great location to visit and explore the local area. Everything worked well.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at this off grid gem. What a unique location and property. I stayed here for two nights with my two kids. We were so comfortable and had plenty of room to enjoy some off grid time. We explored the walking trails and some of the local attractions. We can’t wait to come back!
The property -
Amazing unique construction with so many fun design ideas. You can tell a lot of efforts went into building this one bed cabin. We enjoyed the rocket ship treehouse, visiting the chickens, and exploring the property. Don’t worry about the toilet - it’s super simple and my 4yr old had no problems.
Location -
What a unique location. You feel like your out of town on a farm but your close enough to walk to restaurant or gas station.
Hosts -
The hosts are top notch, very timely responses to questions and always very helpful
We can’t wait to come back
Thank you!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,love our off-grid experience here! everything felt clean and inviting and Cappie was super responsive to any type of questions I had!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Very great host! Very great place to stay! Host went above and beyond!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Was looking for something a little different for a trip without the kids this time. The house was fun to explore and filled with funky design elements. Exploring the grounds and seeing the rocketship treehouse was a giant bonus. Had one question that needed a response while we were there. It was answered almost immediately and the issue was quickly resolved. Really comfortable bed. Would highly recommend if off-grid as a concept is at all of interest to you.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were pleased with the cleanliness and the surrounding area. A great place to start our adventures.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing place to settle down for the night. Such a unique experience. Must stay.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay. The home was exactly as advertised. Cappie and Candace took care of any questions very quickly. What an interesting and unique place! Like other visitors we only wish we could have stayed longer!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Even though we were only here one night, it was the perfect little getaway. Very unique and loved the sustainable features!"
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay while in Spearfish! Couple things to note though, the compost toilet is very uncomfortable for larger people (I’m 6’2” about 190lbs) and that the bathroom is not a separate room from the rest of the unit. There is no door and the bathroom walls don’t go up to the ceiling. Also got quite warm inside as rules state AC is not to be run after 3pm"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,I’ve stayed here a couple times and I loved it each time. For me it’s worth the money each time.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing how you are in town but feel completely out of town … freaking awesome place..
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This off grid cottage was a dream! It was private yet still right in town. There is a walking path to coffee shops, restaurants, farm stands and breweries. The property was gorgeous with a creek, gardens, chickens and artistic touches. I absolutely loved waking up to the sunrise out my bedroom window each morning! I will certainly be back and encourage all my friends who travel to Spearfish to stay at Cappie's!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,What a lovely place!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,No words to describe how amazing this property is. A true gem. Can’t wait to come back
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This homestead was such a peaceful, private, playful, and unique place to stay. We loved the build and warm aesthetic of the interior (the shower, kitchen, and bed were incredible), as well as the expansive 3 acre property. The sauna was so charming and easy to use, we heated it up and took a dip in the river afterwards - it felt incredible! We loved waking up to a horse grazing in the pastor and watching all the colorful chickens, not to mention seeing a couple deer hanging out. This was an awesome Airbnb and we highly recommend booking!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable off grid home. We had a very pleasant stay and enjoyed our time there!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The hay bale construction of the cottage makes it a unique place to stay. The finish details of the construction and the decor is great. The cottage is very well insulated and quiet. The off grid aspect was easy to utilize. Cappie was very welcoming and available. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend the cottage.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Very peaceful place. Enjoyed the creek through the property and proximity to the bike path.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great couples retreat, very peaceful."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Just beautiful. The sauna was amazing.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Incredible space and amazingly quiet even though you are right in town.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"one of our highlights during our road trip, beautiful and quiet place, surrounded by nature and very quiet private space. The place is extremely unique but also environmentally friendly, the owner and staff are well considered and responsive, I wish I have more time to stay few more days there."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Honestly, this was the coolest airbnb I’ve ever stayed in and I’ve stayed all over the country. A hidden gem, the compostable toilet was an experience, and the shower felt amazing. The bed is super comfortable and the surrounding property is just absolutely stunning.
Definitely check out the creek & it’s little man made pool, it’s a little chilly but very cool! & the treehouse is jaw dropping as well. Many things on the property to interactive with, don’t forget to say hi to the chickens.
My only regret is that we weren’t able to spend more time here. It’s truly a magical place."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had some car trouble, but Cappie was very understanding as we got in unfortunately late. The space is amazing! and all the great things to explore on the property are well worth it. A highlight of our trip. My only complaint is we couldn't stay longer!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay. We definitely will recommend this place to any of our friends traveling in that direction. It had a nice homey feel with personal touches that was a breath of fresh air compared to the cookie cutter airbnbs that are all too common now. It was one of the cleanest airbnbs we've ever stayed in too! Great central location for the hikes we had planned for the second half of our trip.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful property and overall nice stay. Only spent one night but definitely would be back!
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The host were great. We were confused and misunderstood that the soaking tub is not a man madehot tub, or we wouldn't have traveled as far out of our way to stay because that was one of the main reasons we did. Overall it's a very nice place."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,beautiful space that we were able to relax at and unwind. would definitely stay again!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome place and host! Always wanted to stay in a off grid home and this one was perfect. Thank you!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely, quiet place with a beautiful view. We loved the vibe of this place-it felt calm and was a great place to relax and disconnect yet very close to downtown and easy to get to the canyon. I was nervous about the composting toilet, but don't worry-it's fine! Communication and response to the few questions we had was quick. We will come back!"
2023-06-01,4,Stayed one night,Place was very interesting. The toilet was a bit noisy but liveable.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful and unique place. Would not hesitate to stay there again. So comfortable. Thanks Cappie for opening up your home!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place with plenty to do. River pool and sauna combination makes me wish we had longer! Treehouse and grilling in the yard. Very good time!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a unique, amazing place stay! Loved our experience and stay! Town also had great food and breweries close to the property."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cappie's place was a unique and eco-friendly experience tucked away at the end of a private street. The house construction and all the amenities are fully sustainable and he was very helpful in getting me settled in for the weekend. I will definitely choose this location again when visiting Spearfish, SD. A++ experience."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Very cozy and it was the perfect size for 2 people :)
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great experience! Beautiful house and very central to skiing resorts. House is central in a small town but the house is located very privately. The house gives a great 90s decore vibe and we loved it. Sauna was a great experience too. Perfect place for a weekend stay.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had such an enjoyable stay at the cottage. I would definitely revisit.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a great stay! Would recommend to anyone! Spearfish was such a fun area and I would’ve loved to spend more time there! I was just passing through for a night. Much to do and such a unique place to stay.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place is perfect, it had been on my bucket list for a couple of years and we were finally able to make it happen. Cappie's description is 100 percent correct. If you read it all the way through and are still intrigued about staying, do so, the craftsmanship of the cottage is incredible and so interesting. All of the little details inside and out make you appreciate it even more. Such a neat place to unwind or rewind. We will definitely be back to stay, we loved it all. He is an excellent host and super thorough and very accommodating!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved our stay at Cappie's cabin!!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cappie was very responsive and helpful We enjoyed the unique cottage and the privacy it offered!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the most unique place me and my boyfriend have ever stayed. The home was absolutely beautiful and it being off the grid made it even better.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely amazing stay. So unique and Cappie was an excellent host. The cottage was cozy when we arrived, fire blazing in the hearth. Secluded and quiet. Very peaceful and Cappie even scooped our walk for us in the morning. We love Spearfish and there’s always so many cool things to do and fun things to find."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is the coolest house ever -- stay here!
We had the pleasure of staying during the winter and were pleasantly surprised by how warm and cozy the home was.
The interior was gorgeous and the craftsmanship was top notch.
The wood burning stove, solar power, and option to compost our trash was immensely appreciated.
Staying in this home was inspiring and has you leave with the thought -- why can't all homes be like this? They certainly should be.
On top of it, Cappie was a fantastic and accommodating host. Seriously, if you are looking for a place to stay, this is it."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was a great way to learn about being off grid! Had a peaceful time together as a couple. The sauna was amazing and very well worth the wait for the time it takes to get started! The owner cappie was very helpful and we got to chat with him for a bit and learn a lot about the cottage we stayed in! Highly recommend it was a beautiful place to be!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Cappie’s home was one of the coolest places we have ever stayed! Pure genius and simplicity went into the creation of the straw bale construction and off grid setup. Everything was comfortable and convenient while remaining quite stylish. We loved our stay and will highly recommend it to anyone else!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing cottage!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We go out of our way to find AirBNBs that practice sustainability when we can, and this place is certainly that! So many amazing and beautiful features we wish we had more time to enjoy them all. Really appreciated the headed mattress as it was a chilly night!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"inspirational surroundings. ease and simplicity of getting in an out. wonderful wood stove and cozy bed nook. take your time, breath and enjoy. highly recommend."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cappie’s place is extremely welcoming, cozy, and unique. I would recommend it to anyone looking to stay in the area. Perfet for couples or solo adventurers. It was perfect for my husband and me!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A place you won’t stay in again and again! Close to everything you need food and drinks just around the corner! We will be back to stay again when we are in the area!!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very responsive to messages. Thanks for a great stay!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We couldn't have enjoyed it more! We especially liked roasting s'mores on the outdoor fire pit, and staying cozy at night with the wood stove."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place in Spearfish!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Just as advertised. Super comfy bed! Dark skies with stars for days! Hubs loved it! Was a great overnight after a long day of driving!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a cute house and a fun experience staying off the grid
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Probably the cleanest Airbnb we've stayed at.
It was quiet and private even though it is in a residential area."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super cool spot, and Cappie is a great host. Would absolutely stay again!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a beautiful, unique place! Such a surprise to have this located within city limits! Directions were clear and easy to follow. The grounds were beautiful and offered us a peaceful place to stay."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks so much !
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing place, will definitely stay and recommend again"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We would highly recommend this place to stay if you are visiting Spearfish. This house is so unique and very comfortable! Make sure and spend some time in the hammock in the creek if you can! We had everything we needed and felt right at home. we were close to beautiful sites and delicious restaurant options. Recommendations are given as well which is very helpful. Thank you so much for letting us enjoy this great place!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best Air Bnbs we’ve stayed at, and we’ve stayed at quite a few. What a great place. Amazing comfort and amenities, especially for off-grid. It’s obvious Cappie has put a lot of thought and artistry into this place."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little of the grid home! Very comfortable!
Amazing secret little creekside getaway!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We had a pleasant stay, very clean, cozy and comfortable. It was super hot while we were there and the A/C worked great. Comfy bed and sitting area, we enjoyed the privacy of the yard too. I even saw a deer in yard one afternoon. Our hosts had great communications and provided a safe, comfortable environment."
2022-07-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Nice cabin! Around the bed could use a good deep cleaning. Solar panel energy is ok but when its 90s and you want to run the ac a lot it uses up all the energy. Gets pretty hot in the bedroom at night time.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"View was amazing, host was very kind!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Everyone about this stay was wonderful! Highly recommend staying here and taking a dip in the creek on a hot day!!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pictures do not do this incredible home justice. The moment you pull up, you will be amazed! Choosing an off the grid home that is completely independent and self-sustsinable, we had no idea what to really expect. Well, this home does not disappoint to give you a location to enjoy all of the Black Hills, and every luxury you are used to. The shower is amazing. It is huge with two shower heads, endless hot water, and makes you feel like you are liberated without a shower door. After long days exploring and hiking, we enjoyed taking a dip in the water hole, made bonfires under beautiful stars and even watched a movie.
If you are lucky, you will get to meet the talented and truly amazing, Cappie. Talking to him was one of our highlights. He is so attentive to make sure your stay is comfortable and you have all you need. Plus, he genuinely builds relationships with those around him.
We are amazed with the craftsmanship of the home and every detail put in! It was such a great trip. This place will not disappoint."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a nice little stay, that provided a relaxing get away."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is our second time at Cappie's place driving cross country from seattle to Minneapolis and we highly recommend it! We absolutely love this place!
It's just so cool- such a unique structure that's creative, cozy, comfortable and well laid out. The bed is suuuper comfortable! The home is so well designed, clean and decorated. The place has a fun funky vibe and is perfect for two people to unwind and relax in a beautiful space! Be sure to experience it for yourself!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"10 out of 10 RECOMMEND to anyone!!
This was one of the best experiences I’ve had whilst renting Airbnb’s - the host is extremely friendly and a great resource for the best spots in Spearfish and they have truly thought of everything!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Staying at this off-the-grid spot was an absolute treat. The cabin was beautiful and clean, just like the pictures. No complaints about this place! We explored the property. The cabin itself sits in a small field and across the creek there is another AirBnb owned by the same folks. Both places share access to the creek, treehouse and outdoor sitting area. I will definitely stay here again, we were sad to leave!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This has been one of our fave places to stay. Great layout for a couple and very convenient location to Town, Spearfish Cr. and adjacent to the park/trials. You can't beat sustainable living and we wish there were more places like this on Airbnb."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic hosts (and humans).
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Excellent communication, clean, perfect location, solar worked perfect, first time using a compost toilet and actually preferred it over a standard toilet, will be staying again! Loved our experience, wouldn’t change a thing."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,This was our first time to stay in an “off-the-grid” Airbnb. The architecture & construction materials of this cottage were so interesting. We found it to be a very comfortable place to come home to after all-day sightseeing & motorcycle rides. We loved it & the beautiful town of Spearfish too! Denise & Ed Davis
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Spent our honeymoon here and absolutely loved this place!!! Such a unique stay!
2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay! It was clean, well-kept, and on a beautiful piece of property that is fairly secluded (though not as much as some of the pictures may suggest). The hosts were very communicative and offered suggestions of events that were happening. The binder of info they provided about the cottage and the town was useful and informative. Overall it was a very pleasant visit!
There is one thing that was enough of a problem to warrant the 4 stars. If you are at all sensitive to noise, the fan on the compost toilet is loud enough that you hear it everywhere in the cabin (at least when I stayed in June 2022). You can even hear it while watching TV. It made it difficult to fall asleep because it is not pleasant. It was a relief when the fridge would kick on and drown out the noise in a more pleasant sound.
Another note is if you do go in the swimming hole, it is shared or right on the border with another property (which I believe they also rent out). That's fine by me but not well represented."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Located in town, yet very private and quiet. Great communication with the host.
It was fun watching the animals from the windows and exploring the grounds. Very comfortable bed. Place was clean and had everything you would need! Really cool property, would stay again!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you’re looking for somewhere to stay in this area, look no more! This is hands down the best, most comfy and cozy home to stay in. It’s the perfect retreat from a long day of travel. Just book it! You won’t regret it!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We can’t say enough good things about our stay at this cottage. Amazingly welcoming and had everything we needed, from nice shampoo/conditioner/soap to a sweet fire pit outside. The house binder even had dinner and coffee recommendations. It was a bit too chilly to take a dip in the swimming hole but I’m sure that would’ve been lovely as well. Callie and Emily know how to host a great Airbnb"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a unique and fun experience. As a city girl, I’ve never stayed anywhere with such character and practicality. Everything we needed was supplied and we enjoyed sitting outside each evening watching the deer and rabbits."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This location was absolutely beautiful! The space was amazing and just outside of Spearfish's Main St. A perfect location with beautiful views and lots of wildlife.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We would definitely rent this off grid home again. It was peaceful and minimal which allowed our spirits to rest and rejuvenate. You won’t be disappointed by the beautiful view by staying in this rental. Thanks again!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to relax and unwind. Amazing hosts, great location. Everything was perfect. Off the grid isn't for everyone but for those that can appreciate it, the attention to detail is amazing, felt so comfortable that I booked an extra night. Thanks."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed at Cappie’s for our 10 yr anniversary. The place was clean and cozy. We loved the wood fire place, which kept the place warm even though high winds and snow. The location was really great, just being on the edge of spearfish with great access to restaurants. Would definitely stay here again!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Best Airbnb yet!
Unique custom house that is tastefuly decorated. Quiet yet close to town.
Cappie provided quick helpful communication. Wood burning stove was novel and put out good heat. I wish I could move the house as I would book it every time I travel."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The best AirBnb I’ve stayed at.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the joys of travel is getting to stay in places that you would never otherwise have a chance to try living in, and this location is that to a tee. This place is an experience unlike any I have ever had, from the floor up (literally; even the adobe flooring was a new experience for me!). Not only is the location fun and interesting—Spearfish is the perfect combination of ""small enough to enjoy"" and ""large enough to have some conveniences""—but the building itself is a joy to stay in. It's design is rustic and interesting, but it does not sacrifice in comfort anywhere, from the spacious shower (with ample hot water) to the luxurious bed. If you're anywhere in the area, you owe it to yourself to spend a night or two here and just experience a different way of living."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Very cool and unique!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is our 3rd stay and as always, we loved it. Amazing house and perfect location for our travels!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fascinating, super cool space! Responsive, informative hosts. It was quite an experience staying there even if only for one night. Check it out!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place to stay at and a great location!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a unique little place! Very fun place to stay in the hills, we loved it!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything is as stated. Very well done and quite cozy. Toilet will be a surprise even though we were warned but worth the stay!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cappie did an incredible job with this place! My brother and I had a great time exploring the black hills and loved coming back to have a fire in the wood stove or fire pit at night. This is the spot to stay in Spearfish!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very nice place, would highly recommend!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely and unique stay! We were so pleased and we had a wonderful Valentine's Day. Thanks so much.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing place all from the art to the sustainability to how fun the whole process is! Would love to come back
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is gorgeous. The bed is sooo comfortable & the house stayed super warm with the wood burning stove. WiFi worked great for movie nights. Only heads up I would give is the bathroom has no doors & the walls do not go all the way up to the ceiling. So you have to be pretty comfortable with the people you’re traveling with. Other than that, it was a gorgeous place that made for a perfect stay. Would 100% recommend."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is so insanely cool!!!! So unique, a great location, the hosts are amazing. 1000/10!!!!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,A truly quiet and comfortable home. Everything was supper clean. The bed dreamy comfortable. Clear instructions provided on the different aspects of working with this off grid home made our stay relaxing.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Thank you so much for allowing us to stay at your place. It created such a beautiful memory for my daughter's 16th birthday 🙏
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is hands down the best airbnb I have every stayed at! So many little details are fully thought out that it all adds up tp be an absolutely amazing place to stay! I found myself able to genuinely relax and unwind in this home. Not only that, but the bedding was so comfortable I found it online to buy it for when I'm home as well! Over all, no detail is ignored and I could not recommend this place more highly. The hosts are extremely communicative and kind, it makes staying here so comfortable!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Staying here was such a delight! My boyfriend and I love new experiences and while this place has all the amenities of a regular house it also has so many unique features! It’s conveniently located in town, but when you’re on the property it feels like you are out of town! It’s so quiet and the best of both worlds! Not only is the house amazing, but the wood fired sauna and tree house are such cool bonuses!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,I wasn’t able to stay due to a last minute family emergency but the pictures of the space looked amazing and the communication prior was great.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"No curtain or door for the bathroom felt a little odd - so as long as you are comfortable with your travel partners, this otherwise was an amazing place! We stayed plenty warm with the wood burning stove even on cold winter nights."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is absolutely stunning! The little details in the construction took our breath away. Cappie’s place is cozy, snug, and the perfect stay."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome place! Loved it! Had lots of laughs about the shitter!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is worth the trip to South Dakota just to stay in it. Everything is thought of - everything about the house is clever and unique, and they take the time to show you how to use everything. There are a couple of really cool amenities that I don't know if the hosts want announced publicly yet so I'll keep it to myself, but let's just say it's an outdoor/nature paradise, and you'll be pleasantly surprised in a lot of ways"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"The cabin was perfect for my wife and I’s little weekend get away. It’s secluded, yet still close enough to town and all its amenities. The cabin is one of a kind, once we spent 10 minutes exploring the cabin we felt at home there. It was very cozy, the well thought out. It had everything we needed, the fireplace kept us nice and warm. Communication was great, very fast replies. The provided local coffee was great as well. Thank you!
It was also cool to learn a little bit about Cappie, and his involvement in the community. We found the Termesphere downtown, and gave the gears a spin. Then had to look it up and learn more about it."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location, beautiful cabin and the sauna is such a lovely bonus. Cappie is a wonderful host. We can’t wait to come back!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,The place is an oasis. It’s a neat experience for folks who want to try something unique and a kind of coming home for people who love truly love the earth and sustainability. So many thoughtful details the home just FEEL better. The king size bed was luxurious and I slept like a baby. I love the moonlight pouring in through the window all night. Highly recommend. I might even move in ;)
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay while visiting the Black Hills! Location was close, without too much ""touristy"" things. Felt like we were in the country but we were in town, close to any conveniences we needed. Cappie made the transaction super easy! The cottage was roomy and comfortable."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean and well kept. Good communication from hosts and provided everything you would need for your stay. Heated mattress pad on the bed was awesome. Only issue was that the internet was too slow for any streaming so we were unable to use the TV. Open concept leaves little privacy.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Can’t find better hospitality. Very unique house, we loved it. Wildlife all around. Had access to several areas that made our experience at Granny Flats even better. Definitely recommend. Thank you, Cappie!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time. Would love to give more stars. Such a nice inviting place. Our host was great, definitely added to the fun of our vacation. Look forward to coming back."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is private and secluded. Beautiful view. Embodies all the great qualities about Spearfish.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean, quiet, and unique! Enjoyed our stay 210%."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great unique little house for a quiet getaway. Hosts are great and we had an amazing time.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed for 5 nights, and loved every minute. The house is exactly as described, but our favorite part was the access to the creek (and swing)! The location is very convenient, and we were able to get to all the local must-see places easily. We hope to come back!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Would definitely recommend staying at Emily and Cappie’s getaway! The home is unique, the property is beautiful and we even had morning guests grazing in the yard! I loved every little detail and am grateful we chose to stay here!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location! The host and property was clean and in a excellent location!! Thank you Emily for being a great liaison as well!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome place to stay! I would definitely recommend and stay there again. Host is great!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,truly magnificent must see a one of a kind Motorcycle friendly
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great long weekend in the cabin, terrific location very friendly hosts!
Thank you!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"A very unique experience, this is one of those places that I'm definitely going to tell everyone I know about. The cabin is perfectly isolated to give you privacy, and is extremely aesthetically pleasing. Overall I highly recommend it."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,The only problem with our stay was that it wasn’t long enough. Cappie made our stay very comfortable and even took time out of his day to show us around the property and let our daughter gather eggs from the chickens. She really enjoyed the treehouse and taking a dip in the stream. We shall be back!! Thanks Cappie
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dont let the unique and sustainable features deter you, very comfortable place to stay. Private, quiet, and roomy. Super comfy bed and we left wanting to build a house like it one day! Also, it's a great location with plenty to do in and around Spearfish."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is a truly unique experience! Learning about off-grid living was so fun and eye opening. The home is clean, spacious, and well taken care of. The property has many places to sit and relax, whether in the tree house or the by the creek. Emily and Cappie are both awesome to work with! I cannot say enough positive things about this Airbnb. I highly recommend Granny Flats to anyone visiting the Black Hills area."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and unique home in a great location! Deer grazing and the creek flowing on the property were nice additions to the experience.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing place! We absolutely loved our stay here. Cappie is really nice and gave us a grand tour of the property. After we settled, we joined him for a refreshing (i.e., chilly!) dip in the water after a full day of hiking and driving. Loved everything about this place. It’s truly a gem in the Black Hills. We hope to return!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great and beautiful! <3
2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Granny Flats is peaceful & beautiful! Cappie has built a wonderful piece of heaven here on earth. The Cottage is clean and comfortable- everything about our stay was perfect! This is the best place to stay when visiting the Black Hills. We loved it :-)
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was definitely an Off The Grid experience and perfect for our honeymoon. It was cozy, and plenty of room for us to sit outside and enjoy the quiet evenings.
I like the style of the home and the handmade tree decor in the living room. It was unique! Loved it!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome place and great hosts. Super responsive and helpful.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful setting, very accommodating and friendly hosts! Flat was very clean, comfy bed, towels, etc. We enjoyed our stay, slept well and found it all charming and warm. Would definitely stay again! Great location, easy access."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed in Emily’s place for a night after a long day of traveling. The house is exactly like the pictures. It was nice to walk around the property and their is a town walking trail nearby we also enjoyed. The house was easy to find, clean and the host was great. It was a fun experience we wouldn’t have had in a hotel."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful spot! Quiet area and wonderful tour given by Cappie of the area. Definitely a place to stay, not only once, that is for sure!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"we loved this off the grid AirBnb. all th comforts of home, cozy and eco-friendly also. one of our most memorable stays thru airbnb"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"One of our favorite stays ever, and we've been to airbnb's around the globe. The off-grid house shows the amazing care with which it was built. It's also very comfortable. You will love it."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! Even though it is kinda in town, we felt like we were away from everything."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We greatly enjoyed our stay!
Very quiet location central to all of our planned adventures. Very clean and stocked with all essentials you would need. We loved the swimming hole, huge comfortable bed, electric reclining sofa, and the open walk in tile shower (I don’t think they have a picture, but it’s beautiful and big). The carport was also clutch because we experienced some of the local severe weather with hail and our rental car was protected!
I was a little worried about the compost toilet, but it did not smell at all and we were over our worry very quickly!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Came out here for a bday weekend and it came out to be extra special. The home is beautiful and unique with a feel of “traveling abroad” and views to compliment that feel. Cappie was an excellent host as well!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a welcoming and peaceful stay. The amount of care taken in building the house was impressive. The home is secluded yet nearby town so easy to get to places. Friendly and responsive owners. We'll be back!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This house is very unique. We enjoyed our story. It was peaceful and comfortable and clean.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, accurately described and very comfortable. The bed and composting toilet are quite tall so if you are older, you may have a tough time. All in all a great stay, we stayed plenty warm during lower temps with the wood stove as it’s quite efficient. Definitely recommended!!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay. Cappie’s place is clean and as described. Responses were very prompt. We really enjoyed the off the grid location.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Cappie is so inviting, such a people person, with vision!
This off the grid home was all I hoped to experience, and tucked away on a bit of unique heaven in Spearfish! 100/10
For anyone traveling, or one day hoping to live this life style, no better place to get your feet wet than at Cappies home! By no means is this roughing it! this strawbale home has all the amenities you will need, including the cuteness and cozy factors! And swapping adventures with this crew is a plus.
No disappointments!!!
Will stay again"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an awesome off-grid home! Cappie’s place is cozy, clean, unique, and set in a beautiful location with mountains right outside the windows. The hospitality was unmatched, and learning about the construction of the home was a bonus. Our stay was a much needed getaway (as a young couple looking to build off-grid in the near future). We couldn’t have had a better weekend exploring the Spearfish area and coming home to this little homestead. Highly recommended for anyone who’s not afraid of a wood stove or a composting toilet. Thanks again for everything!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Two thumbs way up! Very interesting place to stay. We loved it!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic bucolic farm! Perfect place to stay on our road trip. Lovely grounds and very kind hosts! Highly recommended.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You can tell a lot of love and hard work was put into this place. Very innovative as the house runs completely of the land and is build from natural resources. In a beautiful location secluded on their land. Make sure you take a walk to the creek and sit in the hammocks that are tied across it. Would definitely stay again!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cappie’s place lives up to every expectation! The house has an artistic, funky vibe that we loved and was immaculate. Cappie met us at check in and gave us a great tour of the grounds which were amazing! We had a ton of fun listening to his entertaining stories about the various things he’s built. This wasn’t just an air bnb rental, it was an experience we’ll never forget! Do yourself a favor and stay for at least 2 days, not just one!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was wonderful! The house was fully equipped with all that was needed for our stay. The king size bed was a bonus! The hosts were very quick to respond with questions and actually met us for a walk through upon arrival. Great place! Perfect location! Please remember to go talk to the pigs. They get very excited to have company!
Mark and Tammy"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is AMAZING! My fiancée and I were passing through on a cross country drive and stumbled upon Cappie’s place as an option not too far from Deadwood. It’s even better in person than any pictures can do justice. From the start with Cappie personally showing us the grounds and familiarizing us with the straw bale house - to the comfy king size bed and full kitchen, this experience was outstanding. I’ve stayed in many Airbnb’s over the years and have never been in such a thought provoking and well thought out, intentionally designed space. We will be back - and next time to stay for several days OFF THE GRID! 10/10 recommend - you’ll be a better person after taking a grain of what Cappie shares with you! He knows sustainability and it shows."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cappie and Rachel’s house is truly wonderful — quiet, idyllic ... and *interesting*. We’re still talking about the creek, the treehouse, the sauna and the thoughtfulness of the house. All the gold stars from us."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cappie and Rachel are a very accommodating couple, willing to work with your schedule and address your particular needs. They were quick to respond and address any concerns you had. Theirs is a very unique home, which mixed ecological conscientiousness with modern amenities. Some things, like the composting toilet and grey water requirements, seemed daunting before we arrived, but Rachel and Cappie leave detailed instructions and even supply anything out of the ordinary that you might need. Don't be afraid if this seems out of your comfort zone! It's a great experience."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We ended up staying an extra night at Cappie's place because of how much we loved it! I wrote a previous review for the first night.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cappie & Rachel's place was the perfect stop for my partner and I are on our roadtrip. The house and amenities on the property were wonderful. We felt instantly welcome on the farm, enjoying the sauna and peaceful scenery. Cappie and Rachel were quick to answer questions and give us a tour when we arrived. I cannot recommend this stay enough! The house was cozy, full of light, and showed how much thought they put into the design. The bed was extremely comfortable, the kitchen had everything we needed, and the 2 shower heads were heavenly. We would definitely stay again! Thank you both :)"
2017-12-01,5,Stayed one night,I would highly recommend staying here!!! It lived up to my expectations:-)
2017-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cappie and Rachel were warm and welcoming. I appreciated the time they spent ensuring we were comfortable in their place, showing us the ins and outs of the amenities, and making suggestions for activities in Spearfish. Granny Flats is a thoughtfully designed and sustainably built place that is as relaxing as it is modernly functional. Thank you!"
2017-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Cappie was wonderful and his place is beautiful! Was very accomidating to our needs!!
2017-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cappie's place was truly unique and in an incredibly beautiful setting. The details of the house and structure are admirable--it was like a little oasis in Spearfish. We enjoyed hearing Cappie's story behind his work and the amazing property. We sat by the creek in the morning and had coffee, enjoying the peaceful setting, what a relaxing environment."
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to escape to!
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Cappie's place was a one-of-a-kind experience. We have been interested in strawbale for awhile, so we expected the clean, quiet functionality of the house. The pleasant surprise was the other projects on the property: the cob wood-fired sauna, the water wheel and plunge in the creek, chicken yard, swing, and hammocks. Fun for all! Rachel was very prompt, informative, and welcoming in her pre-visit communications, and Cappie spent a lot of time showing us around and enthusiastically answering our natural building questions. Thanks!"
2017-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This off-the-grid Air BnB is just what Brian and I needed for a relaxing and scenic location. We enjoyed the total serenity of this location, the hammock hanging slightly over the stream was amazing, the swinging bench by the stream and the entire land layout is wonderful. I would recommend this Air BnB home to anyone who needs a peaceful, scenic spot."
2017-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This place was pretty amazing, being so close to everything while still having complete privacy was a rare location treat. We'll be back!"
2017-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The property is centrally located yet seems secluded like it's in the middle of nowhere. Incredibly comfortable bed. Cappie is very personable and recommended the most AMAZING restaurants. We were even provided some fresh eggs, which were very much appreciated, we're just not really breakfast people. We'd definitely stay there again."
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What an amazing place! Would recommend visiting! Very nice Host and truly a one of a kind experience!
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised with this cabin. The ""live green"" construction was beautiful and inspirational. Not to forget the privacy! Relax by the creek, take a dip if you're hot, nap in a hammock, sweat in the spa, jump on the trampoline or get in the car and take a short drive to everything from Devils Tower to Mt. Rushmore. With scenic hikes and breathtaking byways all around don't miss out on the perfect combination of beauty and relaxation with this place!"
2017-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a fabulous time at Cappie's. The house was very clean and had everything we needed for an enjoyable stay. The shower was awesome and the bed was super comfortable. We especially enjoyed the swing and hammock at the creek. It was a great location for exploring the Black Hills and Devils Tower. Cappie was easy to communicate with and gave us information about the house and the nearby area when we checked in. This house is truly unique and a real gem! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
2017-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful one bedroom home that is fully furnished. It's more than a house that's off the grid it's a work of art. We didn't run out of electricity (we had a lot of devices iPads iPhones etc). Hot water was perfect. When you meet Cappy to check in ask him where the locals eat for excellent restaurants. It's located in the city but you don't feel like your in the city. It's safe. It's close to a lot of major tourist attractions. Spearfish itself is really nice and is very eclectic. We were told to check out spearfish canyon and I am so glad we did. There are all these elements close by and then return to the home to freshen up. Look out the picture window late at night deer always came to visit.
Cappy and his wife are the nicest couple. Once you check in and get the tour they leave so you have privacy they are not helicopter hosts. Its also very clean and organized. I'm really glad I had this experience it's worth it."
2017-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a cool house! Everything is super conservation- and eco-friendly, cappie and Rachel are incredibly friendly and made us feel welcome in their city and their home. It's apparent that cappie is proud of his work, and for a good reason!
A warning to those who care: there is no bathroom door."
2017-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was an incredible off the grid experience. Admittedly we were coming into this expecting to compromise our needs, this was not the case at all. All the luxuries including hot water, sauna, and walk in shower with two shower heads. Bonuses included centrality to all the monuments and accommodating hosts. Our interest in sustainability and environmental consciencnous have grown considerably."
2017-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Staying in a beautiful custom home made my trip so much easier and ejoyable. The hosts accommodated me to the fullest and had the place ready quickly on short notice. Would definitely love to stay again soon!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved our stay at this cute Airbnb. Nice, new construction, nestled in the pine trees of the beautiful Black Hills. We enjoyed a cup of coffee on the patio in the morning and a cocktail by the fire in the evening. Comfortable beds and a peaceful and relaxing atmosphere made for the perfect getaway. Highly recommend!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The tiny cabin was packed with all you need, nice couch and recliner, good tv, washer and dryer, nice kitchen and comfy beds, timing didn't work out for us to get to their microbrewery and pizza business, and judging by the reviews, that was our loss!, maybe we have a reason to work spearfish into future plans. Enjoyed watching the turkeys come up from the draw in the evenings as well as the white tail and the late visiting mule deer. Thanks for hosting us, for the 2 days we were there we got the distinct impression this family doesnt let any grass grow under their feet!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,beautiful cabin with a beautiful view.

We would definitely stay here again while visiting the Black Hills."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Ali was quick to answer any questions we had and the cabin was quiet and perfect for our trip with our dogs. Lots of wildlife to enjoy and the area was beautiful.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful, private area. Needed a place to be able to let my dog walk around freely and this fit the bill. Other dogs in the area are very friendly. Had a good snow come in but they helped with clearing the snow off the porch and made sure the road was clear to get out. Was given a coupon for a free pizza at their nearby restaurant and tood advantage of that to have dinner with friends. Instructions sent by email and inside the house were clear and easy to understand. Comfortable loveseat in the living area and they provided DirectTV and a firestick so was able to relax with good entertainment in the evenings. Lots of electrical outlets made finding a place to keep electronics charged easy."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This cozy charmingly crafted cabin in the Black Hills is surrounded by horses, cattle, deer, rabbits & turkeys. So quiet & peaceful, the lack of sound is deafening. Good heaters and chillers make for comfortable temperature control."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was perfect for staying a couple nights and having good access to the Black Hills. It's a bit sparse, so wouldn't recommend planning to spend a bunch of time inside - but why would you when you have that amazing deck?
Great hosts, would stay again. Thank you!"

Outstanding communications with the host, especially as we requested the booking a bit at the last minute - only a few hours before we were due to arrive.

It had about everything we needed (kitchen didn’t have mixing bowls or a 9x13 pan so bring those if cooking!) & was so cozy!

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sweet place located close to town. Adorable and cozy, just right for the two of us. Quality linens/towels. Full kitchen thoughtfully stocked with essentials. Extra bonus was delicious pizza at their Sawyers Brewery (and good beer!) Even though their company building was on the same property, it still was extremely peaceful. Ali was great host."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A nice quiet getaway. A great place to stay, worth the trip!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great visit at Ali’s place. She was very accommodating and the surrounding area was beautiful. Loved the log cabin! Thank you!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This little cabin is the perfect abode for a couple or small group! It's a short drive into Spearfish to enjoy all that it has to offer. We enjoyed our time in the ""country"" outside of town for a little r&r. The cabin had the perfect amount of space for our little group and the amenities were new and very well kept. It was quiet, peaceful and had some great views. I highly recommend Ali's place!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you’re looking for a tranquil, cozy, country-like experience, this is absolutely the place! First of all, the little cabin is amazing and so much more spacious than it looks in the photos, and has all of the accommodations you would need - very well equipped. Welcome page is provided with great local recommendations - definitely try the pizza place/brewery that the homeowners recommend (and own, I think), it’s delicious! I think my favorite part was waking up to the sound of a rooster crowing and also the pretty black horse in the field that always walked to the fence when you come out. Will definitely be recommending to friends :)"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely wonderful little cabin surrounded by stunning views of horses, cattle and landscape. My hunny and I didn't want to leave."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Ali was an awesome host for our stay in Spearfish. This felt like a nice country getaway with the added convenience of being close to town. The cabin was clean and spacious with a full kitchen and the modern washer/dryer was a huge plus. Highly recommend if you’re looking for a place to stay in Spearfish!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an excellent stay. The beds are very comfortable, the shower has great water pressure, it was nice and cool for sleeping and has a great deck/view/chairs to sit outside and drink a glass of wine. It was nice to be able to take our dogs with. It was nice to have space to let our dogs run around a bit. They did harass the cows a bit but the cows didnt give them a second look, lol. We did check out the cabin owners brewery, Sawyer Brewery and it was outstanding. I am not a beer drinker but my partner had the beer and liked it. I had the root beer and it was great as well. We had pizza and cheese garlic bread…so good. Leftovers made for great breakfast. Would easily stay here again."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, not as tiny as you would think, it really is a little house. Enjoyed the free pizza and Spearfish is a great town."

Would highly recommend this unique cabin!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Ali has such a great place here. We would stay here anytime!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ali’s cabin was beautiful and the perfect spot to stay on our roadtrip. Everything was as described, and we were able to have a peaceful and relaxing evening.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic stay! The host was amazing and very accommodating. The cabin was perfect for us and I loved that they allowed our fur babies! Would highly recommend!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely perfect for our quick overnight stop between Badlands and Devils Tower. Disappointed we arrived late and were unable to see the true beauty in and outside until we woke up and moved on to our next destination. Enjoyed seeing a few wild turkeys and cattle gracefully grazing outside our window in the morning.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It is a great place to stay - very comfortable! -away from city but close enough to drive to stores, restaurants, etc - wasn’t aware of small pull barn in front of property from the pictures, but did not pose a problem for us - and our dog loved the room to run"

Wish it would not have been booked for next 2 nights otherwise we would have stayed longer. Owners treated us to a free pizza, which was amazing!!

2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Myself, my husband and two of his younger brothers (15&19) and our dog stayed here for 1 night on our way from Minnesota to Red Lodge. The cabin was perfect! Beds were comfy, we brought an air mattress so the boys didn't have to share and there was plenty of room in the main area. Couch is comfy, fire stick available for tv viewing, AC kept us nice and cool on a hot day, kitchen is well appointed, we made dinner at the cabin with no issues. Far enough off the highway to feel super private but only a 10 minute drive to the heart of Spearfish. We checked out the Spearfish Canyon Disc golf course and would recommend that for sure, as a non-disc golfer myself it was a really beautiful hike.
Overall we would recommend and stay again!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are wanting a place that feels ""away"" from town, but conveniently located right up the street from everything you need....this is it! The cabin was cozy, clean, and cool....even in the summer heat! We got to see wildlife and appreciate the thunderstorm even more while staying here! Communication with the owners was great as well! We'd certainly return."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re headed to spearfish do yourself a favor and stay here. Exceptionally clean, with majestic Mountain View’s. Everything you need and then some! Surrounded by horses and various wildlife. We loved every minute of our stay and have already begun planning coming back to this spot next year. Thank you Ali!"

Ryan provides enough to get you through. Kitchen supplies, coffee and other condiments were a much appreciated surprise. Quiet neighborhood close to downtown and right off the interstate makes this place the perfect little vacation spot. Don't forget your glass of wine or morning cup of Joe to sit in your own little private patio..perfection. Cleanliness is top notch and Ryan was incredibly accessible for questions.

My expectations of the place were definitely exceeded, and could imagine his AirBnB being an excellent spot for longer stays too.

We loved it and would stay there again in a heartbeat - thanks so much Chad and Cheri,
Helmut & Connie"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Chad's place was great, the pictures make the bathroom look a bit larger than it is but that's understandable with cameras. The wall AC unit struggles a bit keeping the bedroom cold but otherwise this is a great value and great place to stay in spearfish. I would definitely stay here again if we are back in the area. It is very clean, and well maintained. Check in was very easy and check out did not require a laundry list of things to be completed it was quick and easy on all fronts."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Chad's place was exactly as described. The unit was nice and clean, and all the anemities were as described. Conveniently located 'within walking distance' to area restaurants, the downtown area, and it was peaceful. Chad communicated on each question or replied to our messages right away. Meet an elderly couple in the unit beside us that was so friendly. I would recommend this place for anyone wanting a nice clean place to stay..

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Chad offers a beautiful, comfortable space that is private and easy to get to. We loved the ease of check-in and checkout. The kitchen is well stocked with needed dishes and cookware. The bed is very comfortable, as is the living room furniture. We would definitely book again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautifully decorated house! It looks like a recent remodel. Large and spacious rooms and kitchen. A few blocks from downtown Spearfish. Tight shared driveway for two cars with the unit next door.
The number pad to get in was hard to read until you touched it. Then it lit up. But it registered the number you touched, so you have to hit the right first number before it lights up. I had to take my sunglasses off to see the numbers.
There was house construction (remodeling) going on next door that started at 7:00 am. Fortunately, we were getting up early anyway.
Overall, a great place to stay in Spearfish."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved Chad’s bungalow! Chad was amazing with answering questions. Lots of places to walk to and easy to get around to places we drove to. The bed was super comfy.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our first time to spearfish and the black hills area. Absolutely loved the place, we walked to the downtown area and found it very easily accessible. The interstate is a straight shot away (like 5 minutes straight down the road) so that was really great for getting to other places we checked out in the area. The space was exactly what we needed and the value great!"

2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The location was great but the parking space was hard to navigate if their was heavy traffic on the street or if there is a guest in the connecting unit.

Very easy to get to from the interstate and a great location if you want to be close to downtown!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My sister and I were traveling together to Spearfish as we were both born there and lived for 15 years. Our goal was to see if we wanted to move there again so we looked at different areas and properties. Our AirBNB was easy to get to and close to everything. We went to a play one evening at the very historic Mathews Opera House, built in 1906. All in all we were very happy with our lodging and would stay there again."

Air-conditioner worked great as did the oven and range. Also had a beauty of a dish washer and refrigerator. I used them during our stay and had no problems with anything. Nice bathroom and shower too. Loved the shower head.
Chad was always available in case we had questions and the service we received was super. I would most definitely recommend staying in one of Chad’s Airbnb’s. We were close to downtown and the City Park is lovely. Nice walking path and could walk into the creek to cool off. If we plan another trip to Spearfish we will rent this bungalow again. Thanks for the great stay."

We will be telling our friends and family about this place."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Chad’s place is very comfy and well appointed. The town of Spearfish is lovely. Had everything we needed for our time in the northern part of the Black Hills. Some other reviews mention that the walls are thin between units- true. Not terrible but should be on your radar if that concerns you. Really enjoyed our stay!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Really nice, thoughtful decor in a great location to explore this beautiful area. The place had everything we needed and was very comfortable. Good restaurants nearby—Barbacoa’s and Dough Trader are so close.

Can’t wait to come back sometime soon!"

Jackson is a busy street so a little noisy but not bad. You can also hear neighbors a bit. Good news is you want to be out enjoying the hills and things quiet down.
Host was very communicative. Would stay again for sure."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Chad’s place was clean, comfortable, and in a great location in Spearfish. We were within walking distance to the main street. The one thing to note is there aren’t cooking basics (like oil, salt, and pepper), but we ended up trying a different restaurant each night we were there, so it was a nonissue. Chad gave us a great pizza recommendation (Dough Traders), which we’d recommend to others!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Chad was incredibly patient and accommodating! I would highly recommend booking with him!

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay especially if you're wanting to be close to the BHSU campus. The newly remodeled unit was as described. I tend to do a lot of cooking when Im in Spearfish because our kiddo misses home cooked meals which is why we don't stay at hotels. I like to feel at home when staying in an ABnB so the small things matter. The kitchen was well stocked with most of what you'd need except there were no potholders to get food out of the oven and no salt and pepper. I will add though that this is one of the first places Ive stayed that actually had decent cutting knives so that was a PLUS. Also, if you plan to have more than 2 sleepers or like extra pillows bring them as there were only 2. Overall it was a great place to stay and an easy check-in process is always appreciated."

2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing place to stay in Spearfish. Chad is a wonderful host. Place is beautiful and clean and walking distance to great places to eat and hang out.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This property was super cute and updated as well as very convenient. The location is perfect for visiting your child at school or just being local to everything in Spearfish. The owner was always quick to respond and very friendly. We were also always greeted by Willis the cat next door who is just adorable. I highly recommend this property.
2021-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, new and clean. Comfortable bed too so we were happy campers."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This rental is very nice. The location is perfect if your visiting the area for any BHSU activities. I flew in from Alabama to surprise my son who lives on campus at BHSU for his 19th birthday. He was able to walk back and forth to spend time with me but also attend required football practice. The kitchen was fully stocked and I was able to cook all the things my son was missing about home for him. The shower was AMAZING….the best water pressure ever and the bed slept very well. I can’t wait to stay again! Go Yellow Jackets!!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay for the weekend while exploring Spearfish! The construction and parking were not ideal but only a minor inconvenience! Very clean!

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved this place- perfectly appointed and comfortable! Would definitely stay here again when I visit the beautiful Black Hills!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spearfish was a perfect central location for Black Hills sights and Devil's Tower. This Airbnb is right on one of main streets but just outside of central part of city in residential area. Entire unit is newly refurbished with high quality appliances and materials. Plenty of space for two people. There are two other units attached to same structure but never even heard others and entry is private. AC unit just really services bedroom so other rooms may get warm when it's really hot--we had no problems.
All in all, a very nice place, good location and at a very good price."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is great for a stay in Spearfish. Modern and updated, close to BHSU, impeccably clean, and a very simple check in process vThe communication was first rate. I recommend Chad’s place with no hesitation."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location, tasteful and beautiful renovated home, and we just loved Spearfish. In town for the Dakota Five-O mountain bike race, and came away extremely impressed by everything the town and area have to offer. We’ll be back."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great accommodations. Very clean.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time in Spearfish, SD at the Jackson St. Bungalow. It was easy to find although access to this location was tricky with road construction on Jackson St. It is coming to an end soon and will be nice when finished."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"I thought Mike had a great location. It was good for what we paid. Only thing I wish was different would be curtains over the window where the bedroom is. The lights outside from the complex are on all night. They blast into the window so we were up a few times a night.
Overall great place"
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Check in was very easy, and the close proximity to the walking path and downtown made for easy access to lots of local amenities."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Was in a great area and very comfortable to stay in. Plenty of amenities and easy to access with a nice walking trail behind the home.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place!
Extremely clean, comfy bed and pretty cool to have the water running right out the patio door!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed our stay. It’s nice that the walking trail along the creek is right out the door. We were only there for one night while traveling through but we’d stay again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Awesome place with easy access to downtown spearfish. Very clean and well kept space.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome little gem. I highly recommend staying at Mike's place.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was great! We wanted to bring our dogs and booked this place because it is dog friendly. There was a trail behind the place that was perfect for walking them and it was beautiful. The amenities provided were definitely satisfactory, as the towels were the softest I have ever felt. One of the best parts was that there are two bathrooms, and both have showers. Very convenient for getting ready on the morning. While the immediate surrounding area is not the most pretty, it is walking distance to so many restaurants and so many other things. The bed was memory foam, which is not my favorite, but if you enjoy it then it is probably very nice!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,Mike was a great host. He made sure I had everything I needed during my long stay. The room at Spearfish Creek Inn was freshly renovated and very comfortable. Great location to downtown and loved the that walking trail was located just behind the room.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect little getaway spot right next to a beautiful stream and walk way for our dogs! Airbnb was so cute and cozy! I would love to come back. Definitely recommend!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This property is literally touching Spearfish Creek, which is right outside the back door. The creek runs cool and clear and the sound of it is very nice. It would be hard to find another property like this anywhere. It’s quiet and peaceful, and relaxing- but also close to everything in Spearfish, and only about 2 minutes from highway 90. I really enjoyed my stay here, and I think probably anyone would. There is also a nice park next door, and a bike path, and just tons to do nearby. Highly recommended!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a nice space. Small but inviting.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mike’s place was great. Cozy and a place we would stay again.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mike was extremely easy to work with and get in touch with. The place was just like the pictures. Very , very nice! We were very pleased! Had a wonderful stay!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The host was INCREDIBLY helpful! Beautiful place! Highly recommend!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Host was very responsive. Access was easy and location provided easy access to creekside trail.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,We were Mike's first Airbnb guests at this location and we absolutely loved it!! Everything was as described and better. We really enjoyed sitting outdoors on the patio listening to Spearfish Creek babble by and taking strolls along the pedestrian/bike path right outside our door. Great location only blocks from downtown Spearfish and Mike was a great host who responded very promptly. We will definitely be returning for future visits!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Just another great space!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Very cozy
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,We’ve stayed at Jackie’s a number of times. Cabin 10 is one of our favorites! The shower head is really high and water pressure is great… perfect for my tall husband! All of her cabins are clean and decorated so cute!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I love the Orchard Creek Cottages. I feel so relaxed and comfortable when I stay there to visit my daughter at college. Jackie is very responsive and accommodating.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved JAckie’s place. It is a cute cottage perfect for 2 people and pup friendly. I know it is not a thing that most people think of but I love that they leave a broom in the cottage. When traveling with pets I want to sweep everyday and this is the only place that I have stayed that left one for guest use. The host was great to communicate with. Very responsive to our inquiries. We will stay there again if in the area.
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Super cute and great space. The shower was great! The bathroom was pretty cold in our <30 temperatures because most of the heat was in the main room with the heater. The furnace worked well at keeping the place warm but made loud pinging sounds all night as it heated up and cooled down, which kept us awake until we played music on my phone to drown it out. Spearfish is a cool town and close to a lot of cool things we liked visiting."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,stayed there for a few days for vacation and would definitely recommend!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, great host, beautiful and clean accommodation. I would definitely recommend to friends and family!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cottage was so cute and cozy! It looked like the pictures and had everything we needed. Temps were -20° and lower. JAckie got us another space heater within an hour when the one available at the cottage wasn't working. We will definitely choose to stay here again the next time we are in the area.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Modern cute cottage, great amenities with full size kitchen and bathroom. Great couples get away and would definitely recommend! Host’s did a wonderful job of communicating as well!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cabin has easily become one of my favorite places to stay. I was finally able to rest and retreat here and also enjoy what Spearfish has to offer in just a few minute walk. Jackie was a great host and I will definitely be back!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay! Cute place with a wonderful host!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The cottages are SO cute and comfortable. Spacious bathroom, squeaky clean living space, and kitchen with a keurig! Jackie was friendly via correspondence and quick to respond to questions. Definitely worth a stay, I wish we could’ve stayed longer."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Good place to stay. There's a cute little fireplace in the corner. The bathroom got a little cold, but there's a space heater in the unit you can move around to wherever you need more warmth. Overall, it is a very clean and tidy place to stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This adorable cottage was perfect for a short stay in Spearfish to celebrate our anniversary. We are early risers and enjoy quiet time with coffee; something you can't get in a hotel room. Added to that is the ability to cook meals in a spotless, well-appointed kitchen. Everything about Unit 10 is modern, clean and comfortable."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Really cute and comfortable cottage
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I was visiting for a wedding and had a lovely stay. I arrived very late my first night and locating the unit and getting in were incredibly painless. The cottage was a cozy comfortable place to hang out in my downtime over the weekend. Strongly recommend!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"W e so enjoyed this farmhouse cottage. It was perfect, clean, well stocked, felt like home and was so hard to leave. Jackie is a great example of what property owners should model themselves after. Her prompt and kind communication was so refreshing. She provided a notebook with all the info which was helpful. The mattress and furniture were extremely comfortable and the decor was beautiful and minimal. Thanks for sharing and for having such high standards. If ever in the area, I will certainly stay here again. Otherwise, I will tell others about your place. Thanks for giving us the best place to stay in SD"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location within 10 minutes of walking to downtown spearfish. Just a nice little space to enjoy for vacation! Decorated super cute, and they had everything you could need! We would stay again! Thank you!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband & I really enjoyed our stay at this cozy cottage while attending the Kool Deadwood Nites car show.
The cottage is tastefully decorated with all the amenities you need & more! Located next to beautiful Spearfish Creek, lots of walking trails nearby & just a short walk to downtown, with tons of great shopping & restaurants! It was so nice to relax in the hot tub after longs days of touring scenic Spearfish & area! Highly recommended!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place for my trip with my sister as we explored western South Dakota!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very well decorated! Made it feel cozy. It was a nice, quiet place. Nice to have your own little space."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Driving cross country we happened to stay here going and were pleased to find it available again on the way back!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute little stay. I just needed a place for one night before attending a funeral. The host covered service fees, which was great. Very clean and comfortable bed. Hot water and overall cute stay. Walkable to restaurants and coffee shops. Would stay again and the host was very friendly and responsive!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I LOVED this cottage so much so that I want it to be my forever home! Every little detail felt like a home - it was cozy and welcoming. I highly recommend it! It’s close to nature walks and less than a 5 min drive from the main road. Jackie was a responsive host - don’t sleep on this, book now!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was very clean and they were accommodating. I would recommend them!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful place! Feels like a gem I’m glad to know about, and hope to stay here again the next time I’m passing through. Great bed, huge smart TV you can watch from bed which I loved, plus great shower and kitchen! Amazing hosts who recommended a great pizza place a few blocks away too!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a lovely stay, and this property is super cute!! Jackie gave us clear instructions and made it so easy to find and get in. Despite being basically a one-room cottage, the space was larger than a hotel room, sparkling clean, and beautifully decorated. Location was great too — just a half-mile walk to downtown Spearfish for an amazing dinner at Antuñez! Checkout was a bit early for us (10:00 am), so we headed over to Common Grounds for coffee and unique breakfast sandwiches — a great way to start the day!! The only tip I have for our wonderful host is to please not use fabric softener on the towels (not only does it make them less absorbent, but it's unhealthy for people with chemical and scent sensitivities). We will definitely be back next time we're spending a night or a weekend in Spearfish!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,What a lovely place! And well stocked kitchen. We were very comfortable.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Just like the photos. Very cute, modern and super clean. It is in a quiet residential neighborhood near the university and felt very safe. But also an easy walk to restaurants and the downtown area. Spearfish is a very friendly and tidy town."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful little modern cottage. They communicated quickly and frequently. Hot tub is a nice touch. Great back yard area for pups. Thanks JAckie!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cottages were great and the hot tub was heavenly! Very clean and private.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I loved staying here. very easy check-in, the location is great, and it's always clean!! This is my 2nd stay with the Jackie, and it will be my go-to place when traveling through here. Definitely would recommend it to anyone! :)"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We wish we had more time at the cottage! We didn't get there until 10pm and checked out by 9:30am the next morning. We absolutley loved everything about the cottage. The decor is beautiful and the renovations are very well done! If we come back through Spearfish we will definitely book again!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed in cottage 10 for one night while driving thru and loved our stay! The cottage is so cute with high quality finishes. Honestly, surprised at how reasonable the price was considering how nice it is! It felt bigger than I expected from pictures. The bathroom was really nice (I really appreciated the separate makeup towels). Overall, great experience and if we’re in the area again we will definitely stay again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute quiet cabin in a peaceful neighborhood! Super clean. Check in was very easy. AC was wonderful after a hot motorcycle ride.

2023-06-01,4,Stayed one night,Didn’t know it was located in such a small lot of land. The air conditioning in the window was loud had trouble falling asleep. The decor was very nice and clean.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cottage 10 was a perfect place for us and our pup to relax after a day on the road. Jackie was friendly and responsive to my requests and questions. While it isn’t a large space, it didn’t feel crowded at all and the bathroom is actually pretty spacious. The couch is very comfortable, as well as the bed (supportive but not hard). There isn’t a kitchen table per se, but there is a little table and two chairs one could use if needed. We didn’t use the kitchen much but it seemed to be pretty well stocked with dishes, cookware and the like if you wanted to cook a meal. The area was quiet and peaceful. We didn’t use the hot tub but it looked cozy and clean. And there was a large grassy yard to walk our pup. We would definitely stay again."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at this adorable cottage! It was so clean and comfortable! Jackie was a great host. She was super responsive and accommodating!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,My son loves the loft bed and hot tub and called this his favorite adventure home. This is such a cute place and great thought put into every detail.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The cutest little place
2024-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"Jackie was so responsive and friendly! We only stayed 1 night but it was a great stay for that night 🥰 Everything was clean and the hot tub was great 👍 There's a couple of eateries and a brewery right across the street (walking distance), which is amazing. My only wish is that it was communicated in the description that this tiny home is in what seems to be a little tiny home/mobile home community so it's not quite as private as we were expecting from the reviews. The neighbors were quiet but the deck with the hot tub is right next to the tiny home next door so you can hear others talking when you're trying to just rest and relax. While it was a nice stay for being close to town and a 20 minute drive from amazing hikes, we definitely felt the price was pretty steep for what it was. Aside from those couple of things, we were absolutely thrilled with our stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We really enjoyed our stay at this beautiful tiny home. The open field directly across from the area makes it feel very peaceful and private while still being close to a few restaurants and the brewery. We really enjoyed the hot tub and watching the deer. Our dog loved to be along also. We would definitely stay here again! Great location and great vibes. The hosts were also very responsive and friendly.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect getaway! Very clean, private and close to all things! We will definitely be back! 10/10 would recommend"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,So beautiful! Absolutely worth it. Stopped by in the middle of a road trip from St. Louis to Seattle and it was the perfect little stop!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Very quaint and cozy tiny home. We were only there for one night but there were plenty of amenities that would have made a longer stay very comfortable! Didn’t have a chance to use the hot tub but heard great things about it via the guestbook.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a fun, cute place to stay."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great little stay! Loved the hot tub and the beds, very comfortable space right off I -90."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, will definitely stay again when opportunity presents itself"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was incredible! Super clean, modern looking, and surprisingly spacious for a tiny home. The bed was comfy. Plenty of windows to open for a gentle breeze to flow through. There is a private hot tub overlooking a pasture-like area, which we enjoyed greatly. Even though the home is technically in town, it feels secluded with the hot tub facing the greenery, and a privacy wall next to it. We enjoyed a good soak and watched the starry night sky. There's a neat guest book where people have left their notes on what's good to do in the area if you need suggestions. Would definitely stay again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great, comfortable stay! Perfect location for a peaceful getaway."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved this place and everything it offered. Including the local nature residents!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Such a cute cozy tiny home! Love the guest book to see what others loved about the place and the opportunity to share our favorites with others traveling if they don’t know exactly what’s worth seeing! Place was great!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was perfect in every way! It was peaceful and we woke up to a ton of deer in the field grazing. The home was cozy and beautiful.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Enjoyed our stay very much!! Such a cute space
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Overall it was a great place to stay, no major downfalls. Very clean and communication was excellent. We had never stayed in a ""tiny home"" before, so it was probably all to be expected, but the shower was unexpectedly small, to the point I avoided using it more than once. There was also no real seating, other than the bed or bar style dining chairs. Maybe host could consider only having the bed in the loft and a couch downstairs? But overall would recommend, the hot tub was great!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay! Clean and very cute!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"this was the perfect little place for my one night stay. Check in was so easy, the place was as described and was able to walk one block to a brewery and nice little Mexican restaurant. The next morning while soaking in the hot tub I was visited by a group of deer, an amazing sunrise and beautiful surroundings. highly recommend to solo travelers!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,I had an awesome time in this beautiful Tiny Home. Very peaceful.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It has lovely decor and a quaint setting. Very convenient to downtown Spearfish area hikes. One thing we did not realize from the description was no bathroom sink. The kitchen sink served its purpose!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Check in was very easy as instructions were clear and detailed. We arrived to a little herd of deer we watched from the deck of the cutest tiny house we’ve ever stayed in! Everything was clean, the beds were very cozy, and the hot tub was ready for us upon arrival! We wished we could’ve spent another night in Spearfish to enjoy the property, we’ll definitely be back!"
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with a pet,It was a nice stay overall. I did find it hard to stay warm the first night as it’s heated by space heaters. The hot tub was nice but with how cold it was it had a hard time staying hot enough for me. It had snowed quite a bit but it was plowed so getting out was no problem.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, great views. friendly host."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cute and cozy. Clean. Hot tub was very relaxing.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great location! There were several deer nearby so it was fun to relax in the hot tub and watch them. The place is beautifully decorated and very easy to make feel like home. I couldnt recommend this place enough! Absolutely worth the price, you’re close to several awesome restaurants, and there’s a farmers market nearby! It may be a tiny house but they do a phenomenal job of making sure you have everything you need"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This lovely tiny home is exactly as the pictures show, and more! Simple decor, fully stocked with coffee, shampoo, etc, and mattresses are so comfortable. We were in awe of the proximity of about 20 deer in the area, some of which will get very close to the home! They were so fun to watch from the hot tub on the back porch. The guest book inside is a great guide from past guests with activity and restaurant recommendations! We had never stayed in a tiny home before and had a total blast exploring the area and enjoying the space and hot tub. Jackie has thought of everything and has put so much care into this space. We messaged her once or twice with questions and she got right back to us! Also, the proximity to both I90 and local shops and restaurants is ideal. Do not hesitate to book this Airbnb!!"

Not too far of a drive from all the typical tourist sights in South Dakota, if you are okay with driving. The spearfish canyons were beautiful and I’m so glad we stayed here otherwise I may not have gotten to see them! Overall, this is an amazing place and we will definitely be back."

2023-10-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Really appreciated having this place to stay in Spearfish. Recommend Spearfish Canyon and the Termesphere gallery. As far as the tiny home - great space but WiFi was not reliable enough to work from. Also had a few days with tons of flies - but luckily there are flyswatter’s under the sink.
It was great to wake up and watch the deer play in the yard next to the property, and always appreciate dog friendly spaces!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is amazing! It’s both easy to get to, and incredibly peaceful! We loved the cleanliness, the style, the peaceful surroundings and the thoughtfulness put into this home.

The communication and information provided was very helpful, to include local recommendations.
I would definitely recommend this place and would love to stay again sometime!"

2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"It was a first for us in a tiny house.
We soon realized, we like more room.
I had to put my suitcase on the floor as there is no room for a luggage rack.
We are too old to have such tiny spaces, not the falt of the host. We learned.
Thanks for sharing your place with us."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great tiny house to spend a few nights in for the price. Less than. a minute away from the interstate by car. This particular property is well shielded from the others, so you have good privacy, and the porch is entirely open to an open empty field. Great sunrises. At night, you can hear the tires from the semi's on the interstate, but it's quiet, not intrusive."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We've always wanted to stay in a tiny home to see what it would be like. Tiny Timber was absolutely adorable. I'm an interior designer by trade and they did a wonderful job decorating. It was clean and well stocked with everything we needed. The only negative was that the light in the loft area didn't work and the cover wasn't on the socket. Other than that, it was lovely. At the end of our stay we decided a tiny home is not for us but it was a great experience."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely loved this tiny home. Actually quite spacious, and easily could’ve stayed longer. Quiet and you overlook a beautiful field. Would love to stay again, thanks Jackie!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I wanted to explore tiny homes, as I plan on building one myself. This was the great first tiny home to explore, and I definitely plan on stealing ideas to implement in my tiny home. It has pretty much everything you need in a tiny home, and the clever usage of the loft as a second bed is a nice touch. It felt clean and comfortable. I want to come back whenever I head west again. Love it!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean and new place to stay. Recommended 👍

2021-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is a perfect place to stay while in the Black Hills. After a day of being around people, this is a quiet and out of the way place. You can birdwatch, watch deer, or just sit and enjoy the quiet. I think four adults may find it crowded if you stayed very many days. It would be perfect for a family of 4. The price was great for the area."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space was a perfect ""home base"" for my husband and I to adventure around the Black Hills!

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This house is so cute and Lang made the stay very comfortable. The location is a little far from many of the attractions but overall a great place to stay.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hard to beat, cozy and peaceful. About 8 minutes from both downtown and Spearfish Canyon. There were more supplies available than expected. We would go back, for sure."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect spot to stay for a little peace and quiet!! My family loved it and would totally rent again if we go back out there!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay at the Turtle House! Everything is clean and cared for. We slept well and felt right at home. The Turtle House is highly recommended!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great expierence at the turtle house! They have so much creature comforts, if you forgot something they probably have it there. They had a few breakfast options that you can make yourself so we didn’t have to go out and buy something. House was in a quiet place out of town a mile. The inside was clean and had everything we needed. If we come back we will be staying here."

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"WOW! This place is perfect for a couples getaway! All of the comforts and cleanliness of a hotel suite but secluded and quiet in the woods. Also just a five minute drive to downtown shops and restaurants. Lang keeps a very new and clean property and there is even a yoga/meditation platform on the property and an archery range a half mile down the road. You are only 30 minutes from Spearfish Canyon and Black Hills Forest and 1.5 hours away from Badlands, Jewel Cave and Wind Cave. In our opinion, it was well worth a little extra drive time to have absolute quiet and calm in the evenings. Deer in the neighborhood too! A great value. We will be staying here on our next venture up to the Black Hills for sure. Thanks!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is a beautiful place, very close to Spearfish but tucked into the hills. Well-stocked, clean, quiet, lots of character. It was the perfect place for our honeymoon. We enjoyed the hospitality of Lang, and learning the lore of his family (Termespheres, dragon puppets, music, and so on)! We would definitely come back again if we are in the area!"

2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Among the best AirBNBs we’ve ever stayed at! Clean, spacious, well-stocked and full of charm. I’d stay here again in a heartbeat and you should too — and be sure to check out the Termesphere!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent communication! Lang made sure we were comfortable. This home is in the perfect location. Just off the beaten path, but only 10 minutes from all the best trails and 15 min from Deadwood. Our stay was quiet and the view of the stars in the evening was fantastic."

2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you so much for hosting us at the Turtle House. It's a beautiful property and the kitchen space was excellent for cooking.

2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay. A quiet warm and cozy dome home. Perfect for my husband and I. We stayed for a week. Large fridge and good pots & pans allowed us to cook in during our stay. The sheets and towels were soft and fuzzy. Close to downtown Spearfish and Deadwood but still out in the country. Lang was quick to respond to our questions and requests. We will book again while visiting family in the future.

2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place, off the beaten path in Spearfish. We had the entire recently remodeled first floor to ourselves. Good place to stay as a base, and then venture off to hiking, biking, and sightseeing within the Black Hills."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Turtle House was an ideal location for our Black Hills trip. It is secluded, but not too far off the beaten path. Lang provided everything we could have needed, and was quick to respond to any questions we had. We loved everything about the place, and highly recommend the Termesphere Gallery next door. Thank you, Lang!"

2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Private, cozy apartment with easy access to Spearfish Canyon, Sturgis, & Devils Tower. There’s really only 1 bedroom as bunk beds are in open living space. Short distance on dirt road but driveway is gravel. Were fine on motorcycles. Will definitely be returning!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This location was great for our weekend vacation. We loved that it was secluded and peaceful, while still being right on the edge of town. The space and amenities were exactly as expected and we would be glad to stay there again!"

2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Turtle house was great! Lang responded quickly to messages, and he went above and beyond with the amenities (cooking supplies, food/drinks available, very clean place). My wife and I stayed here three nights and it was the perfect distance outside of Spearfish. Close enough to get everywhere quickly, but far enough away to enjoy the quiet. We definitely recommend Lang’s place!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place! I loved it!
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place exceeded our expectations. So charming and interesting, thoughtful touches like milk and breakfast sandwiches.

2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great place to stay when visiting spearfish. Make sure to check out the art gallery behind the house.
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We looooved our stay at the turtle house. Very hands off check in and check out with clear instructions and awesome amenities. It was a cute little luxury cabin in the woods. The nicest Airbnb we’ve stayed at by a long shot!
For sure recommend taking a peak at the termesphere gallery on the other side of the property as well if you have a chance."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We spent one night at Turtle House and we loved it. The space is comfy, funky and very clean! While we were only able to stay one night we could easily have made an extended stay at Turtle House. 🐢"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Was a great host, and the spot is very unique, and in a great location. Wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the Turtle House."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Lang's place was clean and the yard was great! The property was peaceful and a great reprieve after a long day's drive. I enjoyed my stay and will try and come back to Lang's place the next time that I am in town.
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place to stay! They were great at communicating. Nice and quiet but not too far out of town. I was under the impression that the whole house was ours, but it was the lower level. Which could have been my mistake."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our first Air BnB experience and it will be very hard to top! What an amazing place in a phenomenal location. Sparkling clean and very friendly helpful host.

2020-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved it so much we decided to stay longer. The place had everything you need for cooking and cleaning as well as a good varietyof breakfast food and guides for the area. Perfectly located to get around.
2020-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful get away. Only a few minutes drive from stores and restaurants but having a secluded feel. The place is cozy and the only view you see is trees and a green house giving you the country mountain feel while being close to conveniences. The place is fully equipped for cooking. We stayed during a snowstorm and had everything we needed to be shut in for a few days. The driveway and road are gravel and dirt but easily traversed by a regular car. We enjoyed it so much we extended our stay by 4 days. Lang was very good to us checking on us regularly to see if we needed anything. Good breakfast items were provided for us and everything was very clean. Cleaning supplies and essentials (toiletpaper, shampoo, trash liners) were readily available."
2020-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lang’s place was a quaint hideaway conveniently located in the black hills and many attractions. Very homey and Lang was very attentive to any concerns and quick to respond. Very friendly! I recommend this nice place to everyone. Beautiful natural scenery surrounds the area.
2020-04-01,5,Stayed one night,When looking for a space to stay in the Black Hills you can't beat the Turtle House! The level of detail and care that was put into the stay betrays the fact that an artist was involved. The best example of this is that they have a pasta pot with its own strainer! Will definitely return when back in the region!
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nature is all around! The entrance has a sharp corner that greats you with art blended with nature through the property. Straight in front of you is The Turtle House. Touches of art and turtles are displayed around this warm and cozy little place, giving you the feel that you are in a cabin.
What a great place to stay!"
2020-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,The location is perfect. The space is nicely set up with unique design features. I would have liked a few more cooking tools in the kitchen like pans to cook with in the oven and some large bowls.
2020-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Better than we could have expected! So nice to come ""home"" to after a long day of traveling."
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is seriously awesome. You have everything you need: towels, kitchen supplies, coffee, extra blankets. We appreciated the cozy space that was well thought out and similar to a tiny home. The location is away from the main part of Spearfish and it feels a lot more private and rural. Lang was an incredible host and always replied quickly and reached out to see if things were going well. We also appreciated seeing the incredible pieces at the Termesphere gallery right next door. Next time we're in the area, this is our spot!"
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Will definitely book here again! Great location! Very clean and host responds quick and very helpful!
2020-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"You want to stay here! The space and hosts are perfect. Hosts are artists and have a gallery where you can purchase art and prints. The cabin is nestled in the trees. Owners are close by should you need anything. The space is private and secluded but still close enough to town. Driveway has parking options for FWD vehicles. If I'm in Spearfish again, I won't stay anywhere else."
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a cool theme! The Turtle house definitely impressed. Great location and great hosts. Could have not asked for a better stay.

2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Turtle House is a convenient place to explore the area from. It was cozy, with nice “stocked” items for us to use as needed. The fireplace is the perfect place to end the day in front of. Looking forward to returning on my trips to that area!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Lang is a great host and the turtle house is a unique and cosy place to stay. It's very clean and the fire was already going for us when we arrived on a cold wintery night!
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Turtle house was a above expectations! Very charming Hope to come back and stay longer! Don’t miss a stop at the Termes gallery connected to the Airbnb!
2019-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super clean, love the artistic touches and the outside of the house (really looks like a turtle), warm and cozy on a snowy night, nice options for breakfast (tools to cook if needed- pans/oil/stove). My dad said the shower stall worked well. Lang welcomed us personally and was available for questions but gave us space. It was bright and breezy in the sun, great aesthetic appeal for this lil-hipster girl. Definitely choose this if you are staying in Spearfish!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very fun and interesting space in a beautiful location!
2019-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"5 Stars are not enough stars for Lang's awesome place. I've stayed in well over 50 AirBnBs and this was one of the best. Really beautifully designed and crafted interior. Every amenity you can think of, and all artfully done. And the incredible exterior -- a fabulous wild game (including deer, eagles, coyotes and turkeys) area is right outside the door. A beautiful ridge (great hiking space) runs just behind the property and the Black Hills National Forest is a short ride up the road. Plus this perfect space (for up to 4 guests, including the bunk beds) is integrated into the geodesic-dome compound of the host's internationally- renowned artistic family. That's the excellent frosting on this really excellent cake. I can't recommend it highly enough! If you're visiting the Black Hills, stay here! You won't be sorry."
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful, spacious house in a nice neighborhood, easy access to BHSU and the town of Spearfish. We would definitely stay again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a pricy place for a short stay of one person. But, it’s in a very safe and rich neighborhood of Spearfish, according to my friend who lives there and whom I was visiting.
The place is wonderful! My friend and I played Pingpong in the basement, I loved the master bedroom on the first floor, slept better than I had at home! Spacious living room and beautiful kitchen.
Definitely recommend, it would be a great place for family."

Extremely clean and very beautiful house but more important Todd and Vicky they are awesome."

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"We really enjoyed our time at this beautiful home! It is close to everything in Spearfish, yet in a secluded neighborhood where you can sit on the front porch. Plenty of comfortable places to gather and the kitchen is well stocked and functional. Highly recommend!"

Spent the day chasing waterfalls in Spearfish Canyon, had lunch at the Latchstring on the back patio with great views of the canyon. If you’re in town in July don’t miss the BlackHills Roundup Rodeo in Belle Fourche!
Great AirBNB I would recommend to friends and/or come back if I’m lucky! Hosts were very responsive and friendly. The house has everything you need for a comfortable stay, why stay anywhere else???"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"We love staying at Todd and Vickie's! For anyone needing an accessible place to stay, this one is great!

Our group unanimously agreed that Todd and Vickie’s was our favorite of the entire trip - with lots of thoughtful extras, cozy decor, and even cozier beds. I would highly recommend a stay here if you ever find yourself in Spearfish."

We were in town for business, and this home had everything we needed to make the trip efficient, productive, and comfortable. The home is spacious and was clean. The beds were comfortable, the bathrooms were stocked, and the location was perfect for navigating Spearfish and the surrounding areas. A full kitchen made mealtime a breeze. Local downtown restaurants and coffee shops within walking distance if you prefer not to cook. Easy commuting to grocery, parks, and attractions. We enjoyed the close proximity to the Spearfish creek-side trail and even walking up to the college campus to get some exercise. Todd and Vickie are highly detailed, responsive and took time to answer some additional questions for me. They have a sweet little piece of Spearfish and I know you will enjoy staying here. Looking forward to returning!"

Spearfish is a great town."

The kitchen was gorgeous and beautifully decorated. We appreciated the candles and nice soaps throughout the home. The neighborhood is so cute and the residents were so friendly to us and our children. We walked downtown from the house (about 4 blocks) and enjoyed the restaurants, breweries, and local shops. The highlight for the children was the creek, which is about 2 blocks away. They wanted to go down to the creek and play every day! It’s clear, cool, and perfect for something to do for an hour or so. The hosts of the home were easy to communicate with and the check out procedures were minimal, which was nice since we had a long day’s drive ahead of us when we left. We DEFINITELY would stay here again! Highly recommend!"

Beds and linens are luxury grade; so comfy! Bathrooms are well stocked with personal products; I could have brought just my toothbrush and makeup and been satisfied. Kitchen had everything we needed for the cooking we planned. We took full advantage of the outdoor tables and chairs for our morning coffees. We left the car parked, walking to the restaurants and boutiques that are blocks away. Neighborhood is quiet. Owners are conscientious…anticipating the needs of their guests and easy to work with.
