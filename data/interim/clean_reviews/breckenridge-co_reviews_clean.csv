2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! awesome hot tubs, pools, steam rooms, and saunas. heated parking, walk to the slopes and bars. the hosts were very easy to communicate with. very happy with our stay!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay here. The check in process was seamless. Sandra provided amazing clear instructions that made it effortless on our end. Kitchen had some basic cooking items we could use to make sandwiches. Very walkable nearby with lots of restaurants choose from.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Location was perfect and free bus service was right across the street. Everything you need for a family ski trip was within walking distance or accessible by free bus. Right on peak 9. Lots of amenities at the location such as free games like pool/ billiards as well as arcade games for free like Pac-Man and bong. There is also a gym, steam room, swimming pool and hot tub.
Projection screen if you want a nice movie night. Place is great for a couple but can feel a bit tight for more than 2 especially when you start having things like snowboard and ski equipment with you. We had 3 in our group my husband and I + our teen son. We managed quite well there but place to move around became tight once they rented their equipment & bought it back to the room. We would stay again if going back to Breckenridge."

When we first walked in, it was clean and welcoming. They are literally steps away from ski rentals and the Quicksilver Lift. I appreciate their quick response and communication."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Joel and Sandra's studio was just what my son and I were looking for for his first experience skiing out west. Great location and was a great ""home base"" for an excellent Breckenridge vaca!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joel + Sandra’s place was great. Close to the slope, clean, friendly people!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great, short stay at Joel & Sandra's place. We are a family of 4 and have stayed in MANY places around Breck since we travel up for kid ski programs on the weekends. The location of this unit could not be beat--very walkable to Main Street Breck and Peak 9 base (very close to Quicksilver lift). The unit itself was clean and cozy--but spacious enough for us. We really appreciated the underground, temp controlled parking. And we loved the pool/hot tubs (there are 4 outdoor hot tubs!) and the game room on the 1st floor. Joel + Sandra share helpful information and clear instructions on the digital key + parking info--I recommend to read in advance and you'll be all set."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,Fantastic location! Right at the bottom of Peak 9. Easy & walkable access to lifts and restaurants. Coffee shop across the street. Cozy place with lots of natural light.

2024-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Getting into the room was the biggest challenge, but the hosts were responsive and it all worked out. Had to download and reinstall the app for the digital key several times before it worked on the room keypad. Not a fan of the 10am checkout time either. Great value for an overnighter though! Clean, cozy, and super convenient to access Peak 9 base!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect location in Villages. Can see lift out window. Beautiful view and few minute walk to Main Street and restaurants.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, great atmosphere, great host, couldn’t ask for anything else will definitely be back!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We have been coming to Breck 20+ years. This place is right in the heart of everything from skiing, to shopping, and eating. Everything is a short walk away. We parked our truck in the covered garage and never had to use it again. The building has great amenities as well. Joel and Sandra gave a lot of info that made getting in and out of the property super easy."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, close to everything. Host’s were very responsive. The pool, sauna, hot tub were great after skiing. Would definitely book again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely loved joel + sandra studio. Family of four stayed there did not feel crowded and great location!!! It’s a great place for kids to stay a lot of other activities other than Skiing. We will be returning customers.

Joel and Sandra’s place was clean, comfy, and just right for what we were looking for. It was a great to be able to snap such a great little spot for our ski trip!

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very wonderful people. They helped us with everything from parking to knowing how to check in. The amenities that were listed show just how great a place this was.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We traveled from Texas hoping to get a taste of “White Christmas” in early December. Success! Timely snowfall along with spectacular Mountain Views and charming Breckenridge made this a wonderful trip. The condo was super clean and a 2-minute walk from the best Breckenridge has to offer. We appreciated a useful kitchen, plenty of hot water, and a roomy bathroom. (My wife made use of the full tub.)
The building features a small store in the lobby but it offers only the most essential items.
If you ski, the location cannot be beat. We didn’t ski but we walked around town each day and the condo location was superb. Joel + Sandra were friendly and prompt in our communication. We’d definitely return to this particular condo in the future.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Right in the heart of Breckenridge! Blowing snow on the ski hill right outside our window and all the restaurants, shops and bars within a block to a mile from the room. The hot tubs were great to relax in at night or in the morning. The hosts were so responsive and even let us know we could stay an extra night or two which we did stay one extra night last minute. Great place for sure! Also the underground parking was awesome to not worry about our vehicle!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"At first the No a/c situation has us worried but we had NO issues at all with the air bnb temperature inside. It felt cool and warm for our comfort. The air bnb was really nice! Awesome views of the mountains as well as multiple hot tubs any member of the family can use! Even if it’s hot or freezing cold outside. Will definitely be willing to stay here again, thank you Joel & Sandra for making this vacation memorable!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place to stay while exploring Breckenridge. Super close to restaurants and shopping. Would highly recommend!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The room is exactly the way it looks in the pictures very clean everything you need.
Sauna and steam room for an extra bonus, hottubstubs, pools, , game rooms everything very lovely.
Within walking distance for everything Breckenridge .
The only hiccup is actually getting into the room. Again at no fault of the owners, their explanation is spot on, but it takes a while to actually get into the room and after a 12 hour train ride and an hour and a half drive the only thing we wanted to do was lay down on the bed, but it’s quite the process to get into the actual room . So for future guest, I would stress that you’re not going to get in right a way but once you do, everything is fantastic. The owners always communicated very swiftly and had great descriptions and recommendations. If you were looking for a prime location in Breckenridge, this space is totally it."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Joel and Sandra have a great place in Breck. Check-in instructions were detailed and the hosts were very responsive when I had a question. Location is superb and the place was very clean. We took advantage of the swimming pool and hot tub (which we happened to have to ourselves!) We liked having the hosts' recommendations for dining and doing. Definitely recommend.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The room was clean and well-kept. It felt cozy. The host did a great job of explaining all the details of checking in and getting around the complex. It was much appreciated.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice room in the village and although I came in the summer, it is also right next to the ski lift. Hopefully will stay again in the winter for a great experience !
The hot tub and pool area was also very nice !"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,I truly did not care for this modern way of getting into the building by downloading an app on your cell phone. you had to use your cell phone in the elevator and your door to get in. Joe went above and beyond and got me a key card which was way more helpful. I would definitely stay there again. I’ll be back there next year to do a race and I will look to see if it’s available during that time.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The condo was right in the middle of Breckenridge. It was a pleasant walk to the Gondola, stores, and great restaurants. Plus there was a fun fine art festival happening just steps from the condo on the weekend we were there.
Highly recommend!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location!
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, walkable, and clean. Only reason I didn’t do 5 stars was parking garage door wouldn’t let us out. 2 people in place couldn’t help. Finally worker coming in opened door and backed up to let us out. So if ever an issue again I’d recommend that. Unfortunately we saw one person come in so new it worked but had to wait 30 min for next person to come. Owners were very responsive."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was the best airB&B experience we have had and the cleanest place we have stayed. Great location for walking around town. Despite a lot going on outside, the room is quiet. The building’s health club is clean and updated. It’s a studio but the bathroom closet and kitchen were good sizes so it didn’t feel cramped. There was a lot of attention to detail with newer linens and all the necessities."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to spend the night in Breck. Highlight was the pool and hot tub space - outdoors! Walkable to shops and restaurants.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joel and Sandra were wonderful hosts! They were incredibly attentive and helpful and I am very grateful for their responsiveness. The stay was cozy and beautiful, perfect for a mountain getaway!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our second time staying here and we just love it! The pools, hot tubs and firepit are so relaxing. Easy to walk to everything Breck has to offer. Very responsive hosts. We’ll never stay anywhere else when visiting Breck!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was our second stay here. Location is unbeatable which is why we booked a second time. A 1 minute walk to Main Street and right next to the river! Definitely would stay again!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time in Breckenridge and at Joel and Sandra’s place! It was extremely walkable to activities, restaurants, and Main Street shopping. We enjoyed coming “home” to the hot tubs after many outdoor adventures. Perfect space for the two of us."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We made a last minute decision to drive to Breckenridge for one night after a wedding in Colorado Springs. It was the best decision! Our two boys loved the pool and hot tubs and the nearby walking paths. It was so close to downtown and walkable. The place was small, but very clean. It might not have been as comfortable for a longer stay with 4 of us, but it was perfect for the one night. The step by step directions on how to get there and in were a lot, but very clear and easy to follow. The host was super responsive when I didn’t follow the instructions and very kind in their response."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved the location of the place. Easy to walk everywhere we wanted to go!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was amazing. we've stayed in multiple locations in Breckenridge, and this, by far, has been our favorite location! pefect walking distance to Main Street, even close to walking trails in the woods! will definitely be booking on our next visit!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Place was great. The location is right downtown and within walking distance of everything you could need. Host was so friendly and very quick to respond when we had questions, though we had few because instructions were so thorough!"
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This place was very nice and so close to all the shops and restaurants. The condo had a lot of maintenance going on. The gym/pool area was closed and the water was shut off for a period of one day. The front desk gave us ticket passes for a breck Rec pass so we drove to use the hot tub there.
This wasn’t in the control of Joel and Sandra and they did everything perfect from their end.
Great response time, a beautiful view and a clean place to stay!"

Even the amenities in the complex were better than most places I’ve stayed at before! All around great place!

Lots of channels available on TV. Very fast WiFi. Parking in basement. No road noise as apartment is to the back side. Skis can be stored in room by reception so don't have to take them to the room or leave in car. If lift lines are long at weekends on Quicksilver you can always jump on a freeride Gray bus and go up to Snowflake lift which never has a line."

2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"A very clean, convenient, family friendly studio, and the pictures and description are spot on. It can be a little bit hard to find the check-in location at first, but once your in, everything is smooth. Parking is somewhat limited, and you may need to park a small distance from the elevators to the room, but it’s all covered/heated, and you probably won’t even need to take your car out once you’re there. Location is a good mix of proximity to town, with about a 5-10 min walk to the lift, especially for the price. You can pretty much be anywhere in Town within 10-15 min of walking, but you’re within 5 of several restaurants and stores already. If you bring your own equipment, you will need to walk 5-10 min with it in order to get to the base of the lift and will have to store it in the room or pay for overnight storage. The amenities in the building are awesome, and overall this is one of the most family friendly locations but not the best ski in/ski out set up we’ve seen in Breck"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great studio right at the base of Peak 9. Perfect location in the heart of Breckenridge. Great facility and amenities in the pool/spa/jacuzzi area.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We are local Coloradoans but wanted time away in the mountains for Christmas, Joel and Sandra's was perfect!
Really quant place with comfy furniture, very clean, awesome amenities, and easy access to so many shops and restaurants.
As skiers, it was so nice to have the heated underground parking. We were also shocked how close everything was in the building (garage, elevator, hot tub, trash, etc) which just made it so convenient after a long tiring day.
We will definitely be back again!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Location of condo is an A+, you can easily walk to the Quicksilver lift from the condo with all your ski/snowboard gear. We had below 0 temps during our stay and having the temperature controlled garage was wonderful. Main Street is just steps away and so is the lift, in other words it is the best of both worlds. The hot tub area has been recently renovated and is top notch."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and amenities in a building that also looks like it runs as an owner operated hotel, which means it has most of the amenities of a hotel. Pool/spa area looks like it was recently renovated. Four separate outdoor hot tubs meant there was always a quiet one to relax in no matter how many groups were there.
Short walk out the back door to the base of the Quicksilver lift made it easy to roll out of bed late and still catch first chairs and also get back if you need a mid-day break or lunch in the unit.
Probably worth noting that hallway noise is noticeable if you’re a light sleeper. It was a holiday week though so a bit of noise is to be expected no matter where you’re staying. I’m a heavy sleeper and had no issues sleeping straight through once I fell asleep.
Overall great location that I’d recommend for couples or families with up to 1-2 smaller kids."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location right on peak 9! Super nice and cozy condo too. Extremely clean as well. Wish I could have stayed there longer!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Has everything you need for a great stay. Very close to lifts.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was the perfect Airbnb for 4 people, right in the village. Convenient for rentals, ski-in ski-out, and local restaurants. The room was very clean and the hosts were responsive and helpful. The facilities were very nice!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Joel & Sandra’s place was perfectly located in the heart of Breckenridge, extremely clean and cozy. Great views of the mountains and the slopes! Highly recommend! Would stay here again."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect Ski In/Out Peak 9 location. Ski rental and lift within walking distance. Free public transportation and close public parking during the day in Loft F. The amenities are great after a long day of skiing. Hot tubs, Sauna and Steam Room was definitely a plus. Very clean. Will definitely be back!!!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was an awesome place to stay at. Spent a few days on the slopes to bond with my son. We had great time being right there by the lifts and walking distance to many restaurants. Would definitely stay here again. Thank you Joel and Sandra.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place, great location!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location walkable to the downtown area. Check in took a little figuring out but the instructions sent to me ahead of time were very clear, step-by-step. Joel and Sandra were very responsive when I messaged them. This place is a studio but has everything you pretty much need to kick up your feet and relax between your adventures."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely studio in the heart of Breckenridge! The space has everything you need and is walkable to the entire town. My only complain is that the studio wasn't as updated as it seemed in the pictures. Parking is available for an extra fee.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay. Impeccable location, short easy walk to food, libations, and more. Comfortable clean room with everything we needed. Quiet and safe. We loved the hot tubs. Check-in was a bit confusing but hosts were quick to respond and very helpful. Would def recommend!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Joel and Sandra were great and very flexible with my stay and willing to work with me so I could make it in time to a wedding. The place has a lot of space and was nice and clean.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome place for a great price
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great location with everything close by. The check-in process was very cumbersome. There were 9 parking passes and five room keys. Our lock box had to be reset in order to get the correct parking permit. One room key didn't work and the front desk advised they couldn't help with resetting it.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and a wonderful place to stay!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Joel and Sandra are wonderful hosts! Great communication and very prompt with replies. The apartment is super clean and has a lot of extra touches that make it comfortable. Nice set up in the bathroom with separate space for shower, toilet and sinks."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great for the price, but got a bit of a list of things to do on check out that was somewhat annoying. Overall solid!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I love this place so much. So comfortable and nice, gorgeous mountain view, perfect setup, all the stuff I want as a hiker - easy laundry room access, kitchen, etc. Finding it is a tiny bit wonky but that's OK! also in the center of Breck, which rules"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved the location and convenience of this Airbnb. The check in process and key cards to get into the unit were the only issue we had. The key cards stopped working after the first couple of days due to getting demagnetized. Joel quickly was able to get in touch with the HOA to get us new ones. But something to keep in mind is that the cards shouldn’t be kept near other batteries or magnets or this could happen.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,The place was perfect for what we were looking for. It’s right in the village and within easy walking distance of the bars and restaurants on Main St. The hosts were also excellent communicators. I will plan to return.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Joel & Sandra’s place was awesome!! Really centrally located & so nice to have your own parking spot if you chose to purchase one.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great spot for a quick stay in Breck! Right in the middle of everything. Bed was comfortable and apt was very cozy! We didn’t spend much time there but wished we checked out the pool/hot tub at the complex. Great communication by hosts and very quick responses!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was great and the location was even better! Right downtown, so you can walk to everything. Joel + Sandra responded quick to all my my texts and were very nice and helpful!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An immaculate, cozy studio inside a fabulous complex with fantastic amenities. We loved the steam room and hot tubs after a long day of hiking. Parking was very convenient and the lot was never full. Coffee was great! Lots of herbs and spices which made cooking a breeze. We will definitely stay again in the future!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This condo was perfect, exactly as described. Joel and Sandra were extremely helpful and had very quick response time when we had an issue with parking. This place was extremely cleaned and well stocked with extra towels, pillows and blankets. It had everything we needed. Just a 5 minute walk to Breckenridge Brewery and some great restaurants! No AC, but we left the window open and it was the perfect sleeping temp! Highly recommend this to anyone wanting to stay in the heart of Breck!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is wonderful for a couple to get away into the beautiful mountains, yet so close to all of the best restaurants/bars in Breck. We walked to two of our favorite places (Flipside Burger and Cool River Cafe) from the condo. The parking option is very convenient and the newly renovated hot tub area is amazing. We've been to Breck around 10 times, and this is one of my favorite places, and when you factor in the value, I would highly recommend it!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time I have stayed at Joel and Sandra’s condo…it is exactly as advertised! Sweet place, close to everything, and well-appointed! We would definitely come back."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is clean, a little on the smaller size, but was perfect for our family of 3. You get really nice views from the windows. The building has a lot of amenities, with coin op laundry on every floor, a nice pool and multiple outdoor hot tubs. Check in was really easy, and although parking does cost $25 per day, it is in a very secure underground lot that allows for easy in and out if you need that. The location is perfect, as you are literally 2 mins from the top of Main Street. We enjoyed our stay, and we would come back again."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent communication. Great location. Would recommend for anyone! Walking distance to pretty much everything. Clean. Safe.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Highly recommend! Perfect spot for a getaway into the mountains. Lots to do within walking distance .. bike rentals, live music and restaurants galore, easy walk to gondola for the activities up the mountain! We definitely want to come back!"
2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great place for location, the hotel will check your bikes at no cost. The pull out bed is not the best but what pull out bed is comfy."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"These hosts were very communicative and helpful during our stay. I was on military orders prior and was often unable to reply with timeliness. They were consistent and so helpful during these times. We also needed to call them late at night when our card didn’t work, and they were so kind as they helped us with a plan b and c. Thank you guys!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,All accommodations were as advertised. We had a great stay!

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is my second time staying here and it was great! The new pool/hot tub was an added bonus. Joel and Sandra were so quick to reply back when I had questions during my stay. Their place is definitely my favorite spot to stay in Breck!

Favorite parts:
-Great communication with the host, super responsive
-Location is ideal, close to any food you’d need and the bus to get to the slopes has a stop right outside 
-A parking spot was included
-Full kitchen
-Washer and dryer in unit
-The bed was super comfortable, not too hard and not to soft (super important after a long day of skiing!)
-The lodge will keep your skis downstairs over night
Room for improvement (but not really anything the host has control of):
-River Mountain lodge needs an update
-Noise was challenging at times but quiet other times
-Make sure to get bottled water outside, they ran out of it for a couple of days
For a nice dinner out, Root Stalk and Radicato were amazing. For a fun time go to Castway Cove tiki bar downstairs."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you’re looking to ride at Breck during the day, and cruise Main St. in the evening, this is the place. Wonderful location within walking distance to the gondola, as well as everything Main St. has to offer. There are also 4 hot tubs within the property, one being indoors. The room was very clean and inviting, and the balcony was a great spot for coffee in the morning."
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was pretty good a little noisy at the hot tubs and she was right out the window definitely close to downtown, which was a bonus. Skiing was great. Could’ve used a Keurig but the coffee pot worked overall enjoyed."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay at Josh’s place! So convenient to the slopes! Right across the street from 4 o’clock run at end of day. All the awesomeness of downtown Breck out the front door. Staff at condo was very friendly and helpful. Amenities in the building were very accessible.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Josh was a great host, we had a great stay! The bus was right outside of the front door to bring us to the mountain. At the end of the day we skied down 4 o’clock run and we were home! We were able to check in an hour early which was so great! The town is so close and we walked to all of the restaurants! Josh gave us dinner suggestions which was also extremely helpful! Easy check in and check out. We would stay here again for sure!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Josh's place was a perfect stay! He allowed for my party to check in earlier to get our things settled before going to Main Street.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This establishment is truly remarkable and perfect for our family of four, including our 10-year-old and 12-year-old. The cleanliness and comfort provided made us feel right at home. Thanks to the exceptional service from Josh, we were able to check in a remarkable four hours ahead of schedule. It is worth noting that a car is not necessary to navigate the area, as this location is conveniently situated in the heart of everything. Furthermore, the convenience of the complimentary shuttle bus, which stops right in front of the lobby, allows for easy transportation throughout the town and access to all the ski lifts. We will be coming back. Thanks Josh."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location in Breckenridge!
Walk to everything, lots of restaurants to enjoy.

Breckenridge was magical this time of year."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great walkability to shops, restaurants, and gondolas. The building is quiet and very clean. Josh was very responsive and the people at the front desk were very friendly, ( one helped us glue my daughter’s toy back together!)"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Josh was an amazing host. He responded to emails in seconds. His place was super clean and cozy. Had all the cookware I needed to make meals. The parking was indoors, which was awesome because I didn't have to clean snow/ice off my car every morning. Main Street was literally the next street over, and all the free buses to the slopes stopped right in front of the building. They will also hold your skiis/board at the front desk so you don't have to drag them into your room. DEFINITELY recommend for convenience, location, and overall experience. Thanks Josh for sharing your place and your extremely fast responsiveness and professionalism!!!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great host! Great communication and had great recommendations. Space is as pictured.
Location is walking distance from Main Street, the gondola to Peak 8, and many more!
More than enough amenities to enjoy a stay!
Can easily cook or even get food from the local restaurants!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Josh was super responsive and granted us an early check-in. We always had a response within a few minutes when we reached out to him with questions about local things to do. The unit was perfect and had a well equipped kitchen. He proactively sent food recommendations before we checked in to help with us arriving early to town. It was a perfect last stop for our honeymoon.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Josh’s place for a friends wedding at the Nordic Center in Breckenridge. We absolutely LOVED our location. It couldn’t have been more central to the Main Street location, and well as the venue we were going to for the wedding. From start to finish, Josh was an amazing host. He was very responsive & gave us an extensive list of restaurants, bars, to walk to from our place. Check in was super easy. Josh made sure our first night went well by checking in via message which was very sweet. We loved that there was a Tiki bar on the bottom level (which allowed you to take your drinks to go to your room which was amazing!)
I also left a personal item behind on our stay, and Josh was super patient is helping me locate, and finding a way to ship it back home to me.
Overall, we loved the place. It was cute and cozy. Very comfortable bed. Location and host couldn’t have been better. We can’t wait to visit again!
10/10 recommend"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"After a faultless 3 night stay as a couple midweek in late October, everything was so perfect we tried to extend our stay but there was another booking, so we sadly had to leave our wonderful home from home. I would recommend Josh and his appartement to anyone !"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, great location!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic location! Walking distance to everything in breck. Parking is convenient. Definitely recommend.
2023-09-01,3,Stayed one night,"Before checking in for our stay Josh was very informative with local restaurant and parking recommendations. Early check-in in was available so we were excited to check in once we got into town. little did we know there were no keys in the lock box as the directions had instructed so we went to town to kill time waiting for the host to respond. we were able to get keys and get checked in after the wait. That night I received a very generic message from the host asking how many keys were in the lockbox to ensure that's how many get returned, as if he was completely oblivious to our previous issue checking in. the airbnb was as described and the amenities were nice, hidden restaurant in the parking garage of the East wing had decent food and good drinks. The host fixed our issue with check in but everything after that didn't seem very personable."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic location for walkability in Breck. The condo was super clean and Josh was super responsive.
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Everything went well, and Josh was super communicative and helpful. The only thing that we would say needs improvement is that the condo interior / furnshings feel somewhat dated; could use some TLC / modernization.
Other than that, very good stay in Breckenridge!
Thanks,
Rachelle & Joe"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place for 2 nights in Breck. Comes with parking and you can basically walk anywhere in town. Room was clean and perfect for 2 people. Had pool towels under the sink too. It is in a resort so if you need anything, the front desk can’t help you but that was understandable. Gets hot at night but had fans and the doors open to help."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Josh's place was fantastic. Very clean and spacious. We only had 2 people staying so with more than that it may be a bit tight but for us it was perfect. I would definitely visit again.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Josh's place was amazing. Enjoyed everything about it when we
were not shopping, fishing and eating. Bed was amazingly comfortable. Kitchen was great for cooking. Block away from main street. Would definitely stay at Josh's again. Thank you for your wonderful place!"
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great location. Great communication. We were there to see the town, not in ski season. Was perfect location for that. Would be even better during ski season. So location is ten out of ten!!
The building itself is dated, but condo had some nice updates. Condo has everything you need for your stay. Make sure to bring coffee and filters though, if you want coffee (there is also coffee in lobby if you don’t mind going downstairs before your first cup.)
The bed was very uncomfortable, and because I got hit with altitude sickness, sleeping was difficult.
Overall - great place to stay!"

The place was just as pictured! LOCATION of this unit is EVERYTHING! It is steps from Mainstreet. No need to drive anywhere. Breck connect gondola is a block away, the only grocery story in town is only a few blocks away. The bedroom is small but this unit is perfect for a couple or a couple with a child. Multiple hot tubs on site. And even a great restaurant on site that will deliver to your room.
Great stay & host!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time here! The unit is right across from the 4 o’clock run so it’s perfect for finishing a day on the mountain, and close enough to walk to Main Street at night.
Josh was very helpful in providing lists of places to go in the area and he set clear expectations for check in and check out.
The unit was comfortable and very clean and had everything we needed."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Although there was a small mix-up upon arrival, Josh was very quick to respond/remedy the issue. The listing felt comfortable and was in the perfect location. Restaurants were all nearby and within walking distance."

2022-11-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Excellent location! Right in the heart of Breckenridge. Walkable to everything! Relatively small room (especially if you’re utilizing the pull out couch), but was a real “value” find. The only downside was the place felt a little bit dirty and there was a LOT of noise from neighbors partying throughout the night."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the place. It was so cozy and homey. Towards the end of our week in Breckenridge we spent most of one day in the house. It was just such a welcoming and comfortable space. The location was great. A walking distance to everything including all the restaurants, bars, and shops on Main Street. I liked that we were able to park in the garage where my vehicle would be safe. Josh was a great host! He originally reached out with a list of local favorites regarding places to eat, drink, and hangout. I really appreciated his attention to detail when it came to the check-in and check-out process as well as directions on how to get to the condo. He really made our stay enjoyable and easy(: We do plan on returning to Breck and anywhere we stay we will be comparing to Josh’s place and his hospitality!"
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, clean place. Enjoyed our stay. The building has the feel of a hotel. Building facilities are outdated and marginally kept up. Enjoyed our stay."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed the area and the condo was very clean and had some updates. It was within walking distance to almost everything in Breckenridge which was very nice.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a top-notch stay in Breck! I’ve stayed many places up there, none have compared to the 1) location, 2) overall space and 3) Josh’s attention to detail and care to make sure our stay was perfect! I would recommend this to anyone looking for a place to stay in Breck! The parking garage also has HUGE spaces which I know would be so appreciated in the winter time. Josh was thorough and attentive, making sure we were comfortable and accommodated!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a great place to stay! Josh was communicative and helpful. We really loved the location as we could walk by the river and to Main Street restaurants and to the gondola.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great unit! It faces the pool and hot tub, so they are easy to get to, yet it was never loud or noisy from those using them. It's definitely as described in pictures with lots of kitchen equipment to use, plenty of towels, pillows, blankets, and other special touches. The location is perfect. We love to walk everywhere in Breck, regardless, and it's right in the middle of any place you'd want to go shopping. Another hike we had planned got canceled, so we instead just left the unit and walked right up to a small reservoir and connected onto some paths that led us up some of the ski runs, so definitely easy access to some great walking.
If you're looking for a well stocked unit with amenities, a great location, a cozy feel, and a good price, book this unit!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Josh was an awesome host - this place is perfect if you're looking for a little place to stay right downtown Breckenridge!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved this condo! Great location off Main st. We never moved our car and explored the town during our stay! Can’t wait go to back in the winter!
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great location on the creek that runs through town. This is an older ski condo with some updates. Unit is as described. Neat and clean. Tiki bar on ground floor with seating on creek ... one of the best drinking seats in town. Two outdoor hot tubs on the blink with one under repair ... that okay because the two indoor hot tubs are working great.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great convenient location for activities in the downtown area. The unit was clean. The communication was excellent!

If you want to cook, they have everything you need to do so. Super easy to get on the mountain and ski, and got a ton of use out of the hot tubs as well. Would definitely stay here again the next time I’m in Breck."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A great experience all around! The condo itself is very clean and comfortable. The kitchen is much better stocked for cooking/eating than most, with a really nice set of pots/pans, etc. The location is perfect - you can easily walk to restaurants and stores - but also super easy for skiing - the free bus to the gondola is right outside the door, and you can ski back to the condo at the end of the day. We would definitely come back!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,4 minute walk to the gondola or a short bus ride and ski all the way back to the condo (via 4 o'clocktrail).

Josh communicated really well, amenities were all accurate and functional.
All around a great experience."

2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Josh’s place was awesome and exactly what we were looking for. The location can’t be beat - it’s truly ski-in (located literally across the street from the end of Four O’Clock Run) and a very short walk to both the gondola and the heart of downtown/Main Street.
The condo itself was super clean and nicely furnished, and had all the amenities we needed: a cozy gas fireplace, washer-dryer, plenty of extra blankets and towels, and all the appliances you’d need to prepare your own meals in the kitchen. The ski/board valet downstairs was super convenient, and parking was easy and located in the garage underneath the building. We didn’t use the pool or hot tub, but they’re right outside the condo and looked clean and well-maintained.
Josh was super responsive to any questions we had - he’s a great host. We hope to return!"

The condo had nice appliances and the living room was pleasant with the gas fireplace. Only negative was the extremely small bathroom, but otherwise there was plenty of space for 4 adults. Overall, for the price and location it was a good value."

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed staying at Josh’s place. The condo is exactly as on pictures, very clean and comfy. The hot tub outside was a big plus after the day on slopes. The fireplace is super cozy. Great location!!! Two min shuttle ride to the Breck connect gondola or 5-6 min walk and looks like you can ski back to the condo when there is enough snow (wasn’t the case in the beginning of December, but it didn’t bother me). Lot’s of restaurants on the Main Street which is literally 2 min away. Can’t wait to be back! Thank you Josh for being a great host!"

The airbnb was in an amazing location - just blocks from Main Street and alongside a beautiful stream. The easy check-in process and access to covered parking made our stay all the more enjoyable. Would highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a clean, cozy, and centrally located spot to enjoy Breck! Can't wait to come back for Ski season."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Josh’s condo for a week.
The location is absolutely primo!

Josh’s communication was very good regarding our stay.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My son and I had an excellent stay at Josh’s Airbnb in Breckinridge. The unit is fully equipped and located in the middle of town while still affording a quiet night’s sleep. Josh checks in regularly and is a very accommodating host. We definitely recommend his condo and would book it again.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic stay. The central location is great for getting to the lifts, restaurants and shopping. The unit is very clean with lots of amenities.
We would love to stay again in the future."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a great find in the heart of Breckinridge!! Once they are, you can walk everywhere in town. Also, there are four hot tubs in pools.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about this place was awesome! Great location, easy to walk for dinner and to get in and out of for our local hiking trips. The condo was cute, clean, comfortable, and had all we needed. Highly recommend!"
2021-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Josh was very communicative with us and thorough with the instructions. The condo space works just fine for a couple. We brought our toddler along so it was a bit tight for the three of us (with him sleeping in a pack n play that we brought).
The condo’s proximity to Main Street is unbeatable. I was surprised to learn that there is a tiki bar & restaurant in the building! We were also pleasantly surprised that the mask mandate has been lifted in Breck finally, except for the public buses. My husband enjoyed the outdoor pool and hot tubs. We did not need to make a reservation to use them.
Thank you, Josh!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Appreciated the communication and travel tips to Breck prior to arriving. Josh was great at checking in during our stay to make sure everything was going well.

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location!

The shuttle around Breck is reliable and convenient . The Condo has a homey feel . The bedding and bed were very comfortable as was the pull out couch next to the fireplace. The hot tubs are an added benefit . Location Location Location you can’t beat it ! highly recco Josh’s place and would enjoy staying again.
2021-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"As advertised, comfortable and close to everything!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Josh’s place is in the best location- across the street from the free shuttle and within a quick walk to all that Main St offers. He was extremely accommodating and responsive before, during, and after our stay.
My girlfriend and I stayed here for our anniversary and had the best time. Would highly recommend and hope we can return soon!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Phenomenal stay! Josh was a quick communicator and the place was so clean and comfortable. Would stay again!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Josh’s place was great. Located near bars, shops, restaurants, and the skier drop off. Would visit again."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Josh’s place was clean and very functional for a family of 4. Kids loved the pool and hot tub and you can’t beat skiing back on the 4 o’clock run right to your condo! Busing to the Gondola or any of the other ski lifts in the morning was a breeze as well. Loved being able to get to downtown in just a few minutes!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Josh was a great host!
We had a few questions prior to check in and Josh was extremely responsive, it made the beginning of our trip start on a great note. The room was very clean upon check in and spacious.
Josh left some great suggestions on local spots to check out and it was an awesome trip overall, thanks!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place ! Super centrally located in the heart of Breckenridge. Really appreciated the fully equipped kitchen for cooking in & washer/dryer.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place. Very clean and perfect location. Host was very informative, we had a great time!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was incredible. We could walk to everything, the village was incredibly cute, and the room exceeded expectations!"
2021-03-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Josh’s place had mostly everything we needed for our two night stay in Breck. It was about a 10 mins walk to Quicksilver SuperChair and a 2 mins walk from the end of Lowest 4 O’Clock. Very short walk to downtown Breck with all of the shops and food your heart desires.
There were a few things we didn’t like. There was no laundry detergent provided and it made no sense for us to go buy some for such a short time. A hair dryer was listed as an amenity but there wasn’t one there during our stay. Lastly, our host appeared to make it our responsibility to let them know if a primary key card was missing during our stay. When we arrived, there was only an emergency key card in the lockbox. Given that the stay was actually in a hotel and not booked directly with the hotel, we thought that it might be normal. A host should always be aware of all issues within reason and ensure that everything is in place prior to your next guest’s arrival."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We really enjoyed our stay at Josh’s! The apartment is very conveniently located at the bottom of the 4 O Clock run and has a bus stop right outside the building. The gondola is a 5-10 min walk if you don’t want to wait for the bus. Main Street was super easy to get to as well.
The apt itself inside is laid out well and furnished with everything you need for a week’s stay.
We used the heck out of the fireplace and hot tub amenities. Both are great to have during a ski trip!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I loved our stay and Rich and Beth’s carriage house! The place is just right for 2-4 people! Close to town on North side of Breck in a beautiful setting and easy to get around to lifts and town!
The place is modern, but easy to use all systems, which is not always the case!
Rich was great to work with on plans and changes and communication was best I have ever experienced!!
Absolutely no complaints or even small issues…..We will rent again and that is really all you have to say right!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you’re looking to visit Colorado, this is definitely the place to stay!!! Rich and Beth were absolutely amazing and helpful. They answered all of our questions and even gave us lots of extra info on our stay and things to do in the area. Their cabin is in a great location and was extremely clean. Highly highly recommend this place!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rich and Beth are by far the best hosts we have ever experienced. This was actually our first time booking through Airbnb and we weren't disappointed. We had a wonderful experience in this beautiful home, everything was as described online and way better in person. We felt so welcomed and Rich went out of his way to ensure that my family had great time in Breckenridge. He gave us a list of places to visit since it was our first time there. The hot tub and fire pit were a plus for this home and we enjoyed them too. Also the views are great and the location is even better! I can honestly say that if we go back we will for sure contact them again for availability in their home. I fell in love. Great communication, I highly recommend this home for anyone that is looking forward to stay in Breckenridge."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay, they are very nice and helpful. Whenever we needed they responded promptly and proactively. The house was very comfy and beautiful. Highly recommend!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely cabin in the woods just minutes from downtown Breckenridge and skiing. Loved the peaceful neighborhood, well stocked cabin, and hot tub."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Richard was the best host you can ask for. He happened to be in town during our stay and went above and beyond to make sure our stay was the best possible. We will definitely be coming back.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you so much Rich and Beth! The house was very welcoming and so beautiful. The natural light from the windows allowed us to feel like we were in secluded cabin in the woods. When we arrived, Rich made sure we were able to access the driveway in the snow and reached out to us via text to see if we arrived safely. The steam shower and hot tub was a great bonus to our stay and was very clean. The house was spotless and we really enjoyed the tv options (stayed for Super Bowl Sunday). Thank you for letting us stay and I would absolutely recommend this place to everyone."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rich is an amazing host and I highly recommend his house!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay and made so many beautiful memories! Thank you once again Rich and Beth!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Not only was this the perfect place when it came to accessibility as well as privacy, but Rich’s communication made the stay all the more enjoyable. He was constantly staying in touch even before our trip to offer recommendations, as well as travel updates. He monitored the weather leading up to our arrival and offered recommendations for the safest routes with the recent snow storms and kept me up to date with road closures from Denver to the AirBNB. All in all, I couldn’t have asked for better experience. Thank you so much!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Richard and Beth’s place was truly remarkable and a complete one-of-kind experience! I recommend this place for anyone that is looking for a beautiful private place close to everything especially for avid skiers. The host was very responsive and helpful and above all, extremely accommodating."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I’m convinced Rich & Beth’s beautiful home is the best place to stay in Breckenridge. We absolutely LOVED our stay. The home and the view is breathtaking. I could brag on Rich & Beth all day, You can tell they pour their whole heart into their home and truly care about your experience. Best host we’ve ever had. Thank you again, we can’t wait to come back! ❤️"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I stayed several days at the carriage house. We truly enjoyed our stay. The carriage house is beautiful as well as the surrounding area. Rich and Beth went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. The house was so peaceful, clean and beautiful. The view of the night sky from the hot tub was spectacular. There is a steam shower which was great after a day of skiing! The house was well stocked. Rich and Beth truly have built an amazing place with the carriage house, and you can tell they have put a lot of time and thought into many details to make it a perfect home away from home. If you are considering a place in the Breckenridge area, and the carriage house is available, you should look no further. We felt we were in a perfect spot to relax and have some privacy, yet still close to everything in town that you would need. Rich and Beth are the best hosts and truly want to make your stay a memorable and enjoyable one."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was absolutely perfect. The cabin was spotless, had so many thoughtful touches and was a fantastic location (very close to downtown Breckenridge but also near to the other areas we visited). Beth & Rich were phenomenal hosts. They provided many recommendations, were very responsive and checked in regularly. Highly recommend a stay here."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay at this lovely place in Breckenridge. Spotlessly clean place and well stocked kitchen for our week here. Incredibly quiet and peaceful neighbourhood. Comfy furnishings made hanging out in the evenings cozy. We never got a chance to use the hot tub or have a fire but looks lovely and private. Richard & Beth are proactive hosts and gave great recommendations for the area. Would absolutely book again when back in Breck!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rich and Beth’s carriage house felt just like home. Rich was so responsive and proactively communicated with us to ensure we had the most memorable trip to Colorado. From house instructions to local things to do, Rich felt like a personal concierge.
We would stay her again without hesitation. I already miss the steam shower and hot tub! Thanks for making our trip to Colorado so special."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at the Carriage House! Richard went above and beyond with helping us out with local recommendations, etc.
He also made sure the house was ready for us well before the check-in time of 4:00 PM.
The hot tub was great alongside the cozy little campfire spot..."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"WOW... Absolutely amazing and super relaxing location and accommodation. Felt remote but less than 10 mins from the hustle of Breckenridge. After a long day of hiking, coming back here was the perfect place to relax and recharge for the next day of trails. I've stayed at many AirBnBs and Rich & Beth are top-notch hosts and the nicest people you'll ever meet (if you're lucky enough... LOL)/communicate with. Peak 7 Carriage House, by far, exceeded our expectations. My wife and I will be returning here when we come back to Breck."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,They were fabulous hosts and their home is wonderful!!! Met all of our needs and expectations!! Beautiful location and we enjoyed being on the edge of town and also close enough to go into town in a very short 10 minute drive. Best of both worlds. Would definitely recommend staying here!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Exceptional! We spent 4 nights in August and it's been an amazing experience. Richard and Beth's house is absolutely gorgeous! Very clean, private, modern, yet very cozy. The beds were very comfortable, the kitchen is fully equipped, bathroom has a steam shower. We traveled with our young children and they loved it. The private hot tub was a great amenity. There's a fire pit and a nice grill. The home is just a a few minutes from all attractions and restaurants. I've been several times to Breckenridge but this property was definitely the best!
The hosts' hospitality was unbelievable! They made sure we were enjoying our stay throughout our visit. The recommendations that we got from them for activities and dining made a difference. We pretty much spent our time based on their guidance. Big ""Thank you"" Richard and Beth!
We'd definitely stay here next time we are in Summit county!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great private retreat yet a short drive from everything you’d need. Loved the steam shower and the hot tub.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"if you haven't tried breckenridge yet, try Richard and Beth's place.
I followed other visitor's words and their descriptions were correct.
I hope you would be their next guests and you will see what I mean.
great recommendations
beautiful trail path right in front of the place.
5 min drive to the downtown of breckenridge
a cute fox
wonderful communications with the host
starry night in the outdoor hottub
we want to revisit there .. during fall or winter"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect. Thank you for letting us enjoy your beautiful place!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"SO CLEAN! The home was pristine and Rich and Beth ensured that even the smallest of details were covered making a relaxing and comfortable stay. The home was not in town and gave us the perfect mountain-side location that we were wanting.
Rich was so responsive to any questions that we had and genuinely wanted to make sure that our family enjoyed our trip to Breckenridge-he assisted us with suggestions of things to do in the area. If our family heads back to Breckinridge again, we will definitely be trying to stay at their home again ❤️"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a fantastic week at Richard & Beth’s home. The house was clean and comfortable. The views are wonderful, with lots of opportunities to spot different wildlife (we saw foxes, deer and a moose on our stay). It’s a very easy trip into town, but we loved the fact that it was a bit outside of the hustle and bustle of downtown Breck. It was such a peaceful and secluded setting. We would love to return again in the future."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rich & Beth are the kindest people, they helped my husband and I as this was our first time doing AirBNB, they also helped us when my Husband was having really bad altitude sickness & ended up leaving early - through that process Rich & Beth helped us the whole way! I cannot thank them enough.
And then there’s the house, it is everything you could wish for in the mountains! You are secluded atop the mountain almost inside of the forest and you can see the other mountains in the distance - it is gorgeous. The house was very clean and welcoming - they even provided us with Graham crackers, marshmallows, and chocolate! After we had put our things away, Rich called to make sure everything was good and ran us through how to work everything which was absolutely fantastic!
Book this place as fast as you can!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Felt right at home, the amenities were awesome. The home was squeaky clean, we enjoyed our time there. Rich was an excellent host, super friendly and attentive. We can’t wait to do it again next year!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The host was very friendly and responsive. I felt the home had a lot of things in the kitchen, which was nice. I would definitely stay here again! Instruction manual provided was nice."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Rich & Beth were fantastic hosts! If you're looking for a private yet convenient location from Main St Breckenridge, or Peak 7 / 8 base areas this is the one. Rich's communication was always timely and helpful and the house was perfect for our family. We're looking forward to our next trip to the area!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Rich and Beth were tremendous and courteous hosts! Always tried to go above and beyond to make sure our stay was the best it could be. The house was perfect for our family. Would definitely recommend, and if you have questions about anything don’t hesitate to ask as Rich and Beth are more than willing to help and just want you to have a great time!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beth & Richard are incredible host. I have stayed in Airbnb's all over the world and Mr. Richard is the best host I have ever had. He is super responsive and attentive to all your needs even prior to arrival. He made sure we arrived safely and gave us daily recommendations on activities Mr. Richard offered to drive us after heavy snow to the ski lifts near by and pick us up and delivered hand and feet warmers to our front door to make sure we were comfortable. Everything on the property was exactly as described. The steam shower is amazing it feels like a personal sauna. The bathroom has all the amenities you need, we cooked several days and were not missing anything. The area surrounding the property is just so peaceful, yet fun as well. Every detail has been thought of. Honestly highly recommend this host and property could easily be a super host."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Richard and Beth were very nice and helpful. Our family enjoyed our stay. We will definitely be coming back. Thank you for your hospitality.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is by far my favorite place I’ve ever stayed in Colorado! Rich and Beth are the nicest people and are extremely good hosts with providing info on things to do, places to eat, and just making it a great overall experience! I will be coming to stay here for years to come and you can’t go wrong with this stay! Plus the hot tub and steam shower are game changers! Highly recommend!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, perfect sized house. Richard was helpful for anything you would need. We even saw a fox on the property and moose on the way in and out each day. Would defiantly stay again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Honestly if you are going to stay in Breckenridge this is the place! Richard and Beth are the best hosts we have ever dealt with. Their knowledge of the area, hospitality, and attention to detail really can’t be beat! This was the best experience we have had after many trips!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Richard and Beth made our stay perfect! They checked in with us frequently to make sure everything was going well. They also made an additional effort to personalize our stay to us which meant a great deal. The hot tub was an awesome feature to have along with the steam shower. You can tell that there is so much that has gone into a moderately sized place. The drive into town is quick and convenient. But there’s plenty to do in the place itself to make the trip enjoyable. We loved our stay and will make an effort to stay in this place again the next time we come to Breckenridge.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Sooooo many amenities for such an amazing price. Steam shower, hot tub, EV charger, fully equipped kitchen, and the most amazing host on airbnb.
You're getting craftsman quality with the carriage house, and you will be wanting for naught during your stay. One of the main things we run into staying at Airbnbs are under equipped kitchens. This is not the case here. We were able to cook stews, even a freaking lobster feast during our stay easily.
Everything else about the home is amazing. I used the steam shower and hot tub religiously. The steam shower especially did wonders for my dry skin and sinuses during our stay. The home backs up to national forest and is very private. The view from the hot tub is of the forrest and crystal clear skies.
Rich is the most communicative and accommodating host ever. I literally had to plan nothing because of the quality recommendations Rich sent. All instructions were clear and the house manual is neatly compiled and easy to access online. He even installed an 240V EV charger for our stay!
I've never had such a pleasant experience staying anywhere and I will definitely make the Carriage House a regular spot to stay during our visits to Colorado."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay and experience with Rich was amazing. I can only described Rich as a travel agency. Rich had everything in one package. He gave us hike trails, restaurant recommendations, activity recommendations and any other small need. Rich made our trip super easy for us, especially since it was our first time in Colorado. The Air bnb is absolutely beautiful, very innovative and spot on clean. The description is absolutely spot on and in my opinion worth every penny you spend. I have 0 complaints, definitely a 5 star!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rich and Beth were the most wonderful, hospitable, and accommodating hosts we could have imagined. Everything about their property and accommodations are absolute perfection. We had the absolute best time, and they went above and beyond to make sure that our stay was phenomenal. We cannot recommend them highly enough. We will be back!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is gem among gems. My brother and our wives all stayed here 4 nights without any issues. It’s close enough to town to come and go as you please but far enough removed that you feel nice and isolated. We spent plenty of time in the privacy of the hot tub enjoying the moose, deer, and foxes strolling by. Chilling inside the cabin is just as peaceful with brand new everything, extra comfy couches, a large tv pre logged into most streaming services, windows everywhere and a steam shower! The digital info packet available was great for us being new to this area. And Rich was readily available with a wealth of information. I 100% recommend this place and am excited to come back during the winter."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you want a quiet place to stay with all the modern comforts of home, this is it! The view of the stars from the hot tub completely made our stay awesome. The hosts are the best I have ever dealt with. Best Airbnb experience ever!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Peaceful and relaxing! Great place to stay. It’s close to town yet tucked away and peaceful. The place is as advertised- it’s clean and comfortable. The hot tub was great at nice watching the stars. We opened the windows at night and got a nice breeze coming in. We’d definitely stay again and highly recommend this place to anyone visiting the area. The hosts are fantastic! Hope to see you again!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is the place to stay y’all! SO much heart has been put into this place. You feel it the second you walk in the door! Richard is so incredibly helpful and truly cares for his guests! Great place with GREAT hosts!!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Five stars all around. Rich and Beth could not be nicer. Seriously, you will see what I mean. They are a pleasure to be around and all they care about is making sure their guests have an awesome experience - and for us, their mission was accomplished and then some! We could not have asked for better hosts. The guest house is perfect - has everything you need, decorated very attractively and thoughtfully, views of trees and mountains, hot tub, steam bath - even a huge Roku TV with a sound system so you can bing Star Trek in ultimate luxury! The neighborhood is top notch - up the road to the ski mountains and surrounded by moose, fox, (we saw both), bears, deer and the rest - not to mention the nice homes all around the area. It would be a dream come true to own a place in this neighborhood. You will see. And lastly the town of Breckenridge can not be beat - what a great place to visit in the summer - the shops, restaurants, views - we struck gold coming here. The guest house is just 10 minutes tops from downtown Breckenridge (maybe 5) - and at the same time its secluded, quiet and perfect. This is what Airbnb is all about. Do not hesitate to stay here."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Richard and Beth were very accommodating . The cabin was cozy and cute and super close to all the best things Breckinridge has to offer !
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our vacation at the carriage house was absolutely perfect and included everything needed for our family of four. We were happy with the location, close to the slopes and downtown Breckenridge. The hot tub and steam shower were a relaxing way to end the day. Rich and Beth gave the best suggestions and were wonderful host, making our snowboarding trip memorable."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. Host very responsive. Easy access to Keystone, Breckenridge and Copper Mountain. Will definitely come back. Recommend Yo Mommas Cantina with Daily happy hour."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"What an amazing stay! The location is perfect, close to town, but is tucked away in the forest for some privacy and quiet. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the built-in steam bath and the hot tub with a picturesque view of the surrounding forest. Last but not least, Richard and Beth's attentiveness and hospitality made us feel we are truly being cared for during our stay. We will definitely come back and stay again ."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We were a party of four. This is our fourth visit to Breckenridge and choosing this time Richard’s home was a great decision.
You’ll need to rent a car (February AWD) but it’s really close to Breck.
You will find a lovely, quiet, and awesome place.
Waking up every morning with the National forest view was amazing.
Everything worked. Everything was clean.
The opportunity of having a private hot tub in the forrest is unique.
Richard is really an incredible host. He deserves every positive feedback you will read. I highly recommend this place."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a quintessential getaway location for someone looking for some mountain isolation, easy-access skiing, and/or an amazing downtown filled with cute small businesses. My uncle was a carpenter and he always said he could feel the love in the wood when people put their heart and soul into something. This was the first place I actually felt what he meant. The care and detail put into the amenities is impossible to miss, and who doesn’t like a hot tub and a steam shower after a long day of skiing? Rich and Beth will be the best hosts you have ever had on Airbnb. They made a guidebook that clearly tells you how to manage the property, what there is to do around town, and makes checkout clear as day. Next time I get the chance I would love to stay at Rich and Beth’s cabin again, not only because I enjoyed it so much, but also because they are good people. Hope this helps my fellow airbnbers decide on the carriage house of peak 7 because I know you won’t regret it!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Richard and Beth’s cabin is an amazing find! Located close to Breckenridge to be readily accessible for the slopes but far enough to be peacefully quiet on down days. We couldn’t have asked for more hospitable hosts and can’t wait to visit again. The cabin itself had everything we needed for a holiday and the hot tub was a perfect addition; we loved using it as snow fell amongst the trees.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful place, perfect for a family. The host are super helpful and great at giving recommendations on things to do. Couldn’t ask for a better place to stay!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exceptional place to stay. All the amenities, the ambience. All the extras made this a winter wonderland vacation to remember. The first morning woke up warm and cozy to four moose making their way thru the snow right out front. So remarkable. Hot tub, fire pit, and the wine Perfect get away. Great hosts. Checked on us frequently and no request denied. They gave us great ideas for adventures. Can’t wait to go back."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect cabin for our small family of 4. The cabin is well equipped with everything you need, comfortable and clean. We enjoyed our thanksgiving week here and even cooked an entire thanksgiving meal with no issues.
The hosts were the best part, very informative and went the extra mile to make sure we had a great time. They gave us lots of suggestions for things to do but also made sure we were comfortable and enjoying our stay. We cannot wait to return!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It is a very nice property, its owners have taken care of every detail of the house, it has everything you need to disconnect and relax. On the outskirts you can make use of its hot tub and if you run lucky to look at the stars while enjoying a hot swim surrounded by snow. Beth and Richard, they gave us a lot of tips for our long 14-hour trip and the snow storm we went through when we were arriving in the village of Breckinridge. We enjoyed and relaxed to the fullest. Thanks in total!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If there is a doubt in anyone's mind about booking this place for a trip to Breckenridge, DO IT. From the cleanliness of the stay to the willingness of Rich and Beth to give any recommendations / advice about things to do and places to look out for, our trip to Breck was made unforgettable by these hosts. The Carriage House is perfect for a couple or a small family to be close enough to the action while also being isolated from the noise. The hot tub in the snowy night is to die for. I could not say enough about this house other than we have found a home to come back to again and again for years to come."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our trip. An awesome spot: one of the best airbnbs we have visited in Colorado. Rich was a fantastic host also. Thank you again.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rich and Beth have been working on this cabin for years. You can feel the love and effort as soon as you walk in through the door. The cabin is cozy and modern with amazing amenities; starting with the coolest motorized blinds in the whole wide world: turn them up, down or just half way. Whatever your heart desires! Then, you go to the bathroom and find a steam shower(!!!!). Perfect for relaxing after a very long day in town. The kitchen is very well equipped with several pots and pans, a blender, a slow cooker, a microwave, and way more! The hot tub is a teeny tiny walk from the cabin so make sure to bring a robe or a towel to keep you warm. Rich and Beth were incredibly helpful from beginning until the very end. They gave us suggestions on hikes, gave us directions to the magical troll of Breckinridge, and other activities to do near town. They replied to every message instantly and were ready to help at any moment we needed it. You will not regret staying here."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a great cozy place to be for the weekend! The house was very nice. My family enjoyed the steam shower! We really enjoyed the hot tub while we watched the stars. Rich was certainly accommodating and giving us great suggestions and always checking in to see how we were doing and if we had enough things to do. Our kids didn’t want to leave! The only thing is that we thought it would be a little more secluded out in the woods, but we didn’t really see the neighbors so it was fine!"
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I can not even begin to say how wonderful this host was!!! We were in Colorado to ski before we found out the slopes would be closed due to COVID-19. Rich was BEYOND helpful and accommodating. He spent late hours on his computer sending us MANY recommendations on alternative things to do. He was available immediately by phone any time I had any questions! I can't say enough about his service. You should DEFINITELY rent from him -- he is so awesome!!
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Richard and Beth were very helpful and responsive hosts. They offered suggestions for things to do and helped me safely navigate the Colorado roads in winter. Their home was comfortable and well stocked and was close the free parking and shuttle to Breckenridge. We very much enjoyed our stay.
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You will not regret a single thing. Fantastic location, better hosts, superb home. Secluded yet near the town."
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Richard was very communicative and helpful from assisting in our rental car to fun sight seeing suggestions and restaurant recommendations. A great experience to Breckenridge and look forward to more visits back here.
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quick responses, clean house, awesome quaint location with slopes just down the road. The automatic blinds opening to a snowy forest every morning was one of the best highlights. 10/10 recommend this host."
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great house, great hosts!"
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rich is one of the most thoughtful hosts I’ve ever experienced. The steam shower was a great bonus feature. We recommend highly!
2020-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place. Can’t wait to stay here again. Nice quiet area away from the crowds. Beautiful setting in the trees. Comfy and added touches throughout the property. Rich was very responsive and went out of his way to make our stay great!
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything from the communication from the owners, to the cleanliness of the property were top notch. We are already planning our next visit!"
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location... Nice amenities, quiet neighborhood"
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rich and Beth are the true super hosts. Their house is located in a quiet cal de sac. You wake up to a view of snow covered trees from two sides. You make you own coffee or tea and enjoy a view while kids decided to sled, snow shoe or ski. It is located 3 miles from downtown so your are close to all attractions. Aside from many spot on suggestions, Rich provided us with snow shoes and sleds. This was a nice touch. You need to have AWD in Breckenridge during winter. It was by far best winter accommodation in this price range. We are coming back for more high altitude winter vacation experience next year."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Richard and Beth are both incredible individuals, and are fantastic hosts. We enjoyed our stay tremendously, and were immensely impressed by the location and beauty of this airbnb. The steam shower was great, the kitchen was very convenient. The beds were very comfortable and the place was nice and cozy. Richard was incredibly helpful, easy to contact, and went above and beyond to ensure our stay was as pleasant as possible. We highly recommend Richard and Beth, who truly deserve the title superhosts."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Look no further. Welcome to the perfect blend of accessibility to Breck and mountain seclusion. If you want to be able to hit the slopes or have dinner downtown within minutes but still want some mountain peace and quiet, then here you are. The carriage house is clean, modern, and stocked with everything you need and nothing you don’t. The kitchen is brand new and has everything you need. There is fast WiFi, smart TV with netflix, Hulu, etc. You can end the ski day with a steam shower (so relaxing!) and TV couch time or be in the apres scene within minutes. Beth and Richard were beyond accommodating and responsive. This is truly a special property. We are already looking for dates to book again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is our third stay at Lindsey’s and it always gets better! Such a quiet, private and peaceful condo. So cozy but modern and up to date. Very comfortable too with all of its provided amenities and even more as she provides snacks and toiletries and touches throughout. Beautiful scenery all around. A few minute walk to downtown and also fantastic hiking right on the mountain. We’ve stayed all over Breck and you really can’t beat this spot."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed the location! Perfect single person getaway condo.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,I absolutely loved Lindsey’s condo! It’s decorated beautifully. The beds were so comfortable!! The bathroom and kitchen are new. The location is perfect. It is a true ski in/ski out. We rented skis from the shop right at the bottom of the lift. The lift is out the back door of the building. There is a storage room conveniently located in the building to keep your ski equipment. I also appreciated that there is an elevator and luggage carts to get our stuff to the room. Do not hesitate to rent this condo!! We will stay here again the next time we visit Breckenridge.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lindsey's place was such a great base for my husband's and I weekend adventures.
It was clean, comfortable, literally next door to the lifts, and quick walk to lots of restaurants and cafe. I also really appreciated all the little extras like spices, oils, lots of coffee options, toiletries etc so you can get straight to vaca
Mode without having to head to the grocery store to get the essentials.
Would definitely book again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lindsey’s place is very conveniently located for skiing and exploring downtown Breckenridge. She was very responsive to all my messages and super helpful. The place is decorated very cute and felt homey.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for my husband and I. It was a very short distance to the Quicksilver lift and also not a long walk to Main St. for shopping and exploring town. It was so clean and had everything we needed for a full week. I cannot recommend this place anymore! Lindsey was quick to communicate to us if we had any questions or if there was something going on for the building (parking lot clearing). We will most definitely be back!! Thank you, Lindsey :)"

The unit was well stocked with plenty of coffee pods, snacks, etc. Master bedroom was very comfortable and the living room was great to relax in. Just a short walk from downtown to plenty of shops and great restaurants. We'll be back!!!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Had a wonderful weekend stay with my teenage boys on our first ski adventure in Breckenridge. The location cannot be beat, just a few footsteps from the bottom of Peak 9. The condo is cosy, well appointed and very clean. Looking forward to our visits next year and will be booking here again. Only disappointment was the hot tub was out of service."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,As advertised! The fold out bed definitely beats a sleeper sofa. Lots of thoughtful touches and everything you need for a good stay.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful place! Great location but also terrific host. Lindsey thought of everything! We are already planning our next trip and hope her place will be available. Thank you!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved staying at Lindsey’s place…so much so that we reserved it again for next year. The location was AMAZING…close to the quicksilver lift and Main Street. We didn’t even have a car. We just walked everywhere. The place was so cute and so clean. It was so well equipped, and Lindsey even provided things like snacks, hand warmers, extra toothpaste and toothbrushes, etc. Lindsey was also so responsive!! I only have great things to say about it."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Condo was just as described ski in/out. Owner has the entire place stocked with amenities above and beyond than anywhere else I have stayed. Very clean!
Cozy condo and was close to Main Street, rentals, restaurants and shopping of course!
I will definitely be back 🎿👍🏽

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had an absolutely incredible time staying at the Slopeside Mod. The location couldn’t have been more perfect and the description was exactly as listed. It was the perfect spot with our 9 & 11 yr olds because of the ability to ski in/ski out. In addition, we loved not having to drive anywhere as the town was completely walkable from our room. Lindsey was extremely responsive and we appreciated the thoughtful gift and amenities provided. We would return in a heartbeat and absolutely recommend staying here!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lindsey's place was great! It had everything we needed to spend the Christmas holiday, including the Christmas tree. We enjoyed that it was walking distance to the ski lift and town! Very cozy and the bed is very comfortable!"

The snacks provided were a pleasant surprise and the kids and us enjoyed them, thoughtful and helpful, it saved us from having to run out to the market, the little extras (coffee and Espresso machine) also and made our stay even more enjoyable. Comfortable beds and linens. We plan on booking this Airbnb again next trip to Breck!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lindsey offered the perfect Airbnb!! Trust me, we have stayed at plenty over that past decade. I would rate this place number 1 out of the 100+ I have stayed at. Great location and great value. It doesn’t hurt this it’s a ski in/out and is walking distance to all of downtown Breckenridge. To top it off, Lindsey seems to be a great person and is super friendly and knowledge to answer any questions you may have. We will absolutely be back!! Don’t hesitate on this one."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of the nicest, cleanest, well stocked air bnb’s we have been to. It was so comfortable and homey. We loved the coffee station, provided snacks, comfy bed and linens. It was definitely worth what we paid for. The kitchen was well stocked, the bathroom had extras in case you forgot something, the fireplace was an added bonus to get us warm after being outside. We loved the outdoor hot tub, it was so fun to sit in it while it snowed. We loved Breckenridge, what a sweet town, especially during the Christmas season. I would highly recommend Lindsey’s place, you won’t be disappointed!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lindsey’s place was perfect for a getaway to Breckenridge with my husband. The building was quiet, we hardly saw anyone while we were there. The condo is very clean and decorated beautifully. We were able to easily walk to all of the shops and restaurants in downtown, so we avoided the hassle of parking every time. Lindsey definitely makes you feel at home, so many touches I haven’t experienced with rentals before. We would definitely stay here again!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our 5 day stay in Breck was made even better by Lindsey’s place! The first thing is the location - we only got in our car one time and that was to drive to Frisco! We walked everywhere. Main Street is a block away. Next her place is immaculate and has all the conveniences of home including a well stocked coffee bar and snacks! That was a first for us and very much appreciated. Upon completing your reservation with Lindsey, she provides you with a welcome eBook which includes all sorts of recommendations and helpful hints for your stay. When we arrived we had a little hiccup with the internet and Lindsey immediately responded and it was fixed within 10 minutes. Her response time to our questions from the moment we booked until we left was the best response time I have ever had with a rental. I cannot recommend her place enough!!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent all around!
2023-07-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Lindsey was friendly, flexible, and responsive. The apartment was darker than the pictures portrayed and back up onto the parking lot, so not much of a view and a bit noisy at night with folks coming in and out. That said, all the basics are there and if you are spending most of your time outdoors, it's a perfectly good place for the price in an otherwise expensive neighborhood."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a cute condo! The snacks were a wonderful treat! The location is perfect, easy and short walk to restaurants and shops."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first visit to Breckinridge, and I can’t imagine a better spot to stay! Lindsey’s adorable, comfy condo was a fantastic home base for all our adventures. We took our car out just once to pick up some groceries; we were able to walk everywhere else.
Lindsey was a super kind and thoughtful host. (Nespresso people, rejoice!)
If we were skiiers, we’d book again this winter without a second thought. Truly an A+++ experience!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Second year in a row staying at Lindsey’s place! (Stayed last year and it was wonderful, her place was under a different listing and has 100s of 5 star reviews!). The perfect spot to celebrate our 10 year anniversary. Squeaky clean, very comfortable and great modern style. One of the best areas in Breck too as so quiet and peaceful tucked in the woods but blocks away from downtown. So we’ll stocked with snacks and toiletries. Fantastic hiking up the slope and in the forested area literally steps away from the back of the building. Awesome little hot tub basically in the forest. Can’t wait to come back!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay

Lindsay was over the top kind when we had a travel plan fail- we can't say enough about her as a host.
Building access is easy and the location is ideal"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved this place and will definitely be back again! What made it so special was all the little extras. No airbnb I have ever stayed in has had a Nespresso with a frother, there was a kuerig too, but I am a Nepresso girl! Then there was more excitement when I found bathbombs in the bathroom! On top of that, there were extras in the bathroom in case you forgot something (toothbrushes, deodorant, ect). There were also plenty of snacks in the kitchen for my boys to shove in their pockets when we went skiing. My family was able to take the bus right outside the condo to the main gondola in town as only peak 7 was open. If the entire mountain would of been open there is a ski in/ski out right outside the back door of the complex. My family was able to walk to town both nights we were there and there were no complaints from my two boys as it was such a short distance. We also were able to walk to the Breck troll, but we did ride the bus back. Absolutely recommend!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an amazing place to stay. The apartment was cute and decorated so well she had a full coffee bar for use and snacks and all the amenities of home. Perfect for a couple or young family!

We will absolutely be back!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Unbeatable location if you're hitting the slopes.

Spencer was a very responsive host and well organized with all of the condo details (getting in, wifi, etc). Just a few nits: The bed was softer than we prefer.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great communication. Very clean and organized. It was very comfortable.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place right next to Breckinridge Golf Club. First thing we noticed was how clean everything was. Spencer was also very responsive and helpful the whole time. Easy access (ground floor), nice building with security, and huge tv. Best part is the massive corner unit porch. The place is on the ground floor but because of topography, the porch is elevated so it feels more private to hang out on. Would recommend Spencer and his place."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Awesome place, super cozy. Spencer was quick and concise with communication. Everything went smoothly."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The location of this condo is central to the Snowflake lift for skiing, to downtown for walking around and for driving around the vicinity to sight see. Well decorated and easy to get around, especially with a 15 month old! Locking off the bedrooms and all one level was super helpful."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tyler is a terrific host! The condo was as described. The only reason I gave him 5 stars is because there isn’t an option for more. Quick communication and crystal clear instructions. Went out to CO for a 4 day ski trip and couldn’t ask for a better location. Close to Main Street and walkable to Snowflake lift. Would love to stay again in the future. Thank you Tyler!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had an excellent stay for my 2-day ski trip. The lift was walkable [5 mins] - or a bus was available across the street for transport. Easy walk to Main street and great restaurants - receommend Aurum, Sancho's tacos and Empire. The place was cozy and perfect for our trip. Very clean all around, with everything you'd need in the kitchen. Easy storage of skis and other equipment - and two hot tubs within a 1 min walk. I'd def stay here again."
2024-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Very nice spot. Great location. 10 minute walk, uphill to 4 O’Clock lift which is a great way to get the day started. ~5 minute walk to downtown.
Tight entry way and bed/bath situation. Oven/range is permanently stained.
Hosts were great and very responsive."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We very much enjoyed our stay at this lovely place in Breckenridge! Plenty of restaurants and stores, as well as ski lifts within walking distance! Free parking and washing machines are a plus as well. Creaky floors from the upstairs unit was the only complaint, other than that it was a great stay."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Truly great location for a Ski condo. A seven minute walk to the snowflake lift and the ability to ski in by take the 4 o’clock piste to the parking lot. It’s was perfect, the condo has everything you need, we use the hot tub every day which was fantastic. The condo has an auto gas fireplace, which was perfect. Great Wi-Fi and everything you need for Ski vacation. Tyler was super responsive and take care of all request. Highly recommended."
2024-01-01,4,Stayed about a week,Cute place. Perfect for our week in Breck.
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"Great stay at Tyler’s Breckenridge condo. Very accessible to ski lifts and shuttles, can ski right home, and a block walk into town. Location was great!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Totally enjoyed our stay, found the accommodation super comfortable and lacking in nothing - always appreciate ample dishwashing and toilet paper supplies! The place is perfectly located near the slopes for skiing and also town for shopping and getting the vibe. We travelled without a car and getting around on the free ride bus service was super easy when you needed it (most of the shops are walking distance anyway).
Access to the ski field is simple from the house - the free ride bus collects you across the road, you can get off at the first stop and catch the Snowflake chair which gives you ski-down access to Peaks 8 and 9, or you can stay on for a couple more stops and get off at at Peak 9 base.
Peak 9 was our favourite as it was quieter than Peak 8.
Would thoroughly recommend Tyler’s place for a family trip (there were 5 of us). Thanks again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was the best location for an AirBnb in Breckenridge. It was walking distance to a chair lift and walking distance to Main Street. The host was super responsive. The condo was an open concept and perfect for our family. The storage for the ski gear was a bonus!
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Tyler was really easy and quick to communicate. Great place and great location
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This space was very clean, open, and comfortable and the host was excellent at communicating in a very timely matter. I highly recommend"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, just a fantastic condo my two kids (18 and 14) and I enjoyed and one we will try to rent again if in Breckenridge.
With key benefits being that it was super clean, very comfortable, in a great location and overall ""as advertised"", one of the biggest pluses was how quick and easy it was to communicate with Tyler the owner. Being our first time to Breckenridge I had a bunch of questions about places to rent ski gear, how best to access the mountain and also just where to go to best get groceries and meals. Tyler helped us get settled very quickly which made our three nights/two full days there so much easier.
Would recommend this condo for a family."
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"Nice apartment, with a nice street view and trees for the beautiful snow season and a few meters from the river and Georgetown."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great place to stay. highly recommend
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Easy to find and a great location for our two days skiing at Breckenridge
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"As a 5 star air bnb host myself, I have pretty high standards for places I rent. This condo was absolutely perfect for our family over Thanksgiving ! The bedrooms were perfect for the amount of people we had and the beds were comfy! The living room size was perfect and we loved the huge counter island and dining table as it gave us space to put out snacks and play lots of games from the wonderful selection they had for us to choose from. We LOVED the location,literally right in the heart of Breck. We truly didn’t drive after we got there! We were able to walk to restaurants and shopping and even one of the gondolas for skiing. The hot tub is super close to the house as well and the fireplace was a wonderful place to warm up after cold days/nights! We have stayed in Breck 3 times and this was by far our favorite for the price, location, amenities and condition! 5 star all day every day! We will definitely be back!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home was everything my family and I needed. Very cozy, clean, and comfortable. Close to anything we needed and the host was super responsive and helpful. My family and I are already planning our trip back!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay! The location was perfect. We were able to walk every where we needed to go. We would definitely stay here again next time we are in Breck. We weren’t there during ski season but this location would be great for that as well.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay and very close to downtown!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great loscation. Short walk to Main Street. Quiet at night. Great shower and washer/dryer available.
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, this condo is great and would stay again.
It was just my husband and I, but I could comfortably stay with another couple, or this condo would fit a family.
Great things:
- location to main street, very easy walk across the street
- condo comfortable and homey with the perfect layout
- host very responsive
- easy checkin and out
Things that I wish we knew:
- pools were closed, we had a rainy day and planned to use the pool but it was closed for maintenance. Host was not aware that this occurred. Not his fault and he was super apologetic. He even tried to get us into the recreation center, but they were also closed for maintenance.
- this is a bottom floor unit and every moment is heard above you. This impacted our sleep so much we tried sleeping in different rooms to see if it was better; it didnt make a difference 😞 Started every morning at 6am and went until after midnight-1am."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Exactly what this busy executive needed! I love Breck and was looking for peaceful tranquility with easy walking into town and hikes. Snowflake trailhead just up the road. Easy to do everyday. Will definitely return!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place and great stay. Thanks Tyler!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The condo was perfect for a girls weekend! The location can’t be beat, it is super cozy, and the host is very responsive. Would definitely recommend staying here!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place! Very clean, comfortable beds, and awesome location! Only minor problem was the listing and check in instructions said 3pm but the host said 4pm so we were unable to get in when we arrived at 3 but Tyler was very responsive and unlocked the door for us about 20 minutes after we arrived.
Thanks for the great stay!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at Tyler's condo! You can't beat the location, walkable to everything downtown and a short walk to the gondola as well. The condo has a great layout, perfect for our family of 4 (but plenty of room for more). It was clean and comfortable! We loved it and hope to come back again next year!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent location one block from Main St. Well equipped kitchen. Comfortable space.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was beautiful and perfect for our family of 5. Walkable to town and hiking. would love to stay here again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We hit the jackpot with this location.
Our family had never been to Breckenridge so we were unsure what the best location was that would allow us access to both town & the mountain.
The property manager was very responsive to all of our questions and we were so happy when we pulled into the parking space (they have two but we only needed one) to realize we were literally a two minute walk from the center of town but separated by the river so the building area was peaceful and quiet. We were there for the 4th of July but noticed the nearby ski lift would have been ideal for getting right up the mountain during the season.
The unit was perfect for our needs. The kitchen was spotless with a comfortable dining room area. Living room was comfortable - must be a new couch! The bedrooms were great - plenty of room & the clean bathrooms with more than enough space & privacy. Great water pressure in showers too.
We had never been to Breck before & this unit allowed us to enjoy a great trip!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was hands down the best AirBnb we’ve stayed at in the Breckenridge area. The location is perfect, whether it is a winter ski trip or a summer get away.
The home itself is wonderful, and perfectly equipped for a good sized family. Lots of room, lots of kitchenware, equipped with a washer and dryer. I highly recommend this home to anyone who is planning a trip to Breckenridge."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the condo - perfect for 4 of us on a short visit - with space for a couple more if we needed. Great location close to downtown and we enjoyed being able to walk into town for coffee, shopping, dessert, etc. We also could walk up the mountain to trails as we explored Peak 8 and some of the beauty of nature around us - just what we wanted. Finding the right building at night is a little difficult as we entered the first entrance we realized that we were not as close to the condo as needed and had to pull out and around to the second entrance off 4 OClock Road. Not a big deal but a little harder to do after midnight after a drive through the mountains. However, the ease of entry, the immaculate rooms, and great gathering spaces were perfect for our crew. We enjoyed our stay and would certainly consider getting this place again. Thank you for a wonderful experience that fit our needs perfectly."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great hosts from the moment I booked the condo! Friendly, responded right away, and easy instructions to get to the location and access to the property. The condo is awesome: lots of space for cooking and hanging out, nice private bedrooms / bathrooms when we needed quiet time, and the location is perfect for checking out the town (4min walk to shops and food)! We couldn’t have asked for a better spot for a nice relaxing long weekend, and the hosts are top notch! Definitely booking again when we head up to Breckenridge!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had an amazing stay at this downtown Airbnb! The location was perfect as it was close to everything I wanted to explore. Having parking included was a huge convenience. The place itself was clean and well-maintained, creating a comfortable and welcoming atmosphere. Overall, I highly recommend this Airbnb for anyone looking for a fantastic downtown experience. Will definitely return."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The location is perfect, right in the heart of town, making it super convenient to explore and enjoy everything around. The hosts were fantastic and kept great communication with us throughout our stay, ensuring we had a smooth experience. As for the condo, it was fantastic! It had a stylish mountain vibe, and it was clean and comfortable. I would definitely book this place again without hesitation. Highly recommended and we had an amazing experience!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great experience staying at Jamie’s Airbnb!
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great location and accommodation for the price. Walkable to everything which was key. The only downside for me was the app used by the village to access all areas of the complex. It's good for security but was a mild pain to have my cell out at all times. The unit looks out onto the roof but great views beyond. Communication was exceptional. Thx!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time, thank you!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Return guest here-we enjoyed it even more the second visit due to discovering more amenities in the building. On your way to the hot tubs, check out the game room with free arcade games, a pool table, plus cozy fireplace and seating area. That plus the location - just off Main Street - ensured our family’s time off the mountain was as much fun as on the mountain."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Excellent location at the base of Peak 9! Less than a five minute walk to the Quicksilver Lift. The space was perfect for our father-daughter ski trip. Multiple hot tubs, pool and games within the complex were a bonus. Thanks for a great stay!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Good location, good amenities, ski rental just across the street and very close to the main street"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, accommodation, and amenities! The place has 4 massive hot tubs - even right after skiing, you can still easily get a spot! Plus a sauna and steam room makes it a no-brainer. A swimsuit dryer is the cherry on top!
The accommodation itself is great as well. A large studio apartment with a stocked kitchen and bathroom/shower. Even has conditioner!
Would stay again!
PRO TIP: The location is at the base of the Quicksilver chair. This services all greens, as well as the kid’s ski schools. If it is busy (a packed line was 50min wait for us), just walk 6-7min up to the Beaver Run Superchair. Worst case, take a shuttle to the peak 7/8 gondola down the road."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our family of three had a great time! The location is perfect and walkable to both the ski lifts and to town. The studio was nice and had everything we needed for a long weekend. We would definitely stay here again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great Airbnb! We got stuck in Breckenridge due to a winter storm and they were super nice and helpful in helping us extend our stay. Would definitely book again due to how nice they were!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,All good
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jaime’s place was absolutely perfect for my wife, five year old son, and I. My son was in ski school and we could not have asked for a more convenient location to get him set up prior, drop him off in the morning, and for myself to jump on the Quicksilver lift right there to start my ski day! The amenities, like the pool, hot tubs, and game room, were perfect for entertaining in the evening, and it was walkable to every restaurant up and down Main Street. I would highly recommend and would definitely stay again!!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed it
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great weekend at Jamie’s place. It was cozy for our family of four, but we planned appropriately and made the most of the space we had. Super convenient ski in/out and Main Street Breckenridge."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent location and walkable to the Quicksilver lift. Loved the convenience of the storage for skis at Christy’s. Easy to use electronic locks. Nicely remodeled pool/hot tub area with a really fun game room!
2024-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Location is perfect. Amenities / hot tubs, pool, game room were so much fun for all of us (2 adults, 2 kids). Ski in/ski out and so easy to store skis at Christy Sports for the weekend. Beds were not very comfortable. The pull out couch seemed old, thin mattress and the pillows need to be replaced. The pull out would not be a good option for an adult. Otherwise, we enjoyed our stay!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jamie was an amazing host.. very responsive to questions and requests. the place was super. convenient to all the hot spots in Breck.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very gracious hosts.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great ski-in ski-out location. While the property is older, it didn’t feel that way. The concierge staff were also very friendly. Having the convenience store onsite was also a big plus!
We had an SUV with car top carrier about 7’-9” tall and we’re still able to park inside the climate controlled garage."
2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. We loved the proximity to the lifts. I also loved the foam roller in the closet. I honestly think the place would be cramped with 4 people. 2 people is perfect. The only thing missing is a wine opener.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay for peaking close to the peak. Everything was enjoyable!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Host was VERY RESPONSIVE with helpful and friendly recommendations.

Hot water, full kitchen, free internet and a lobby downstairs with oxygen bar and fresh coffee!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Fantastic location and amenities for our family ski trip. Quick access to the Quicksilver chair on Peak 9. We utilized on site Christy Sports for ski rental & storage which worked out very well well.
The pool, hot tubs, and game room were perfect for relaxing after a day on the slopes.
The unit itself was clean and comfortable. We made a stop at a local grocery store and mostly ate in. The kitchen had everything we needed.
Jamie and Shane were wonderful hosts with great and prompt communication when I had questions about the digital key and parking garage access.
We had a wonderful time and hope to come back again sometime soon."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Right in the heart of Breckinridge. The Village amenities were great! The movie room, games, steam room, pools and hot tubs were way better than expected. Very nice facilities. The room was smaller than expected, but the amenities made it well worthwhile."
2023-11-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Me and my mom had a great stay! Only thing that sucked was some of the hot tubs were closed and you had to have a Bluetooth key in your phone. My mother has issues using her phone(she is not user friendly) and it just became a lot of arguments between us.
Breckenridge is super expensive so my mom and I just went to the grocery store and cooked in the Airbnb!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We actually got to see two seasons (fall & winter) in one weekend! Hiked up to see Isak Heartstone one day and had 9”of snow the next!

Garage parking was a big plus and the office even stored our skis and equipment every night which was a nice convenience. We use Airbnb a lot and Shane was the most responsive host we’ve ever had. Overall a great experience !"

We walked all the way to see Isak Heartstone the troll from our Airbnb and even walked all of Main Street in the same day and the Airbnb was conveniently located!

Jamie's place was perfect and it's located right where all of the action is. I timed it and it was a 90 second walk from the room with my skis to the lift. So easy and just incredible! The view out the window in the morning of the fresh fallen snow and beautiful mountain was a huge highlight. Main Street is right out your front door and I loved walking into town each night for something different and delicious to eat. Everything was super clean and they communicated with me instantly every time. On top of all that, the parking was included and it just made it such a great experience from start to finish. I will definitely be staying here again every time I come back. I hope it's soon!!"

2024-02-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Not a bad place, clean inside recommend to clean some plates before using them. Had a problem with heating and host offered a refund for rest of the days but everything around was expensive so decided to stay and buy a heater. Close to the ski trails. You can hear your neighbors walking up and down the stairs. A little smaller than what you expect based on pictures."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed here for a week and felt right at home. Very cozy and beautiful location. We will definitely use this host again when coming back to Breckenridge!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,The apartment was just what we needed for a Breck getaway. It was beautifully furnished with generous amenities (plenty of quality linen and consumables). It is a well kept apartment and the laundry in the unit was appreciated as we were traveling with a toddler.

2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Very clean space, however felt a little off the beaten trail in terms of downtown Breck & the place did feel more like a hotel with the bathroom amenities & all the tissue/towel folding- not knocking it, we just really love the homey feels from others we have stayed at. Great for skiing I’m sure as stated and the place was very clean and well kept- not for us as a family with a little one but for a single/couple planning on being on slopes and just a place to get a nice shower & rest would totally be right up your alley!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"This place was the perfect peaceful, nature-oriented summer getaway! Joe & Steph were very responsive to our questions and thorough with instructions. The only complaint I have would be the pullout couch. The place is listed as having 2 beds, but it’s one large bed and a pullout couch and I did not get a restful night sleep on the couch. Otherwise, I would 1000% recommend staying here if you are only planning on using the bed!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommended! Great place & great hosts! Their welcome info has great recommendations on places to go & things to do. Since we visited in the summer, being able to walk from the condo down to town was very convenient."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Breckenridge has so much to offer. Joe and Steph's place was perfect for our trip. the house is spacious and very comfortable and it is close to the town. we spent few days hiking, and exploring the amazing Town. there is so much to do and we will definitely be back.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joe and Steph were amazing. This was not our first time staying in Breck; but the last few times we stayed so close to town it was a pain to get to the units and it was noisy. We opted for Joe and Steph’s place this time and while we couldn’t walk to everything it was so much better- quieter and easy- and everything they did for us was great as far as the unit, and communication. Thanks so much!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The condo was located very close to town and was very convenient. It was comfortable and clean. The kitchen had everything we needed for our stay. We didn't prepare meals but we stored snacks, etc. We will definitely stay here again when back in Breck."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My husband and I stayed from April 10 to 17 and it was an excellent week. We find the place super clean with everything you need for living. I fell in love with the bedroom mattress. It is a very comfortable, quiet and very nice accommodation. On foot we were a 15 minute walk to peak 8. A great location.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This condo was super clean and comfortable. it had a modern kitchen and great family room for relaxing after a day skiing. Joe and Steph were very responsive and helped us with a smooth check in. We stayed for a ski trip and were happy with the access to the slopes. From the front door it is a quick walk around the building and down the street where we accessed the bottom half of the 4 O'clock run which drops you at the snowflake lift. Just before the lift there is a road to cross, so we had to unstrap the skis and walk across the road, a minor inconvenience, but still a great way to access the slopes. It was super easy to drive into town, nothing was more than 5 minutes drive, grocery, restaurants, shops, etc. Great place to stay and great hosts, 5 stars!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at Joe and Steph’s condo. The place was just as it was pictured and super comfortable. Quick drive to downtown for shops and restaurants and super short walk to the slopes. You honestly couldn’t ask for more. Had a quick question for the hosts and they answered almost immediately. Overall awesome stay and we will absolutely be back!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Condo is newly renovated with updated appliances and finishes. Everything you need in the kitchen. Short, 100yd walk to the ski slopes on 4 O’Clock and a quick 5 minute drive to town, or 5 minute walk to bus stop. In-house laundry was a huge bonus, allowing us to pack less clothing for the week long ski trip."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay for a couple skiing at Breck for a week. We were able to cook a few meals at home and loved the short walk to get on the 4 o’clock run down to the snowflake lift. All was in order inside the condo and we enjoyed our stay!
2022-12-01,3,Stayed one night,"Our bed sheets did not seem to be washed. Had body odor shell.
Unit was very cold."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for an easy ski in/out unit to access Peak 8--this it it! The hosts were responsive, the entry and access was seamless, which was helpful since we arrived at 2:30 AM. The place itself was clean, organized, and had bedding, linens, and towels for everyone. We had 4 people stay in the unit, which is a perfect fit with the bedroom and pullout bed from the couch. We absolutely loved our stay here, it was so nice to be able to ski in and out with a very short walk to four o'clock run, plus there was a place to lock up our skis and snow boots as well! I would absolutely recommend this spot to stay, and will likely book another ski trip and stay here again in the future."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable condo. Well kept, clean, easily accessible, fully equipped. Great for couples or very small family of 3 or 4. Not too warm during summer season even without A/C. Additional fans were provided and greatly appreciated. Location is walkable to many locations, and free public transportation is also available. Guidebook was very helpful with many useful recommendations. Thank you Joe and Steph for helping making our first Colorado experience a great one!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Hands down the best Airbnb we have ever stayed in. The hosts have thought of everything necessary and even some extras. The location is beautiful. We even saw two young moose out our front window! We would absolutely stay here again.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend!! It is exactly as advertised, modern, clean, and comfortable. My wife and I initially booked Joe & Steph's condo for 2 days but after the first night we knew we wanted to stay an extra day to explore more of Breck. They responded back to us immediately confirming that the condo was available and we swiftly booked another night! Everything was easy about this place: simple check-in/check-out, an awesome guidebook in the apartment, and every amenity you can think of inside. We had a car so we opted to make the short drive down to Main Street when we went into town, but it also seems reasonably accessible on foot or via shuttle bus. The apartment stayed very cool even though we were there in the middle of summer. Can't recommend this place enough and we would gladly stay here again if we visit Breck in the future!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joe and Steph’s condo is clean, spacious, and great for a quick trip to Breck. Windows provided ample evening air flow and room is spacious.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great communication and modern, clean apartment"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great end-of-season ski weekend. The place had everything you need from games to travel mugs to take your coffee with you. We were able to prepare breakfast every morning and the Keurig coffees helped get us out the door.
Place was 100% as advertised. Perfect location to either take the lift up the mountain or walk into town. And yet quiet enough away from the beaten path.
One of those book without hesitation places.
Thanks Joe & Steph"

Our only regret is that we only had one night but if or when we’re back in Breckinridge, we know where we’ll be staying!"

Would recommend this place to anyone and everyone I know who is visiting Breckenridge. Thank you Steph and Joe!!!!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joe & Steph’s place is convenient, clean, and comfy! We had a rental car so we didn’t try to navigate the bus. The condo was cool, even in the heat of the summer. Parking and check in is super easy. I appreciate the great place to stay!"

2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We visited in the summer. I gave 5 stars on everything except value only because I really don’t know how the cost stacks up against other places. This was such a nice and beautiful condo. The check in / check out was super easy. Communication with Steph and Joe was quick and easy and they gave lots of good info on the area. It really is walking distance to Breck Fun Park. The condo is a great fit for a couple. We had our young-ish son with us and he slept on the sofa. If you have been considering booking this place stop considering and just book it.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Joe and Steph saved our vacation! We we're unable to get into the Airbnb we had rented so at 8pm that night we sent a message to them asking if we could stay at their place. They responded very quickly and were willing to work with us given the uncertainty in our plans. The place was spotless, had all the amenities you could want and was very convenient for hanging out in Breckenridge. Honestly, this was the best experience with a host I have had!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time in this condo! It is clean and beautifully decorated. The hosts are friendly though we didn’t have any problems so didn’t have to maintain contact. This place is in a prime but quiet location. We used the kitchen a lot and one thing we found was that the smoke alarm is sensitive. My husband opened the oven a little too quickly twice and the steam set the alarm off so be mindful of that! This isn’t a negative, just something that I thought I should mention. We can’t wait to travel back to Peak 8 and enjoy Breck!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a fabulous place! Everything was thought of. Beautifully decorated, impeccably clean, modern touches. They welcomed us at the last minute and we are so grateful they did. If you want a lovely place to rest and renew, this is it."

2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a great value. 30 sec walk to ski in ski out. With fresh powder I rode my board from the condo parking lot to the ski in area 2 of the days. I’m sure you could do that everyday mid season. This place is exactly what you would expect from the listing and I would gladly stay there again. Hosts were very responsive. Thank you Joe and Steph
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joe & Steph should be the paradigm by which all Air BnB should be measured. These guys were on it from the moment of booking. The condo was perfect for location, amenities, cleanliness, owner response time, and overall value. Incredibly close to the Four O'clock run! Easy 5 min ride into town. Can't be missed!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super cozy, great location."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was perfect for us! Our kids stayed on the comfortable sleeper sofa and enjoyed the huge TV. The bedroom was also very cozy. Everything was exceptionally clean and nicely finished. We were able to ski down to the Snowflake lift but it was too early in the season to ski back to the condo as the run was closed. The bus brought us back within a 5 minute walk to home. The communication with the hosts was always prompt. We look forward to staying there again soon.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joe & Steph’s place was great, very central to everything, downtown was only about a 5 minute drive, and the bus stop a 5 minute walk if you aren’t wanting to drive down to town.
The Nordic Center was also about a 5 min walk, and was the highlight of our trip since we were able to see a couple moose while on our hike around the grounds.
The condo itself was very up to date and the beds comfortable.
The neighbors were very nice and one was even kind enough to offer suggestions on what to do while we were visiting.
We would definitely suggest this unit to anyone visiting Breckenridge!"
2020-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place! Our only issue was that the thermostats were turned OFF when we arrived and it was 18 degrees out. It took hours for the place to warm up, even with the dryer and the oven on. We ended up going to bed with hot towels from the dryer but the cold still really messed up our first night's sleep. Otherwise we had no issues. The place was clean. Parking was easy and available. The kitchen was equipped with the basics but not with enough to cook from scratch. Everything was very new with higher-end finishes."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,10/10 would recommend
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great location close to everything in town, very clean, great kitchen for cooking some meals in. Joe and Steph are easy to communicate with, and check-in/check-out was a breeze"

2023-08-01,3,Stayed with kids,"This is a great location if you are in the area to ski, right beside the lifts and easily accessible.
There were small maintenance problems that should be addressed, broken doorknobs and window cranks. Also it is not mentioned in the description that there is no ac in the unit, however there were multiple fans so that helped cool it off. We visited in the summer.
Overall it’s a nice place."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,The venue fit our family well. A few minor corrections need to be made to a window and shower drain but nothing that was terrible. Would definitely stay there again!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location for a getaway! Steps from the gondola on Peak 7 made for easy access to the amenities on Peak 8 and all that Main St in Breck have to offer. Condo had ample space to relax and the welcoming feel of a home. Great spot for winter or summer!
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay and the condo worked perfect for us!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location for summer fun on the mountain… Couldn’t get any better for ski season.
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Scott was wonderful to work with. Property was great, we had all that we needed and the location was perfect! Thanks for having us!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,The best place that we stay in Breck. Cozy and left like a house than a condo. Beautiful place for a family with kiddos!!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place and location
2023-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"You absolutely cannot beat the location on Peak 7! It was perfect for my family of 5 (2 adults, 3 kids). It is a very spacious condo & the living area feels nice and comfy. I would have rated it 5/5 but for the tired furniture and how dark it felt inside."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Key takeaways and comments:
- I'd stay again and Scott was an efficient host
- The lodge is at base of Peak 7 / Independence Super Chair. With the ski in/out locker room, can't get closer to a lift.
- Small patio off the living room, one off the master bedroom. The condo is on the first floor facing opposite the mountain and located next to the main external entrance. Someone standing on the steps on the way into the lodge would be pretty close. In the summer, maybe that would bother someone, but I didn't think it was a big deal. I think Scott priced the condo appropriately for its location within the lodge.
- Three bedrooms with en suite bathrooms were all sized well. The master bath is very nice.
- Stocked appropriately for incoming guests"
2023-03-01,4,Group trip,"Scott’s condo was perfect for a true ski in / ski out destination vacation. The lodge had very nice amenities and the access to slopes and lift were game changers.
Scott was very responsive and the property was as advertised.
We would chose this location on any return trips to Breck!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was exactly as described and Scott was very helpful! We would absolutely stay here again. We enjoyed our stay and had no issues.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay! Ski in, ski out, at a comfortable, clean place, with a responsive, accommodating host was what we were looking for, and what we got! Thank you!!"
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,The condo was perfect for an amazing ski vacation. Scott is a fantastic host and was ultra responsive to any questions or requests.
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,The place is very central Just to go skiing the apartment is very accessible and with all amenities! Amazing place to ski!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay and would definitely rebook. Scott was great at communication and very helpful with anything. The location is great especially if you have kids.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Felt right at home, this place is perfect!"
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location for a fall girls trip! Since it was off-season, the unit was very quiet and relaxing. We utilized the free shuttle into town. We were disappointed that the BreckConnect gondola was closed.
Communication with Scott was very good. Slight mix up with the check-in instructions sent but a quick call to Scott cleared things up!
The unit just needs some TLC to make it exceptional."
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place, proximity to the gondola and slopes can’t be beat."
2022-09-01,4,Group trip,"Great rooms , great location
Scott was quick to answer and take care of issues that popped up"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great location and the place was beautiful
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great place, location is awesome. Off season stay was quiet and enjoyable. Felt like we had the resort to ourselves! Free shuttle service to town is easy to use and very timely. We had a mix up on our arrival day and Scott quickly saved the day and got us in a day early with no hassle. We hope to come back during ski season!"
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Large condo in super location. Easy to work with Scott!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! We had some trouble finding the keys, we called Scott and he came right over and got us situated. Awesome host!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect location—my family loved the free access to transportation into town, especially the gondolas. Scott was prompt in responses and the condo was great!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay! They have everything you could need from a ton of extra pillows, box fans, and everything for the kitchen. Check in was a little Bit of a pain but that’s not Scott’s fault. They Lobby was closed to our building.
We absolutely would stay here again."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place and location in Breck
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,Very clean place with easy access to everything in Breck.
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,The condo is beautiful and very roomy!
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful, spacious and comfortable condo in an incredible true ski-in ski-out location. 5 stars!"
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,"This place was incredible! Ski in ski out right by sevens. Amazing hot top on the mountain. Large space, tons of room to hang in the unit. Clean and big beds! Only minor downside, check in was late (4) and check out was early (10). I wish one could be earlier or later!"
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,"We loved our stay! So convenient to the slopes, thank you!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice and plenty of space! Well located for ski in and out! Furnished with everything you need.
2022-01-01,3,Group trip,"Below par communication - waited for a response for more than 5 days besides also leaving a voicemail. Never got a response until I called again.
Place needs some TLC in general, but location, size, and mattresses were great."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Scott was a very accommodating guest. Our son got high altitude sickness and it was a challenge all weekend but Scott was amazing. We also lost a key card and he got us two replacements the same evening. The condo is perfect for a family visit. You are a steps away from Peak 7 chair, Brek Rentals and Sevens Restaurant. I highly recommend this condo for any holiday visit. You won’t be disappointed."
2021-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,Great stay. Great location. Enjoyed being close to the gondola.
2021-09-01,4,Group trip,"Very comfy beds, nicely updated kitchen and bathrooms, huge hot tub at the resort, and right at a gondola for ski season."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Scott was great with communicating when we had any questions. Loved how he had coolers we could borrow while we went hiking , along with fans we could use in the condo. Place had great space and loved the view and being next to the gondola. We have never been to this area before and loved it. We can't wait to return and would stay here again."
2021-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, lots to do and the gondolas & shuttles are super convenient. Great value for how large the unit is, basically 3 master bedrooms. Carpet could be cleaned or replaced but overall nice unit."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a wonderful condo! So spacious, well appointed and clean - the location and amenities were perfect.
We loved the gondola being right outside for a fun and easy way to enjoy downtown, and great hiking/biking trails right outside the building. Complimentary Bowling and swimming for the kids was just a short gondola ride away. Looking forward to coming back again!"
2021-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a quiet place up in the mountain, Crystal Peak can’t be beat. Easy access to town and any other activities that you need and a great hot tub after a day of hiking to soothe our sore muscles! Great trip."
2021-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place. Thank you!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,The kitchen has everything you need. There was even ground coffee. The sleeping arrangements were great. plenty of room for everyone. Loved both balconies. Very large hot tub with great scenery. We really loved having free access to bowling and swimming down the hill.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"If you are looking for an INCREDIBLY CONVENIENT location in Breck, I'm not sure you can beat Crystal Peaks. That's really what this place is all about.
When you walk out of the ski lockers room, you're maybe 10-15 steps from the lift line. If you need to buy or pick up lift tickets, you can do that right around the corner. You're also only a 5 minute drive into town (or you can take a shuttle or the Gondola, which is next to the building).
The unit has 3 bedrooms, a private, full bathroom in each bedroom area, and a half-bathroom in the common area. The kitchen is large with high quality Viking appliances. The lounging area with couches isn't large, but it's definitely good enough.
We went during COVID so we had to make hot tub reservations (they limited the number of people/families who could use it at one time) and get a special key to access it, but that was never an issue. The hot tub is large and wonderful.
There are always little things that can be addressed, like burned out lightbulbs and dresser knobs that are loose or falling off, but these are all minor issues. When it comes to a large, ski in/out location, this place is amazing!"
2021-03-01,5,Group trip,Such a great place! the location was everything 😌
2021-03-01,5,Group trip,Such a great location and had all of the amenities we were looking for. The beds were very comfortable and the kitchen was well stocked with everything we needed to prepare our meals. There was even a crock pot for our chicken taco night! We would definitely stay here again.
2021-02-01,5,Group trip,"Great ski in / ski out location. Very competitively priced.
Scott's communication was absolutely flawless."
2021-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Big 3 bedroom, with much needed space. Very cozy with a lot of amenities offered."
2021-01-01,5,Group trip,"It was a perfect set up for our group. Location is awesome!! Just walk out the back door to get on the lift. The hot tub at the building was not working during our stay, but we were able to use a sister property’s and a on call shuttle to take us. I would highly recommend this place."
2021-01-01,5,Group trip,"We are a “first lift” family and this place was perfect. This is high value for money because of location, location, location. It’s probably the closest you can get to the mountain (about 40 feet from the door of the ski locker room to the entry of the line on Peak 7). The line tends to be shorter here in the AM because most go past it on the Gondola. We would get 7-8K of vert in before 9:30. The free Gondola to town and the free bus worked like a charm, even during COVID. Being on the backside means you have less noise at night (though it also means the views are a bit obstructed). Definitely will try to book again."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,Amazing location steps from peak 7. Two comfortable king beds with accompanying bathrooms good for 2 people. Third bedroom/bathroom best for 1 guest only. Host answered all questions/concerns we had.
2020-12-01,5,Group trip,Scott made everything very simple for check-in and check out and did not overcomplicate anything. The unit was roomy with a very large kitchen and directly at the base of the peak 7 lift with the ski breck rental shop and lift ticket right outside. Very convenient for the avid skiier. Note that the Gondola shuts down at night so to get to town you need to either drive your own vehicle or take the Breck shttle.
2020-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Amazing location and great value during COVID. I can only imagine a much better experience with all amenities open.
2020-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Ideal location, great ski cabin feel."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Spacious, well-appointed unit with plenty of room for our family of 6. Excellent location with easy access to town, hiking, skiing, and outdoor activities. Amenities in the building were closed due to COVID-19 but would be lovely when available."
2020-10-01,5,Group trip,"The condo was surprisingly large and could accommodate more people than we had. The location is awesome with many trailheads within a couple minutes walk.
It was very clean and we did not have any problems or concerns. What a great value. Could hope to stay again in the future."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was beautiful and bigger than we expected from the pictures. It was clean and had all of the basics we needed for our stay. The only thing that was a bummer was that the gondola wasn’t running and some of the amenities were hard to have access to because of the combination of the season and COVID restrictions. Overall I would say it was a good value and we would come back especially during ski season.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Superb location!!!
2020-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,"What an excellent location! Right next to the gondola, hiking trails and beautiful mountain views. Amazing space and value for the weekend."
2020-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"I give this 4 stars because of location (5 stars), overall quality of the finishes and furniture in the unit, but this could easily be 3 stars because of the check-in issues I had (not a well organized welcome email....needs to be re-written) and because of number of issues with the unit. First, it is summer so you want to be able to open windows. The second bedroom’s windows would not open correctly so I had to take screen off and manually push it out (the handle would not catch and thus could not operate the window). The master screen door could not slide open without serious force. Then, the third bedroom has pocket doors but it took about 15 minutes to get one side to close. Then when we got it there, we had to leave it closed because it was nearly impossible to move again. The TV in the third bedroom did not work and then the last two days of our stay, we could not get DISH TV to work in any of the bedrooms. I wonder if it was a problem that the lodge was having. Also there were two doors that would not open from the outside (the hall bathroom door could not be opened from the hall and the hall closet could not be opened until maintenance guy used his screwdriver to open it and show us items inside that was for our use). Scott did answer my call about the broken items and two days later a maintenance person showed up (was supposed to schedule a time but just surprised us during lunch). He explained that bedroom door has been broken for a while and owner would not approve him repairing it. He tried to fix the window but it did not work at all. The screen door was repaired but no one ever came to check on the TV issues. So, I hate to give these honest, negative comments because this is a great property and convenience to trails and gondola is awesome. Also, the kitchen has upscale appliances and the furniture was comfortable. So much potential if the owner/manager would just pay attention to the details."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Plenty of room, nice and clean, great location. Would definitely stay again!"
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,Great stay!
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean & great amenities!
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great time - ski in and ski out with s restaurant in the back.
Would recommend for large groups"
2020-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Close to lift
2020-02-01,4,Group trip,"Amazing location in terms of access to Peak 7. Condo has good kitchen, and the group generally enjoyed. Sleeping was difficult for several in our group due to poor pillows. Would expect better given how much you are paying."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ski-in/ski-out is no exaggeration! If Peak 7 isn't for you, it's just few steps to the gondola to get to peak 8. Great spot to maximize skiing time!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location right at the gondola. Super easy ski rental on-site. Spacious condo. Would highly recommend.
2019-09-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful, spacious condo. It was spotless and the beds were SO comfortable! Definitely deserves the 5 stars we gave it!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great value. The accommodations where great and their were many amenities at the facility that made the stay enjoyable.
2019-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location, great spacious spot! Would definitely stay here again!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location....huge condo and great host. Could not be better
2019-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Excellent location. We all had a great trip! We would love to come back.
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"OUTSTANDING PLACE !!!! Been to Breckenridge 5 times - the last two were Ski In/Ski Out locations. This one is by far the best. The location is perfect - having the ski shop right there in the facility where you can buy or rent gear as well as get your tickets is ideal. Then you can walk right next door to Sevens and get a bit to eat.
Really a great location and a great house. Margie at the front desk was awesome and most helpful with suggestions for where to go in town. Both the house and the lodge were clean and well kept. Having a pool table, Jacuzzi, lockers, etc all right there was a huge bonus. Communication with Scott prior to the stay was great as well.
The checkout was great - they let you know you dont have to do anything - housekeeping takes care of everything. REALLY WELL RUN PLACE !!!
We'll definitely come back here. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!!"
2019-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely fabulous spot. Walk out the door to either the lift or gondola. Ticket office and rental shop in the building. Place itself is beautiful and well provisioned.
Only suggestion for guests is to make sure you are aware of when the gondola is running when you make your plans. It doesn't run nearly as early or late as I'd have liked."
2019-02-01,5,Group trip,"Scott's place was in a fantastic ski-in ski-out location for a great price. We have stayed at a few places within Crystal Peak Lodge over the years, and Scott's upgraded kitchen was a dream to cook in. We loved the layout with the three bedrooms down a hallway away from the living room, and a half bath in the kitchen/dining area. The condo was perfect for my husband and I, plus the two other couples who stayed with us.
The bedrooms had tons of pillows to choose from and extra covers to stay cozy at night. Every room had a humidifier which really helped us sleep in the dry conditions. Every bedroom had its own bathroom which was super convenient.
Crystal Peak Lodge itself has lots of great amenities- an outdoor hot-tub, a fitness room and shared sauna, pool, shuttle service, being right on Peak 7, in-house lift tickets & ski rentals, plus easy access to the gondola and so much more!
Hope to be back next year!"
2019-02-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The unit is large, spacious, and in a perfect location, steps away from the lift and gondola. It is pricey because of that fact. There are ski lockers, hot tub, gym and steam room as part of Crystal Peaks. You can even rent ski equipment there. Nothing can beat the convenience of that. However, our unit was not cleaned well before our arrival - likely whoever came and did the cleaning did a poor job. Communication w the host was frustrating, but we were able to get the unit cleaned again after we checked in. You may have to send messages to the host multiple times to get a response. just FYI."
2019-01-01,4,Group trip,The location couldn’t be better and really enjoyed the space!
2018-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This spot was perfect for our family of 5. It would easily accommodate multiple families or many couples with the layout....we didn’t even use one of the bedrooms/bathrooms. The location was top notch - we rode the gondola to town and to Peak 8 for our kids’ snowboarding lessons. We were able to rent and store equipment right on the property. Our family loved the pool table and hot tubs. We had everything we needed to prepare meals - the kitchen is lovely. Check in and out was super convenient and easy - the hotel staff gave us good info on where to sled (there were even sleds in the condo to share!), where to grab a quick bite, etc. We will most certainly be back. Thanks so much!"
2018-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful property with amazing ski in ski out access to Peak 7! It is a spacious unit and we were very comfortable! Highly recommend!
2018-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Scott was a great host. This was our second time to stay here. It was great both times
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time and loved this condo. Plenty of space and really clean. Beds were very comfortable and this location is awesome! This would be perfect for ski season at the base of peak 7 & 8! Great location for hiking too! We will be back!!!!!
2018-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,super clean and roomy. we loved it!
2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is simply perfect in every aspect. Great location, convenient layout, spacious, clean and very comfortable. Scott is a great host! Highly recommended!"
2018-07-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Location of the unit is right next to the front door and circular driveway and road where guests are dropped off and enter the building all hours of the night. They are not quiet to the point of not being able to sleep. The unit does not have air conditioning so the windows and doors had to stay open. Even with the doors and windows closed the noise from the street and guest pick up and drop off was disruptive. The interior 3rd bedroom was unable to hear the noise my daughter reported to me however it does not have a window so it was the hottest in the unit. The unit is beautiful, the location of the building was great and the free shuttle bus is indispensable. It would be a five star rating but unfortunately the noise from the location of the unit spoiled it for us."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful condo with high end finishes and super clean. If you like to cook, the Viking appliances are incredible. It's roomy and has the perfect location to take the gondola down to downtown Breckenridge. Each bedroom having its own bathroom is a luxury!"
2018-07-01,4,Stayed about a week,Great location on Peak 7. Easy access to town on the gondolas.
2018-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was great...more that I expected. Lots of space, clean, nice amenities. We were running around most days, but my family did enjoy the hot tubs and pool table when we were hanging around. Easy to get to town via gondola, car, or shuttle. I will definitely stay here again on my next visit."
2018-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was great. Everything we needed was there, full kitchen, laundry, and incidentals which I wasn't expecting. The place was beautiful and in the perfect location."
2018-04-01,5,Group trip,"Great location right on top of peak 7. If you’re coming from out of town, use the humidifier provided in the closet. The air gets super dry when the heater’s running."
2018-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Crystal Peak is a great location for families. It’s right at the base of Peak 7, a gondola can take non-skiers easily to Peak 8 for lessons. The beds were good and the condo was quiet. There were some minor issues with housekeeping and other small details but in the end it worked out. Thanks for your hospitality Scott."
2018-03-01,5,Group trip,"Scott’s place was outstanding! Better than the descriptions and pictures! The location cannot be beat, which was most important to our group. Literally ski in/ski out with pool tables, hot tubs, restaurant and bar. Inside, I loved the appliances, dark wood trims, tray ceilings. It was perfect for our group of 6 (2 couples and 2 singles). Scott was great with communication and very prompt to respond with any questions. I will definitely seek out this property in the future and would highly recommend to friends and family."
2018-03-01,5,Group trip,Perfect ski on ski out location. Truly steps from the Independence lift. Perfect! Would definitely stay again.
2018-02-01,5,Group trip,"We loved staying at this Condo. It was perfect for our family, Spacious, nice kitchen and decent sized living area. Also loved being on peak 7 so close to the lift and gondola. We did not use the amenities at One Ski Hill on peak 8, but the hot tubs at Crystal Peaks worked for us. Would definitely stay here again."
2018-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice place. Location can't be beat.
2018-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay at Crystal Peak. Loved the complementary shuttle to/from town. Amazing outdoor hot tubs. Ski lockers were just steps from the chair lift at Peak 7. The condo was clean and spacious for our group. Perfect spot!
2018-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed this condo. Great location and great people.
2018-01-01,5,Group trip,"Great place! The location was second to none and the amenities of Crystal Peak Lodge were outstanding. Truly Ski in/Ski out. At the base of Peak 7, pick up your rental equipment right in the lodge from Breck Sports and a twenty foot walk to get in line at the Independence Super Chair 6 person lift. Sitting in one of the two hot tubs after a long day skiing as well as the awesome steam room made recovery from the activities of the day very nice. The condo itself was very clean and the rooms were great sized with comfortable beds and a first class kitchen. My kids loved drinking hot chocolate in front of the two fire places. Having the washer/dryer in the room also made it nice and allowed us to pack a little lighter because of the ability to wash and dry nightly. Check in/Check out was very easy and Scott was always available and prompt when we had a question. Long story short, my family was not ready to leave and is now spoiled as a result of our week in Scott’s place and will not stay anywhere else when we head back to Breckenridge."
2018-01-01,4,Group trip,It's a great condo for ski in and ski out... right in the middle of everything!
2017-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great location. Well laid out space with all of the basic kitchen tools needed to cook in.
The bedspread and pillow shams in the master bedroom had fragrance from a prior guest and there was a dirty sock on the floor, but otherwise everything was very clean.
Would have been helpful to have a bit more communication in advance of the check in process, but everything worked out.
Overall I would certainly recommend this property."
2017-12-01,5,Group trip,"If youre visiting Breck to ski, I cant imagine staying anywhere more convenient. The chair is literally a few steps out the door of the ski locker room. You’re on peak 7 which is less crowded than peaks 8 or 9. The kitchen is great, with really nice appliances and a ton of room to work. There is also a free shuttle down to the town if you want to grab dinner, go shopping, or just hang out. Will be back!!"
2017-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing 1st floor condo on Peak 7. Easy access to the Gandola to Peak 8 and Downtown. Peak 7 chair lift right outside your door.
2017-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"First class 3 bed / 3.5 bath literally 100 feet from the gondola in Breckenridge. There is a cool view out of every window of the mountains and skiers zipping by in the gondola.
The unit has excellent craftsmanship in all of the trim work, cabinets, and wood blinds, tile work, and counters. The linens are clean, the closets were spacious, and the floors are in excellent condition.
The kitchen has tasteful granite counter tops, all Viking Professional appliances, a wine fridge, and any kitchen gadget that you would need to prepare food.
No detail was overlooked, from a generous supply of towels to high end shampoo and soap in every bathroom. Very strong wifi signal and Verizon signal as well.
The garage is key, especially as the weather starts to turn for the winter - no worries about scraping ice and snow off your car. And the interior steps take you right up to the unit - makes for very quick unloading of luggage and groceries.
Scott is a real pro and highly responsive. He has a high level of pride in ownership, and he certainly is offering a quality product.
I hope to be able to stay in this place again for more than just a weekend."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"This is sweet little place. So close to main street. The bed is super comfy. John was very accomodating with early check in and adjusting the temp. I was a little uneasy with no locked doors in any room or entrance. The garage door is the only secure door to the apartment from the outside. My husband had no problem sleeping. However, we enjoyed our stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Super cute place and easy walking to Main Street.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. John let me check in early and let me check out late! Everything was great. The only issue I had was that is was very cold. Said it was 65 the entire time and even turning the thermostat it stayed at that temperature. And it had snowed. But overall it was great. Maybe also shoveling the stairs for guests as well. I’m pregnant so it was a little scary. The place was great and just what we needed for the night!
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful house but this unit was tucked away in the back under the garage. Beyond that, all was well. Bed very comfortable. Wonderful shower."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"By far the best, cutest air bnb ever!! I was so impressed & the hosts were so friendly & nice. Made for an amazing stay!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful home about 4 minutes from everywhere you want to go. True one bedroom apartment, bigger than hotel. Very Warm and secluded, never saw anyone except out in drive way. Mr. John took a sincere interest in my plans to help make the most out my vacation. I wouldn't have made my flight if he didn't tell me, ""That day, that time, need to leave at 9:00 a.m.""
Great bed super hot shower, laundry to wash my snow gear. I would stay there every time I'm in town if it's available."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay. Perfect spot for a weekend getaway!

This was my first time staying in an Airbnb where the host is right upstairs, but it was a great experience and we had great privacy. The unit looked exactly like the pictures, was very clean and comfortable, perfect for two tired skiers at the end of the day. Also a very walkable location and so convenient getting to the gondola."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect crash spot for skiing in Breck!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, great location. John is a friendly host and greeted me when I checked in."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,John’s place was really great! Would recommend to anyone who wants to stay in Breckinridge.
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,John's place was a convenient place for me and my husband to stay on a quick ski trip to Breckenridge. We did hear sounds above us which is to be expected when staying in the basement unit of an older house. The bed left a bit to be desired as far as comfort but the overall value of the place was what we needed. John was a thoughtful host and we appreciated his hospitality.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and space for a quick getaway!
2024-02-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Lackluster is the best description. Location is very nice, host was fine, cost was good, but the experience and lodging was just ok. From the photos it is clear this is a basement apartment. That was ok. From the photos, the kitchen doesn’t look like much, and it isn’t. Shocking unfinished cabinetry, meager basic utensils, no cutting board or sharp knives for apres ski, no glassware, and kitchen really isn’t functional. They had a Keurig, but only one coffee cup! In the bedroom you can clearly hear footsteps, TV and talking from the residents above. I just expect more.
I was disappointed and misled by comments on this listing."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay in a fantastic location! John was really responsive when I had a question and was very accommodating. Wonderful host, location and perfect place to spend a night in Breckenridge!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"John’s place is super warm and cozy. It’s right next to town and the perfect place that’s also not in the middle of crazy traffic. I really appreciated him greeting me at the door and showing me how to get in. The space was an excellent condition and it smelled so nice, I would love to come back and stay here again"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,John was very responsive and helpful due to the crazy weather around the time of my trip! Wonderful host.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay for a short ski trip for two. Very walkable to Main Street. John gave very clear instructions for check in and the place was extremely clean and comfortable. Would definitely stay again!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,John is a gracious host. Very responsive and accommodated all our needs.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved staying here. Forgot a phone charger and the host was kind enough to lend one to me! Very clean and homey, walkable distance too all the fun activities in breck! 10/10 reccommend!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great stay! Beautiful place inside and out! I booked and got in super late. The check in instructions could use some pictures and be a little more precise. I felt bad that I woke up the host around midnight, but he was very polite and helpful! I think they usually meet their guests, but since they had it available so late at night I figured the check instructions would be specific enough that the guests could get in without disturbing the hosts. It was a great stay, super clean and very spacious, nice that the washer and dryer is right there, wished I had the time/energy to do my laundry in such a convenient location, it was so comfortable, I slept past the check out time!"
2023-12-01,4,Stayed one night,A great place near downtown Breck. Very clean but also a bit high priced for the amenities.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"John’s place was great! Communication, check in, expectations, quality of stay - all great! Would 100% book again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,It was the perfect place after a day of snowboarding!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"John and his wife were just the best hosts’ ever!! Not only did they allow us an early check in but they also allowed us a late check out.
The Airbnb is located in a prime location for walking everywhere.
There were plenty of blankets and extra pillows for us to use in the Airbnb itself also.
We will definitely book with them again when we return to Breckenridge. :)"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,John’s place exceeded our expectations and was even better than what the pictures showed. Thoughtful amenities and very walkable to Main Street. Great value and would highly recommend!

2023-11-01,4,Stayed one night,"john was very attentive on his phone and able to answer any questions I had quickly. This basement apartment was in a great location and was very clean.
I would have appreciated some type of curtain or bind coverings, though, for the escape windows in the living area and the bedroom. although you couldn't look straight in, anyone could have looked in while we were sleeping."
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"John's place is cozy and the location is fantastic. It's within walking distance to downtown Breckenridge, it was cozy and it was clean. I'd say that the only concerns I had was that there was no soundproofing from upstairs to downstairs, and that the garage door was the only lock to the basement apartment. Other than that, this is a great place to stay and has everything you need for a weekend getaway."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful place, close to town."

Thanks for letting us stay a little longer than your check out time. Loved being in Breckenridge with easy walk into town. It's a beautiful area. Appreciated the little extras, laundry soap and ability to do a quick load. Only thing is we are tea drinkers and the Kurock machines make the water taste terrible for tea. Highly recommend a stainless steal tea kettle for heating water. Other than that...perfect!"

2022-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay in this clean basement apartment with a great location, but there is zero view, not even a tree, much less a mountain. This place needs some inexpensive upgrades:there’s no bureau for your clothes, an itsy-bitsy-teeny-tiny table to eat at. The TV is VERY old, not smart, so your Netflix account won’t work. No curtains on the windows and 3 ceiling lights out."

2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great and cozy stay. Easy short downhill walk to town center
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,The location is great and everything was super clean! Such a cute house!!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a great Airbnb experience! John was very quick to respond provided easy instructions. We had the entire basement that had a living room area, kitchen, washer dryer, bathroom and good sized bedroom. It was in an amazing location that was walking distance to Main Street. Fair pricing too. Highly recommend!"
2021-11-01,3,Stayed one night,The accommodations were adequate and the price was very reasonable for the convenient location. The studio is within walking distance of the old downtown. The studio is located downstairs underneath the house and garage. The noise of the residents living upstairs can be heard but is not a disturbance to the enjoyment of the studio.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Quiet and within walking distance of shops and restaurants. Parking is easy too.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,I would highly recommend John’s place.
2021-09-01,4,Stayed one night,Nice
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute place for a quick stay that's very close to downtown. Will book again if I have another short Weekend getaway. Thanks John!
2021-09-01,4,Stayed one night,Great location in town. Walking distance to main street. John provides excellent communication on amenities and check-in instructions. The place is very clean and spacious for a 1 bedroom/1 bath basement apartment. We would definitely stay again!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great find in Breck! Walkable to town, easy parking, and the private basement is great for a few people. Would definitely stay again!"
2021-09-01,3,Stayed one night,Great location. Just a short walk to town.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Johns place is always the best! He’s such an attentive host and this is not my first time staying with him. If you get the chance to stay with him, do it!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The location was perfect for us. Quite street, short walk to restaurants, shops and bars. Spacious setup and comfortable."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"John was very nice, the location is great right off the Main Street few blocks up"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The listing is accurate. Everything was clean and well-stocked. The hosts were very accommodating. The location is perfect as it is extremely convenient but is far enough away from the late-night noise on the main street. We enjoyed browsing the book collection and were very happy with our stay here.
2021-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Convenient location to downtown where you can walk to the shops and restaurants. Check in was an easy process. Only stayed one night but the room was very comfortable and the small kitchen area was great for making coffee and tea. There are no curtains or blinds on the bedroom and living room windows, so you may want to bring something to cover them with if the outdoor lights bother you. 10/10 would recommend to anyone looking for an affordable place in town."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic stay. Clean, cozy, and all the amenities you could want. John was very helpful and responsive. Would absolutely stay here again!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"John's home is very quaint and is only ~5 minute walk to Main St, which was a prime location. The home is set back away from the hustle and bustle of Main St and has a little walking trail behind it. He had shower essentials, cold water, and two beers in the fridge upon our arrival. John was extremely helpful in providing us with some great food options which we took advantage of. I would definitely recommend staying here!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,John has a very quiet place in a great central location in Breckenridge. Only three or four blocks to Main Street where all the shops and restaurants are located. We enjoyed our stay.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Excellent stay at John's - the location can't be beat, <5 min walking to the heart of Breckenridge. The space itself is lovely, could honestly be marketed as ""Entire Apartment"" rather than a shared space, since you have your own entrance, living room, kitchen, bathroom, etc. Highly recommend, will be back any time I'm in the area!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really enjoyed staying here. Perfect location, everything was clean, and John was great at communicating. Highly recommend!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome location. We spent one night just passing through on a road trip and had an awesome time.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay at John's place. Nice and close to downtown Breck. Clean, quiet, and comfy."
2021-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"Ultimately, this was a great find. You absolutely cannot beat the location for this price. We were a brief 5 minute walk from Main Street, so we saved a lot on parking.
Pros: clean, easy to find, clear instructions for entry, close to Main Street, had all the basics we needed (coffee, water stocked in the fridge, some local beers to try)
Cons: it’s a basement unit, so you can hear footsteps above you. The bed was very firm—totally personal preference, but a little too much for us.
Would stay here again!"
2021-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"Cute home nestled only blocks from downtown Breckinridge. Great communication, and instructions in directions. And how to access home. Hope to visit again soon! Thank you John!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay! The place was very clean and tidy and had everything we expected. The location is unbeatable since it’s only a 5 minute walk to Main Street. We will definitely stay again and recommend it highly! If you are an early to bed person, just keep in mind this is a basement unit in a lovely older home, so some noise from upstairs is to be expected. Nothing out of the ordinary however, and it was completely quiet after 10pm."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,A convenient and wonderful place to stay. John is a fantastic host. Will definitely return.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a perfect location. And a cute little spot with privacy and very clean also.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,The basement unit was perfect for our trip - only blocks away from Main Street yet very quiet at night if you need to wake up early. John was quick to respond to our messages and the place was equipped with more than we needed. (Amazing hot showers after the end of a long day of hiking!) Hope to stay again in the future if we end up in town - and would recommend for anyone looking for an easy (and clean) stay.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I came a little early for a wedding and needed somewhere to stay to explore Breckenridge. It was clean, right on the edge of downtown, a 5 min walk to Main Street. It was easy to come and go through the private entrance. Overall a great value!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"John's place is cute, clean, and has everything you need for a quiet, convenient stay in Breckenridge. Felt right at home."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful location and a great space to stay in. Quiet and clean. A great space to stay at in breck.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect location for a getaway in Breck! The property has everything you could possibly need and the proximity to Main St. makes it a perfect home base for your time in Breckinridge!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice basement unit. John and his wife were friendly and helpful. Location was excellent, a few blocks from the main commercial part of town and next to a trailhead. Bed was very comfortable and shower was excellent. Pullout couch has seen better days but I slept ok in it."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Can't beat the location or the facilities (spotless, well-appointed). John was a great host, even pitched in to help me move my motorcycle to a better place to resume my journey."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"John’s guest suite is the perfect spot for anyone coming through Breckenridge! We only stayed for one night, but the suite had everything we needed - washer, dryer, fridge, hot shower, and a cozy bed. There’s even a PS2 and some games (including Tony Hawk Pro Skater!). It’s also walking distance to downtown, so we got to spend the evening out getting pizza and crepes, then enjoyed the beautiful walk back to the suite. We will be recommending this place to everyone we know!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very cozy, clean, spacious, comfortable, private, and has everything you might need! Amazing location only a few minute walk to Main Street. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a nice central place in breckenridge!"
