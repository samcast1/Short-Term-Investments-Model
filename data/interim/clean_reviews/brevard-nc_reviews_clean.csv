The apartment is located on their beautiful property that truly felt like something out of a fairy tale. The apartment itself was very cozy and had so many special touches. The location was a perfect homebase for our Mountain Bike vacation - located super close to the Pisgah Ranger District as well as close to many restaurants and the grocery store. Missy and Chris provided so many helpful suggestions of places to eat and things to do. Based on their recommendation we rode our bikes to Oskar Blues one night for beer and dinner! When we had a mechanical issue on one of our bikes, Missy and Chris were so gracious and lent us their bike pump as well as an offer to use any tools we may have needed.

2023-02-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Susie was generous to allow us to come In a bit early . We had a long and cold rainy drive in from florida. The location is pretty close to town within walking distance, maybe a bit far in rainy weather. There tons of restaurants in the area . Very safe neighborhood and we appreciate even the cute stream in the back yard. Only two mentions for place it would be a-little better if there was a curtain on bathroom shower area just person preference. Your not in full view or anything just feels more private . Only other concern we had was home add a bit of a moisture smell . In fairness highly sensitized to it due to allergies and it rained quite a bit recently which I am not sure contributes to it."

We used the kitchen to cook dinner one night and had everything we needed. It was nice to have a dining room table to eat meals at. My husband used the large desk in the living room to work at in the evenings. The location was great for what we were doing in the area. Susie is quick to respond to questions and even left us a voicemail when a particular light went out prior to our visit and couldn't be replaced. It wasn't a big deal as the bathroom had another light, but we appreciate the communication and transparency. The only reason for the 4 star for cleanliness was there was dog hair in the living room and on the couch. The rest of the cottage was very clean!"
2022-03-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Fantastic stay!!!!!! Only reason for 4 out of 5 stars is that we ran into issues with the wifi a few times that required rebooting.

2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Susie’s place is the perfect combination of quaint and peaceful! The location is perfect for exploring the beautiful neighborhoods around downtown and perfect for those never wanting to get back into your vehicle to experience all of what downtown has to offer.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was such a cute and cozy home that had everything we needed for our stay! Communication with Susie was a breeze.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I wish I could give this cottage 6 stars or more. It is more charming than the pictures demonstrate, was meticulously clean, well stocked and in
good repair. Modern kitchen appliances with well stocked kitchen. The hostess even provides many toiletries and coffee. Susie was very responsive and helpful when we had questions. We would very much like to stay there again on future visits to family in the area."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Lovely cottage perfect for two.
Postives:
Cute, interesting architecture inside. 1 BR on main level with bathroom. Kitchen and second bathroom downstairs.
Walking distance to downtown Brevard.
Well stocked kitchen with spices, cooking oil, slat pepper, sugar, etc., and a cannister of ground coffee in the fridge.
Nice oven and stove, lots of pots, pans, plates, bowls, glasses, cups, even a salad spinner.
Nicely decorated inside, homey, lots of knickknacks.
Two bathrooms - one in the main level BR, one downstairs opposite the kitchen table.
Nice big yard behind the house.
Nice family room comfy couch and chairs, flatscreen (we brought our own Roku), desk with chair.
In a nice quiet neighborhood quite suitable for walking the dog.
Negatives:
House had a pronounced musty smell. We had to air it out when we checked in. Odor probably came from musty basement, but also bathroom on main level.
Overall, a great stay. We would definitely stay here again. If you plan on eating in, this place works well. Walkable to town, too."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Lovely cottage in a great location, cute layout, comfortable bed. We saw a white squirrel outside the dining room window!"

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cottage on Laurel is a perfect location if you're planning a stay in the Brevard area. The cottage is in easy walking distance of downtown Brevard with easy access to the national forest and the Blueridge Parkway. Susie is a great host and has completely outfitted the house for anyone who schedules a stay. The kitchen and bathrooms are better outfitted than any other BnB in which we've stayed. We arrived very late our first night and Susie had left many lights on for us. We can't think of anything we would have needed for our stay that Susie hadn't already thought about. We will be back!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and a really cute and cozy home! Would love to stay here again! It was perfect.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,Excellent house in an excellent location. Very clean and comfortable stay with communicative and pleasant hosts. We hiked all over Pisgah and Dupont. This was a great base camp. Would stay there again for sure.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place has it all. Great walking distance from all that downtown has to offer (.5 miles to center of city), beautiful furnishings, cozy feel. We didn't realize that Halloween was such a ""thing"" in Transylvania County and were presently surprised to see a host of holiday activities geared toward that theme. We saw our fist white squirrel when we were unpacking the car and another one as we were getting ready to leave! Hiking, great beer and fabulous food were all within easy reach. We will be back for sure!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect cozy cottage convenient to downtown- just the right size for my husband and I plus the pup. We were in town for a wedding and also enjoyed DuPont and Pisgah while we were there. Hope to be back someday.

We will definitely be visiting again!!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. It was perfect for two people. Clean, cozy, well appointed. The kitchen has everything needed to make any meal. Two full bathrooms also added to the convenience. We had a great time sitting on the back porch in the evenings or playing with our dog in the back yard. The location was very convenient; walkable to downtown. We’ll certainly stay here again next time we go to Brevard."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute and cosy cottage to stay in and just right for two. Enjoyed sitting out on the back deck under the trees in the evening making the most of the beautiful and secluded back yard. Great location for exploring Pisgah area and with an easy walk into Brevard for dinner and exploring down town. Highly recommend staying here if you get the chance.
2021-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Cute cottage perfect for a couple wanting to explore the Brevard area. It’s been remodeled very nicely. The basement is the kitchen, with the Den & Bedroom on main level. My only change would be to consider putting a king bed in the BR. So, if you don’t mind sleeping in a queen, you’re good to go. TV does have local stations but nothing else unless you want to use your Netflix, Amazon or Hulu accounts on the TV apps. Again, a great rental home for the value & location there in Brevard!👍😁"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little place and walking distance to downtown. We'd definitely rent it again.
2021-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Cute cottage in a nice neighborhood. Close to town and short drives to waterfalls. Very clean.

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This delightful little cottage was tucked away on a very private and quiet street. The work Susie and her husband have done on the home modernized the space but did not detract from the charm of it's 1930's era. The space was clean, quiet, cozy and safe. The A/C system was amazing and kept us cool on a few hot and humid days. The hot water was instant and hot! Even though there is one bedroom, it was super convenient to have two bathrooms! The bed was very comfortable and the kitchen was stocked with everything you could possibly need.
I loved that it was a very short walk (.5 mile) to downtown Brevard. The best part of the walk was the white squirrel that we spotted daily in front of the same house just a few doors down.
All in all a lovely stay with many things to do in the general area from shopping to biking to hiking."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I absolutely loved my short stay at Susie's cottage. It is as cute as the pictures suggest! The location is great- just a short drive or longer walk to downtown- and the house is well-equipped with everything you might need.

2021-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the little quaint feeling of the cottage. It is so close to town and minutes from great mountain bike trails and hiking trails. This place is great for a couple and I liked having two bathrooms. The back patio made for a great spot to enjoy morning coffee. We made meals every night and found the kitchen to be adequately stocked with almost everything we needed. The Brita in the fridge was a nice touch, and it was nice having plenty of coffee for each morning. All in all we had a great time and would highly recommend it for a nice getaway."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super cute cottage. My husband and I stayed with our dog for our 28th wedding anniversary. Went to hike the lovely waterfalls in the area.

Susie was very helpful for dinner suggestions and hikes. Easy checkin and check out.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My dog and I loved Susie’s cottage. The house was so cute and everything we could have wanted. The location was perfect— only a short walk to downtown or quick trip up into the national forest for hikes. Couldn’t have asked for a better stay!

It was VERY clean, and the attention to being COVID-mindful was evident. The location was fantastic - we walked downtown a couple times and enjoyed the local shops.
The house is only 10 minutes from property we just purchased, so it’s nice to know there is a perfect Airbnb available for the back and forth. We will 100% be back."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a sweet and precious cottage! My husband and I were so lucky to be able to stay here for a few days over Christmas. It was extremely clean, a great location, and we can’t wait to stay again!"

2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Coziest little cottage. Perfect location.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We loved everything about our stay at the cottage. Location is perfect, walking distance to downtown and just a short 10-15 minutes in the car to stellar hiking routes. Pisgah never fails to impress. We like to cook most of our own meals and the kitchen here is great. All of the appliances are high quality and the space is very functional. Washer and dryer make for clean hiking clothes every day without over packing :) The bedroom is cozy and does make you feel like you are nestled in the trees. Our dog appreciated the big backyard. It is not entirely fenced in but is protected/secluded enough that as long as I was with her she was fine playing off leash. Parking was easy and check in/out is a breeze. If I could give more ""stars"" I would. Highly recommend. We will be back!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cozy little cottage was perfect. It was very clean, comfortable, and had everything we needed. We hope to come again and would highly recommend"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect little spot for a traveling couple. We loved how close we were to downtown Brevard (walking distance) and how quiet the neighborhood was. We were very close to the hikes we planned as well. Brevard is such a cute little town with so many great options that it can be tough to choose sometimes and I feel like the cottage is a perfect representation of the town. We brought our dog too and she loved the area due to the walkability and abundance of squirrels! A trip we never forget and would love to return again in the future.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Susie’s Place was just what we needed to escape Election Day and all of the vote tabulations. DuPont State Forest and Pisgah National Forest provided miles and miles of wonderful hiking trails. We dined outside at three local restaurants: Marcos Tratorria, The Squre Root and Sunrise Cafe. Susie has COVID cleaning procedures in place and provided sanitizing wipes, sprays and hand sanitizer. We were blessed with incredible weather, which only heightened the experience. Had wine and cheese on the deck and enjoyed watching the Brevard white squirrels in the yard. Will definitely try to return."

Close to town - good value - certainly happy we found this rental - enjoy all the area has to offer -
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cute cottage is such a lovely gem in Brevard! It’s extremely convenient to the quaint downtown of Brevard as well as some beautiful hikes & sights in the Pisgah National Forest. If you have extra time to explore, we discovered a beautiful family owned farm & orchard only about 20 minutes away - Jeter Mountain Farm. We’ll definitely be back to the area and would love to stay in this space again!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This cottage was absolutely perfect! I have high standards for cleanliness and this place felt very clean which is so important right now. The cottage itself is walkable to downtown but the area was very quiet. We had a toddler and a dog and we had a great time just hanging out in the back yard. The whole place was well stocked with essentials and the kitchen had everything I needed to cook. We loved the personality of this cottage and would absolutely stay again for our next visit to brevard.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely cottage, everything you could need and more. We wanted to get away, see some mountains and waterfalls and Brevard did not disappoint.

It was close to so many hiking trails. The kitchen had many useful utensils. Home was very clean.House seemed much larger on the inside compared to what is seen from the street. Very thoughtfully furnished. We loved it."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stay here as often as you can! This is such a lovely cottage and our stay could not have been lovelier. The house itself is reminiscent of a cottage in the English countryside and it is immaculately furnished. Susie was very responsive and the pricing was perfect. We will definitely make this our go to stay whenever we can get up to Brevard. This was simply charming and homey.
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Location is great and I love the layout of this cottage. Everything was super clean and cozy.

2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here! My sister and I were here for a short hiking trip in the area. The cottage was a really close drive to lots of great waterfalls, but also close to downtown for easy quick takeout meals (we enjoyed Pad Thai, The Cardinal Drive-In, and Blue Ridge Bakery). The cottage was just as cute as the pictures look--tons of natural light upstairs with the living room and bedroom. Porch looked tranquil, though it was unseasonably cold so we didn't go out there. We saw this is as a bit of splurge for a hiking getaway, but it was totally worth it!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is an adorable cottage in a perfect location to enjoy the parks and beauty of Brevard. Superhost provides thoughtful touches that make you feel right at home. Lovely 💕

2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at this adorable cottage! The location was perfect. We were able to walk to downtown Brevard.
We did some cooking and the kitchen had everything we needed. The back porch was one of our favorite spots at the house.
Just a heads up if you're tall (my husband is 6'9""), you may have to duck a bit in the downstairs area as the ceiling is a little low. But if you're average-normal height, you should be just fine. :)
We would absolutely stay here again."

2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A cute house just a ten min walk from mainstreet Brevard. Beautifully furnished with a real eye for little touches and guest comfort. I could live there. We stayed around town for this trip, but this would be a great base-camp for day-trips into Pisgah and beyond."

2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Susie’s home was impeccably clean and well organized. It has everything you need for a stay in Brevard. It’s within walking distance to downtown, a quick drive to any of the grocery stores in town, and about a 10 minute drive to the entrance to Pisgah. Perhaps the most convenient thing about the home was the kitchen. It has all of the essentials(olive oil, seasonings, condiments, tea, coffee, etc) for cooking away from home, which is not always the case with AirBnB’s. We would absolutely stay there again! Thanks Susie for a wonderful stay!"

It was everything I was hoping for my solo visit to Brevard."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thanks so much!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house is beautiful & only a short drive to town. Don't count on Ubers to get home lol. We made that mistake and ended up walking home after the White Squirrel Festival 😂🍺🦦. Other than that house is 10/10. Very peaceful. Good location.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely cabin! Convenient to Brevard and surrounding area. Quality touches throughout - linens, beds, furniture, coffee, toiletries, and well stocked kitchen.
Great spot for star gazing!
My 85 y.o. MIL was with us - the steps up from the drive may require supervision for the very young, or very old. She managed with assistance and once inside was fine. I would also note that we were aware of this when we selected this home as it was clear in the description. We would still choose it again. We had a wonderful stay!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay in this beautiful mountain retreat! The cabin was clean, easy to find, and felt secluded from the world, while still being just minutes from downtown and the National Forests. Couldn’t have asked for a better weekend getaway!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location looking out over the French Broad River valley. You can tell the host takes great pride in the property.. best equipped property that we have ever stayed with. Close to Brevard and highly recommend!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved the location. It was so peaceful and relaxing. Home was very nice and comfy. Will come back! Thank you Jackie!!
2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful cabin and we appreciated the excellent heating and gas fireplace during some very cold weather. Comfortable bed and very well equipped kitchen. We knew the area and had no trouble finding it, esp. with the clear instructions. The stone steps that others have commented on were a problem for one of us. Also, the numerous windows in the living/dining room give a nice view but need some blinds, esp. in the dining room. The morning sun was blinding in the winter as it rose over the mountain and we could not sit at the table until afternoon. We appreciated the quick response to our request to book on short notice, and the easy access to town."
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,This house was perfect for us this weekend! Amazing location. Would recommend this house for anyone. Look forward to going back.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,excellent ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay at the French Broad Cabin. The cabin was clean and comfortable. It’s a great location for popping into downtown Brevard. Our only note is that there are not curtains or blinds on the large windows/sliding doors in the living room area. While the they provide a beautiful view, at times the sun was very bright in that space and there was no way to block it. Overall we had a great stay at the cabin."
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Our family had a wonderful family vacation at the French Broad cabin. It was a comfortable and peaceful place that was very clean and had all the amenities we needed. We had no trouble getting in touch with the host. We would love to stay there again sometime.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful visit!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful time and hope to go back another time!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay at the French Broad Cabin. The location is great just outside of Brevard. The owners were prompt to respond from our request to book through our departure. The cabin was a great place for our arge family to gather while visiting Brevard.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our third stay at the French Broad Cabin. I can't recommend it highly enough.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The French Broad Cabin is wonderful. Even better than the pictures and description, which are fantastic. The space was comfortable and clean and we felt right at home. Check in and out were a breeze. The location is both convenient but also private and quiet. We hope to visit again in the future when back in the area."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, very nice Cabin. We really enjoyed our stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful trip- easy access to Brevard and to beautiful mountain views. And hosts were very responsive!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at the French Broad Cabin! The home is the second one of three on a long driveway, but we could not see the others from where we were because of beautiful trees and landscaping around the homes. We actually didn’t really see the other two homes at all.
The cabin had a beautiful wooden interior that we loved! It was very cozy, and the views from the balcony were breathtaking. The drive into Brevard was short, and we enjoyed the local shops and restaurants.
There were LOTS of towels available in the bathrooms! That was really nice. Like, a closet full of extra towels.
The dining room table was round with 4 chairs. 4 additional chairs were stacked under a cabinet, and the table comfortably seated 6 for dinner. Additional bar seating was available at the kitchen island.
We had no complaints and would stay here again if we are in the area!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"The cabin location was beautifully nestled in a serene location. Looking out the balcony or the top floor at the view, was absolutely breathtaking. I can’t tell you how many times family kept saying that this cabin was the perfect choice. The beds were so comfortable, the kitchen is well equipped with everything you could need. I would absolutely rent this cabin again and highly recommend."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a nice and peaceful place to stay. We would definitely rent this house again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very convenient to Brevard- just minutes away. Beautiful view of the mountains from the upper deck. Perfect little getaway!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,We’ve been renting in Brevard for over five years for family reunion weekends and by far this was the best cabin! We loved the layout of the home which worked so well for our group. There was plenty of all the right kitchen ware and the beds and linens were all so comfy. The property was amazing! Jackie encourages her guests to wander the property which my husband and I did with our two youngest granddaughters at sunset. We all enjoyed seeing the fields of corn and wild flowers. Our group thoroughly enjoyed our stay and hope to be returning guests. Thank you Jackie!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay! It was exactly what we were looking for! Beautiful cabin home with a beautiful view! We will be back, as our baby girl now attends college in the area! Thanks for allowing us to stay in your home!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was beautiful cabin and we would definitely stay there again if we were in the area. It was clean, comfortable, fully stocked, close to many great sights and in a beautiful setting. The hosts had great instructions and recommendations and I enjoyed the history that it used to be a boys camp. We highly recommend it!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is great. It was clean and very well stocked with everything we needed. It is comfortable and homey and set on a beautiful property. It's a easy 5 minute drive to downtown; restaurants, grocery store, etc. And it was very quiet and peaceful. It is quite close to the highway which did not bother us at all but just mentioning in case others want to know. I would recommend to friends and would stay here again. Communication from Jackie and Katie was quick, helpful, and friendly."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jackie’s French Broad Cabin was quiet, peaceful and beautiful. The beds were new and wonderful. Fully stocked kitchen tools and dishes. Exactly like the pictures. We are coming back in two weeks! And staying here again. It was great for us and two teenage daughters. We got to make full meals in the kitchen which saved money as well. Slept like a baby. Dark, cool and quiet bedrooms. The perfect stay."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our short stay. The location is great-only a short drive into town or to Dupont State Park. Although near the highway, it was quiet and peaceful. The cabin itself is beautiful and my wife kept migrating to the cozy chair near the sunlight coming through all of those large windows."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! We had so much fun exploring the town and area! Loved the cabin, and felt right at home"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here. Great location with easy access to downtown Brevard, and close to local rivers. Clean and comfortable space with everything we needed. I’d definitely recommend it."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We very much do enjoyed our stay! Definitely recommend this place & would stay again ♥️
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a great place to stay in Brevard. Very near town but still feels you’re in the mountains. When we return to the area we will check to see if Jackie’s place is available before we book anywhere else!
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"The cabin was beautiful and a great location, close to Brevard, trails and waterfalls. Jackie was very responsive and the cabin was clean and as described. We will definitely return when we visit Brevard again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"French Broad Cabin was in an ideal location and was a charming home for our vacation. The cabin is spotless and better than the pictures. It has a well appointed living area, cosy bedrooms, and a deck that provides a peaceful space to wind down after a day of hiking. We felt very much at home and highly recommend it to others."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a very beautiful place all around very comfortable and cozy. Stay would recommend anybody.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The French Broad cabin was an amazing place to stay! Super convenient and close to all the awesome restaurants, breweries and hiking trails in Brevard. The views were also beautiful. My sister and her friends rented the Little French Broad and we were able to easily walk from our place to theirs!
Would highly recommend! Easy 5 Stars! :-)"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute cabin located close to downtown Brevard. Host was very responsive. House was clean and well kept.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great time at Jackie’s place. The house is beautiful inside and has everything we needed. Definitely would come back!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The French broad cabin truly has that cabin feel, all wood inside, plenty of authentic furniture. The loft with three single beds is extremely convenient with kids. Would have preferred not to be so close to the highway with the noise and lights, but it was barely noticeable. Only minutes away from downtown Brevard, as well as the Dupont Forest, perfect location."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great stay in a great location!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is beautiful. We loved it for our weekend getaway. Just far enough that you felt you had some privacy and quiet, but a five minute drive from anywhere in town. I absolutely recommend staying here!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed at a lot of places in the Brevard area while mountan biking and this one has topped them all. One of the nicest in the Brevard area for a group of Mountain Bikers, perfect location and perfect space."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful cabin right by the river. Within minutes to downtown Brevard which has great restaurants and shopping. Cabin was very spacious and had all the amenities to make you feel at home. Beautiful decor and plants. There was plenty of room for our family of four. Great experience, and we will definitely be back!"
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"The cabin was outfitted with high quality sheets, linens, lotions, shampoos, kitchen supplies, furniture, games, TV, Roku streaming device, wifi -- you name it. Convenient to Brevard which had awesome shopping and restaurants and hiking even though it was freezing cold! Also very easy to get to Asheville.
When the upstairs pipes froze, they were there in minutes to help us find a solution on Christmas Eve!
We felt a little cramped when we first got there (a family of four couples and one single) but soon adjusted and the high ceilings and huge windows helped that a lot.
Would recommend 100%."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We thought this cabin was outstanding. Exactly what we hoped for when we booked. It delivered. Beyond quickly responsive hosts on the AirBnB message app, perfect location near Brevard and Hendersonville, and little touches around the house really made it feel like a home in the mountains. Highly recommend for a family get together in the winter."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent! We will be back.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,I swear this was the best place ever me and my family didn’t want to leave everything was perfect we drove from Florida to stay and everything was perfect it felt like home… when your ready let us know when we can move in
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"You will love your stay here...great location, clean, and well furnished! Communication was great! It's very quiet and peaceful and just a few steps from the French Broad River."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jackie's place is the perfect getaway. While situated next door to another cabin, the location feels secluded and was peaceful and quiet. The primary views from the cabin are of nature (a large beautiful cornfield) and the morning and late afternoon light cause the interior of the cabin to glow (makes for very beautiful family captures!). This place felt more personal than other AirBnb's with all the little touches--real plants, fully stocked with helpful items like sandwich bags and sharpies, homemade quilts, lots of extra towels and even safety features like an escape ladder. Not to mention, the town of Brevard is adorable and just a few minutes drive away!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our family of four thoroughly enjoyed our few days in Brevard at the French Broad Cabin. The house and grounds are so tranquil and beautiful. The town has such a great vibe. The surrounding forests and mountains offer no shortage of opportunities for recreational activities. We look forward to returning again soon!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great cabin, great location. Will be back again soon!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of the best Air BNB’s I’ve stayed in! It’s a true log cabin home and has all the comfort of home! Located 1 minute from the French Broad river. Highly recommend this place! We will be back
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was exactly as described on the website and more! Well located and convenient to town. We enjoyed the stay!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a great spot- exactly as described. Easy check in/out and well-equipped. Would definitely go back if we are back in the neighborhood!
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,Fantastic stay. Very convenient location to downtown Brevard. Loved it.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful location that is both convenient to downtown Brevard but just far enough out to give the property a quiet, cozy, and secluded feel. The cabin view is wonderful (a gorgeous field of lush-green late-season corn was our front yard). The physical space was both communal and private, clean and comfortable … which made our rain day not a big deal. Lots of space for a family of five to spread out and claim reading nooks, and watch the steady rain. The owners were gracious and very response. Thanks, Jackie and Katie, for a great Labor Day holiday get away!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,The cabin is decorated really nice and loved the views with all the green. Location is perfect near all the quaint shops and restaurants. Highly recommended.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Enjoyed a wonderful time in the Brevard area staying at Jackie’s beautiful and well appointed French Broad Cabin. Rent it. You won’t be disappointed! Although one small warning. The stone steps leading up to the cabin are a bit uneven so anyone with mobility issues might be challenged getting in and out. But the place is well worth! By far one of the best Airbnbs we’ve stayed at!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved our time at Jackie’s house. It was central to downtown Brevard and easy access to Pisgah and DuPont. The house was very comfortable for our family of five and extremely well appointed. We hope to stay again!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cabin was in a very convenient location and the property itself is super beautiful would absolutely stay again
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Another wonderful trip to Brevard and this special cabin.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay. Very welcoming, clean, and comfortable. Excellent location as well."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, comfortable home in a very quite, private location very close to Brevard and the Pisgah Forest where there are many waterfalls to enjoy! Jackie responds quickly to any inquiries, a great host!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is even more beautiful than it looks in pictures. It is lovingly decorated, every little touch special and thought out, chosen for peace, comfort and relaxation. The views out the windows are just gorgeous. The location is incredible. I recommend everything about this place!!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is exactly as described. Extremely clean, very easy check in, and great communication from the host. Plenty of parking available and myself and all of my family members that stayed here had perfect service here the entire time. The view outside from the porch is incredible at night! Would absolutely recommend staying here!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay in the French Broad Cabin. It was super comfortable and had everything we needed for a relaxing stay. The kitchen and bathrooms were perfectly stocked, and the beds and bathrooms were great. We loved the log-cabin feel inside and the houseplants made it feel very homey. The location was perfect! It was only 20 minutes from Dupont State Forest and the town of Brevard was just 5 minutes up the road. We loved it."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot, great host!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second stay. Love the place. We'll be back for a third round, for certain."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is a great place to stay. It is very clean and has nice amenities.
While we were there we went to Biltmore (about an hour away), Hendersonville (to a wine festival, great little town to explore), and went on a pontoon boat ride on Glenville Lake. We ate at a couple nice places....the outside patio at Cedar Mountain Cafe was nice and also the Sierra Nevada Brewery outside of Ashville. We hiked both Dupont and Pisgah to view some waterfalls. The outside balcony at the cabin overlooks a corn field and was a nice place to sit after a day away. There are some slightly uneven stone steps up to the entrance, but it was not a problem for us. We would definitely stay in this cabin again."
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,"We have stayed in several airbnb homes, and this was one of our best experiences.
Communication and directions to the home were excellent. We arrived at night and found the home without difficulty.
The location and grounds are also very nice. The cabin is close to Brevard but just far enough out to get a good dark night sky and you don't feel like you're ""in town"". It's an easy drive to Asheville or Greenville.
The home itself was spotless. Appliances were modern and mostly higher-end. Nice towels. Good sheets. Comfy beds. Nice LG washer & dryer. With three kids in tow, I cooked a lot of dinners and packed lunches to take on hikes, and the kitchen supplies were not lacking.
The home itself is very nice. I'd say nicer than the pictures, actually. The wood paneling gives it a very cozy feel. The seating is comfortable with modern lines.

There are ample lighting sources, as well, with general, task and ambient illumination provided by an array of interesting fixtures. (Good lighting is often overlooked by homeowners, and I appreciated this attention to detail.)
Historic photos and interesting information about the history of the property are also presented, which gives some context to the place.
Overall a very relaxing, comfortable, clean and pleasant place to stay."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved our stay. Accommodations were so nicely done, well thought through and inspiring. The history of the cabin was a special touch to learn about and enjoy. Views are peaceful and just lovely.
Kitchen was well appointed and stocked with necessities. We'd most definitely come back!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jackie’s cabin was perfect for our family. Plenty of room for 4 adults and 2 young kids. My little ones loved the blocks and toys upstairs while the grownups enjoyed the cozy gas fireplace at nighttime. Overall, we loved our stay and would love to stay here again on our next trip to Brevard."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"this cabin far exceeded our expectations! it was 6 of us, 3 adults and 3 kids and all the details didn't go unnoticed! Jackie included basics like toilet paper, shampoo/conditioner, soap, cleaning supplies. other Airbnb's I've stayed in we have had to provide all of these things. also, plenty of towels! the location was perfect, you felt like you were in the woods but really only 5 mins from downtown Brevard! we will definitely stay here again!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful stay in this lovely cabin and property. Very clean and well furnished. Location is great with a short drive into town and close to many waterfalls! Would definitely stay again.
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,"Amazing cabin!! One of the best cabins I’ve stayed at. We came for a ski trip, but wasn’t able to ski. This cabin mad up for it all. We still had a great time!!"
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,"Jackie is AMAZING! There are not enough words to describe how amazing, thoughtful, and kind she truly is!
The cabin is roomy, the view is stunning, it has so much natural light, the fire place warms the whole down and upstairs! Brevard is a cute little town! And downtown is so adorable! We were lucky enough that during our stay it snowed covering the fields, tress, and cabin creating a magical feel to the place. Everyone who stayed here wants to return in the other seasons! It's close enough to Asheville to do day trips to see the city and different locations around the city, close to hiking, the French Broad River is a shot walk away! Perfect for writing retreats, family vacation, romantic getaways! The cabin is clean, the beds are comfortable, the internet is great, there are ample towels (we had a group of girls haha), extra blankets! We 100% plan on stay here again! Thank you for the most fantastic experience!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Probably the very nicest Airbnb of about 14 that I have stayed in.
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,The home was inviting and warm for our weekend getaway. Jackie was quick to respond and was very accommodating. The home was close to downtown and to a great hiking spot. I'll definitely considering staying again the next time I'm in Brevard!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Christmas Getaway. Everything was remarkable! The location was fabulous and the cabin itself was exactly what we were wanting for a peaceful, beautiful Christmas getaway! Jackie decorates the cabin with a tree and fresh wreaths, which made the holidays even more special.Downtown Brevard is a short drive (5mins) away and you can certainly spend hours in the shops and restaurants. We dined at Square Root for dinner and it was delicious! If you want to go to Asheville, its only 45 minutes away. But Brevard has plenty of shops. we didnt do any nature trails, but the forest is nearby and has countless options. 10/10 recommend this location. Plus, Jackie was very helpful and kind through texts leading up to our arrival."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is just our favorite AirBnB. The cabin is adorable and comfortable. Our family with 2 teens spent several days pre-Christmas and it was the perfect home base for winter hikes, watching holiday movies and just relaxing and connecting. We arrived at night to a Christmas tree lighting the window—such a sweet welcome! Loved seeing the white squirrels on the property. It’s so quiet yet close to Brevard, DuPont and Pisgah. We will definitely be back!"
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,"The French Broad Cabin was stunning -- better than the photographs! It was truly perfect for my mom's 70th birthday celebration and our first family reunion in two years. The kitchen is extremely well furnished, the bedrooms are beautiful with pillowy soft beds, and the living area is stunning and comfortable around the fireplace. And the view from the living/ dining area is spectacular!
We all thoroughly enjoyed our time relaxing in this space, walking the land, and visiting Pisgah National Forest, Biltmore, and Brevard.
Jackie is one of the best hosts I've stayed with, hands down -- quick response times, excellent communication, and wonderful hospitality. I hope to stay here again!
Warmest wishes for a joyful holiday!
Kirsten"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great house in a great location. Very close to all that downtown Brevard has to offer and a short drive to Dupont Forest trailheads. Super clean and serene environment. Our favorite dinner spot is Square Root and we discovered an amazing new breakfast place - Cedar Mountain Cafe - a can’t miss…12 minute drive from the cabin. We can’t wait to return!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jackie was a wonderful host, and the house was a perfect cabin getaway. My family had a wonderful time, and we got a lot of good use out of the kitchen, which had everything you could need. Would definitely come back again!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you want the best of both worlds--close to downtown, but also private, quiet, with a spectacular view--this is the place to be. We were so impressed with the location and we are definitely going to stay here again."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great, clean place. Lot's of living space, and a unique location close to Brevard. It's very new feeling!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Jackie is a great host. She took care of all the details and made sure we had everything to help us feel right at home.
2020-12-01,5,Group trip,"Everything was perfect! Jackie was quick to provide responses, house was very clean and she even had a Christmas tree set up! Loved our trip!"
2020-12-01,5,Group trip,Gorgeous cabin with very cozy touches. Jackie was very professional and thoughtful. It was my birthday weekend and she left me chocolates! Our group of friends had a lovely time staying in the cabin in the evenings and venturing out to the nearby hiking areas during the day. Overall outstanding!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very Clean, well stocked home."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This cabin was the perfect cozy getaway for four adults and two children! It is very clean, nicely decorated, well stocked with all the basic amenities you’d need, and good location to drive to many of the area’s trails and waterfalls. We enjoyed cooking our meals in the kitchen, and at nighttime standing on the balcony looking up at the stars — such clear skies! What a wonderful, restful weekend we had — we already can’t wait to be back."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect in every aspect. 45 minute drive to Biltmore and numeous day trips to national park and surrounding areas. Downtown Brevard is great
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had the most amazing time at Jackie's French Broad Cabin. It's in the most convenient location for exploring Brevard, Pisgah, DuPont, and Asheville. The cabin is so beautiful and cozy. We didn't need for anything. Everything was immaculately clean and smelled so nice. There was plenty of space for our family. The kids loved the loft area. It took us maybe 7 minutes to get into town. (We saw so many white squirrels!) We hiked every day and the cabin was the most relaxing place to return ""home"" to. Jackie was a wonderful host, always quick to respond and check in on us. We had the best time. I will absolutely check to see if their cabin is available first the next time we visit Brevard (which I hope will be soon)!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our third visit. It is our favorite place in Brevard. It is in the perfect location to see everything. It is very comfortable, clean, and attractive."

2020-10-01,5,Group trip,Jackie’s place was extremely clean and cozy! Perfect for a little getaway. Communication was prompt and appreciated!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay at the cabin! It was perfect for our family of 5. The cabin was spotless when we arrived. Jackie was so helpful with local spots to eat and hike. She even left candy for my kiddos!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing cabin with very thoughtful hosts! Clean, spacious with thoughtful touches!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was everything we wanted and needed. It is located about a 5-minute drive from the ""downtown"" Brevard area and everything was easily accessible but it still feels like you're secluded. The views from the cabin are hard to beat. We had several nights where we could clearly see every star in the sky from the balcony. Everything was super clean and we had everything we needed to cook a few meals at the cabin. We did a fair amount of hiking so it was nice that there was a brand new washer and dryer to use to wash our hiking clothes! The beds were very comfortable and the bathrooms were decently sized. Jackie was very quick to respond and communicate directions to the cabin. We already can't wait to come back!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was amazing! Very clean, short drive into town, and great amenities. Jackie truly went above and beyond and far exceeded our expectations. We will definitely be staying there again!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A picturesque cabin. A private rural setting and yet only few miles from downtown and it amenities. The landscaping was exquisite and really made the place feel special. We saw hummingbirds, rabbits and deer during our stay. I highly recommend this cabin for your visit."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The French Broad cabin is the perfect place for a family get away to the mountains! Is is bright, comfortable and spotless, and peaceful at night with amazing star gazing. It is very close to town (shops, grocery, restaurants, etc...) are just a 5 minute drive. Pisgah and Dupont are close for hiking. This is our new family vacation destination."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a wonderful place. It is very comfortable and clean in a convenient location.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family loved the French Broad cabin. We had fully planned on spending as much time outside as possible, but as happens in the mountains, we found ourselves indoors due to rain, and we loved being in the space. The hosts have a beautiful cabin with great amenities and charming touches. Comfortable beds, clean showers, and the cabin is close to all that Brevard has to offer. We can't wait to come back."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! What a great place to stay in a great location! This place was very clean with a well stocked kitchen for cooking, comfortable beds and quiet surroundings! It could easily be my home away from home! Close enough to stores, dining and indoor/outdoor activities, yet far enough to relax from the hustle and bustle of life.
Jackie, the host, was exceptional! Her communication was great and she gave great recommendations for things to do in and around the area, but you'll find that information inside the cabin as well.
You will not be disappointed!!"
2020-08-01,5,Group trip,This is such a cozy and cute cabin in a great location. We loved our stay and definitely hope to return in the future.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best views and amazing hospitality. Would definitely stay again. 5 stars all the way!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The PERFECT mountain cabin retreat -- especially if you wish to be close to both hiking and civilization. So close to Brevard, yet feels private and just disconnected enough to really unplug. Airy, beautiful, space with all the amenities, modern but feels historic. Great beds and so much room! So comfortable. My whole family loved it -- me, my husband, and my 14 and 15 year olds. This is our favorite AirBnB in the states we've ever stayed at! We will definitely be back! Thank you Jackie for your great communication."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is a great find in Brevard! The cabin is a comfy cozy spot in a great location close to downtown, DuPont and Pisgah! This cabin is spotless and has been well taken care of with attention to every detail. The homemade granola, coffee, and cookies were incredible! We had a blast riding and plan to return soon!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful space, with plenty of room for our family of 4. We loved the special touch of coffee and homemade granola from Jackie, and found the home to have everything we needed for our time away. The cabin is located just a couple of minutes from Brevard proper, and a short drive from multiple places to hike and enjoy the outdoors, including Dupont Forest, the Blue Ridge Parkway, and Flat Rock. Wonderful time away - thank you!"
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,"Jackie's cabin is the perfect getaway spot for any visit to Brevard and the land of waterfalls.
It's located near everything, yet secluded enough to be quiet and peaceful at the end of the day.
Everything is perfect, it's exactly as represented, even better in most cases, and Jackie couldn't be easier to work with.
We had five people there for three days and had plenty of room and were all very comfortable.
My wife and I have stayed at many airbnbs around the world, and this is easily one of the best."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This cabin is amazing and absolutely perfect.
Definitely the best experience we have had at an Airbnb.
Jackie has thought of everything you could possibly need. Its so clean and well laid out. We had plenty of room to entertain. The views are beautiful and relaxing. Its so nice to be so close to town but yet seem so secluded.
We will be back for sure."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The French Broad Cabin was perfect for a quick weekend getaway for our us and two of our grown kids who were weary of quarantine in the same house. Jackie provided super communication regarding the property, directions, and special cleaning between clients (due to Covid19). We felt safe and secure.
The location is easily accessible and close to downtown Brevard and hundreds of mountain hiking trails with and without waterfalls. We had two great days of hiking (working around late afternoon and evening thunder showers) and enjoyed the view of the cornfield, the river, and the mountains.
This is a great location for two couples or a small family to get away and unwind. The hosts made everything super easy as well. Would definitely book this property again when we need to unwind."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Better thank we imagined! We stayed two nights with two adults and two children. It was roomy for us to spread out and relax. We enjoyed all the books and games, saw bunnies, deer and skunks. Great, restful sleep. Close proximity to the national park, stores and restaurants. Jackie was so kind to deliver an iron for a last minute need. Thank you very much!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Fantastic family vacation! First thought walking in the door was ""this is awesome"". Very clean and airy, plenty of space for our family of 5, and there were so many little touches that were great. Wonderful location for cyclists, close to both road and MTB. Convenient to Pisgah, Dupont and Blue Ridge Parkway. Our family did a different adventure each day and there is still so much to see and do. We will definitely be back!"

2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great little cabin! Close to town and all the local trails. Will be coming back.
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this cabin! The cabin itself is beautiful. A ton of natural light with huge windows that overlook their beautiful land. It’s close to the Pisgah forest which is a hikers dream, with tons of trails and several gorgeous waterfalls. The cabin was clean and had all of the amenities we needed for our 3 day stay. The owners were welcoming and made our check in and check out very easy. We will definitely be back."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jackie’s place is good for the soul. Beautiful and peaceful, cozy and functional. Filled with light, elegant and has all the amenities you could want. I will definitely stay here again next time I’m in Brevard!"
2020-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place is secluded and at the same time, very close to Brevard, which made quick trips to the grocery store easy as well as visits to downtown. Beautiful place - just as pictured. We would definitely stay here again. Absolutely enjoyed our stay. Thank you!"
2020-02-01,5,Group trip,We rented this cabin for a girls weekend and it worked out great. The location isn’t too far from Asheville so we got the secluded cabin feel but were still able to find things to do. Jackie was very responsive to my messages and the homemade granola was a wonderful surprise and a HUGE hit.
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You will love the location. Downtown is a few blocks, hiking is EVERYWHERE. Waterfalls not far. You have to visit Pretty Place. Not a bad drive and so worth seeing the Sunrise. We watched 2 white squirrels all day playing across the field. House had everything except deodorant . We did not expect all the extras and we brought with us. So much better then a hotel and price was great."
2020-01-01,5,Group trip,Very clean and inviting home. Close to downtown Brevard and good for seeing the town. Amazing spot for a getaway!
2020-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family of 6 had a wonderful stay at this cabin. As other reviewers have said, this cabin was sparking clean. We loved the touches of homemade granola, milk, and good coffee! This is a great location, as it is close drive to downtown Brevard, but still has a remote, cabin feel. It’s a beautiful place to relax after a day of hiking. Jackie was wonderful to work with and gave us great recommendations for food and good family hikes. We hope to be back!"
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem! Less than 5 minutes from downtown Brevard, this immaculate cabin was a sanctuary to come home to.

The surrounding fall foliage was beautiful. The hosts were very responsive and helpful! We will definitely be back!"
2019-11-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful cabin in a beautiful spot right outside of Brevard. Far enough away to be able to see all the stars but close enough to town if you need to go grab something! Cute decorations and accents also!
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is so cozy that you may ""stay put"" all weekend! The photos are very accurate, all the furniture is comfortable and there is no clutter (important when you're unpacking your own stuff). The kitchen is equipped for any level of cooking, simple to elaborate. An awesome pleasant surprise was the side entrance to a big laundry room, for messy clothes after a day of hiking in the rain, and a great space to store bikes."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I am VERY particular when it comes to cleanliness- and this was by FAR the cleanest AirBnb I have ever stayed in. The fridge was stocked with milk, granola, and sparkling water, there was ground coffee and filters in the kitchen for my use, and the bathrooms had nice, fresh shampoo and soap for our use. I could not be more impressed."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. Very comfortable, clean and welcoming. Very good location as well."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you’re looking for the convenience of downtown Brevard, hoping to explore the area trails and waterfalls, and want a comfortable place to call home away from home, you can’t go wrong with the French Broad Cabin!
The space is clean and comfortable. Jackie’s thought of everything you might need, and she’s a quick email or call away if you need anything else. Very accommodating!
Easy to find and convenient to area attractions... we’ll be checking availability on future visits."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jill’s place is very special and we would definitely stay there again. It was a lovely walk to downtown Brevard’s great attractions.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place was great, clean, cozy, quiet, awesome for relaxing and near downtown. Jill is an awesome host, very attentive and always willing to assist you. We really enjoyed our stay and will stay again if we are in the area. Just beware you will not fit in the bedroom if you are taller than 5’11”, but again the place is great."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My mom and I stayed at Jill's for a long Mother's Day weekend. It was perfect for the two of us, just a short couple of blocks to walk downtown to all that Brevard has to offer, including restaurants, shopping, and even the movie theater. The house was clean, comfortable, and well stocked with the comforts of home. Jill graciously left some snacks for us and she was easily available if we needed anything. We would happily stay here again!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ann is my new Super Hero! For reals. We booked last minute & were surprised to see that her highly-rated place was still available. She immediately responded with a personal reply & I felt her genuine welcome from across the miles. It was like we were planning to visit old friends. She waited up for us but having taken her recommendations for a local brewery & a bite to eat, we arrived a bit later than planned. The unit is simply perfect: Pristine, warm, cozy, peaceful with touches of comfort everywhere you look. After a long day on the road, we were super grateful for the big, soft bed & decided to leave the curtains open overnight so we wouldn't miss the sunrise. We awoke to find ourselves surrounded by trees & birdsong. We made fresh coffee and enjoyed a quiet morning before heading out for the day. We met Ann before leaving and again...it was like connecting with a friend. Ann & her husband have created a sanctuary in the hills & have filled the space with only good. My New Fave!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ann's place is in a great location close to Brevard and Pisgah National Forest. It's near the city but feels secluded with a view of mountain peaks behind the trees.

washing machine/dryer, plant based creamer, snacks, water and sparkling water. the place was very clean, remarkably clean.
We loved they cared about the environment and an example is the washer sheets they provided for one wash.
My only dissatisfaction is the design of the headboard of the main bed . Poor design and one can get hurt if not careful so please watch your head and don't bang it by accident cause you can really get hurt
Otherwise , lots of care and attention to detail put in this Airbnb."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Coming in from Charlotte, NC area for just two nights. My husband and I were looking to get to the trees to unwind.. even if for a few days.
Ann’s space caught my eye because of the back porch! It was better in person as it was right up to the green forest! The relaxation hit as I took the little path to the back to enter the Airbnb.
Ann told us they do not go back to the area and to feel free to keep the blinds open to wake up to the sun and the trees. That’s exactly what we did! It was perfect! The bed looks right out that huge sliding glass door.
Location: situated at the top of the road. Nice and secluded. But not scary secluded. 10 mins to downtown Brevard and 12 mins to waterfalls and Pisgah!
Space: very private and intentional space. Clean and perfectly laid out. Comfy bed, great shower, fridge. Best part is that porch!❤️
Can’t wait to come back! VERY nice people!"

Ann gives you very detailed instructions (including pictures) on how to get to the property which was incredibly helpful and appreciated since we checked in later in the evening.

We would 100% stay here again!

I can’t wait to book the house again.

Victor was always quick to respond to any questions or changes I needed to make to the reservation.
We went fly fishing and it’s located in the perfect spot in regard to Pisgah and the Davidson River. It’s quiet and peaceful. It had a really neat creek running behind it.
The space itself was immaculate. The beds were extremely comfortable. You can tell that the hosts care about their property. We would stay here again in a heartbeat."

The house was extremely clean and well equipped for everything we needed for our home away from home. The location is very peaceful and has absolutely stunning views!! The attention to detail for everything was so warm and thoughtful. From the decor, to the board games, to the info/guides for nearby places made us feel like Victor truly cares about the experience we would have. Víctor provided us with a list recommendations of places to go from places to eat to things to do, that we never heard of during our research on the location. It was all amazing!!! Victor was always very quick to respond to any questions we had and even went out of his way to help us find a location for our kids to enjoy. WE CANT WAIT TO GO BACK!!!!! Will be booking again at this house in the very near future. Thank you Victor for everything, you’re the best!!!"

The finishes and overall look are beautiful -- I kept saying that I want to live in this house! The location is amazing, up a winding mountain road with views of forests all around. We went hiking in Pisgah and mountain biking at DuPont and Kanuga, all of which were easily accessible. Victor was a responsive host and we had everything we needed: the house was well stocked with things for cooking and grilling. I definitely want to come back!"

He was great at communicating with us about our stay and checked in to see how things were going. The house was clean, cozy, and welcoming. Wifi worked well, I was able to work a couple days no problem from their house. We stayed with our two young children and would definitely stay again next time we're in the area. Great place for mountain bikers and hikers."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of my favorites in all of AirBNB-land. Always a stress free experience, and I can't tell you how amazing it is to have an ample supply of fresh fluffy towels, comfy beds and everything you could dream you ever wanted in a rental. Hubby's fav is opening the fridge after a 4hr drive and finding chilled refreshments waiting.
We are repeat guests, and already booked another trip for 2024 because we can't wait to come back, relax, and ride bikes. Close to all the fun in Dupont and Pisgah. Can't wait for our next adventure here."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great find & one of the best AirBNBs we have stayed at. It’s exactly as pictured, super clean, and very peaceful. Victor was very responsive to messages.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is by far the best Airbnb we have stayed at… our host Victor went above and beyond… The cabin is beautifully tucked into the Pisgah forest mountain. Upon our arrival we encountered a family of deer (baby fawn included) a few steps away on the backside of the property.
The house was well maintained and fully equipped for all our needs.
We highly appreciated the coziness and cleanliness of the property, it made our long weekend/birthday weekend getaway a dream!
We thank you again for letting us into your home, we also left you a token of gratitude (aka a bottle of champagne) for you guys to enjoy!
We will definitely be back for more adventures and to enjoy the beautiful wilderness that Pisgah and DuPont national forest have to offer!
Thank you once again!"

Thank you guys so much for the hospitality and the charm you put in this beautiful cabin. ❤️❤️❤️❤️ I'm in Love...😊"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home in a quiet and peaceful location. Victor's home was easily the cleanest rental we've stayed in - which is always an important factor we consider. We enjoyed that the home was close to town and shopping but was remote enough to enjoy nature and the lovely views and location. There was plenty of space inside the home and it was equipped with everything we needed for a restful stay. Would absolutely stay again - we had a great time!!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful home. Cleanest home we have rented! The directions, house manual and maps inside were perfect. The home provided a beautiful haven to relax after a day of adventures. There were plenty of towels, well stocked kitchen and comfy beds. Would highly recommend this listing if you are in the area.
A special thank you to Victor who went out of his way to make sure the construction in the area did not inconvenience our stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We are from Miami and this was our first time in North Carolina our experience with nature in this beautiful House for the time was just the best getaway we ever had, hiking and exploring the town was just exactly what Victor said it was going to be. since we entered the house we loved everything, comfy, homie and had everything you need it for the stay. over all the rooms are comfortable and we I appreciated the cleanliness of the entire house, the place is wonderful to spend a few days and disconnect from our routine thank you for the stay."

Host was very responsive and helpful, house was cozy, and my family and I had a genuinely great stay. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to stay in the area!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really can’t say enough good things about this place; the cabin, while very secluded, is very close to the town and it’s many shops and restaurants. The cabin itself is fairly new construction, and absolutely pristine; modern kitchen, stainless steel appliances, comfortable and easy-to-navigate spaces. The back deck was a nice highlight, from which we were able to observe a lot of wildlife, including a variety of songbirds and raptors, baby deer, and (almost legendary in Brevard)…… white squirrels! I would absolutely recommend this cabin to anyone looking both for peace and quiet AND easy access to everything you could want."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stunning newer property tucked into wooded ravine. Loved the house and layout, front and rear balconies to enjoy the view and relax. We even were able to have dinner on the back deck two nights as the temps were cooler.
We came to take advantage of Dupont State Forest, and Pisgah. We were about equal distances from both. Great storage for our mountain bikes and bike wash station at the house which was really nice to have.
Hope to be back in the fall to do some more riding."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hello future guests!
DO NOT hesitate to book this beautiful cabin. If you’re looking for a peaceful getaway or an adventure filled vacation this is the home to stay at in Pisgah Forest. So many hiking trails and waterfalls to see in the area (DuPont is a must do). If mountain biking is on your list of adventures then check out The Hub (awesome bike shop) and it is less than 15 mins away from the cabin.
Tip: Stop at the Inglés in Brevard, NC on your way in to the cabin for groceries.
The cabin is spacious, clean, organized and cozy. A home away from home. Vic and Claudine are amazing hosts and know about accommodations.
Thank you for the experience and I will be returning in the fall.
Happy adventuring! Cheers"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We have stayed at many Airbnbs. This one ranks as one of the best!
Clean, uncluttered, well-stocked, excellent location, comfortable beds.
A great place to reconnect with our family and nature."
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice place and close to lots.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the house — great central location and easy to zip into Brevard, AVL etc. We brought our mtb and loved riding from the cabin to DuPont and checking out the trails in Pisgah in addition to hiking. The outdoor racks, hose and basement storage were perfect to keep our equipment safe and clean. Victor was super responsive and friendly. The house was squeaky clean, spacious and so peaceful and comfortable."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful experience over a long weekend at this cabin, and found it easy to get to local attractions while providing a lot of peace and privacy.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a beautiful house in a beautiful location. It rained most of the days we were in Pisgah, but the house was so nice we just hung out and had a great time. Every amenity one might expect is present. Truly an amazing home."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent central location for a mountain bike vacation. Beautiful home with beautiful views of the forest. Victor was easy to communicate with and made sure we had everything we needed. We highly recommend this beautiful spot and friendly host!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Victor's place was one of the cleanest places we've ever stayed. Plus, there's a stream behind the house, and you can open the windows and hear the stream from every room. It was very peaceful. The mattresses were also very comfortable which is an important quality, in my opinion. We will definitely stay there again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This cabin was amazing! The space is beautiful, very peaceful to sit on the porches and listen to the creek and waterfall (plus we saw a deer!) It was well stocked and comfortable…everything we needed and nothing we did not need. Victor was very responsive our questions. A very easy drive to biking in DuPont and dinner in Brevard.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved staying here! Such a beautiful place - the photos don’t do it justice- in an amazing location for the experience we were looking for - a relaxing, quiet place to land after exploring by foot and by bike. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This space was literally perfection and the most beautiful escape in the mountains for our family. We stayed with three small children under the age of five and had everything we needed. We brought an easy travel bedrail to sleep our 5 & 3 yr old on the queen and put a blow up divider in the middle of the bed so they had their own little space and they LOVED it. We are daydreaming about staying for a month next year since my husband works remotely. So clean and the hosts were so thoughtful with all the little touches that allowed us to stay so comfortably.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect experience start to finish!

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a fabulous stay. Way too short! This was the perfect place to reset, relax and refocus. What I loved was the cozy yet modern feel of the cabin. Being surrounded by mountains with the lovely sounds of the babbling brook and the visit from a beautiful doe combined with the warmth and comfort indoors was everything I hoped to experience."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From my wife...This lovely home is located in a wooded area; and it features architectural upgrades, tasteful decor, comfort, & amazing cleanliness. On that point, this home is immaculate (totally spotless). The kitchen is absolutely beautiful and all the large appliances look new. This is the only rental where we have stayed that designated a large space with shelving for groceries; which allows the kitchen area to remain uncluttered & organized.
The homeowner’s are generous and they keep this home well stocked with coffee, tea, cold glasses in the freezer, plenty of towels & sheets, etc. This home is definitely a keeper and we plan to return in the near future."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a great spot! The house is clean, light, spacious and cozy, and the back of the house is entirely wooded which is super peaceful. It's also a great jumping off spot for activities in the local area. For this trip we mostly focused on kid-friendly activities and Victor's place was <15 min drive from multiple trails, hikes, playgrounds, and fam-friendly breweries. Highly recommend!"

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Your cabin and accommodations exceeded our expectations. The location is off the beaten path and tranquil yet easily accessible to the town and local attractions. The only disappointment I have is that I can only give 5 stars.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It’s been 7 years since my husband and I visited Asheville and we stayed at a hotel in the city. This time we wanted to have the true mountain experience while staying here with our two toddlers boys. This home was tucked away in the mountains about 30min from the city of Asheville. A very quiet and secluded community. The home is breathtakingly beautiful! It’s definitely a new build which makes everything more sweet. It’s equipped with everything you need for a family - pots, dishes, extra towels and sheets, etc. The home was very cleaned and clutter free. We didn’t get a chance to enjoy the back patio as much as we would have liked too but we stepped out there a few times and it was so peaceful. We felt safe - there are cameras on the outside of the home for extra security. Victor was responsive and we didn’t need to reach out during the stay because everything was seamless; from the check in to the check out. We would definitely recommend this home - you won’t be disappointed."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of our favorite places we have stayed. It was quiet, had great accessibility to DuPont Forest, and nice decor."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect home base for your Brevard adventures and exploring town. Super nice home with all of the amenities you are looking for. Put this home on your short list, I know I can’t wait to go back."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing house! Amazing host! We loved our trip and home away from home. :)
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was absolutely wonderful and perfect. The pictures don’t do it justice. It was so clean you would have thought we were the first people to use a newly built home. It had all the comforts of home, great beds, nice towels… and everything about the stay was easy. We went to Asheville, Brevard and hiking in DuPont during our stay and the location was perfect. We can’t wait to stay there again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Awesome little house tucked away in the woods! We stayed for 4 nights on a family trip and enjoyed this little place very much. The house was fresh, clean and seems new! We spent a lot of our trip out and about but while we were in the house we had what we needed."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We absolutely love this spot and house! The fall leaves were beautiful and we had such a lovely stay. Thank you so much!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, looks even better in person! It seemed like a new-build cabin to us - everything was spotless and worked well. Victor was a great host; the yoga mat and foam roller were a pleasant surprise to unwind after some hiking. It's roughly 15-20 minutes from either DuPont or Pisgah National Forest, so lots of great outdoors sights nearby. The final 0.5 mile drive up gets a little steep, and might be tough for a car if there's snow or ice, but we were just fine with a 2WD car. Would definitely stay here again if we're in the area!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome cottage in the woods, perfectly clean and very cozy, loved sitting on the back deck feeling like you’re in a treehouse, hope to return on another hiking trip to this beautiful area."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! The nicest Airbnb I have ever stayed in! This property has every thoughtful detail planned and executed! It is perfectly located in between all of the recreational locations (Dupont, Pisgah National Forest, Local Breweries and Downtown Brevard etc..). I stayed at the property with my Wife and 2 year old Daughter and it was amazing! Look no further, this property will make your trip!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location and adorable cabin. My family and I thoroughly enjoyed our weekend.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was PERFECT. Clean and quaint - nestled in the woods right between town and the forest. LOVED having a safe place for our bikes and all the extras that went along with that! Victor was amazing to communicate with as well. We can’t wait to come back!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is new and clean and it was great being able to hear the trickle of the stream from the back deck. I suggest checking out the trickling waterfall before you leave, it’s pretty neat! Check in was super easy, and it’s close to some great waterfalls and Brevard. There was a small leak in the 1/2 bath toilet so the water had been turned off by the previous renter, but Victor was nice enough to have someone come fix it after we left. Check out was a bit early at 10am. We really enjoyed our stay and being surrounded by nature!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and great hosts who communicated well! We had a wonderful stay, loved everything about the place. The cottage is well equipped with everything we needed to cook our own food and BBQ. It was spotless and exactly as described, we hope to be back! We are also Airbnb hosts, this was good value for our money – thanks."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the best Air bnb I've ever been to. VERY CLEAN, awesome location, beautiful views and everything you need on site (pots, pans, grill, seasonings, etc.) Mr. Victor responds expeditiously whenever I messaged him. We will be coming back even if it's just to get a little peace for a weekend. This beautiful cottage is the place to be and right the middle of beautiful sites. We hiked and visited 6 different waterfalls near by. Listen just book this beautiful home, you will not regret it."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is awesome!! Perfect location for anyone looking to ride in Pisgah, DuPont and anywhere really in WNC. Super clean and well thought out. Sure is a comfy and cozy place to wind down after a long day of riding. Will be headed back for sure!!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location and very clean! We’ll definitely stay again.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I can’t say enough good things about this house. First, Victor was an excellent communicator from the beginning. The house is in a perfect location between DuPont and Pisgah, with quick access to Brevard. Anytime we thought we needed something at the house, they had it. The linens were great, kitchen stocked (knives are actually sharp!), house really clean and comfortable. The setting is really peaceful and we enjoyed dinner on the porch one evening. We will definitely be staying here again next time we’re in the area."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Victor’s home was lovely! The home is very clean and well-appointed, and the setting is tranquil and beautiful. We especially enjoyed some time on the back deck, immersed in the surrounding forest."

The location is perfect, the host was great with communication, the house is extremely well stocked and has such a homey feel, AND the beds are super comfy! I have no complaints. This was such a great experience. If you’re debating booking this house, DO IT! We had an amazing time."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property and location (close to
Brevard) but up in the forest is absolutely stunning. The house is so cute, relaxing, comfortable, and clean. The outside back deck has such a beautiful view and we enjoyed so much time out there. The forests around there…DuPont and Pisgah were both great for exploiting. That area has such a luscious landscape with the greenery and farms around. Would definitely recommend."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place exactly as pictured. Will definitely be back !
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Victor’s place was everything that was promised. It is new, super clean and in a great spot. Kitchen was well stocked. It was really nice to sit on the deck with a coffee in the morning. Communication with Victor was great, he responded quickly.

The cabin was spectacular! Extremely clean and up to date!!! We definitely recommended 10/10 and couldn’t have asked for a better experience. Victor is also easy to communicate with and did nothing but make sure we felt like we were at home. We will be back!!! Thank you again!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brand new, super clean and central point to awesome MTB riding at DuPont and Pisgah. Highly recommended. Will be back here in future"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great stay. Clean and in a pretty location near Pisgah and DuPont for great hiking, picnics with the kids, and trail running. Victor was extremely communicative throughout!
Keep your eyes peeled for white squirrels in the surrounding forest. We enjoyed sitting on the back porch where could hear the nearby stream."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Victor's cottage is an oasis away from home! The cottage is wonderfully furnished and very comfortable. We enjoyed sitting in the rocking chairs on the front porch, hiking in nearby DuPont State Recreational Forest, and going out for dinner a short drive away in Pisgah Forest or Brevard."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A lovely well stocked house in the woods quiet and serene
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This beautiful cabin was the perfect place for our vacation! It was super clean, well appointed, and great location! We felt like we were staying in a tree house. Victor was a wonderful host! We would most definitely stay here again!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful place! Peaceful. Lovely. Beautiful setting. We were very happy to find it and can’t wait to come back.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place has a great location convenient for hiking in Pisgah Forest and DuPont state park - a well as Brevard and Hendersonville. Super clean. Easy to find.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Can’t say enough great things about this cabin. The style and decor are so inviting and the location is amazing! Coffee on the balcony up in the trees with the lullaby of the stream was perfect in the mornings. Cozy seating, spacious kitchen, and fully stocked with all the essentials. It’s just minutes to Dupont, Pisgah, and Brevard. Our family will stay here again for sure!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Very clean.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Everything's new and clean. The cabin's well-stocked with almost everything you need, the exception being specialized things like a salad spinner. The bed in the front room has the softer mattress and the one in the back room has the firmer so, if you're sharing, work out who gets which before settling in. Highly recommended."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location, excellent communication, comfortable and clean. Easy access to Pisgah and DuPont hiking."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay here. Perfect size for our family of three, with a generous amount of space. It was nice to be tucked away in the woods but still an easy 20 minute drive to hiking, shopping, and dining. We only had a couple of days here but would definitely put this on the list for a week-long vacation so we can spend more time just lounging about the house. Communication with Victor was prompt and efficient."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is an absolute WOW! An awesome setting, modern cabin with all of the amenities, very clean, has everything you need for a great get away. The rockers on the front porch, grill and table and chairs on the back porch and the fireplace were all great surprises. The home was incredibly clean, the bed was very comfortable and the area is incredibly peaceful. Our only regret was waiting until our 3rd night to use the fireplace! Thank you Victor for being a great host - available for questions, but allowing our privacy."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A very well built and clean little modern cabin that was perfect for a weekend trip. Victor was very respectful, well organized and responded in a timely manner to any questions we had. Would stay again, would also recommend to friends and family."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved our stay. The cabin is gorgeous, centrally located to national parks, downtown, and great breweries. Highly recommend for a weekend getaway or even a longer stay. Victor and his wife are fantastic communicators and made sure we had a great stay!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is beautiful and pristine house. The stay was perfect for a weekend getaway. Thank you!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This lovely mountain home is the closest to perfection I have experienced in a vacation rental. The home features a thoughtful floor plan that creates a spacious yet cozy layout that was ideal for our small family. It is located in a lovely community and is tucked down from the road in such a way to feel private even in winter. You’re close enough to one neighbor to hear the tinkling of a wind chime, which just adds to the peaceful nature. Make the small trek along the service road beside the house to see the little waterfall. I bundled up to sit on the back porch to enjoy its sounds. We spent most of our time at DuPont State Recreational Forest, which is SO close. Victor’s communication was great. Check out the house manual on your Airbnb app early (we didn’t see this until late in our stay and it has a lot of good info in it). If you find this mountain gem, don’t hesitate to book it. We are so glad we did!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a fantastic stay at this lovely house! The location is perfect and close to Pisgah, DuPont, and Brevard - and you can hear a small waterfall from the back porch. We loved the house and the small touches to make it feel at home. We would love to come back and stay!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Victor was an incredible host! Communicated really well & timely on responses, and was of great help to my boyfriend and I when snow hit during our stay. He went way beyond to make sure we were updated on weather/neighborhood news and that we had everything we needed to be comfortable! Check-in & out is made really easy & we had no problems. The house was very clean, but highlights for us were the kitchen, (perfect for cooking) & bathrooms.
Would absolutely recommend to stay here!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Victor’s place was amazing and we enjoyed our stay! We will definitely be back in the future. It is a beautiful and cozy home that we were thankful to spend time in!
Thanks!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great spot! I can't recommend this place enough. We found it to be immaculately clean, very comfortable, and in a dreamy location with a stream just outside. The host's communication was clear and helpful from booking - checkout, and we'd definitely stay again if in the area."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Victor's house let me just say amazing!!! very clean all you could ask for and more. beautiful towns, wonderful golf courses, if you love shopping and golf go you won't regret it."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful place for a getaway or mental reset. It's secluded, quiet, and the babbling brook in the backyard gives the sounds of relaxation. it was fully equipped with everything that I needed."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here! The location was amazing, the views were amazing and the cabin was super cute and spotless! Not too far from the Biltmore/downtown Asheville and plenty of places to explore! Highly recommend staying here if you want a nice relaxing getaway!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home about 15-20 minutes from downtown Brevard. Surrounded by rhododendron forest with a creek and little waterfall out back. The road is quite steep and windy - no issue with 70-degree temps last weekend but our little Prius would not have done well if there was snow or ice. It was perfect for our weekend getaway... miss it already.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Victor’s place is EXCELLENT. My favorite Airbnb I’ve had the pleasure of staying in. The home was beautiful and even better in person than in the photos. Spotlessly clean, brand new, beautifully designed and in a wonderful location. We spent time hiking (lots of great options close by while still feeling secluded) and visiting Brevard and Asheville; as well as relaxing in the house which was wonderfully cozy. Kitchen had everything we needed to prepare meals. I can’t say enough positive things and can’t wait to return!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing stay! Truly on of the best Airbnb's we ever stayed at! Everything was as expected, and the place is stunning! So beautiful and peaceful."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful stay at Victor’s place! We brought our 4 month old daughter with us and it was truly the best set up for our family. We loved the location, the home, and we came during the fall and saw some beautiful foliage around the house. Cannot recommend this place enough!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, cozy, clean! Absolutely perfect spot for a getaway with everything you need! Hope to stay again in the near future!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Awesome place!!! We had an amazing time staying in this modern but still cozy cabin. Great place to crash and have a beer or just relax after a day out biking or exploring. Communication was amazing, place was simply stocked but with all necessities, solid spot to store bikes, gorgeous forest mountain road/property. We’d be back next weekend if it wasn’t a 12 hour drive :)"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Victor & Claudine's cabin. It is even more beautiful in person! The home is very clean and decorated so lovely. The kitchen has everything you need. The beds and linens were so comfortable. The bathrooms were very nice. We loved the barn door on the main floor bathroom. You can tell that they really put a lot of time and attention to each and every room. We enjoyed beautiful sunrises and hanging out on the porches watching the birds and squirrels each day.
Check in was so easy. The owners responded within minutes any time we reached out. The owners guide pointed to a lot of great places to eat and experience.
The surrounding forests have beautiful trails that we hiked to see some of the many waterfalls in the area. Take a drive on the Blue Ridge Parkway for stunning views.
We will definitely be booking this place again and would highly recommend a stay here."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely great stay! Perfect family getaway!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home is incredible! More beautiful in person. Very tranquil and we saw some wildlife from the porch. Everything about the house is gorgeous. Very clean, with great utilities, spacious rooms, and new appliances. The neighbors are also very nice and friendly. The hosts are so helpful and communicated everything perfectly. We really enjoyed our stay."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, new place! Very clean, quiet & relaxing. Victor is timely with responding, stress-free stay. Great location & quickly accessible to road, gravel, and/or trails for bicycling!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Victor was a great host. He was responsive, polite and made sure everything went smoothly! His property is absolutely perfect for those looking for some peace and quiet. It was stocked with everything you could need. I look forward to coming back one day."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We LOVED 725 Pisgah Forest Drive. This cottage is an escape to silence, natural beauty and peace. Huge windows throughout the house showcase views of wild rhododendron and the lush surroundings of the Pisgah Forest area. Comfortable beds, lovely inviting front and back porches, an open yet cozy living area, and well outfitted kitchen make this place feel like a getaway.
Sadly, we were working for our 2 days, but the quiet, the privacy and the accommodations allowed us to think and be productive. The hosts are responsive and helpful. Book it! You won't be sorry."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is a MUST! It is both immaculate and cozy! We loved how close it was to so many trails, waterfalls, and restaurants. Victor was also super responsive to our correspondence. We will be staying here again and highly recommend it! :)"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What wonderful home! We thoroughly enjoyed staying here. We highly recommend this property. The attention to detail in the home is great. They have everything you need to have a great quiet mountain stay. Wonderful area for cyclists. The location right between Dupont and Pisgah Forest is fantastic!
We hope to make it back here soon."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I had a great stay with my family! Victor is a great host and was really helpful answering all of our questions. The home is beautiful! The decor was minimal but tasteful which helped the place seem very clean. We traveled with small children and it was so nice that there wasn’t anything for them to get into. I would suggest bringing a portable baby gate if you need to block the stairs for babies.
It’s located in good proximity to lots of great restaurants, breweries and things to do.
We highly recommend this awesome place and hope to stay again."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Victor's was so very peaceful, just soaking in the beauty of the forest, sounds and air! Very bright, clean and well outfitted.
Communication was real time. Victor even helped me sort out a cycling back route into Dupont. 5 stars across the board!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was amazing. Great location. Internet was good, super clean .The host provided everything that was needed and communicated very well with us.
Would definitely stay here again!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is amazing. Wonderful new construction close to dupont and pisgah. not to mention everything else. Tucked away from everything but still right by everything. The house itself is new and is amazingly nice and modern. Stay here NOW before I book it up for good... we will be back. Perfect hiking and biking hub or whatever you need it for - you will not be disappointed.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay close to Brevard and Pisgah Forest. Would definitely stay again. The bike room was awesome!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Gem of a place! Beautifully decorated interior, comfortable beds, fully stocked kitchen for cooking, ample supplies to see us through our almost 4 week stay, bike storage, great communications with Jennifer,etc. We’ve already booked again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely home. Had everything we needed and more. The bike storage was a big plus and we were very close to shopping, restaurants and breweries.."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is the best we've ever rented. I honestly could not give a higher rating. We brought our two young boys to experience Brevard for the first time and this house helped make the trip. My wife who is super detail oriented kept saying "" this place has every detail covered!"" It has that cool renovated old house feel with sort of a mid century styling, and it was really nice to have the one large room by the patio where everyone could put their shoes and bags to keep stuff out of the way. could not be a better location -- in between downtown and the national forest, a few minutes to each. Jennifer's communication was so good that, if anything, I had to keep up with her. If you want to go to Brevard, make your life easy and look no further."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I don’t think I can accurately describe how fabulous Jennifer‘s place is. To begin with they were very understanding and sympathetic to our needs, and went above and beyond in making accommodations for us. It is comfortable, easy to get to and in a quiet cul-de-sac. The decorations are over the top. Everything felt very professional, and yet comfortable. We had everything we needed, and the coffee provided for us was a pleasant surprise.
If you are in the area and need someplace to stay, forget about a hotel room… this is where you want to be."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Jennifer's home is beautifully designed and luxuriously appointed with all of the amenities. It is in a peaceful, walkable neighborhood in a fantastic location. Jennifer is the perfect host.
With gratitude, Belinda"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer’s place was beyond beautiful! We checked in and didn’t want to leave! It was so cozy, clean and a peaceful place to spend our weekend. There were so many little things that she thought of that we didn’t have to worry about anything. Jennifer was so quick to respond to us and so helpful! We are definitely going to come again and would recommend anyone to reserve this wonderful space in Brevard!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was very impressive…clean, comfortable, and great location. Jennifer was fabulous! She was very friendly, responded quickly when we had a question, and just provided a place that was cozy, well equipped, and perfect for our anniversary weekend. We would absolutely recommend this wonderful home and look forward to booking it again.
Mark and Diane Mitchiner"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay in Jennifer’s cottage was so comfortable! The interior design is on a professional level. I just enjoyed looking at all the furniture, artwork, kitchen design, and all the thoughtful touches put into this home. It felt like a luxury hotel stay but with the comforts of home. There were mini makeup removers, q-tips, floss, and so many more little extras that I know is above and beyond what is expected with an Air B n B. There was coffee and creamer available to us, which was huge because we are big coffee drinkers. The kitchen was impeccable with everything you would need. The knives were sharp! The beds were comfortable, and we enjoyed the many blankets as we snuggled up in the living room as a family for a movie. It was close to the grocery store, the bike path, Main St., and the Pisgah National Forest. Convenience and nature. What else can you ask for? I think so much thought and care was put into this home and it shows. We hope to stay again!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Easily the best air bnb we've ever stayed in. There aren't enough superlatives....beautiful, spacious, most generously appointed, huge TV, warm, homey rooms, so comfortable, brand spankin' new kitchen with many extras. Outdoor, private off-street parking, fenced in backyard and private patio area with nice furniture..
The hosts are excellent communicators and have obviously exceeded any expectations for providing exceptional experiences for clients. Thank you, Jennifer."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Best stocked and great location ! Hosts respond quickly and are very helpful. Beds are great too !!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay. It is very convenient to activities in Brevard. We were there for the music festival and the forest. There are great supermarkets and restaurants close by. Don't miss the Square Root. The neighborhood is very quiet. The house is an older one but it is excellent condition. It is quite large for a ""two bedroom"" house. We enjoyed the fully equipped kitchen and wonderful appliances. It has a large TV. We are looking forward to returning."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Good location. Easy coordination and a great setup in Brevard
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place! close to town and has everything you need.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay exceeded our expectations. Beautifully decorated, good beds, nice baths and towels, very nice common area, excellent kitchen. Very clean. Patio equipped for relaxing and the pre-dinner libation. Pefect for two couples. CLose to town and shopping (if you are in the mood to cook). This is what an internet booking experience should be."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything in the description is 100% accurate, and the host was super responsive! In fact the whole place is much nicer than described! Great beds, nice kitchen and patio, close to downtown, and a short drive to Pisgah, and right around the corner from the bike trail. The internet is amazingly fast, and there is a nice study if you have to catch up on work. The living room is very comfortable and has a huge TV, nice if you want to catch a game.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"cannot say enough good things about this rental. the location was great for a walk into town on the path or a short drive to The Hub / Pisgah. the hosts clearly thought of evey amenity. we were particularly impressed that the fridge and pantry were stocked with basics (mustard, ketchup, hot sauce, tea, coffee, oil etc) and thar there was a generous place to both wash and dry bikes outside and then easily store them indoors as well. we stayed just the two of us but would be a great place for two couples as well with private bedrooms and baths. in short we recommend without hesitation !"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of the most comfortable, well-equipped, coziest Airbnbs we've ever enjoyed! The house is simply and beautifully decorated.

We loved the indoor bike rack! I got a lot of remote work done using the kitchen table as my office space. We don't cook much in Airbnbs, but if you do this kitchen is well appointed with quality equipment and wonderful coffee! The entire home is super clean and just so cozy and tranquil.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My brother and I stayed for a week to go mountain biking and run a Spartan race. It was amazing being within half an hour drive of Dupont, Kanuga, and popular trailheads in Pisgah. It felt good to ""go home"" at the end of the day rather than a cramped, smelly hotel room.
The house was way more spacious than anticipated, with a large living room with lots of natural light, comfy seating, racks for three bikes, and a big TV! We enjoyed playing board games and watching movies when thunderstorms rolled in.
The bedrooms were comfortable with nice closets for our extended stay, so we weren't digging through suitcases. The beds and pillows were comfortable and clean.
The kitchen worked well and it was very nice being able to cook our own meals. Some welcome snacks were provided and appreciated after 15 hours of driving!
Only one bathroom, but not a huge deal when it's only two people. The bathroom has a large shower with non-slip flooring and fast-heating water.
Very large back yard with some woods and a fire pit! We should have brought our hammocks, and when my brother and I plan to come back in the fall, it will be cool enough for fires!
All in all, cannot recommend this AirBnB enough! This stay is saved and we will be back!"

We didn't get to use the yard but it's a nice space. The washer and dryer are awesome amenities and so was the well equipped kitchen. Check in and checkout was easy and all the info arrived in a timely manner.
We'd love to come back!"

2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,House was ready a little early so we could get in sooner. House had everything we needed for our quick overnight visit. Great location for downtown Brevard and Brevard College events.

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you have your heart set on a low-key, relaxing weekend in the North Carolina mountains, the Pisgah Bike House is a wonderful home base. My friend and I registered for one of the new REI bike tours in DuPont State Forest, and this house made getting there so easy. Our host, Mary, provided a spot-on restaurant suggestions with Quixote in Brevard, and we enjoyed the home's proximity to Oskar Blues brewery, which was so much fun. We'd definitely stay again."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome value!!!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,I have stayed here several times with my boys. The place is always clean and comfortable and it is super convenient to downtown Brevard and area hiking
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mary was super easy to communicate with and the contactless entry was also super convenient. The house is a comfortable home base for exploring Brevard and surroundings. It's quite close to Oskar Blues (you could actually bike there) and easy access to bike trails (we didn't get to try them because of weather but it was clearly a good location for biking.) It's 5 minutes max from the house to the center of Brevard, restaurants, coffee shops, etc. Be aware there is no dishwasher so if you plan to do a lot of meal preparation you will be washing dishes by hand; wasn't an issue for us, but just something to be aware of. We would be happy to stay at Mary's house again."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Arrive, park your vehicle and ride! Seriously, the house is about a block from the greenway. The house is cute and has great amenities. The owners are great and super quick with communication. I would definitely recommend and will be planning to stay again."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"House is exactly as described. Mary was so helpful on communication, even warning us of incoming weather during our stay.

The extra drinks you left for the kids were greatly appreciated!
Thanks!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As noted in the many good reviews, this is a very clean and comfortable 2 bedroom home in a quiet neighborhood convenient to the local bike path and to Dupont recreation area, and to Pisgah NF with all the hiking and biking and waterfalls. It is also close to town and makes a good Basecamp for exploring the area. There is a big living room with comfy couch and large TV, and a kitchen that makes it easy to cook and pack your own lunches if you don't want to do restaurants. WIFI was steady and trouble free. Mary was available to contact for any reason and the place was as described. If you are lucky, you might see the famous white squirrel visit the big back yard, and maybe the two woodchucks will also show up. Happy trails from a good Basecamp location."
