2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,FAVORITE!! Love loved this place
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"2nd stay at this property. As nice as the first time. We had more time to enjoy the house this time and loved sitting on the 2nd floor balcony in the evening. Historic downtown blocks away from home, loved being able to walk out to breakfast and dinner.
Sunrise on the St. Johns is a nice bonus."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,I will always stay at this house when I'm in town. It's a beautiful home and has everything you'd want.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A magnificent historical home, meticulously maintained, with a wonderful view of the river, with a dock! This is my 4th time to this home, and I‚Äôll keep coming back!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,It was a great house! Would definitely stay there again! Julie was a great host!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was amazing to stay in a circa 1856 home, the decorations inside reminded you this is a special house with some period correct furniture and appliances. For example an old ice chest in the kitchen akin to one that might have been there over 100 years ago. It was the perfect mix of historical vs. modern in the home. Well done Julie!!
The location is breathtaking, situated on the St. Johns river, be sure to get up early and catch the sunrise which is spectacular over the river. You can very easily walk historic downtown Palatka from this home, everything you would want to walk to is under a half mile walk. We walked to breakfast each morning and dinner each evening.
The house is well appointed, kitchen has coffee in place with a Kurig style coffee maker and also a drip option if you prefer that. (bring some creamer they only have powdered which is understandable) The bathrooms has body wash, shampoo and conditioner in the showers. The linens were very nice too. Excellent stay!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,The sunrise views from porch and balconies were high value. The home and grounds provided great opportunities to enjoy the outdoors.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Julie was a great host and everything was just perfect I would recommend her place to everyone looking for a home away from home

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow ! What a pleasure it was staying at Julie's Riverfront Home in the South Historic District of Palatka, FL, formerly known as The Quarterman House. The level of detail inside the home made the price an absolute bargain. The home is absolutely stunning and spectacular. The interior is extremely spacious and cozy and the beautiful exterior of the riverfront matched with the surrounding mossy oaks make you never want to leave! What a terrific piece of property this is and experience to stay at. Thank you very much Julie for providing us with a real treat. You have an extraordinary home and I hope to return again in the future. My best regards. Robert"

We loved everything about the house. It's got a great location overlooking the river and within walking distance of downtown Palatka.
It's been remodeled recently and many things are brand new in the home.
Julie is a great host. We had to reschedule because of the hurricane and this was no issue for Julie rescheduling us to the following week.
Julie was in constant communication with us reassuring we had everything we needed in the home."

The house was very comfortable with plenty of room. It was nice and clean. Thanks Faith! I wish we could‚Äôve brought our bikes because downtown is only a couple blocks away. The golf course and boat ramp are only a couple minutes away.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The five stars says it all! Faith was very communicative throughout the entirety of our stay. Her place is so charming and warm. I especially loved the fenced in backyard where a lemon tree stands and squirrels and bird are happily eating at their respective feeders. The bed was super comfortable and the bathroom was spotless. I appreciated the organization and tidiness in the closets and common spaces. Overall, we felt relaxed and safe--two things that I highly prioritize. I only have positive things to say about our stay and would love to return for a longer stay. So much gratitude!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Want to step back into a by-gone era and reflect on a more simple, slower-paced life?
This bungalow is the perfect spot for you!
And so wonderfully affordable.
Easy to find...private...excellent location to explore the area but still kind of away from it all. (We enjoyed time in St. Augustine and Flagler Beach.)
We felt right at home and appreciated all the thoughtful touches included. Everything was nice and clean. Loved the well-suited kitchen!
Faith is an exceptional host. Proactive, very kind, and generous. Sure wish there were more hosts like her! Worthy of a 10 star rating."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place is so cute! I loved the fireplace and the squirrel feeder. Lots of happy fat squirrels were in residence. Faith offered to bring us more firewood if we needed but there was plenty and we never ran out. When there was severe weather she was more than accommodating and so generous. She really made our vacation wonderful.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A beautiful 1925 Arts and crafts bungalow right out of the Sears catalogue will surely take you back to a simpler place in time. An atmosphere that will soothe your soul while you rock on the porch swing, cozy up by the fire, play the old records and watch the light shine through the stained glass. We had our own privacy and the place was very clean! This house made our trip! Would love to stay here again. Faith was very friendly, helpful and over generous!!!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We love staying here! Faith has created a warm and inviting home that has everything we need. The king size bed is just as comfy as our bed at home. This home is a gem and we appreciate staying here.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"To say we felt right at home is an understatement. The charm of this bungalow is captivating. Every little detail you could think of was evident, including books on this period style home. We loved watching the squirrels eat the corn. What a pleasure! We highly recommend you book Faith's little slice of paradise. You won't regret it."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Faith‚Äôs description of her place does not do it justice! It has historic charm yet had everything we needed. The home is easy to find. Very clean and comfortable. Faith herself, is kind, quick to respond and a generous host.
We have family in the area. We will book with her again next time we visit!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was my first experience with an Airbnb rental. And I was amazed at how comfortable I felt right away. Faiths house was a home away from home. I loved the old artsy bungalow feel to the homes decor. Very pet friendly. You can tell Faith cared about her tenants and the four-legged friends that came with. I would definitely recommend this house and stay there again! Thank you again, Faith, for the experience!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good morning dear Ms. Faith,

Rashid and Masud!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always good and sweet
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay was from July 17, 2023 - July 25, 2023. This eight-night stay we wished could have lasted twice as long. It definitely was a home away from home, and more. Faith is more than a super host; her heart is as big as the ocean. She places herself in your shoes and there is nothing she wouldn't do for you. It is an exceptional place to bring your dog. Faith told us about day trips available for us to take. Faith and Tripp kindly offered to care for our dog for the day while we went on the day trip. Faith is not only a super host, but she is also an exceptional woman whose kindness knows no bounds. The home is a relaxing and enjoyable retreat by itself. We enjoyed feeding the squirrels the corn husks and watching the colorful birds. The train is a couple of blocks away, we found the sound of the train soothing. The price is beyond reasonable, the memories you will make are lifelong. Faith and her loving, well cared for home will be unforgettable. Warmly, Patti & Scott"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had an amazing stay at Faith's bungalow. The house is charming and comfortable. Our big dog felt welcome and had a blast too.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,There‚Äôs always let me feeling wonderful!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely a hidden gem in Palatka! This home is close to everything a visitor might want to do on a weekend visit...the St. John's River, Ravine Gardens and other activities. Clean and spacious are good words to describe this property. Hard to believe the house itself is almost 100 yrs old. Faith has done a great job of restoring and maintaining her Air B&B. Basic staples are in the kitchen to get your trip started...and grocery stores are within a couple miles so you can get yourself stocked up and ready for your Palatka adventures. Would definitely stay here again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was an awesome spot to stay for the weekend! Had absolutely everything you need. Great little perks and tips were laid out for us and the location was close to downtown and by the festival. Would stay here again in a heartbeat.

Place is very clean and cozy. The absolute best welcome book that has everything you could possibly need to know. Definitely on a list of recommended places to stay.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Love this little gem. This was my second time staying. Quaint little fenced in yard, easy parking, and in and out; very comfortable.
Faith thinks of everything! She had coffee, ice, some cold drinks in the fridge, the box of dog things set out. very clean and comfortable.
Would definitely stay again!
The area has lots of wonderful spots to eat. Palatka is a lovely little town; isn't far from St Augustine at much better rates! Enjoy."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay! Cute house that has been beautifully restored. Ample parking for truck and boat. Great locale close to city docks. Faith was a great hostess!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Faith‚Äôs bungalow was a fantastic find and perfect for our trip. The house was decorated beautifully and immediately felt right at home. Everything was well stocked from bathroom amenities to cookware in the kitchen. Loved the supplies for the squirrel feeder and birds. Faith was prompt on communication and very gracious. We didn‚Äôt ask much or have much in the way of special requests but I don‚Äôt have a doubt that Faith would have done all she could to accommodate. Can‚Äôt wait to go back!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This bungalow is very homey. The hostess Faith, provided lots of personal touches such as a fully stocked bbq, board games, reading materials, local restaurants and events. The place is exceptionally maintained and quaintly decorated. Faith thought of everything and also offered to provide custom items as requested. Highly recommend this place!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"First and foremost - Faith is awesome! I mentioned I was staying at her home for my birthday weekend. She had a happy birthday sign waiting at the door and a delicious cake in the fridge. Her home was beautiful and clean. My pup felt right at home. The small yard was great for my dog. I hadn't realized the distance to St Augustine when I first booked, but the 30 min drive wasn't terrible at all. Make sure to grab a key when you get there and unload your car! I almost locked myself out!
The only complaint I'd have would be lack of light out back at night. The motion sensors don't stay on for long and I would've liked that especially when letting my dog out at night. Other than that tiny thing everything was amazing and we enjoyed our stay. Definitely take advantage of the corn for the squirrels. It was hilarious watching them all gather to get a bite.
Faith is truly an amazing host. She's incredibly thoughtful and her home has everything you need. Thanks again!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Was a great place
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Faith‚Äôs place is super cute and charming. Within walking distance to the downtown area and centralized to a lot of restaurants and parks in the area. Faith was quick to respond if you have any questions. We will definitely be back ‚ù§Ô∏è

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This bungalow is a treasure. She go's above and beyond. PERFECT for pets. Fenced in yard is fabulous.
Faith's recommendation for Corky Bell's @ Gator Landing was great. ( although they don't allow pets. even on the outside patio.
Everything is absolutely squeaky clean. She has messages all over explaining things. If you go when it's cool the fireplace is great. There is a log furnished but I would definitely suggest bringing a few more. There is a train track very close. I personally love the train horn but some folks may not."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the best Airbnb experience I‚Äôve ever had‚Äîthe host went above and beyond in being thoughtful. Can‚Äôt wait to stay again!

Would definitely recommend this to anyone and look forward to using it again if the need calls for it!"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for an event at the airport. We were happy to find a pet-friendly property. I wish I had half of Faith‚Äôs taste in decor. The bed was very comfortable. I can‚Äôt think of a thing we needed that wasn‚Äôt supplied. The backyard was perfect. There are definitely some run down properties on the street, but we felt safe at all times. I also had concerns about smoking being allowed on the property. We didn‚Äôt notice one bit of cigarette odor. We‚Äôll be back for future visits!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a repeat stay with Faith. I appreciate her concern for our needs. We had everything we needed and more.

Faith was so helpful and communicative and the space was amazing! Could not recommend this rental more."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house was perfect for our trip. It also allows pets, which is a game changer when traveling for a long weekend.
If you‚Äôre not a Florida local, it‚Äôs perfect to get a sense of old Florida charm."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Faith's home is an excellent location to explore the area but still kind of be away from it all. St Augustine is an easy 45 minute drive away, Salt springs is 35 minutes away. You can rent kayaks, canoes or pontoon at the Marina next to Salt Springs. We kayaked around, just gorgeous! Palatka has Ravine Park. The home is cozy and has all amenities one needs for comfortable, enjoyable time. Definitely would recommend."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"alright, if youre looking for a place to stay close to st augustine- this isnt the place. its an hour away.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Faith‚Äôs place in Palatka is just about the coziest, welcoming cottage around. This was our third time staying here. It‚Äôs always clean and tidy, well stocked, and thoughtfully decorated. Faith is wonderfully easy to communicate with and such a gracious host. We love the little backyard for our daughter, too! Great for BBQing in the evening while the little ones play. Only 35 minutes from the beach and a couple minutes up the road from a river side park. Perfect!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Faith goes above and beyond on everything, I really enjoy my time and my family love it too. 5 stars on everything."
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,the cottage was in good repair. Inside amenities were very good. The only negative is the outdoor surroundings were not very appealing (houses and location) but it is very convenient and quiet.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Arts & Crafts Cottage is a real gem in Palatka. It‚Äôs comfortable and well stocked. The beds are comfy and the front porch swing is great. Complimentary treats and breakfast items were an unexpected bonus. The neighborhood is transitional but it‚Äôs close to everything and there‚Äôs ample parking. I look forward to staying here again.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This AirBnB was so quaint. Faith has thought of everything! Upon first glance the neighborhood wasn‚Äôt what I was expecting but I quickly had my mind set at ease with how homey the place was. We stayed for 5 days and I felt completely comfortable and at home here. The bed was very comfortable, the pans were in excellent condition, the knives were sharp, there was a laundry room, there were smart tv‚Äôs, excellent internet, filtered water for drinking, and the absolutely cutest squirrels outside the kitchen window. We became buddies throughout the week. Faith was so helpful and I actually felt a little sad to leave. I highly recommend staying here when visiting Palatka!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Quaint and intimate, this place an amazing stay for a weekend in Palatka or surrounding places.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little cottage is lovely! It is close to downtown Palatka and a lot of stores are within walking distance. Faith made sure there was ice, cold bottled water, coffee, spices and a kitchen full of cooking gadgets. The bed was super comfy and the fireplace is ready to light, should you feel a chill.
Enjoy the fun little fenced in yard and the front porch too!
One of my top favorite spots so far! Looking forward to going back when we head to St Augustine."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great house! Had everything we needed. Faith was very accommodating and quick to respond to messages. We only heard the train once during our long weekend stay and it wasn‚Äôt disruptive. Look forward to staying here again!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful host, beautiful place, and area. Away from the hustle and bustle of St. Augustine, but close enough to still visit. Absolutely perfect vacation! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Faith's home is exactly as described. I was thrilled with fenced in back yard for our dog and the cleanliness I found when checking in. Wifi worked great for my remote work needs!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Faith's home is truly a wonderful place. I could not of enjoyed my stay any more. During my stay, I FaceTimed my mother to show her the ornate decor inside the home....now my Mother wants to make a trip to the home for a stay. Faith was very gracious in her communication throughout my stay and provided everything inside the home for a wonderful experience. I hope to make another trip to her home one day.

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This has been my second 5-day stay here. Faith is an excellent host, the bed is extremely comfortable. Nice kitchen, new gas stove! Plan on staying here again next year."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was very accommodating and Faith communicated with us very well. Thank you so much!!!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time staying at Faith‚Äôs charming 1920‚Äôs craftsman‚Äôs style house. It is very clean, and has pretty much everything you need for cooking. There are squirrels on the side of the house that Faith leaves corncobs so you can sit in the chairs with ferns all around and watch the squirrels or from the kitchen window. Beds are very comfortable! This was our first time at a Airbnb and Faith made us feel very welcomed plus answered our questions right away. We would recommend to our family & friends and we would definitely stay again."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I went to Palatka for a wedding, booked this place a month in advance just to make sure we got it. Everything was awesome! Faith was a great host and very understanding about our arrival and departure since we drive in from Tennessee. We will definitely try to come back!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Faith's bungalow was a very nice, quiet place for a month-long stay out of the cold winter of Minnesota. It is centrally located to other parts of Florida. We could take a quick trip to Palm Coast where we would walk along the beach with our dog (Jungle Hut Beach), take in a dinner theater in Jacksonville (Alhambra), meet friends in Daytona Beach, and drive to Blue Springs State Park to see the manatees. When we weren't going places, we would walk to the River Walk along the St. John's River, or to Ravine Gardens where we enjoyed all of the beautiful azaleas in full bloom.
Faith is one of the most attentive hosts we have dealt with through Airbnb. She thought of everything! Anytime we would think of something we needed it was there - from utensils in the kitchen (even a blender for our morning smoothie), to beach towels, to a water dish for our dog. When we hit a rainy snap in weather, she was so quick to provide us with wood for the cute fireplace. We highly recommend Faith's place!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is the ABSOLUTE best air b n b we have ever stayed in! It was amazing and perfect! The host was AMAZING!!! I wish other hosts could learn from her!

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying at Faith‚Äôs place and it is wonderful. The location is very close to downtown Palatka. The house is a very cute cottage with a historic feel. The kitchen has the essentials for cooking such as oil, spices, etc‚Ä¶. We really enjoyed our stay and will definitely try to book here again if we are in Palatka again."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This space is wonderful! Not only is it perfectly clean, but there are also a million personal touches to make you feel welcomed and at home. From the well-lit entry path to the gift left just for us inside, we were impressed with the little touches. It was even decorated for the holiday season in a way that complemented the interior decor but wasn't overwhelming.
Faith is a wonderful hostess and incredibly thoughtful. We will definitely stay here again."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is an old town with history and beauty. There is an Amtrak train close by but please don't let it discourage you. It sounds off in the distance. Our toddler and 2 dogs never even noticed it.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great place
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Home is warm and inviting. Owner goes extra mile to make sure guests are comfortable! Would stay again

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Lovely house with a nice size fenced in yard if you have kids or a dog. The house is in a good location just minutes from the St. John‚Äôs River. Faith is such a wonderful host who left thoughtful items throughout the house. Cleaning supplies, supplies for dogs, coffee supplies, popcorn and snacks‚Ä¶ I could go on! We really enjoyed our stay here and will be booking again if we are back in the area!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Faith is an awesome host‚Ä¶.she helps with any questions you have. The home had everything I needed and then some.
For me, she went to a personal level because of the nature of my travels, and it was greatly appreciated! She has a great heart."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot. Peaceful and great proximity to beach and Gainesville
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great cozy bungalow, old but full of charm at a great location with everything just right. Greatest host, by the way."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,that‚Äôs my favorite! No where better than here
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The home was beautiful and very comfortable with a convenient proximity to St. Augustine. Faith provided excellent communication and was generous enough to extend our check out time. I can‚Äôt say enough about how cozy the home was and how sad we were to have to leave. Highly recommend!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,we love staying at this airbnb. It is our third and hope to have many more staycations in this very cute house
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Welcome to your new home away from home! The bungalow is super comfy and has all the things you need. The area next to the house was good for walking the dog around in grass and staying off the main streets. We liked hanging out in the front porch and feeding the squirrels. Faith is super accommodating and quick to respond to any inquiry you may have. Will totally try to stay with her again. Five stars ‚ú® üíñ
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay. House is very beautiful and cozy. everything we needed was available. We would definitely stay again.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cutest, most cozy, stay in Palatka guaranteed! Faith gets all the details right, from the decor to the all cotton sheets‚Äîthoughtful touches are everywhere. We absolutely love staying here!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is so adorable. The place is really well appointed and very cozy and comfortable. We used it as a base to explore the region. It‚Äôs not too far from St. Augustine either, about a 40min drive. We would definitely stay here again.
The owner mentioned the train might be noisy, but it was nowhere near as loud as expected. But they even had ear plugs available for light sleepers (they not necessary for us)."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If you are looking for a cozy place to stay this is the place! Everything is close by if you need to run to the store to get stuff, very convenient. If you have kids there‚Äôs a little park by the river they can enjoy which is only 3 mins away. There are little shops within walking distance if you are looking for some unique items..
There is a little corner shop about 3 blocks up the road that I would probably avoid. We saw a man get out of this car with an AK37 rifle, not in a case, that he might have been getting ready to sale or something. We didn‚Äôt hang around long enough to find out. Definitely find another spot to get your late night snacks from.
The bungalow itself was very clean and welcoming. Faith did a wonderful job of making sure that we had everything we needed to get by during our stay. There was even a bag of ice in the freezer so we could have ice cold drinks! Very thoughtful. If you forgot little things Faith had it there. It felt like a hotel suite but way better.
Faith communicated regularly to let us know things that were happening around the town. She let us know that despite the rain activities at the river we‚Äôre still being held for the 4th of July. She offered to stop by to take the trash to curb for us. Anytime I messaged her with a question she was very quick to respond back. It was wonderful knowing if we needed anything she would be there to help.
I will say that Faith certainly showed that she was more than someone out to make money but someone who genuinely cares for others. There was a nasty storm that was coming and Faith allowed us to stay an extra night so that we didn‚Äôt have to worry about driving in the tornado weather. We will be forever grateful for this kind hearted person.
We will certainly stay here again and recommend it to anyone wanting to see another side of Florida."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I feeling there so sweet for me! I love stay there forever if I can .

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The ABSOLUTE BEST!!
Let's put it like this: We arrived by boat. The dock is over a mile from the house. We had two adults, two kids, two Labrador retrievers, 8 bags and a huge cooler.
Faith showed up in her personal car and told us to put everything in, including the dogs. She took us to the awesome house and picked us up two days later to take us back to the boat.
She's amazing, the house was awesome and I've never encountered a host with such a positive vibe.
Ten stars. We WILL be back for another boat trip."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our 2nd stay and we are just as happy as the first time. the house was clean and adorable. We checked out Azalea City Brewing while we were there and it's worth a visit! can't wait to come back!

2021-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space is cozy and charming. We had a bit of an emergency at the house (no fault of the owner) and Faith responded immediately and offered us alternative accommodations if the issue could not be resolved in a timely manner. Her communication throughout the process was a 10+. The issue ended up being resolved and we stayed at the house. The beds were comfortable and the kitchen was well stocked. One of the downsides to the location was that a train came through nearby, blowing it's horns at 3 am each night we were there. Possibly it can be heard throughout the whole town or it's not a regular occurrence, that I don't know, but it definitely woke us up. Regardless, we would definitely stay again if in the area in the future."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was my first time using Airbnb, and I had an amazing experience. Our host Faith could not have been any more accommodating.

2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay in this cute little bungalow. It is walking distance to shops and restaurants in Palatka, and an easy bike ride to the Palatka to St. Augustin rail trail, and a short drive to the Palatka to Lake Butler rail trail. Don't miss the Ravine Garden State Park a few minutes away. The bungalow has a cute little front porch, food for squirrels, a full kitchen with gas stove and a working fireplace. It is an excellent value. We highly recommend the cottage and look forward to a return visit in the future!"

2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Faith's bungalow in Palatka is charming in a way that is hard to put into words. We stayed in her place thinking we would be driving into St. Augustine a few times but in the end we just preferred staying in the bungalow all day everyday. The home is cozy and spacious and has everything you need. Faith is a thoughtful host who tries to anticipate your needs before you even have them. We had a cozy, pre-Christmas relaxing family trip and I'd recommend Faith's place to anyone on their way to St. Augustine or just looking for some time away from it all."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Could not recommend this place enough.

They really thought of everything! The house was very clean, check in was easy, and most importantly, there was a nice backyard and plenty of greenery beyond the property for my pups to explore!

Vinnie was very accommodating and answered immediately when we had questions. My nephew chased lizards every day. We had s‚Äômores over the campfire and played board games on the screened in porch. We will most definitely be back next time we visit our uncle. This was one of the nicest places we have rented we love the farm. Ziggy was extremely nice and made sure we were welcome. This house exceeded our expectations and the cleanliness was fantastic. It is very well stocked also. Lots of dishes, silverware, pots and pans. Plenty of towels it was just like being at home.

A pasture surrounded the house and the farm animals and fish pond were a special attraction for the children (2 and 6).
The kitchen was well equipped and even had children's plastic dishes and utensils.
An unexpected experience happened while there. We had an evening thunderstorm while sitting on the porch. I'm pretty sure the frogs were louder than the thunder. our kids thought that was hilarious."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Sue was accommodating and super reaponsive when my original reservation was canceled and we had to scramble to find a new place. Her description of the place and the cost was too good to pass up! The original cancellation ended up being a blessing in disguise.

Good hiking in the area. 50 minute drive to a nice Atlantic beach. Good resturants close by."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Recently stayed at this Airbnb during Bike Week and overall, it was a fantastic experience. The house was exactly as described in the listing - spacious, well-equipped, and in a convenient location. The check-in process was smooth, and the host was very responsive to any questions we had.
One minor issue we encountered was with the water - it had a noticeable sulfur smell. While this was a bit off-putting, it didn't detract too much from our overall enjoyment of the stay. Perhaps this is something the host could look into improving for future guests.
Despite the water concern, I would still highly recommend this place, especially for those visiting during Bike Week. The location was perfect for our needs, and the amenities provided made our stay comfortable and enjoyable. If you can overlook the water issue, this Airbnb is definitely worth renting for your trip."

All sorts of knick-knacks, a circular stairway leading to a loft bedroom, a cozy eating area next to the kitchen, night lights everywhere to help you find your way and other things that I fail to remember.
I think there was everything in the kitchen that anybody would need.
The beds were comfortable and the linens smelled great. Instant hot water in tub/shower.
We'll probably be back in the Palatka area again and if so I hope Stephanie's place will be available."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We stayed in Stephanie's place for a week in February. The home had plenty of room for us to spread out and each have our own space. She provided games and DVDs - which my children were so happy to see. The home itself is right next to a wide paved bike path which we didn't utilize but looked great. Stephanie was very responsive and kind.

2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,House was great and the host amazing.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Her home was decorated beautifully, comfortable and my family enjoyed the wonderful fragrance that greeted you once you entered inside. In every room you could tell she wanted your stay to be a wonderful one. Her home was very accommodating with kitchen, laundry, bedroom, bathroom and cleaning supplies. This was the first time using an Airbnb. l booked Stephanie's home for my brother, his wife and their 3 grandchildren that traveled from North Carolina. My family's homes/apartments (and mine) in Palatka were too small to entertain a party of 5. Her home fulfilled a great need at a good rate and they felt right at home and wished to stay longer. We will definitely book her home again. I applaud her as the host with the most!"

Easy drive to St. Augustine but not much around the area of Palatka. Restaurants in Palatka leave much to be desired so you had better plan to cook at home or drive the 51 minutes into downtown St. Augustine for food/entertainment."

Even the essentials (like shampoo and soaps) were above and beyond - so good, I have already ordered some for our home! And now I want a bidet (and now I understand the title ‚Äúrustic but modern‚Äù. It really was the best of both worlds.
Not only did the humans (us) enjoy our time there, it was the most relaxed our dogs have ever been on vacation. The LOVED IT!

Roberta‚Äôs home was so relaxing and had everything we needed and what we didn‚Äôt have was just an extremely short drive away. The views are beautiful, my kids who are 21 and 18 enjoyed every bit of the quiet cool mornings, afternoons and evening. Lovely sunsets and during the winter time the cool weather is perfection.

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We were comfortable and happy at Peacock Cottage. It was in a great location for us. The Keurig coffee machine was a real plus as we usually travel with some of our favorite k-cups. Would definitely look at staying here again when we are in Palatka.

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had such a good weekend at Roberta‚Äôs place. We have 3 young kids (9 weeks, 3 and a 6 year old) and and actually slept comfortably in the space. Love what they did with the cabin and the ideas they have for the future of their property. The kids loved walking down by the lake in the morning, looking for the bald eagles and grabbing a fresh grapefruit. We drove over to St. Augustine 1 day and hiked the Ravine Gardens another day. They were so accommodating and even brought us a pack n play and high chair just in case. We had an adventurous weekend and would love to visit again."

2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Roberta's place was a nice cozy getaway. The decorations are lovely. The backyard areas was really nice at night.

She loved the decor and now wants peacock wallpaper! The hosts made sure you could have anything you need‚Ä¶ I mean 3 different coffee makers to choose from? I was sold! And the coziness with actual DVDs and games. We forgot we were in Florida for a minute. The lake is so peaceful and the trees that surround the lot, serene. The extra touches like a book on the bed of my daughters sleeping nook just made it a home away from home. Thank you guys for sharing your lovely space so we could strengthen our family bond and just relax after such stressful times. The hosts are also the sweetest things if you do rent and are lucky enough to meet them!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a great place for a small retreat
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Roberta and Skip are so great and were extremely fast to get back to us with any questions or needs we had. The cottage is absolutely perfect!

Roberta is very friendly and a great host. If I‚Äôm ever back in the area I know where I will stay again."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Roberta‚Äòs cottage is a wonderful little enclave in Palatka. You‚Äòll forget about the rustle and bustle of the streets when relaxing either inside this beautifully decorated cottage or in it‚Äôs little Zen Garden. We particularly enjoyed having a kitchen to use as well as the dock over the lake to watch the sunset from.
2021-05-01,4.0,Group trip,Great secluded little bungalow! Perfect for a quick trip about an hour away from St.Augustin. May be difficult to maneuver for elderlas the beds are pretty high. Great for same families or a group of couples.

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely loved my stay in Peacock cottage. Roberta has thought of everything and then some. From the extra touches like fresh flowers in the bathroom to current issues of magazines on the coffee table to three different ways to make coffee to the peacock theming to the lush bathroom towels...the list goes on and on. Truly, this might be my best Air BnB experience yet. Would love to return and highly recommend this cottage to anyone visiting the Palatka area."
2021-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Roberta was the best host. She was quick to respond to messages and had the cottage filled with little extras to make our stay special. The peacock cottage was very private and a good distance from the hosts home which was nice. The only negative would be that the rooms the beds are in do not have doors which made sleep a bit difficult traveling with someone who got up to go to the bathroom a lot at night. The cottage couldn‚Äôt be more cozy and couldn‚Äôt be more perfect for a young family or couple getaway.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The amenities were top notch and the space was very well decorated and cozy. Our hosts were extremely hospitable and have a beautiful property. We‚Äôre already looking forward to our next training trip so we can come back and take full advantage of those kayaks!

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Peacock Inn is such a great spot! The location and cottage itself are superb! Decorated in the theme of Paisley, the peacock who lives out back, this little cottage is impressively decorated and packed with everything you‚Äôd need and so much more! Roberta and Skip were amazing hosts! They thought of everything and introduced themselves quickly and wanted to make sure we didn‚Äôt need anything more. My sons loved fishing on the lake, the bumper pool table and making s‚Äômores over the fire that was located privately in the back yard area. I would highly recommend staying here and plan on returning myself in the future!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Peacock cottage was very cozy. We loved the design. There is a lot of privacy and there are nice sitting areas outside. We just stayed one night and would definitely recommend this cottage. It was too cold for us to kayak but nice to know there are kayaks and a paddle boat to use.
2021-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Very cute little cottage. Roberta and her husband are extremely nice hosts, came to our need immediately with questions. The back area was very private and nice. The cottage would be a little warm for me in the summer, it was hot in January bc the window unit doesn't reach the bedroom. Decorated beautifully, it seemed like a lot of furniture for the space especially if you have 5 people staying.
The kids loved the fishing, swimming and kayaking and of course having fires and smores. These were the best features, a great place to unplug and get to playing games or spending quality time together because there's no wifi for this cottage...which was a plus for us! Thank you again!"
2021-01-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"The host (Roberta) was very attentive, she makes sure you get what you need, and she was available for any question. If you don‚Äôt mind being in the middle of woods, this place is a okay place to spend the night in."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a cute little oasis. They thought of everything and it looked like a page out of Better Homes and Garden. Should be featured in Tiny Home living. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It‚Äôs difficult to find great places to stay in this area. Two Old goats was awesome!! It was clean and quiet. The animals on the farm were really cool to see from the balcony. We enjoyed our stay!

I recommend this place for anyone wanting to get away from the riff raff pace of city life!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect getaway! This quaint loft above the barn of the alpacas was the perfect place for us.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Two Goat's Farm. We had beautiful weather to enjoy the animals and surroundings.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The accommodations were beautiful and the animals were a huge plus! We loved sitting on the balcony, watching the animals play."

All the animals that are right below you are so adorable and friendly. The sheep is like a dog. The unit itself is absolutely adorable, clean and well stocked. There was even tea for me to drink at night before bed. The beds, pillows and linens were extremely comfortable. Bathroom was super clean and everything smelled fresh. The only con was there wasn't a hairdryer. Not a big deal for me, but maybe someone else. Thanks so much for sharing your space!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was very scenic with very friendly animals. One issue we had was its well water so the water has to run for a bit or else it'll smell, but thats expected of the area. Very cozy for a short vacation. All amenities worked great and it was a very easy check in."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was beautiful. My wife fell In love with the pantry, of all things. We loved the open floor plan with the separated rooms. And the views from the window were spectacular. I've seen large showers before, but that one takes the cake. We arrived late and left a little early, but it was well worth the price for the beauty and fun we had. I will be booking this home on our next visit toFlorida"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,It was even more peaceful than we imagined. The house was stocked with everything. The walk to the dock was SUPER EASY with a fabulous yard to walk through.

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This small home provides a perfect place to enjoy quiet and privacy for a couple on retreat. It is clean throughout and the space well designed for utility. The kitchen is complete and satisfactory in every way. The bed is as good as you will find in any commercial accommodation. The sitting area and TV are comfortable. Staying here for relaxation or as a base for exploring the local area is five star. Be advised, however, the lake is very small and the views are primarily of surrounding camps and homes. We didn't bother to take out the canoe for there is really nothing to see. Apart from that, you will not be disappointed."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This adorable cottage was so comfortable for us. From the moment we stepped inside, we knew it was what we hoped for.
The very large, semi-circle window in the kitchen provided the best view of the lake and large oak trees. It was truly picturesque.
The king sized bed was perfectly comfortable, the linens were soft and pretty. There were plenty of towels, washcloths, and hand towels.
The cottage has a retro feel to it and it was refreshingly nostalgic.
The ac works amazingly. We put the dehumidifier on during the day and slept peacefully at night with it turned off.
Additionally, the cottage was very clean and just perfect for us. üíó
We recommend this place if you are looking to relax and enjoy nature. Cute, cozy, clean, and comfortable! 5 stars."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great place if you‚Äôre looking to get away from the busyness of the world. It‚Äôs quite, peaceful, and you‚Äôre able to relax while feeling right at home. There‚Äôs a lot to do in the area whether it be going to the springs to walk and swim, or just relaxing at the house and taking the canoe out. The host are amazing and great at responding back within a short period of time. I‚Äôd recommend this place and would for sure comeback to stay again."

We stayed here as a home base for visiting springs + Gainesville. While there are neighbors + usual neighborhood sounds, it‚Äôs still really peaceful + feels pretty private, esp the house + porch. Pictures are all accurate. Hosts are responsive. I‚Äôd totally stay here again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed using the canoe. The kitchen was very well stocked.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Joe and Tefa have a beautiful cottage and I always feel welcomed by them and the house. It is like home away from home. This was my third visit to Gopher Ridge and each time I get there and I love the place. Joe and Tefa have done an amazing job in renovating the cottage. I will go back again and again.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home is secluded and cozy, the perfect getaway for those looking to explore and adventure. There are so many great places to go to around the area, and even great recomendations from Joe and Tefa. I personally recomend stopping at the Silver Springs State Park museum and walking the trails there too if you wanna see the local wildlife. The view from the kitchen window out is stunning and we really enjoyed sitting on the back porch often. Super neat and tidy house and it feels very welcoming. Very clear instructions and fantactic communication. We had a fantastic stay. Absolutly amazing."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the few places I've stayed where the photos were spot on. It's an adorable cottage. Easy to move around in, not cluttered, and plenty of lounging space both inside and outside. Was peaceful just sitting in the canoe in the lake, or on the back deck.

The bed was very comfortable as was the sofa. Shower was roomy and having the extra bathroom and laundry was a plus. Would definitely book again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,very cute & cozy home! well kept. will be visiting again
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great place to relax & enjoy your time! We loved every second of it.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful and very peaceful getaway for a staycation/short vacation. Enjoyed the lake and beautiful lily pads. Would bring extra snacks and food next time because shopping is far for good supermarkets or restaurants but it was exactly off the grid like we were hoping for.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This spot is placed in a beautiful natural setting on a small and lovely lake covered in lily pads and flowers . I saw sandhill cranes from the kitchen window while drinking coffee and heard owls at night. Coffee and tea are provided.
The house is filled with beautiful personal touches and amenities that made the stay more comfortable. Overall I had the feeling that the guest was very much in mind when things were put together. The bed is super comfortable as is the sofa. The modern appliances were nice, and the filtered water was delicious, which is unusual, in my experience, for Florida.
I came to check out the natural springs in the area and the house is located conveniently near several of them. The springs are absolutely beautiful and incredible. Lots of wildlife. The springs are managed by the park service and offer amenities such as changing rooms and gift shops. I definitely recommend snorkeling! At Salt Springs, you can snorkel right down into the spring itself."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed a peaceful stay at this property. The host communicated well, the home was clean and comfortable, and the property was beautiful.

Had wonderful recommendations in the description that we went to with food and attractions would definitely stay there again. There was plenty of privacy. It was off the beaten path of public. It did take about 30 minutes to get anywhere with food or attractions if not more but overall extremely good stay.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Joe and Tefa have a beautiful home. I am blessed to be able to stay there. I always leave the house clean and respected. It is a cozy and beautiful place to stay.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joe's place is even better than the pictures. One of the cutest places we have stayed. We had everything we needed, a comfortable bed and it was nice having the extra toilet in the laundry room. Loved the open kitchen with the beautiful countertops So nice out back at the picnic table under the shade of the tree. Had dinner at Hog Wild Country Cafe about a 15 min drive. Great BBQ! Joe provided plenty of information prior and during our stay and was very responsive when I sent a message. Great Air BmB host. Dont let the dirt road scare you we have a Forn Focus and it was no problem at all. Grocery store is close and Hitchcock's had everything we needed. Short weekend trip but so relaxing. you will not be let down if you stay here."

Had everything we needed. The views were great with plenty of privacy.
Very clean and renovations were excellent.
There are many natural parks in the area. Just be prepared to drive a bit to experience all the area has to offer.
We saw wild horses and buffalo at Payne‚Äôs Prairie. Rainbow Springs was also a beautiful spot for easy hiking.
Will be back! 5 stars!"
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"As I use a walker, it was difficult to get in the back door with the split rock sidewalk.
A challenge for me."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joe's place was very private, super clean, & definitely relaxing. The view of the lake from inside was inviting, and it was thoroughly enjoyable to relax on the deck and fish off the dock. The Spanish moss hanging from the trees added great ambience to the area. The furnishings in Joe's place were modern & convenient (loved the big kitchen!). It was very well decorated and was larger than appeared on-line. Joe was exceptionally responsive, getting back to us immediately when we reached out to him. We would recommend his place to anyone desiring a quiet, peaceful retreat!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great place to relax and enjoy the lake. Lovely house and decor, and a gorgeous view of the lake through the kitchen window. Joe and his wife were very communicative and made sure we had everything we needed. We loved it!"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything in the house was beautiful. The home decor was perfect. Just a lovely house.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joe and Tefa's house was perfect for our Florida vacation. Communications was great. They answered all my questions and made great recommendations. The space was clean, welcoming, and had everythingwe needed. We made several day trips and visited Cedar Key, Manatee Springs, Silver Springs and Gainesville. All were wonderful but Silver Springs was delightful. Highly recommend eating at Fryers and Blue Water Bay in Melrose and The Yearling in Cross Creek. We would love to stay at this house on our next trip to Florida."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sweet and cozy place, and nice and quiet - great for a getaway! Joe & his wife were very helpful and always responded fairly quickly with messaging. Would definitely go back again :)"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hidden Gem! Perfect for a couples stay or family of 4! Can def see the stars at night, use the campfire or any of the fun amenities they have available for the lake! Went fishing off the dock and to Silver Springs State Park, it seemed right out their back door! Was really peaceful and quiet, so if you're looking for that look no further. Adorable place!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We very much enjoyed our stay at your beautiful home.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is such a beautiful and well kept home. The host was very kind and responsive to my emails. The location is beautiful and peaceful. 10 out of 10!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Best spot in the area really loved it!

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Described completely accurate. Very nice comfortable place for a couples vacation/getaway. We were able to relax and settle in immediately because it‚Äôs so homey feeling. Everything was perfect!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The property is newly renovated, clean, and very cute. The pictures do not do it justice, and it is much more spacious than it appears. Joe was helpful for check in and check out and when I reached out with questions, but was otherwise a hands off host that let us enjoy our time uninterrupted. Since we were visiting family in Interlachen, we had them bring a fishing pole over and caught and released some bass and blue gill, and even spotted a baby gator! This trip was a great experience and I would recommend the property to anyone looking to relax or visit nearby sites while staying in a clean and comfortable house on the water."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was such fun traveling down an actual rural road and arriving at the property which was surrounded by magnificent live oak trees. The electric door lock was so cool! We had never seen one before and now want one for our own house.
The kitchen was very accommodating and although it didn‚Äôt have a dishwasher it was no problem as it was just the two of us. Since I love to cook I took advantage of the brand new stove with that neat stainless steel hood (and yes, I want one for my house now too lol).
The queen bed was very comfortable and we slept like logs. The WiFi signal was great! We binge-watched movies on the super sized sofa while enjoying popcorn provided by the host which was a nice touch. Coffee, creamer, and a selection of teas were also provided by the host.
We had hoped to take advantage of the paddle boat and canoe, but couldn‚Äôt because of some physical issues at our age‚Ä¶oh, if we were only 10 years younger! We sat out on the new dock as fish jumped and herons flew over the lake. We also saw a mother on a paddle board with her daughter on a kayak and waved to them.
One day we ate at The Yearling restaurant and toured author Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings‚Äô house and spent another day at Alexander Springs off SR #40, which was magical! We will definitely be staying at Sand Lake again when we visit the area. Thank you, Joe!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful property with plenty to do at the house from paddle boarding, to swimming, to sitting out by a fire. The owners were nice and very responsive always looking to help make the stay better. Neighbors are nice and helpful as well, and keep the area peaceful and quiet. Untouched by the hustle and bustle of a city. Would recommend this place to anyone who is looking to get away and relax. The house itself was beautifully unkept and furnished, and it was obvious that plenty of thought went into making it a comfortable living space."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Ms. Sherrie‚Äôs place is very clean and extremely comfortable. My stay at this location was pleasant and she has extra amenities that other Airbnb hosts do not offer. My family and I were very pleased with our stay. We will definitely stay again in the future.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Anna and Josh are amazing human beings! The cottage is immaculately clean. Tastefully Decorated. Fantastic Sunset Views! Riverside boat deck made for an stress-free and stunning evenings. My amazing employer provided this excellent experience!
Annas‚Äô hosting skills are beyond superb. This has been one of my best Airbnb experiences in any of my national or international travels. As a former Airbnb owner, I have appreciation for attentive, unobtrusive, stellar host like these because they balance the scales for the not so nice AIRBNB experiences that occur from time to time. We left a gift of boat inspired coasters, please enjoy!
Ps. We are coaster peopleüòá

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at Josh and Anna‚Äòs. Their place is serene and beautiful on the bank of the St. John‚Äôs River. It‚Äôs very quiet and peaceful.
Good place to getaway from it all.
The house is perfect for a small family. We brought Bikes and rode from the house along the rural roads and bike trail.
We went to the Ravine Garden State Park, which was a great place to hike with kids. It‚Äôs about 15 minutes away outside of Palatka.
I would definitely come back."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place, great people."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Probably the best on property host airbnb rental I‚Äôve ever stayed at. We had steaks with Anna and Josh and fished most of the time we were there when I wasn‚Äôt working. Be prepared to catch just about everything off that pier. 10/10 would recommend to anyone looking for a nice place on the river to stay.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place to stay, super quiet and cozy place on the water. The house was very clean and had absolutely everything I needed. The hosts were super kind and easy going, they mad my stay very enjoyable. I would 100% recommend this place to anyone!!! Thank you"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü all the way! Host is real deal breaker and Anna was very responsive and extremely helpful!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Anna and Josh are excellent hosts and have a beautiful home and property with a perfect guest house. Everything was as shown in the photos and exceptionally clean. The beautiful view from their dock of St. John‚Äôs river makes for a great morning coffee spot or a relaxing afternoon book reading nook.
10/10 would recommend!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for hosting the guys during their fishing tournament at St. John's. The rental was perfect for their stay and well appointed for everything they needed. Your fishing tip also helped them place in the tournament! We will be back.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This place is amazing! The house was perfect for our sibling retreat, 3 bedrooms perfect. We spent hours on the fabulous dock, sunrise, sunset, moonset and during the day. We did 3 different bike rides, totalling 50 miles, from the house into the countryside and the trail. Also hiked at Ravine Gardens. It is so peaceful, quiet, and beautiful along the river."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a peaceful place! Watching the sunset from the deck was indescribable. The property is on the same property as the owner. They were great hosts and were a pleasure to talk to. Be sure to try Velchoff‚Äôs Corner restaurant in old town.
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"I'll probably come back to this place, it's just spectacular. I recommend it 100%"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Lovely stay !!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and relaxing. The place is very nice and relaxing.Exactly what we were looking for.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Anna was exceptionally polite when I spoke to her on the phone. Was really mind-blowing. The place was S-P-O-T-L-E-S-S. Perfectly clean. As for most important criteria‚Ä¶ Noise levels. Absolutely silent the entire stay. The location is also extremely beautiful, backed up to the water.
My only complaint and advice to future guests is that between the 2 showers there was only one bottle of shampoo (plus some tiny trial sizes in both), and absolutely no body wash in either. Definitely make a trip to the store to pick some up for yourself if you flew (or use hand soap like I did which isn‚Äôt as slippery on the skin), or ask the host if this has been changed. I have never been to an Airbnb that didn‚Äôt supply shampoo and body wash in every bathroom.
All in all, it really was an absolutely perfect and gorgeous stay and I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to book again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,everything very good thank you very much
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,the place is very beautiful
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful, beautiful, spottless guest house with gorgeous views on the St John's River
Anna and Josh were beyond responsive and helpful.
Exactly what we needed to relax. We will book again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,The guest house is adorable and so very comfortable. The rates were cheaper than most of the motels in the area and it was well worth the cost..The surroundings were beautiful and we enjoyed getting to sit on the dock overlooking the river. Anna and Josh were the best hosts! They were responsive any time we had questions and were very generous letting us use the amenities on their property. I highly recommend and would love to stay again next time I‚Äôm in town.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Amazing host very friendly and helpful, if i need anything i would text and trust me they responded fast, house was very clean and well put together i would gladly recommend this place to friends and family."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Cute place! Very Clean! AC works like a champ! The view from the back yard is amazing as well as the sunsets. We were able to use their amazing dock and park our boat there for a fishing tournament. Definitely would recommend!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This house is a private, separate guest house on some huge land. The guest house is waterfront with river access and a dock! The ladder on the dock allowed us to get in the river and enjoy the St. John‚Äôs River and get back up easily. Whenever we didn‚Äôt want to get wet, we could still enjoy a beautiful view of the river. Inside the home was very bright and inviting. I was surprised at how clean the house was, and how easy it was to check in. An introduction message was sent to me which made checking in a breeze. Along with water activities, there was also a paved bicycle/running trail just outside the neighborhood that goes for miles, for our morning run. Local restaurants are pretty good. We caught trivia night at a local Mexican place. Walking the riverside in palatka was very pretty, but be sure to make it back before sunset because the sunset from the river-house is one of the best I‚Äôve seen. If not, the riverside is still a pretty amazing sunset. Plenty of bars to frequent as well."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our Airbnb rental was a dream come true for fishing enthusiasts like us! The fishing deck was perfect, offering breathtaking views and easy access to the water. The house itself was immaculate, with tasteful decor and all the amenities we needed. It was a truly memorable and relaxing getaway. Highly recommended!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First off - ANNA YOU ROCK!!!!******
I can say that Mother Nature threw us a curve ball while we were at the home. But the owners jumped in front of the issue and resolved it to the best of their ability. Bravo!!
Definitely found our diamond in the East Palatka area. Quite, clean and spacious are good words to describe this property. 3 Days of peace and relaxation in this cozy little cottage!!! Everything needed to have a great stay. We hope to stay with them every time we‚Äôre in the area. Don‚Äôt forget your fishing rods and sunscreen."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This vacation was all for my husband as he wanted to fish the St. John's River. The boat ramp and dock was amazing and just what he wanted! The house and porch was just what we needed to relax after a day of fishing. Every room was spacious and suited my family's needs in every way. The gated yard accommodated my daughter's pups and kept them safe while outside. The yard was large enough for all of our vehicles and our boat trailer. We would definitely recommend to family and friends and this place actually makes me want to buy a canal property! Thank you Tiger and Larisa for opening your home to us!!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Was everything the post stated, boat ramp was shallow due to low level of water. Future boaters beware of low water level. The place was great and roomy."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to stay!!
Will be back!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was as described

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I can‚Äôt begin to say enough about this River House. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! Much needed time away for my birthday! The host was responsive and provided a link to local area attractions. Fishing off the dock was amazing and the neighbor across the canal was very friendly. We enjoyed watching his dog and chickens play. We caught several fish from the dock. Biggest bonus is we traveled with our dog. His enjoyment of the dock and the canal made it so much better. Thank you for sharing your home with us.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice spot

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely enjoyed our stay! The area is beautiful, and anything you could need while on vacation is there. I really loved how much though and attention to detail and guest experience went into the home. We even added an additional stay to our visit just to enjoy the yard and water feature in the back. I highly recommend this home and we all look forward to staying again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful place right on the banks of the St. John‚Äôs River. If you are a fisherman, this is a dream place to stay! Plenty of room to park a boat and it even has a boat ramp in the backyard. I‚Äôll be back for sure! üëçüí™üé£"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The location is relatively private but close to town. I fished while the wife worked remotely. The canal can get shallow at low tide but it worked out ok. The walkway by the canal worked good to tie up my boat securely. We had a great week of fishing and relaxing.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Awesome location if you like boating down St John's river!..easy private boat ramp n dock made a fishing trip enjoyable.Will definitely be back!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We booked Tigers place to get out of town for the weekend, it was a very spacious, clean, comfortable home. Our dogs loved it and it was in a great location to get to downtown Palatka and explore the surrounding areas. We loved the large TV and comfortable couch and board games!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place made me and my family feel like home. I will definitely come back.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The cutest place and the hosts were so nice and responsive. We really enjoyed our stay!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our family needed a place when we visited for a family wedding. So glad we had this instead of a hotel room to stay in. Made our weekend away from home enjoyable!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"3 couples and a couple of dogs stayed for 3 days. We had a great time. It's private and away enough, yet so much to do all around. We shopped at Hitchcock's Market and the Stand for fresh veggies and fruit. The house was very clean and spacious. The space is well thought out and the beds and linens were very comfortable. All the comforts of home and then some. Our dogs loved it too!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Nice place to stay at and very peaceful!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was another one of Palatka‚Äôs gem. Sunset was beautiful over the water. Friendly neighbor directly behind, great bar with friendly staff and super cheap drinks, 0.9 miles away, really close to our event, I love the spaciousness. Thanks for having us."

The fact that we arrived quite late was not an issue for the key handover. Liz was waiting for us.
The house is very very old and has its own charm. You can reach the upper floor via an external staircase. We loved it. It is comfortably furnished and you have a lot of space. Since it was very cold at the time of our trip, Liz had already preheated everything.
We only used the house to stay overnight."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Liz was a wonderful host. They were both so friendly and helpful and it was so nice getting to know them.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were met with fresh baked cookies and cold waters at check in. My daughter goes to college here and Liz‚Äôs place is near her apartment, so the location in this historical neighborhood is ideal. You can tell Liz and her husband have put a lot
of love and effort into this house and space. The size and value is unmatched in the area. It is private with parking, a large living room, and two porches. I would stay again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very spacious and clean property. It felt like being in a treehouse when you looked through the windows and were surrounded by the old Florida trees in this Victorian home. Also great location to just walk around and see all these Victorian homes. My favorite part was the home-baked cookies she surprised us with - I became a cookie monster - they were super yummy!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I stayed here for a night and the place exceeded my expectations. It was warm and welcoming and the bed was super comfortable. It was a good distance from St Augustine and she had even welcomed us with warm cookies! Loved the stay and would definitely come back!
,,,I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place if you have an animal. It describes the location as dog friendly yet there‚Äôs fire ants all over the property. Also the side door does not lock and I felt very unsafe staying here. My dog got bit from the ants and now I need to see a vet. Also the neighbor to the right has a dog and it‚Äôs not very friendly. The toilets don‚Äôt flush sometimes and have air pockets in the water lines. Not very good water pressure here.
,,,"It is a nice looking house on the inside but it didn't not have a washer or dryer it didn't have wifi the smoke detectors didn't work over half of the windows are sealed shut, there are exposed wire and plugs through out the house the bedroom upstairs dose not have working electric plus has clutter thru out the house none of the closest are useable and the air conditioner only works half of the time. The neighborhood is not the best so be careful. The neighbor play very very loud music thru out the week. Other than that Stephanie is a very nice lady. Had no hard feeling for her hope she gets these problems fixed."
