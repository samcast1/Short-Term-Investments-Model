2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wildwood felt like a home away from home. The property is a stunner with a full deck, fire pit, and lake. The home itself is in immaculate condition. The bedroom accommodations were spacious and private. Jensena was a fantastic host who even had pizza and drinks waiting for us upon arrival. This is definitely one of my favorite air bnb’s. We look forward to another stay when we come home to visit. Five stars!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wildwood escape cabin!
The mark this place left on our hearts.. will be forever. The peace and serenity that was felt throughout the whole place ... it's all around. Jen, is a GREAT host- the house had everything you could imagine- she left snacks, drinks, s'mores basket for us! Her daughter also left some space related toys bc we were up for the eclipse. I don't have one negative thing to say! Thank you Jen for everything!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jensena’s cabin was just as pictured and described. The rooms are very spacious and clean. There was a welcome basket upon arrival which was a nice surprise and the house is well stocked with the essentials. Fishing poles and kayaks provided added entertainment for the pond and the fire pit was lovely in the evening. Jensena responded quickly to any questions we had and was extremely helpful when we had a medical issue on the first day there. The area around the cabin is private and quiet. We saw several deer, turtles, herons and fish while we were at the cabin. It was a very nice relaxing week. We would definitely stay again if in the area."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I highly and confidently recommend this lovely very responsive and nice host cottage felt right at home!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The home was exceptionally clean and well stocked. The atmosphere of my surroundings were such a surprise — so peaceful and calming with a great porch for viewing sunsets. Add in the strolling turkeys and grazing deer. And then the special event of the 17-year cicadas. I cannot wait to return for another visit. Truly a special place with a wonderful host.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The location was amazing. Secluded and peaceful. The host was extremely accommodating and I felt like they really cared about us having a perfect experience. We look forward to coming back the next time we are in the area.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Thank you,"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Ryan's place was nicely decorated and spacious, perfect for 3-6 people. Located near downtown, it was easy to get to and from. Only downside is that it's next to train tracks, which can be bothersome to some guests (and babies/children)."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Nice place
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great host and cozy amenities.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A great stay- just what we needed. We often drive through the area and will check this place first from now on.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I enjoyed the over all stay at 327. It was comfortable.
The house neat and well arranged and color co-ordinated and decorateions are appropriate
As usual-I took my own house wares and Bedsheet and Pillows.
I carried my own cooked food. Everything went alright.
I will recommend this place with no reservation.
Thanks again"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ryan responds quickly. You'll have an answer to your question almost instantly. Train tracks 1 block to the east and 1 block to the west. Safety horns blow at all hours which could be a problem for some sleepers. So much better than a hotel!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location for what I was looking for. Host is very responsive and flexible with requests.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place! Easy to find and close to everything
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Enjoyed stay
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Love this space! My home away from home. Ryan is an awesome host and is extremely responsive! I love coming to this place when I’m in town for work!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Ryan's Place was very nice and comfortable. We arrived after dark, and getting in was a breeze. Would definitely stay here again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I felt safe and I felt welcomed at the Main Street Bungalow. I love to cook and although there was no counter space there was a nice size dining table with a huge pantry full of every kind of kitchen device you would need or want in a home.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We had a wonderful stay at this airbnb and Ryan was an excellent host. He was responsive and helpful to all of our questions. The place is more spacious than what appears in the photos, with tasteful decor and a fully stocked kitchen and laundry room. Would recommend to anyone!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"After two grueling Days on the road from Florida with two senior chihuahuas I arrived at a different Airbnb only to find it was occupied by somebody else. Due to my situation I needed to find someplace to stay quickly, the Main Street Bungalow was a last minute reservation for me and a blessing in disguise! The furnishings in the home are tasteful and my bed and bedding extremely comfortable. Ryan was never intrusive and addressed my needs immediately and at my convenience, I was feeling a little spoiled. I felt safe in the home and the location was near lots of places for shopping and great places to eat out. I personally love all things vintage and this home was no exception. Take a chance with Ryan at the Main Street Bungalow, you will not be disappointed!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ryan’s place was a great place to stay and had everything that you would need for your stay. Definitely will be staying here again.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great!!!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great stay! Ryan is a thoughtful host—he even got us a personal gift!
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Will be staying here again.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was fantastic. Ryan is a great host and very quick to respond about anything. We loved all the personal touches and the place felt private and safe. Ryan also left a personalized note and gift which we absolutely loved! Five stars across the board.
2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Overall, rating this an okay stay could be considered generous. I think we may have just had a series of mishaps that just soured the experience a little for us but i'm not sure. The more I think about this space and our experience the more I wonder if I am just being overly kind. I'm not sure that my experience is a reflection of the usual happenings here but as a super host myself, I owe it to future guests to report my experience so here we go.
The host has you enter through the back door, which is fine but it was pouring rain so we had to traipse through the muddy, wet grass (with a newborn) so just be prepared for that especially in snowy or rainy weather. There is no path...just grass. Kitchen has very little counterspace, so most food prep will have to be done on the kitchen table. We didn't stay long enough to cook, but something I noticed. Huge pantry off the kitchen appeared to have some fun stuff in it like (if I remember correctly) a crockpot, large roasting pan and coffee maker (among other things). Speaking of coffee...there was none. We found a canister that had a few coffee grounds in it. It certainly smelled like coffee....had evidence of coffee grounds in the past...just no coffee in it currently. Apparently coffee isn't listed as an amenity which is weird since there is coffee filters and creamer and sugar packets. Anyway, coffee places nearby...or bring your own grounds.
Speaking of kitchen...there was like 6 pieces of mouse poop in the kitchen sink and one right next to the sponge. I brought this to the host's attention. To his credit, he offered to send a cleaner over right away who could clean the kitchen as well as bring us more towels since I pointed out there were only 2 bath towels despite there being 3 adults and a baby booked for the night. I declined the cleaner as it was 11 pm and my sister (with her newborn) were already in bed after our long day of travel. I decided to let him bring the towels because he was only 5 minutes away and was trying to make it right and I felt bad. Upong arrival with clean towels, host was very apologetic, sincere and kind, which I really appreciated. However, we discovered the next morning, after three days of travel, we were unable to use the towels our host brought as the Airbnb did not provide shower gel, shampoo or conditioner (which I normally travel with but of course I forgot on this trip)....so I *guess* it's not his fault, however rough for us after 3 days of not showering.
Sheets in one bedroom were pilly and, therefore, rough like sandpaper. I was going to sleep on the futon, but discovered I ""couldn't"" because the house manual requested I only do so with the sheets and bedding provided. Spare bedding was suppose to be in drawers under the queen bed but were nowhere to be seen. My 42-yo self ended up sleeping in the bed with my 72-yo mom. Good thing we like each other. Probably worked out okay because both the living room couch and the futon would not have been comfortable overnight unless you are under 100 lbs.
I don't know....maybe I screwed this one up. Maybe I didn't pay close enough attention to things like the $100 cleaning fee WHICH IS RIDICULOUSLY HIGH. Maybe I should have done a street view of the area first to see if the area was sketchy. Perhaps I should have checked amenities to see if they would have the BASIC stuff a hotel would have like shampoo, conditioner and coffee. As an Airbnb Superhost myself, I feel like I should take the blame for all of my many mistakes in choosing this location. But then again, maybe they could just do better. I dunno. You decide. For me? 10/10 would not stay again. Too many things went wrong. Cost was excessive for what it was. Location 5/10. Thank god it was only one measly night."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious house, great communication! Everything you need, would recommend!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Love how cute this place is on the inside. It’s pretty quiet besides the few times a train passes which isn’t too often. A/C works great. My husband loved the comfortable beds and he’s picky. 😆 The checkout procedures were very easy and simple. One of the least things you have to do which I love.
You have to go to the Farmhouse for breakfast/lunch. They have some yummy things. ☺️"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We stayed for one night (last minute) at Ryan’s place. The decorations were so cute - all of us loved how it looked. We had everything that we could’ve needed there. Ryan seemed like a really great host and was quick at communicating. We enjoyed our stay.

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I spent 5 weeks here while doing a clinical rotation at the hospital in town. It was a nice, quiet location where I could study and get some rest. While there are train tracks nearby, I did not find this to be a disruption. I sleep with a bedside fan and never noticed the trains at night. The bed I slept in was very comfortable, and the place was very clean. Would definitely recommend this location to others."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Main Street Bungalow was a great place to stay. Had everything we needed for our short stay.

2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I played a gig at the Granada Theatre and this was the absolute perfect location to be able to run back and forth to change and then at the end of the night, I didn’t have to drive really far to get back — it was literally a 60 second drive! Super clean, great decor, really comfy bed - just be ready for the trains that go through all night. I was tired enough that they didn’t keep me up, but if that kind of thing bothers you, they were super kind and actually provided ear plugs! Highly recommend!!!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Train tracks are close but wr didn't find it to be an issue at all. Overall very happy with the stay.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was my third week-long stay and the first time I've visited during chilly weather. Happy to report that the heater works as well as the air conditioning. All the charm and amenities were still there, with a few upgrades. We noticed some additional kitchen spices and herbs (cumin! oregano!) to flavor our meals."

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great place to stay
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super cute house in a quiet area. ❤️
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay. This little house was perfect and so clean. we had anything we could have wanted or needed while there.
I would suggest to parents of light sleepers to bring some sort of white noise because a train runs very close blowing the horn. The host actually thought of that and provided ear plugs if needed. We are not light sleepers, so were not bothered at all, but it may have kept my kids up when they were little."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed in Mount Vernon on our way from Kansas to Maryland. The bungalow was very convenient location-wise and had everything we needed and then some to rest up for the next day. Super comfy beds, to boot!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house was beautiful and very cozy! Location was perfect and convenient! Well stocked and extremely clean! Ryan was great with communicating. If we ever travel from Louisiana to Illinois again.. this will be the place we will stay!

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent stay as we were passing thru town. Close to downtown with good parking on site.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This bungalow was perfect for a short overnight stay. We contacted Ryan last-minute during a road trip and he was very quick to reply and accommodate us. The decor was thoughtful and they included some considerate extras, like a full Brita pitcher and toiletries. The bed was comfy and we didn’t have any issues with noise or light (admittedly, we were really sleepy after a 16 hour drive!) I can’t comment on the local area since it was a very quick overnight, but it seemed walkable to some cute parts of downtown Mt Vernon. Overall, highly recommend."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for a friends wedding. This place was just what we needed to rest during a busy time.
I appreciated the cute decor and the Brita water filter in the fridge. The house was very clean and well put together.
Host was very accommodating when our reservation needs kept changing."

2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful & comfortable! Plenty of blankets & pillows, a large kitchen & pantry, lots of ice in freezer- it’s all there! The only downside is the location is close to a railroad track & the road so there is a little bit of noise at night… even so I would stay here again over anywhere else in the area. Go book this bungalow & see how great it is for yourself!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,A spacious and well-appointed two bedroom with many boutique touches to give it that bed and breakfast feel. I loaded up on some supplies beforehand but this place had everything - from appliances to laundry soap - that I needed for the stay. They even had the air running and the ice stocked which was great since it was one of the hottest weeks of the year.
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,This was a great one night layover on my trip. Very comfortable and clean.
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Easy check in. The place is absolutely adorable! Beautifully decorated and comfortable. Just a heads up, through the bedroom windows, there is a street light that shines directly on the bed at night. The trains passing through the night nearby are a bit noisy for light sleepers."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay here. There isn’t much in the area so it’s is hard to find places right off the interstate. This one is not right off the interstate but close! It was so peaceful and after spending a week plus on the road, out lab stout loved having room to spread. She was noticeably happier here after a week plus on the road!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Just a short jog from the freeway and close enough to town for supplies. Rosemary and family provided all the basic necessities (tp, paper towels, handsoaps) which is very helpful when traveling across the country. The house is large, yard is even bigger, and set away from the roadway. Very private despite being on a state high way. Beds are comfortable! The house was clean and had all we needed for the evening. The driveway has plenty of space for trailers and turning around."

Upstairs living and dining room with bonus downstairs ( only a few steps ) living and dining area. Close to town but just far enough away to be peaceful. Well stocked for our visit with a few thoughtful extras. Will stay again next time we visit. Yard was well kept. Everyone loved it. Rosemary always replied immediately to my couple questions.

2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Rosemary's place was great. Couldn't have asked for anything better for our 3 couples. We came on motorcycles and we were able to park them in the 2 car garage overnight which was really nice.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Rosemarys house was very inviting. With plenty of comfortable beds and a hot shower, this was the perfect place to stay after a long road trip. We got in late at night, not able to see much, but when we woke up, we were able to see how beautiful the property was."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Rosemary's place is a little slice of heaven!
we stayed here during a family funeral, and the peaceful, natural environment was a perfect place to recharge in between family gatherings!
the home was clean and comfy, and everything we needed was there!
We want to come back just to enjoy the land and let our grandson fish and run!
It was so lovely to drink coffee on the bench and look at the water!
If you are a nature lover, this place is spectacular!!!! Highly recommended!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at Rosemary's Airbnb, and we came back for several reasons. First, Rosemary's communication is prompt and she is so kind. Secondly, this property is clean, very spacious, and we are always amazed at how peaceful and quiet it is. Thank you for making our stay such a pleasant experience!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Friendly host and it was a nice place to stay
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I can not say enough good things about Rosemary as a host! The home was beautiful and the property was as well an an amazing place to just sit back and relax with the family! We had purchased a house and ran into some issues with the closing and she was understanding and accommodating to the changing needs they surrounded it. We had to make a change to the dates twice and she understood and worked with us through both of them. She responded to every message that was sent quickly and politely, but more important to us personably. Truly a great host and would recommend to anyone going through the area."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Nice place with a nice view to wake up to in the morning. The owner was incredibly responsive and very friendly.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed here overnight on a roadtrip, but we would have enjoyed staying longer with a bigger group. The grounds were gorgeous with a lovely front and back yard--my mom's dog LOVED it. The house itself was immaculate, nicely decorated (even if not to my taste) with a great layout for a family. Check-in and check-out was a breeze.
A couple of things to note:
- There is no TV. The listing does not claim there is, just be aware.
- The driveway is a bit difficult to find when driving at night since it is off of a highway with cars driving at relatively high speeds. (You couldn't hear cars from the house, thankfully.) The house number is on a mailbox next to a dirt/gravel road. It would be helpful if they were larger or lit up somehow.
- The balcony door from one of the bedrooms is locked. This was a bummer for me since the balcony was a major draw for me, and I chose both this property and my bedroom for access to it.
Overall great though! Recommended."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I would definitely recommend staying at the cabin, especially if you are looking for an outdoorsy place and are going through the area. They had small trails, a Hammock area by the trails, a pond with fish you can feed, and a fire pit area among many other things - those are just the things we participated in! Although the cabin is on their property, it feels private. We were there on a Sunday, but if you go any other day they have a community of farm stores and farm eaterys around them to enjoy. They also had so many amenities to make us feel comfortable and cozy. You can tell they put a lot of love into the place. I would stay again if I we come back through the area!"

It was very clean and the hosts included a lot of extra goodies for our stay. Much appreciated! There is so much to do around the cabin and pond. We spent our day walking the trails, fishing, and kayaking on the pond. The grill and fire pit were also much appreciated for dinner and sitting outside at night. The hosts are very friendly and they ensured privacy as well as making sure we had everything we needed. It was a great experience and I cannot recommend it enough."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay, enjoyed walking the trail and the hammocks in some perfect weather.
The cabin had absolutely everything you needed and most things you’d ever think of wanting.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We think this tiny cabin by a private fishing pond is perfect! The cabin is very clean & comfortable for 2 adults. The tiny kitchen is well-equipped with everything needed to prepare simple meals. Privacy is afforded by the way the cabin is positioned, even though it is on the owners' property. Easy to be outside at the grill or fire ring or on the deck while being out-of-sight. Roomy fishing dock is only steps away, with all you need to fish or kayak. It is a very quiet & peaceful country setting. There is also a walking trail on-site & worth the time. April & Brian are excellent hosts, friendly & responsive. Highly recommend this unique site!"

Watching the aquatic life in the pond is a must, and Rend Lake is a quick drive away for beach time and kayaking."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,One of the best Airbnbs I have ever stayed in. April has seriously thought of everything when it came to all the little touches in the home.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great hosts aiming to please at every opportunity going above and beyond making our stay tremendous. We loved the rural outdoor setting and felt safe and secure during the thunderstorms. The cabin had all the modern amenities we required including internet access. The boys enjoyed the fishing, kayaking and also played some basketball. This was a great trip made better by our choice book this place to stay."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Couldn’t haven chosen a better place for my son and I!
We walked the trails, laid in the hammocks, fed the fish at the pond and played yard games.
The cabin was private and peaceful with its own fire pit. Everything was exactly as described and the hosts were nothing short of WONDERFUL!
Super accommodating (my son has some special needs), very knowledgeable about the area and offered endless recommendations for the 2 of us. I had to bring my truck and trailer, and their place was perfect for that too!
Truly a blessing to stay here and get to know the hosts."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"April was attentive, wanting to make our stay as pleasant as possible. The amenities were awesome for the peaceful retreat we were looking for. She anticipated our every need by supplying above and beyond what we needed. We were so impressed!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Brian and April are wonderful people! They will do anything to ensure that you feel comfortable while you stay. The Lilypad cabin was instantly the best home away from home. We can't wait to return!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great hosts. We came for a few days away and we got it. Loved the water access, the hiking trails, the cute little hammock area-hidden in the trails."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet, affordable, clean, with plenty of amenities and a nice trail to walk in your free time."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This adorable little cabin was a real gem! Situationed on a peaceful pond, close to woods and far out in the country, it was a beautiful and relaxing setting. April and Brian's house is close enough that they could help if we had needed anything, but far enough away that the cabin was very private. The cabin itself was absolutely perfect. Everything was extremely clean, and the rustic decor was delightful. It felt so cozy. The cabin had everything you could need and then some. The pond was so fun. We fed the turtles and fish and then in the morning, we went fishing and caught catfish and another smaller type of fish. We chose this cabin to celebrate our fifth wedding anniversary, and it did not disappoint! Thanks to April for the recommendation of Seasoning Bistro for our anniversary dinner. It is located in Benton, only about fifteen minutes away. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was delightful. We would definitely recommend this place, and hope we are able to come back!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My boyfriend and I stopped here on our way south and we wished we could have stayed even longer! This was by far the loveliest Airbnb either of us had ever stayed in, full of personal touches and felt like home. The property is beautiful, April was very communicative and hospitable, and the space was squeaky clean. We plan to come back soon to spend more time here!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This cabin was wonderful. It was secluded enough that it felt private, but close enough to the other homes that it felt safe. Would definitely stay here again! April was great!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was adorable, quiet and had everything we needed for a nights getaway. It was very clean and had everything we needed. The pond to feed the fish was so fun! We met the host and her husband and they were so sweet! Would definitely return!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Me (22) and my girlfriend (21) both loved this space. We stayed Tuesday-Friday, and I was able to work from home with reliable internet. On lunch and in between assignments, we had a great time hiking the trails and fishing from the pond shed which had everything we needed.
Will definitely be staying again, thanks April!!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Aprils airbnb is a wonderful lil place for a weekend getaway. Has everything you need and can’t beat the setting. April had great communication about checking in, she even offered to get a fire ready for us when we were out at dinner. Relaxing by the pond in the beautiful weather was very relaxing. Highly recommended! Also make sure to go eat dinner at Seasoning Bistro in Benton, was fantastic."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a beautiful and peaceful little place that I definitely will stay at again if given the opportunity!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A slice of paradise. Serene and quiet. Lovely area with plenty of outdoor space, small fishing pond, hiking trail, woods, and privacy. Every detail has been considered. One of the best places I’ve ever stayed. Would eagerly stay here again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The cabin was an excellent place to stay! I just wish we had taken more time out of our trip to stay for a few more days and really soak in the quaint area.
Great place if you want to get away with plenty to do for the whole family."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I really enjoyed staying at April & Brian's cabin! Their property is beautiful and peaceful. I enjoyed fishing in the catch & release pond, walking through the trails on their property, visiting Rend lake not too far away, and making smores by the outdoor fireplace. When I arrived, the cabin was very clean, the linens smelled good and the bed was comfortable. It's a nice little cabin for a weekend getaway from the city. Their small cabin doesn't feel cramped, and the kitchenette and full bathroom fit perfectly. There is an on-demand hot water heater that works well. It even has good wifi if you find yourself needing to do some work. They provided a few snacks and drinks in the mini-fridge.
I got to meet April & Brian when I arrived- they were very friendly and made me feel very welcomed. It was easy to communicate with them and they made sure I had everything I needed. I felt very rested after my trip. This was probably my favorite Airbnb stay so far. I hope I can go back & visit!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The extra little touches were above and beyond! Toiletries, homemade cookies, chocolates, snacks and stocked fridge were a bonus. Chairs were set up by the fire pit, hot dog sticks were on the porch and there was even bug spray and a lantern if we needed them. Thank you for a superb getaway weekend!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at the Lilypad Cabin. A top favorite of our airbnb stays. It’s in good proximity to Rend Lake if you’re looking to take advantage of the area. The small cabin and setting were well-described in April’s listing and photos true. It was spotlessly cleaned with thoughtful touches from April like snacks, water/soda, an assortment of flavored coffee creamer and even a few toiletries if you’ve forgotten something. The bed was extremely comfortable for a good night’s sleep. We enjoyed walking the trails winding throughout the property which Brian maintains. We spent our evenings on the dock and had fun feeding the catfish. We have AT&T cell service and had no issues with wireless and I was able to send and receive texts inside by stepping to the front of the cabin. April and Brian will respect your privacy if you wish for seclusion but we were happy to to meet them. They are conscientious and the nicest people. You can’t go wrong with the Lilypad Cabin!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,April has done an outstanding job of making this getaway like a home away from home. I would definitely consider staying here again if I’m ever spending time in the area.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Can't say enough about this place. We loved everything about it. Quiet, remote, clean, great view. April & Brian were more than willing to help throughout every step of the process. They are so nice it was like they were instantly friends. The genuinely cared that our experience was a great one.
The cabin is a small, perfect getaway for a couple that want to experience some rest and relaxation while still having majority of the comforts you would have at home. We will definitely be back!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We can't say enough about The Lily Pad! April was the BEST host I have ever interacted with on Airbnb. She was responsive, accommodating, and when our plans changed, she was so helpful. The thoughtful touches were wonderful! It felt like we never left home. I wish we could have stayed another night to enjoy the cabin a little longer. We are already talking about how we can plan another trip to her place in the future!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Couldn’t have been happier with my stay at the Lilly Pad! April is very responsive, helpful, and organized. There is a binder with all of the information needed and even different activities/restaurants to do and visit around the area. The view while staying there is perfect with a porch looking out onto a peaceful pond. At night I could hear different sounds of nature including two owls.
The cabin is very well kept. Everything was very clean and organized. April provided some complimentary snacks and toiletries. There are beautiful nature trails within walking distance from the cabin. They have even provided fishing poles and kayaks. The cabin is secluded but still close to any type of needs. If you’re looking for a nice, peaceful, and quiet place to unwind this is the place for you!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a very wonderful place to stay. It's very cozy and quiet. We went antiquing at nearby towns and Rend lake is close by to go boating and swimming. April was a great host and the place had a lot of amenities. I very much recommend this place.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Thank you so much for sharing your adorable cabin with us! We couldn’t find any check out instructions, so we hope the way we did everything was ok!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The house is darling! Easy to get to. Two stairs to get in with heavy luggage. Nice and clean and a very comfortable bed. There’s a little noise from the street and close to a train. But it didn’t bother us for sleeping. Would definitely stay again!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful cozy cottage! You can tell they put lots of detail and consideration into it!
Traffic and the train were definitely noisy.

We will definitely stay here again if we're ever in the area! ***** 5 stars!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super clean, cute and comfortable!! Love the reclining sofa and chair. The bed was comfy! Overall the place is very appealing!
Only cons are it is right by a hwy so there is hwy noise, and it’s close to a train track so that is loud too. Suggest bringing a noise maker of some sort"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were in a pinch to find a place to experience the total solar eclipse and found this tiny cottage. It was perfect for what we needed and bonus, it was in the path of totality. We didn't actually stay there for the viewing, but it was a nice option know we were able to use the yard. The owners were friendly and responsive. The place was very cute and extremely clean. It still had that fresh new build feeling to it. Did mention it was very clean? We would rent again, just maybe not at eclipse prices. It was the best option and well worth it, and awesome to tell friend about the ""tiny cottage"" in our trip."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We have stayed at quite a few airbnb’s, but this was probably our favorite! Justin and Crystal’s place was so cute and impeccably clean.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My family of eight were looking for a place to stay near my family and near Rend Lake. We found this place on Airbnb and found it to be nice and affordable. When we pulled up, we loved that it was on a dead end street. It was super peaceful outside. There was patio furniture and a basketball hoop set up outside. Check-in was very easy and super intuitive. When we entered the home, we were so impressed with the space. The home is very nice outside, but gorgeous inside and has plenty of room for our large family. The living room has a huge sectional that is so comfortable and a large flatscreen prepared. There were kids toys that my children were occupied with as we unpacked. The jetted tub in the bathroom was a nice touch. The kitchen was prepared with everything we needed to make dinner and have coffee in the morning. Overall, I would highly recommend this Airbnb. Kristofer was very kind and accommodating. We will recommend to friends and family. Thank you!!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This house was perfect for our fishing trip on Rend Lake. It is located within walking distance of two restaurants The Habor Lites and Burtons Cafe. Both had very good food and great service. The house was very clean and comfortable. Had everything you will need. We had our boat with us and there was plenty of room in the driveway to park. We will most definitely stay here again.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We stayed here for a family vacation. This was by far the best spot in the area. The location was great. Kristopher was the most responsive host I have ever dealt with. I will definitely stay here on my next visit and have recommended this rental to everyone I know.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home served my needs superbly. I had a graduation to attend for my granddaughter and this place definitely was a good location. The only negatives I can think of was no laundry facilities and a couple more chairs in the livingroom would have been nice, small inconvenience."

Really enjoyed the pool table
Ryan communicates well"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It was my husband and I with our 2 small dogs, meeting up with friends /family and going to NHRA race by St Louis. The house had lots of historic pictures and was furnished with many neat things. Fantastic game room with a pool table. The main bedroom and bathrooms are very nice and roomy and on each end of the house, so if you shared the house with another couple, it would be private sleeping areas. Mt Vernon had their fall festival on and it was walking distance to downtown. St Louis is only an hour away. The trains were not an issue for us. We would definitely stay again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a wonderful time in historic Mt. Vernon. Ryan is an excellent host. The house was clean and spacious. The neighborhood was quiet and peaceful. And our guys really enjoyed the pool table.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Me and the dogs enjoyed staying at this house. Very dog friendly and peaceful. Also I could barely hear the trains so I don’t believe the noise is ever an issue.
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a fantastic stay at Ryan's place. The pool table was a fun touch that we enjoyed. It smelled a little musty when we first entered, but after we ran the AC it cleared out. Would stay at again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great neat house. Well maintained
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a brief overnight stay enroute to Indiana, would have loved to stay longer.

Thanks for the stay, if we’re ever in the area, we’ll definitely stay again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We were looking for a last minute stay in Mt Vernon and I’m so glad we stumbled upon Ryan’s place. It was spacious and fully stocked. Would definitely recommend.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Adorable historic house. Felt like I stepped back in time! Only had the pleasure of staying one night since we were driving across the country, but I would highly recommend the location if visiting the town. Easy access to the highway and walking distance to the local amenities. Very safe neighborhood! Great place!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, walkable to downtown although you need to drive most places. We were attending a workshop close by and were able to walk some days. The house was quiet and very restful and we really enjoyed the pool table. Everything worked well, good A/C, parking is easy."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Historical home in quaint downtown neighborhood. Lovely art displayed showing the history of the home. Very quiet and private (don’t let the mention of trains concern you, the house is well noise insulated and we seldom if ever heard it while inside). Very comfortable with well equipped kitchen. Would definitely rebook if we’re in the area in the future."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ryan was great! He was very responsive. Had a little difficulty accessing first time but he was quick to get us in the door. Was patient with us after working the night shift on the day of check out. Friendly. Oh and the neighborhood cat that seems to have adopted the house is so sweet and friendly

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Thank you
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Felt right at home. The house is definitely vintage which was fun looking at the old photos of the town and the great furniture. Super warm inside despite being freezing outside. Ryan was wonderful to work with and kept checking in with us to make sure everything was fine and that we were warm enough. The pool table was a great hit and it was nice to be able to relax here after visiting with family.
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was impeccable, albeit old. 100% full of history and charm. Ryan is a great host and accommodates well. Definitely recommend this place!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house was beautiful, truly a blast from the past , well decorated and interesting art work all around . we enjoyed our stay , my favorite part were the warm tiles in the bathroom 🌡️♥️"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very spacious and perfectly fit our needs. A little musty smell, but in a way it fit with the historic nature of the house. Host left out some snacks and water, which was very nice. Biggest criticism is that the towels were small. Would stay there again."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place and Ryan was a great host!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place!!!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wow! Spacious home. Original everything. Like staying in a time capsule. These boomers felt right at home!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really loved the house a lot and had a wonderful stay. We appreciated the off-street parking and entry to the house was smooth. The space in there is great, it felt secure, the neighborhood was quiet for the most part, and there are some other gorgeous old houses in the neighborhood, too, that were fun to see. Bottled water, chips, pint of ice cream, and lotion/hair care products were a nice touch along with a handwritten welcome note when we arrived. The retro look and feel of the place was very charming! All the photos and pictures on the walls were SO interesting and the lighting was cozy and warm. We played pool and also chess and checkers. :) Bathrooms were great, beds were comfortable, pillows were just right, and sheets were nice and soft. Trains weren't loud enough to bother us. Nothing to sit on in the back room/porch area or outside, though, so anyone wanting to rent this in fair weather might want to bring some lawn chairs with them because there are some great spaces inside and out for enjoying the weather. I wanted to pack up the whole house, bring it home with me, and live in it! lol I would love to know who the original owners were and what they did for a living because that place would've been pretty upscale back when it was built. Wonderful, well-thought-out floor plan and solid, quality construction. Thank you for opening up this beautiful home and for a great AirBnB experience, Ryan!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay at Ryan’s place after a very long drive! The house is really cool- so much history. Ryan clearly thought of everything, including a lovely bag of shampoo, lotions and ear plugs. Definitely recommend!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was great would stay again ❤️
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was the perfect place to rest after my event downtown. Space was very nice and slept my whole family comfortably. Well decorated, and I enjoyed all of the historical photos!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice, clean, and historical."
2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed about a week,Property needs to be aired as it has musty odor The appliances are very old The paper towels were substandard & dirty There was dust on some pieces of furniture Wifi wouldn’t work in master bedroom Ryan is nice & communicative
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My family and I enjoyed a comfortable and worry free 3 days at Ryan's house. The house is definetly historic and well preserved. Ryan responded quickly when I had a question which was much appreciated.
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"If your planning on staying here, let me be honest, you get what you booked. 3 rooms, 2 bathrooms, and a extremely spacious house. But if I’m being completely honest the price is not worth it. Compared to the other places we’ve stayed it is quite expensive. One of our bathrooms showers wouldn’t drain, and there was a little confusion in the checking out process, but other than that the place was okay. The check in process went smooth, but we thought they could have provided a few more essentials, soap, larger bath towels, etc. considering the price."
2022-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,This home is great for someone staying one or two nights. We generally stay for 3-4 weeks. Beautiful home just needs a few more amenities such as outdoor seating and a grill. Definitely needs a washer and dryer and maybe some larger bath towels.

2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"We set off with no real agenda, ended up kayaking at Rend Lake and really really appreciated how secluded and quiet that day was! Then we went back to the tiny house, made dinner, then walked to the Barn Bar and enjoyed live music!!!! Had NO idea we would be able to walk from there to a super friendly fun place to hang out! Super thankful we could take our dogs with, they enjoyed roaming around the house a little. Honestly the tiny house is so tiny it wasn’t very practical having a German Shepard taking up so much room!!
Looking forward to booking again and spending more time on Rend Lake!"

2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"This stay is certainly cozy, and I have very few negative things to say about it! The hosts were very proactive in responding to my needs and concerns while I was at the stay. It’s a cozy, modern cabin !
There is, however, an elephant in the room that certainly tainted my stay. Apparently, the shower drain was not installed with a trap. This meant that for the first two days of my stay, sewer gases were free to enter the Airbnb. As the listing suggests, this is a tiny home, which meant that the gases were able to quickly accumulate. I left for work in the morning, and upon my return, was hit with a much-less-than-refreshing odor in the space. This oversight is not only a health hazard, it’s against IL plumbing code and it’s just downright unpleasant.
That being said, the hosts truly turned the situation around. They were very apologetic, & had a plumber on site just a few hours after I reported the smell. They went above and beyond following the incident, offering a night free. Nice!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Justin and Crystal have performed an act of design magic by placing a full menu of conveniences in a tiny home’s small footprint. The interior layout is efficient without any element of crowding. Indeed, their space reminds me of the Black family’s residence in Harry Potter where the building appears much smaller on the outside than the reality inside. As a carpenter, I found the natural finish of the tongue and groove walls completely enchanting.
In their pursuit of perfect hospitality, Justin and Crystal stocked the mini-fridge with bottled water and creamer pods while a snack basket offers with an assortment of treats to entertain many palettes.
Singles and couples should consider a stay especially if a visit to nearby Rend Lake is in their itinerary. Light sleepers should note however that traffic noise increases in the morning and a nearby rail line features the rumbling of periodic freight trains."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We stayed one night after a long day of driving. We had plenty of space to spread out and everyone had their own beds. Some are definitely meant for younger children (bunk beds) vs adults but since we only had four adults it worked out fine. Just a heads up if your group is all adults. Martha is proactive with communicating. There is a great area for kids to play in the basement which would be great if traveling with young kids. Fully stocked kitchen for those wanting to prepare meals there.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Martha’s place was very nice and spacious. It was big enough for our entire family. Everyone had their own room and their own space, which is hard to find sometimes for our large family while also accommodating our two small dogs.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Was as described. Place had everything that is needed. Awesome hosts.
2023-02-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"If you're looking for a cutesy/high quality place to vacation, this is not what you're looking for. The house seemed lived in(wet/used towels still hanging up in the bathroom. Fridge/freezer stocked with open food items-not just condiments). The basement is still under construction. Most of the outlets in the basement bedroom didn't work. Cleanliness seemed to focus only on the kitchen and toilet (minor mold found in two areas).
However, if you are simply looking for a place to sleep with enough space for the whole family (including pets), this place is ideal!
I think the price tag reflects a cutesy/high quality vacation, not a large space to sleep. With that in mind, I'd say it's overpriced."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We booked this at on a whim and it was at 5 p.m. on the day of. Martha reached out to us immediately and got us checked in. Place was great and just what we were looking for.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were able to enjoy a relaxing weekend while visiting family and friends. The rooms are spacious and very comfortable. The front porch and back patio are wonderful for early morning/late evening views. Something I had not experienced at a stay before was that Martha had labeled each of the cabinets and drawers in the kitchen so finding cooking utensils, skillet, etc. was super easy to find.

Plenty of room to put more blow up mattresses if you need more beds. Was perfect for my extended family to stay altogether in one comfortable area. Host was quick to respond and very helpful. Make sure to read amenities, as I didn’t bring a hair dryer and didn’t read the full amenities list to notice there wasn’t one. We will absolutely use this place if we all go down again in the future!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Martha’s home is the most well ordered Airbnb we have rented. She was very thoughtful in having all the little things you need. Future renters should know there is no tv, but this did not bother us. She had toys, baby gear, family games, wood for the fireplace and a well stocked kitchen. The home was clean and spacious. It is a rural area, but town center was 10 minutes away. She even took care to have the porch and walkways shoveled after a snow storm. She has WiFi and good beds. The big chair in front of the fire place is the best place for a good book and a nap. :)"

2021-12-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Rain covers road to home you may have to find an alternate way in so be careful too deep to go through In a car The heating unit is very hard to regulate it is too hot in bedrooms and too cold in living room you have to keep bedroom doors open at all times therefore you have no privacy yes we adjusted floor vents it did not help

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Was well worth the cost , plenty of room for a large group.
Fast response to needs."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I would absolutely recommendto all travelers looking a for a peacful nights rest after a long day of travels. Felt very homey and loving to stay here. We had a big family dinner with laughs and games that made us forget we were traveling. When morning came none of us wanted to leave ...... 1000% recommend
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Just passing through and found a few local treasures. We ate at the airport cafe which had decent food at a great price. Hidden gem not to far away called Yellin Helen’s ice cream.
2023-07-01,4.0,Group trip,"Home was large which is why we booked it to use for family during my daughter's wedding. All in all, we had a good stay. Due to the heat the first day, my daughter had to get a hotel room to make sure that she was cool enough to sleep for the remaining days in Mount Vernon.
Pros: Large space with plenty of room, comfortable beds, nice amenities and extras, reliable wi-fi, easy to get to/convenient location for us. Decorated cute. Nice new back patio and grill. Rosemary was a wonderful hostess and communicated well before and during our stay.
Cons: Cooling could not keep up during hot/humid stay. Cooled down overnight, but during the 100 degree days it was 75-78 although stat was set to 68. No TVs :( Traffic noise from the highway was loud starting at 5:30am, so bring a sleep machine or fan.
Rosemary responded quickly when we told her that the home would not cool down after we arrived. She arranged for an HVAC guy to service the unit on the second morning. Very responsive!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Easily accessible and very clean place to stay!!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very spacious and clean!
2023-06-01,4.0,Group trip,"The house was clean and decorated nicely. The kitchen is stocked with coffee, condiments, and everything you would need to cook with. There are plenty of towels in the bathrooms however the hot water was an issue, only 1 person was able to shower the morning we were leaving, and 2 hours after they showered we still did not have hot water. I did make her aware after we checked out, there was nothing really that could have been done that morning. Hopefully, they will fix that problem. An oddity to me was there are absolutely no TVs in this residence. Not something I would have even thought to look at on amenities, I have never been in a house with no tv. If you are only planning to sleep there is no big deal, but I had 5 people waiting there for a wedding all day with not a lot to do. Also, be mindful that if you are traveling with pets, they are welcome as stated in her ad but there is an additional fee. I did not see that mentioned in the ad and I missed it when booking."
2023-06-01,4.0,Group trip,"Rosemary's place is a nice clean place to stay, My little family went there for a getaway for my husband and I 5th year Anniversary, Its much more spacious than the pictures show, we had everything we needed as didn't have to leave and go get anything, very nice elegant pots and pans, very nice deck, good quality beds, I would definitely recommend her place."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay in the newly remodeled house. We had plenty of space to spread out with our family of eight. Thanks again for the clean and beautifully decorated house. Felt very at home!
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a wonderful stay! It was clean, we had plenty of room to have some quiet time, we felt safe and was a nice distance from town. Would love to stay here again when visiting family. Such a nice change from the hotel setting. Thank you for a lovely stay..."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a great place to stay while we were in the area for a wedding. Had plenty of room and everything we needed for our stay. Thanks!!
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,It was in a good location.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stopped for one night on a road trip and this house was perfect for that purpose. This was so much better for our family of four (with two large teens) than a hotel.
Rosemary was very communicative the day of our trip. As noted on the listing, they are working on the landscaping. That wasn’t an issue for us. The home is much more spacious than it appears. Plenty of room for a large group. Kitchen was well stocked. It’s on a main road but the street wasn’t very busy and traffic died down around bedtime. We slept well."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a quick overnight here on our way to see our son in Georgia. This was a wonderful house to stop at with my extended family and relax for a bit after a long day on the road! Plenty of space for everyone to have their own comfortable bed! And even a few nice surprises left in the fridge and cupboards for us! We would definitely recommend this house and would have enjoyed it for a longer stay as well.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place with lots of room!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Thank you for letting us stay for the night. Was a nice stop on our move.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay!
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Rosemary’s place was perfect for our group of 8. The home was clean and cozy, beds were comfy, and the open kitchen-living room floor plan offered plenty of space for our group to hang out. The kitchen was thoughtfully stocked with everything we needed for making breakfast at home, including coffee and eggs and bacon in the fridge! Rosemary was quick to respond to any questions, and was upfront about the ongoing work they’re doing in the backyard, leaving that space unavailable for use at the moment. Everyone in our group agreed that we would absolutely stay here again!"
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"House was near where we needed to be. Thoughtful amenities. House was under renovation, but otherwise met our needs."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place for our family. Great supply of linens/kitchen items. Perfect space with having a toddler and infant as there was a crib available and toys. Rooms were spacious and beds were comfy. Rosemary was very responsive and super friendly. Next time we need to visit family in the area I would book here again.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our group of 6 had plenty of space and everything was spotless when we arrived. We were only there for a quick pit stop so we didn’t take much advantage of the kitchen but it was well stocked, along with extra linens, pillows and towels. Very comfortable beds!"
,,,"Rented this place because it was big and had great reviews. Was not small child friendly. The place was really dirty, could see where you walked on the dirt on the floor. My child was covered in dirt from just playing in the living room. A lot of bugs, not bugs like roaches, just regular bugs that you’d like to keep outside and not in your bedroom. Hairs left behind in the showers and tubs. Cleaning supplies and mouse traps left in places my toddler could and did easily get too. On top of this it was 87 and the a/c could not cool the house until around 10 at night. Would never rent this place again"
