2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first ever Airbnb stay , it was exactly what we were looking for, in a getaway. Within 15 minutes from everything we had interest in doing. The condo was very very clean ! We had no issues when entering into the condo, and the public parking was within perfect distance to take our luggage to and from. I will be staying with Samantha when we return to the mountains again. She made us feel very welcome.!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was truly a hidden gem. It was very private and safe. It’s out of the hustle and bustle of Pigeon Forge, but within a 5 to 10 minute drive of everything you would want to do in Pigeon Forge, or drive a little further to get to Gatlinburg. Right in the heart of walkable downtown Sevierville. You can walk right up to the Dolly Parton statue. It was a great location where we felt safe and right at home. Loved Trotter’s BBQ (just a block away)! We had everything we needed and our host was very responsive. We would definitely stay with Samantha again."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I could not have been happier with our stay at Samantha's place. The location is great. The parking is easy and getting in and out of the apt was a breeze. There are restaurants within easy walking distance and access to the major highways are just blocks away. The place is spic and span and best of all (in my opinion) it is church-mouse quiet. We felt comfortable and right at home our entire stay. This place is why we love using Airbnb. I don't think we would stay anywhere else if we come back to Sevierville!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful place to stay! It is clean and new. The kitchen is well-stocked with everything needed to prepare meals or just a quick snack. The view is amazing and looks like a movie set. The attention to detail in the decor feels just like home. I stay at a lot of Airbnb's for travel and this is by far one of my favorites.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable little condo in downtown Sevierville Tennessee. The condo was very clean, decorated so cute, stocked with all amenities needed for a great stay in the mountains. We was surrounded by all kind of places to eat, shop or go to a show.

2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The area was amazing and had a great view of downtown. The condo was very pretty and I love the decorations and how the place was put together. Very easy getting to the place, instructions were very clear. We only had a problem with parking but the hosts did fix that problem for us so that was a huge bonus as well. Overall, a great place to come stay at and definitely recommend for anyone."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved it
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at this lovely cabin for 5 nights. It is brand new and has everything we needed for a comfortable stay - a fully stocked kitchen, an indoor pool, and comfy furniture. However, it was missing curtains for all the windows. Our kids woke up at 6 am the first morning due to the sunlight streaming in. We contacted Samuel, and he promptly arranged for curtains to be installed in one of the bedrooms and one bathroom. They are working on getting window coverings for all the rooms, but it's best to double-check before booking if you need to use all the bedrooms.
Otherwise, this place was great, and would absolutely book again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Felt like home!
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Super clean. Beautiful property and great location.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed the place, new and very clean."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Great place to stay to visit Knoxville and Surroundings
Samuel was great and place was brand new, I will definitely stay here again when visiting the mountains!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved our stay and didn’t want to leave. The private indoor pool was such a fun experience. Hot tub was very nice. The view from the living room and deck was serene and a beautiful slice of the mountains. We got to see a pair of pileated woodpeckers in the trees.
The deck furniture is quality and tasteful - as are all the furnishings in the home. We enjoyed meals on the back deck and really loved the hanging egg chairs on the front deck (so comfortable!). This is a new neighborhood and homes are still being built up the road, but we did not have interruptions and all the crews working up the street are quiet and respectful.
The kitchen is well stocked for any cooking/baking and has a Keurig. We appreciated the starter pods, as we didn’t think to ask the type of coffee maker. There was a tea kettle, as well.
The beds were great, internet was very good, showers were fantastic. Samuel is a great host and very responsive. We would love to stay again. Thank you!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Book Now! You won’t be disappointed. Awesome, family-friendly accommodations. Beautiful new place, lots of windows — just like the description. Great area, lots to see, explore and do! Or, stay-in and enjoy relaxing in the hot tub, fireside or taking a swim in the pool. The kids loved the kid-cave, old school arcade games and shuffleboard table! Already planning our next adventure!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had an amazing time at this accommodation. It definitely exceeded one expectations and we will definitely recommend it to friends and family.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is very clean and faces beautiful wooded hills. We loved staying here. Samuel was really helpful with recommendations on where to eat in the area and helpful directions on how to get to the cabin. What a great experience!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If heaven on earth was a place THIS WOULD BE IT. Modern luxury with the Great Smokies feel. The home was beautiful and as described. Literally HOME AWAY FROM HOME.
The beds were extremely comfortable which is very unusual.
The pool and all amenities were new and fully functional.
If you’re looking to come in and cook there were plenty of cookware and cutlery available.
Sam was an amazing host who responded promptly to any questions and request.
The location is close to all of the action yet tucked away for a nice and peaceful slumber.
I will be back soon."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay definitely recommend!!!! 5 out of 5 stars!
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,"This house was beyond amazing - the views, the decor, it had it all. I would go back for sure! Samuel was extremely responsive and helpful. We had an amazing weekend and were sad to leave."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location. Wonderful home. Could not have been happier. We were coming to town for the convention center and our hotel was less than adequate. We found this house and will never stay in a hotel again. Clean. Beautifully decorated. Easy to find. Beds were great. Pool a big hit. Will stay again.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Overall a great stay!
Cool, new subdivision being built, it has a resort vibe to it. The new subdivision was active with construction during my stay. However this was not an issue in the slightest and does not warrant any star deductions as this is out of the owners control. It was noticable that the house was freshly built. I noticed a couple things here and there that should have been addressed by the builders, but these items didn't take away from my experience, you'd only see them if you knew what to look for. I was working long hours for this business trip and didn't get to enjoy any of the numerous amenities, I wish I had time, I specifically picked this place for the shuffle board! Having said that, everything I used worked great and I enjoyed my stay. It definitely has potential and should be even more amazing once the subdivision is finished! I'm confident it will be a popular place during the summer with a water park extremely close, you have to pass it to get the house!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great time and Samuel was wonderful to work with us.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Rented for a week! Beautiful house! Samuel was very helpful, nice and responsive! Easy to get into. The pool and hot tub were awesome! We will absolutely be back!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Samuel was absolutely incredible to work with! This home is gorgeous too. The moment you step in the door it smelled so nice and it is pristine. It’s so wonderful to stay in a place that is absolutely spotless. There’s so much room in this home! We loved playing shuffleboard everyday and playing in the indoor pool, what a treat!! The kitchen is stocked perfectly with everything you need. The water and ice from the fridge tasted great too! We loved it here and look forward to coming back!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful property in a convenient location short drive to all attractions. Samuel was a great host communicative and friendly. Would definitely consider staying here again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,What a beautiful spot in a gorgeous new home! Having a place with our own private pool and hot tub away from the hustle and bustle from the local attractions was the perfect peaceful retreat after a day on the town. We also enjoyed the bunk room for the kids and dinner on the upper deck with beautiful sunset views!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,SO much fun with the pool and the hot tub on the same level! Indoor pool was perfect for the kids. House was pristine and appreciated that it had everything we needed to be comfortable!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Sam was a great Host! He was always responsive and accommodating. This house is beautiful and in a great location to get to all things. The indoor pool and hot tub were very nice after hiking the Smokey Mountains National Park. Would definitely recommend this place.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Brought my family for Easter weekend. My kids loved the pool and the adults loved the hot tub! Place is gorgeous and looks brand new! Hosts are super kind, responsive, helpful and inviting! I would return to this home."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a new build in a new neighborhood.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay at this beautiful home. It was brand new - we loved that everything was so clean and the house was very well decorated & furnished. There was an issue with the hot water but Samuel was responsive and had it fixed before our stay was over. Since it was brand new there were no window treatments which I wish we knew about beforehand - as we had young kids with us. But the views were beyond amazing and the house was a joy to stay at. Watching the sunset from the balcony did not disappoint. I look forward to going back again. Samuel was a great host and always got back to me within a few hours. Our family loved our weekend here.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful new build to make for a perfect getaway. Spend 5 days with my family and parents. From ages 9 to 68, we all enjoyed the location."
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Pros -
Beautiful place, lots of bedrooms
Pool to yourself (has a lock with a code too)
Hot tub was nice
Good location
Cons-
All in all, it was rushed to rental. It was easy to see that the home hadn't been stayed in previously. Some of the easily resolved issues were - pool door handle coming off, missing mirror in basement bathroom, no trash can in master bath, no window covers anywhere (issue when there's a large window over the master toilet and the hot tub is right outside the bunk room), the furnace wasn't turned on yet so we had no AC for a night, the water never gets hot in the basement or master shower, no wax for the shuffle board table, mud I'm the decks and in the pool area, no garbage cans to take out the trash to. All of these are easily fixed but the only one that they sent someone out for was the AC. There wasnt an offer for us to have anything refunded for the night without AC. If little issues had been tended to I would give 5 stars."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay! The cabin was spotless and felt like home. It was nice and private and close to all the things we wanted to do. It was also fun to just stay in! Everything we could possibly need was provided! Chargers, shampoo, body wash, conditioner, spices, beach towels, etc. We were really able to just relax and enjoy our time there. We really loved the movie room and the hot tub was aaaamazing!! We will definitely be staying here again!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Boyfriend and I stayed here for our first vacation together for my birthday. We loved it. It’s not far from all the local tourist spots and the drive up was beautiful. Hot tub, pool table, and theater room were great additions that we really enjoyed. It is very quiet and peaceful. Jaynee was very helpful and responsive. She even checked in on us during our stay. It was clean and we loved every bit of it. If you’re thinking about staying here do it! You won’t regret it."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. Great host. Very clean. Very quiet.
Would stay here again 1000%
Me and my wife had a kids feee trip for our anniversary. Great time."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the cabin. Great secluded location away from the hustle and bustle of the main touristy area. Great location for visiting daughter at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. On the way make sure to stop at Ye Olde Steakhouse for the best Prime Rib ever."

Clean, peaceful, and private with just enough amenities that we didn't have to leave the entire stay! We will definitely be coming back to celebrate more anniversaries!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a beautiful and unique cabin which provided us the privacy and quiet that we needed for our romantic get away!

We will definitely stay here again!"

Only con was how flat the pillows were in the bed but if you bring your own pillows, it won’t be an issue! Everything else was PERFECT!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was my first experience with Airbnb and I’m so glad that, Marcel made my first adventure a great one! He responded back right away, was helpful and friendly.
Everything was clean, organized and beautiful. Everything looked exactly like the pictures.
Added bonus: The place is near everything in town just tucked away to give you that added peacefulness/privacy and you don’t have any of the local traffic noise. So any errands or food/gas runs are effortless.
If I was to ever travel back to this area I would 100% be going back to the Retreat Oasis."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Just book it! We wanted to be secluded, but close enough to go do all the fun things and this was perfect! We drove into pigeon forge several times a day to go eat, shop and what not; then we would come back and walk the beautiful trails on the property! The kids loved fishing and pedal boating! Truly the perfect balance. We always look for unique luxury places to stay and this one is one of our new favorites! Marcel was a super awesome host! Beautifully lit up at night!! Truly a 5 star property!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I am an AirBnb host and I had the pleasure of staying at a this modern cabin in Sevierville that offered the perfect blend of modern comfort and eco-friendly charm. Tucked away in a serene setting, this accommodation provided a refreshing escape from the hustle and bustle, while still being conveniently close to the vibrant attractions of Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg.
From the moment we arrived, we were captivated by the cabin's modern design that seamlessly integrated with its natural surroundings. The large windows allowed for plenty of natural light, providing a warm and inviting atmosphere. The interior boasted contemporary furnishings and amenities, making it a true home away from home. The attention to detail in the décor showcased a commitment to both style and sustainability.
Our stay at this modern and green cabin in Sevierville was nothing short of exceptional."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The oasis retreat was amazing! It’s the cleanest air bnb we’ve ever stayed at. The trails around the cabin are also a really nice feature. It’s secluded enough to feel like you’re by yourself in the mountains but close enough to pigeon forge to easily go out and do anything. It’s such a nice cabin and area. They’ve done an amazing job, and I would recommend this place to anyone! We will definitely be back!"

Marcel's cottages because that's the name of the owner is in the European style , very clean , modern , in a very quiet and peaceful area surrounded by forest and water . Everything is as it appears in the photos. The marcel is a very nice and friendly person, and after we spoke with him, we had as long as we knew him for a long time . I highly recommend this place for the first time with my husband I was so pleasantly surprised by each other, even our dog, which we had with us, was also happy there. We'll definitely be back this summer . Thanks again, and we'll be sure to recommend this place to our family and friends ."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was wonderful! From lounging by the fire pit to kayaking in the lake, it was better than we ever could have imagined. Marcel also provided several little “extras” that were not expected such as laundry detergent, kcups for the Keurig & hand soaps in both the kitchen & bathroom. Our cabin was extremely clean. My son loved the lake & being able to fish from the kayaks. The area is quiet but also close to town. Our stay was a much needed break from the normal hustle & craziness of our everyday life. We will most definitely be staying with Marcel again. His cabins are a hidden gem in the Smoky Mountains!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Hands down this was the BEST AirBNB we’ve every rented. We stayed here for a week while my husband attended the Cirrus flight school and found it to be so peaceful and a great getaway from Knoxville. Every detail put into the house, design and overall property is so impressive. Marcel thought of every detail, even the organization and fire pit set up. We loved this experience and would definitely recommend and suggest anyone who is looking for a special getaway visit here!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I booked here for my bestfriends FIRST trip to Tennessee!! We absolutely loved it and she had a blast. The place was just as described and matched all the photos. It was very easy to check in and check out, also very easy to adjust the temperature inside (huge deal for us). The set up is adorable, the trails were easy to use and we loved walking them. The distance to Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge is great. We loved being the first to write in the little book about our stay. The bed is also super comfy and the fact it’s a king size is great. We’re already in the works of our next trip back with our boyfriends!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonderful time at the cabin. We loved the interior design and the trails. We will definitely be back to visit. It was peaceful and quiet. Everything we needed was carefully thought of and in specific locations. Very nicely organized. We enjoyed the fire pit too.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family loved our stay at Oasis Retreat! The A-Frame cabin had a beautiful view, and it was the perfect size for our family of four. The pictures accurately portrayed the space and amenities. Marcel sent messages with everything we needed to know before our stay, and we never had a need to contact our host with questions or requests. Having a washer/dryer in the cabin was greatly appreciated. We will definitely be back, and we have already recommended Oasis Retreat to friends!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was awesome! A real gem near Dollywood. It manages to feel secluded while being completely accessible to all the surrounding towns have to offer.

The kitchen is also well-equipped, and there is a full-sized washer and dryer available. We loved our stay and are definitely planning to come back in the future."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Marcel was friendly and responded quickly. The cabin was modern, quiet, and cute! Great location for near by attractions. The cabin also had little activities available without traveling such as paddle boating, finishing, and kayaking. 10/10 recommend!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place sets the bar too high! We are afraid we are not going to be able to enjoy a different Airbnb. The cleanliness was amazing and the amenties were phenomenal! We had a great time beginning the day canoeing and hiking on the property early in the morning and then ending the day around a cozy fire! The cabin went above and beyond our expectations! We enjoyed the cabin and area so much we ended up staying an extra day! Marcel was a great host, always responsive and accommodating. He cared about our needs and made the trip stress free for us. He and his team did a great job with the property!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,What an absolutely amazing stay! The fact that this Airbnb was close enough to everything and far enough to enjoy the beauty of the area is wonderful.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"recently stayed at this beautiful cabin, and I must say it was a fantastic experience. The cabin itself was gorgeous and spacious, providing more than enough room for everyone in our group to feel comfortable. The highlight of the property was definitely the patio - a peaceful and serene spot to hang out, relax, and enjoy the surrounding nature.
The location of the cabin was perfect for our needs. It was just a short 40-minute drive to Cape Cod, making it easy for us to explore the area's beaches and attractions. Additionally, its proximity to Pigeon Forge was a pleasant surprise, as we were able to explore this charming town without much hassle.
One of the great features of this property is the availability of small hikes right on the premises. This allowed us to enjoy nature without having to venture too far from the cabin. It's an excellent addition for those who love the outdoors."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin is so cute! The hiking trails were amazing it even has cute benches for you to rest! Would highly recommend!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best Airbnbs we’ve stayed at, and it’s easily one of my favorite ones as well. Perfect for a family looking to connect with nature. Beautiful trails, lake, and luxurious amenities just as describe in the listing. Marcel’s response time and communication was perfect as well! Looking forward to future stays!!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a fantastic place for me and my two boys. A private location that’s very close to the main highway. A super fast and responsive host that is more than willing to help in any way! Great pond for fishing and just a great atmosphere overall. Highly recommend and will be staying here in the future! Thank you so much!

Clean, Hot Tub was very clean, I could not get over how cute and Quiet it was. You will not be disappointed. Robert and Jessica was very Helpful, Thank you so much, we will be staying again ❤️"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay here. The cabin was clean, and super cozy. The hot tub was very relaxing and we loved the view from it of the stars in the sky at night. The patio area was done so thoughtfully outside for comfort and a complete ""get lost in the moment"" vibe. The small kitchenette was perfect and equipped with all the basics for a small , yet delicious meal."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"""Everything was perfect. The only issue I had was the amount of cobwebs near the hot tub, so I swept them away myself. Considering it's the woods in Tennessee, spraying spider spray around the deck all 12 months of the year may help. That's being nitpicky though! It was a great stay."""
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was a great one day get away with my 6 year old son who loved the pool and hot tub
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely loved the place. Quiet and peaceful. Perfect size for my family and my girls loved the pool! Would definitely stay again!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin and pool were outstanding. It was a birthday weekend for two of us, so the price was didn't bother us too much. It is in a local community of cabins and is very well maintained. As long as you have food, you really don't need to go anywhere (swimming, games, Roku, etc.) all there. Clear instructions on how to get in and how to leave it for departure.
Tiffany was a very good host and communicated often with us prior to arrival and just before departure."

There were games to play, hand soap ( a must).The hot tub was hot and ready for us to get in. We loved the double deck. We actually loved everything! We arrived one day prior to pool cleaning but signs were posted and we were aware that they were coming. We did have an issue but it was addressed immediately, within 5 minutes. We are already planning on going again next year! I highly recommend!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our family oved the location and cabin! We would definitely stay again. My two year old loved the pool and arcade game the cabin had to offer. It was also close distance to all pigeon forge had to offer.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Although it is located in a ""Cabin Resort"" it is very quiet, very private and stocked with everything you need to enjoy time with the family in mountains. We loved the option of a hot tub and our kids loved the option of an indoor pool. We were surprised at how close it was to almost everything! The location is dead center of what we dubbed 'The Mountain Trifecta"" :) - close to Pigeon Forge, Sevierville, and Gatlinburg. Look forward to visiting again.
BTW, we arrived a little early and met the cleaning crew, what a nice bunch of folks that do a bang up job- thanks again!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It could have been a nightmare. Weather was bad, ice and snow on the ground and a lot of things closed, including the cleaning crew. Received a call from Patrick on our way up letting us know. Suggested we stop by the store to pick up extra essentials just in case we got in and couldn’t get back out. We did so, got to the cabin, and even though the cleaning crew was not able to get there, house was clean. He told us where extra sheets were and all we had to do was wash towels. Patrick checked in with me numerous times over the weekend to make sure everything was ok. House was great. Perfect location. We definitely would recommend this cabin to anyone. We look forward to checking out their other cabins in the area."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Definitely recommend staying here super close to pigeon forge and Tennessee! Great location ! Offer everything you could possibly need in the cabin. We got snowed in for 2 days but had plenty to do in the cabin !

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is adorable and had plenty of games and things to do. Very close to Pigeon Forge! The pool and pool area was a little cold but we were still able to swim and have a great time. I would def stay again ❤️
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a blast here! The place was perfect for our two year old and he especially loved the pool. The location was also great for us. It was private and gave us a taste of the Smoky Mountains but it was also close enough to the surrounding towns where we did not feel like we were driving too much. Overall we had a wonderful time and the hosts were very friendly and easy to work with!

We can say, we WILL be coming back again! Thank you Amy for hosting us and we look forward to coming back for a longer stay!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Betsy and Trey were the best Hosts of the lighthouse stay! The area is beautiful, peaceful and serene right on the lake. I shared with Betsy prior that this stay was a gift to my parents for their anniversary. She went above and beyond to make their stay so special. There was an amazing anniversary basket on the counter when they arrived, along with some farm fresh eggs from the chickens they raise! Such a nice surprise! The lighthouse is super cute and cozy. The top level has the best view of the lake and great space to kick back and relax. Betsy made this such a special stay for my parents and created new favorite memories for them! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Highly recommend!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Exceeded expectations!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at the Lighthouse was truly a dream. My husband I had a wonderful, peaceful, and restful stay.

We also loved the chickens, sweet dogs and goats! We will never forget our time here- truly magical!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,The light house and the property are gorgeous. A very relaxing and peaceful place to get away for a few days.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stayed here for our anniversary. Very peaceful and private location. 15 minute drive from downtown Sevierville. Hosts were very nice and helpful. Would love to visit back when the lake is in open season. Thank you again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had the most wonderful stay. If you’re looking for a quiet escape this is it. The lighthouse is beautifully built and decorated, comfortable, quiet and inspiring. The surrounding property is gorgeous as well. We had the best time wondering around the little peninsula, lounging in the sunroom and watching the gulls at sunset. Any was a thoughtful communicative host. This is airbnb done right. We can’t wait to go back!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. perfect views. nice comfy place to do our 10 year anniversary
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is simply amazing. I’ve stayed at several BNB’s over the last couple of years. Overall with lovely experiences had. With research and time invested, this is probably true for you as well. (Which is why you are reading this review.) Let me say the Lighthouse met and exceeded all of my expectations! Believe this 5-star rating and book it! You will not be disappointed. There’s a peace found here that is utterly magical. We didn’t feel like we were vacationing at a rented space but rather we felt home. We were transported to a place and time where we looked out of our kitchen window to view a lake nestled at the base of the mountain. We walked along its shoreline to the sounds of shore rock crunching beneath our feet. We read on the couch as the light streamed in through the surrounding top floor windows. Betsy and Trey were incredible hosts. One mention of anything you were looking for was received with instructions to it or it placed sweetly at your doorstep. Book it!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had been really looking forward to the experience in this light house for months (since we booked it) & we were absolutely thrilled with our time there. It did not disappoint one bit. First of all – the 3rd floor 360° room was spectacular! We spent as much time as we could in that space. We watched sunsets & changing weather from there. It was glorious to check out the seagulls & herons flying over the lake. Because it was winter, Douglas Lake had been drawn down so we were able to walk the shoreline, which would be the lake bottom during the warmer months. We were so fortunate to have beautiful warm and dry weather while we were there, up until the last evening when we watched the rain fall & noticed the lake level rise from the previous day. We enjoyed meeting the goats & chickens during one of our walks on the property. We also saw a small group of deer near the waters edge too. We felt immersed in the whole lighthouse experience- which was something I had wanted for a long time."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking for a quiet getaway with beautiful views, you've found it. This lighthouse is perfect. Thanks for having us."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Driving upon the lighthouse at the end of the day was magical. The setting is beautiful. A great place to stay to relax and recharge. Other than going out to get supplies, we stayed in and enjoyed the surrounding area with hikes, great views and nature. We saw birds and ducks. We would have missed the deer if our host had not alerted us that they were in front of the house. Did not want to leave, it was so peaceful. Would love to return in the summer to take full advantage of the lake."
2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous lake and Mountain views. Resident egg-laying chickens and adorable goats. Lovely hosts. Proactive letting us know of inclement weather before arriving.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved it here! The views were amazing and the location is just so peaceful. The lighthouse itself is beautiful. We loved watched the sun rise and set from the front deck. We wish we could’ve stayed longer, but we hope to be back! Highly recommend!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The lighthouse was beautiful, the area was quiet & peaceful-the perfect little escape for our one year wedding anniversary. Amy was super kind & helpful. We loved our time here!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The lighthouse is so peaceful! The sunrises and sunsets are stunning at the top. Amy and her husband are the kindest people and they did an incredible job with the lighthouse. When we arrived it was clean and Amy’s instructions to find the lighthouse were super helpful. We will definitely be back!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The lighthouse is a beautiful retreat! The hosts were very attentive and made great suggestions for places to visit and shared their favorite restaurants. We felt right at home and very welcome—will definitely return!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We will forever refer to the lighthouse as Gods Land! We had a wonderful time, we disconnected from the world and reconnected with each other."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Lighthouse!! What an extra special place! It’s more than a place, it’s a feeling of peace and calmness for your soul. The owners were very friendly and responded very quickly to any questions we had. Unfortunately our stay was cut short due to a medical emergency at home but we definitely will be back. If you have any doubt about this place, don’t. BOOK it! Your soul will thank you."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was my first time staying at the Light House in TN and I was filled with joy at the entire experience! I booked the house at the last minute for a trip with my son and from the moment we pulled onto the gravel drive and saw the silly goats we were filled with anticipation at what was in store! Let me tell you, when we slowly took that last left and took our first look at the Light House I stopped the car and immediately took a picture to remember that moment. It's truly such a SPECIAL place. The rocky shores, the secluded location, the safety of a private property, the views ... 100% worth it. My 4 year old told me on day one that this was already an 11/10 vacation and I could not have agreed more! I will absolutely be booking the Light House again as soon as possible. Thank you so much to the wonderful hosts! You have built a truly special home and the intention and love that you put into this special place is clearly evident. I was honored to be able to stay here!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What an amazing 2 days. Hated leaving the beautiful Lighthouse and serene lake. Would definitely recommend.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at Hunkerdown Hollow couldn’t have been any better. The lighthouse was beautifully built and the views were unbeatable. And the farm fresh eggs provided were just an added bonus! Betsy and Trey are super nice and responsive to any issues or questions you may have. And their little farm is just the cutest! Definitely going to keep this one for a return trip!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful every way possible except for we had to leave. Perfect getaway with gorgeous views. Loved floating on the lake, star gazing and drinking coffee on the deck!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay! The lighthouse was so cozy and the view from every window was beautiful.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The lighthouse was the perfect place for us to celebrate our 19th Anniversary! Beautiful views everyway you turn. So peaceful. Our favorite spot was the table near the grill. Trey was always a text away if we had any questions. We loved using the canoe to go around the coves. We also got to visit the sweet goats and chickens! The house was extremely clean and had a fully stocked kitchen with anything you may need to cook. We will be back!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place.
Can’t wait to go back!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"What an incredible stay! One of the best Air Bnbs we have stayed at.
Lots to do nearby - we explored Smoky Mountain National Park, Dollywood, and went white water rafting. However, the views from the front deck and the pristine accommodations made it hard to leave.
Very hospitable, gracious, and helpful hosts.
We spent a week here and wish it could have been longer.
We arrived after dark, and though it would be preferable to arrive in daylight, the hosts provided clear directions and even left the light on for us.
Highly recommend!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is like a slice of paradise tucked away from the hustle and bustle of city life. Nestled on a serene lake, the view from the lighthouse is like something out of a dream or the best Hallmark movie you’ve ever seen! Pictures do no justice to the calming energy you feel here! A big shout out to the charming residents of Hunkerdown Hollow: the goats and chickens! They're basically the unofficial welcoming committee, and they do it in style!
Amy, our amazing host, deserves a crown for hospitality - always one step ahead of our needs to the point I think she’s a mind reader! After spending time at Hunkerdown Hollow, I can confirm that it's not just a place; it's a feeling. A feeling of true rest, where the world's chaos takes a vacation and leaves you in peace. So, if you're looking for a dose of tranquility, a dash of laughter (goats are surprisingly funny), and a heap of amazing memories, pack your bags and make your way to Airbnb Hunkerdown Hollow. Your soul will thank you!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best AirBnBs, I have stayed in. absolutely beautiful location and peaceful on the lake. Plenty of space that made it feel very private. Amy (Betsy) & Trey are very friendly and gave us plenty of recommendations!
Very Highly recommend!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful time! The lighthouse was exactly as described and the hosts were very responsive and friendly. The scenery and lake are gorgeous, and it was great to watch the sunrise and sunset each day."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The lighthouse was everything I expected and so much more. The setting was beautiful, relaxing and refreshing. My husband and I had a great time. We arrived on our first night and we’re treated with fireworks while seated on the third floor! Thank you Trey for the tip! We will definitely be back to visit again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The lighthouse is a beautiful and one of a kind location. The interior is immaculate and the exterior is beautiful with 360 views. The view from the 3rd floor is breathtaking. Amy and Trey are amazing hosts and are extremely helpful and proactive with any needs you may have.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a beautiful gem the lighthouse on the lake is!! Amy (Betsy) & Trey are wonderful hosts! They made our family feel so welcomed. They reached out multiple times before our trip, answered any questions we had and provided photos to make sure we understood how to get to the lighthouse. The property is absolutely stunning!! Our boys had the best time fishing, swimming and watching the boats on the lake. The inside of the lighthouse is equally spectacular- shiplap, a gorgeous kitchen and the third floor has the most breathtaking views! We all left sad that we had to go home! Looking forward to planning our next getaway at the lighthouse!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic week at the lighthouse! The home is beautiful, clean and private. Overall, the lighthouse was a perfect peaceful retreat. We spent all day soaking in the sun, sitting in the water, birdwatching and relaxing. Definitely a stay for those who are more physically capable as there are lots of stairs to contend with, but definitely worth it if you are able! The lighthouse was a delightful home away from home, and the hosts are so wonderful as well!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"What an amazing place! It is perfect for anyone who wants to getaway from the crowds of Pigeon Forge or Gatlinburg. Beautiful lake, wonderful deck to enjoy the outdoors, and a gorgeous place to stay. Betsy (aka Amy) and Trey are such wonderful hosts and they have thought of everything a guest might need. My husband and I had such an amazing time during our week in Tennessee. I highly recommended the hosts and this incredible lighthouse!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amy and her family were wonderful hosts! This property provided us with an outstanding break from our routine. We especially enjoyed the unlimited access to great fishing and beautiful views on the lake. Gracious hosts and wonderful atmosphere of their home, exceeded all of our expectations and will be recommending this to friends and family."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The lighthouse is simply MAGICAL! We loved the 360 views, the sunrise and sunset views, the lake. There are kayaks available for use. Although we did not fish, it would have been a great fishing spot! The grounds are beautifully maintained. The location is just private enough and only a short drive from tons of activities, including Dollywood!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was extremely peaceful and relaxing. The road to the place was curvy and hilly, but after we arrived we didn’t want to leave! It was so close to the Smokies, Pigeon Forge, restaurants, etc. Amy was very responsive to our call about sweet Daisy’s visit (her elderly bulldog that gave us a visit). We intend to visit again!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful sunrise and sunsets. Very peaceful and private.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It’s absolutely beautiful and Betsy and Trey were extremely helpful! The drive is a little rough for a smaller car but other than that we enjoyed our stay!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Easily the best stay we have had at any AirBnB! This lighthouse was perfect for our family of 4. Stunning views and gorgeous decor. Such a beautiful and unique stay nestled in the smoky mountains.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our 1st Airbnb and it set the bar so high for future bookings! The lighthouse and views were so beautiful and relaxing. It was the perfect anniversary get away. Trey & Betsy were so inviting and kind, we appreciated them sharing this slice of heaven with us…also enjoyed their dogs :)"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The host was not only extremely flexible but also so accommodating to our situation. She offered to help get a photographer arranged for my proposal as well as to get champagne and anything else I needed. Her and her family were so helpful and kind. I the location and lighthouse were so beautiful and secluded and I would recommend to any small families or especially couples looking to get away for a few days to enjoy nature and a beautiful home!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay. Very peaceful and right next to the lake. Waking up to nothing but the sound of Canadian geese and little waves on the shoreline and the sun glistening off the water. The lighthouse was as beautiful as described in the listing. Great place to unwind and just enjoy nature, but not too far away from Sevierville. Definitely worth a second visit and more! Amy was a great host and we were glad we got to meet her in person as well. She helped us with directions and pictures on how to get to the lighthouse. Definitely an 11 out of 10 for this listing!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amy was an amazing host. So gracious and kind! She even decorated for Valentine’s Day and left us a little treat. The lighthouse was absolutely beautiful and had everything we could need and the views and surroundings make it so worth it in itself. I will definitely be staying here again!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is absolutely magical and easily one of the best Air BnB experiences we’ve had. The lighthouse is incredible; a water view from every window, nicely decorated, super clean, and completely relaxing. The lighthouse is private, has direct access to the water and island, and the view of the lake and surrounding mountains is endless. Our host was so welcoming, kind, and communicative. She truly made us feel like family. She invited us to feed their goats, explore their property, and she even hung a banner in the lighthouse for my husband’s birthday. There is so much love and thought put into this property and it definitely shows. We are already planning to come back again this year and would 100% recommend it to family, friends, or anyone who is seeking an amazing retreat to a very unique location."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful property!!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place and very peaceful. I’d only suggest driving a truck or suv. A sports car could be tricky
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was nothing short of amazing!! From the cozy cabin feel to the fantastic view.. The view was priceless I must add!! Check-in was simple. Amy was prompt to answer the few questions I had. The place was stocked with many supplies as well. My only regret is not having more time to stay. 100% sure we will be coming back to this paradise to experience the beautiful lake when it’s warm enough to swim and enjoy the canoe/kayaks. Amy was so gracious to have allowed us to utilize the washer/dryer set and for that I was i incredibly grateful!! My 19yo daughter was disappointed there was no TV. The point of staying there was to get away anyways, so it didn’t bother us one bit. There was Wi-Fi to connect our devices to so that was an easy fix. You’d think being way out that connection would be an issue but it wasn’t at all. Oh and very important to me, the bed was PERFECT!!! A good nights sleep is very important and was just that, perfect!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Legend has it that when Adam and Eve were kicked out of the garden of Eden, they searched the earth for the next most idyllic spot. Where did they land??? The Hunkerdown Hollow lighthouse! This lighthouse ON ITS OWN ISLAND is three stories of pure bliss. There’s a full-size kitchen, dining area and bathroom on the first floor, a large bedroom on the second floor and a gorgeous loft hang out area on the third floor with views for miles and miles. I am currently sitting on the front deck while listening to ZERO sounds of humanity. During the summer you will have some boats on the lake but otherwise, sit, relax and let your blood pressure recede to zero… because you’ll think you’ve died and gone to heaven. Take a walk through the woods to the end of the island, go swimming in the lake, go fishing, kayaking or just sit and listen to the sounds of the earth as God intended them. Don’t bring a phone. Don’t bring a computer. Just exist here and let all your stress melt away. Oh, and if you are coming here with your significant other, I would highly recommend not bringing any clothing either. There’s not a soul in sight! You’re welcome, humanity."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My stay was excellent !!
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful relaxing fun great place to hear and see nature. This cabin has it all. I would definitely come back. My kids had so much fun. Close to town.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is amazing!! Brain was a super host and had a lot of good ideas for things to do. This is the perfect place to explore the Smokys. We saw deers by the house. Everthing was so good, the jacuzzi and playroom and perfect beds. I would defenitly come back to this place!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Phenomenal Cabin nestled in the hills of TN. Simply amazing views from the porch, especially in the morning while enjoying our morning coffee.
Thank you! it was great."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This cabin is amazing! It’s in a nice neighborhood and has amazing views. Brian was a great owner and very responsive with a minor issue we had. We would definitely suggest this cabin to friends and would stay here again when we return to the area.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The view is beautiful and has the cabin has two decks plus large windows to take in the mountain scenery. There are many cabins nearby; however this one is on the end of a row, making it feel more private. The view is not obstructed by any of the other cabins. It was clean and the beds were very comfortable. The games were a fun added touch. We had an issue with the HVAC but the host promptly responded and someone came out to fix the issue, even though it was late in the evening. There was a lack of amenities such as toilet paper, coffee, and cooking supplies. Overall though the experience was good with a beautiful view, peaceful setting, and conveniently near Pigeon Forge. Would stay there again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great cabin! We loved every minute of being there. Everything was great, highly recommend!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home. We had the best vacation. We will definitely be back. Thank you Brian 😊
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing view. The kids had a blast with all the games, their own space, and a hot tub on the deck!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This cabin was everything we expected and more! It was our first time in the Smokey’s and we were far from disappointed! It was almost hard to leave the beautiful porch with the picturesque view and cozy cabin. Very clean and tidy all around. Brian was extremely responsive and gracious. We would highly recommend for anyone who wants to check out the Smokey’s!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"After agonizing over hundreds of places to stay we chose this one. I am so glad we did! I was looking for privacy which seemed hard to do on a mountain full of cabins. Brian’s place is at the end of the road and has a very private feel from the hot tub and porches. The loft area and games were perfect for the kids and the mountain view from that upstairs bed is outstanding! Cabin had everything we needed and Brian was a perfect host and was very helpful and responsive. Drive time to pigeon forge and gatlinburg was very easy and didn’t take long at all. Stop searching and book this one, you will not regret it!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I would give this place way more than 5 starts if I could. First off, let me start by saying the pictures of the view do not do it justice. Its so much more in-person. You can see the entire area from Legacy Mountain, over-top of Gatlinburg, into the National park mountains. This cabin sits at the end of the road and is very private. There is only one other cabin close, but the way the cabin faces, you don't even really know its there. The balconies and hot tub offer a private, amazing view. The cabin was extremely clean and in proper order. Our family of 5 stayed here for almost a full week. The guide that Brian provided is very extensive. You could book this cabin with absolutely no planning and Brian's guide would provide you with days worth of activities, restaurants, and places to go. It is an easy drive up to the cabin, as well as a very short drive to Pigeon Forge, Gatlinburg, and up into the National park mountains. I highly recommend this cabin and am planning to return!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cabin was fantastic!
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Spectacular views! The hot tub was great after a day of hiking. Everything was as described.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Excellent, excellent. Would absolutely rent again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Awesome place to stay! Had a snow storm as we were coming and when we were leaving, Brian was awesome about keeping us in the loop in regard to road safety and possible problems WTH the weather."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The host was extremely helpful. We had an issue with the hot tub, but they were on top of sending someone out as soon as possible to resolve the issue. Would recommend this place for future stays!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place with a beautiful view! Loves sitting on the deck, watching the sunrise with coffee and surrounded by nature. Cabin is well laid out and perfect for a family. Brian's instructions were very helpful. Thanks for a great stay!!"
2023-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The cabin has a million dollar view. In a great location, only 15-20 minutes easy drive from both Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg. Great communication from Brian."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a great cabin with lots of fun stuff (billiard, air hockey, jucuzzi ... etc) you can do. Kids really enjoy the stay."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Brian is a very good host and extremely responsive. We would book a cabin with him again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing cabin. Views are stunning. Very clean and perfect location in the heart of gaitlinberg. Best vacation my family has ever had.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at the cabin for 5 nights. Everything was WONDERFUL. Amazing view, the cabin is in a cul de sac, which is wonderful. The host was extremely responsive. There was a minor issue that needed to be resolved and he helped us right away.
I am definitely going back to this cabin. We absolutely loved the experience."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stay at Brian's place every year for the last three years for our anniversary! We love it there! The view is spectacular and Brian is so nice and very responsive! He even gives us a welcome basket with tons of goodies inside which is such a nice gesture! Can't wait to go back next November!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at the Far and Away cabin was so peaceful & relaxing! Our city life stress of the daily grind, just melted away!!
Kitchen was clean & stocked with cookware for our family of 4 adults to prepare dinner each night. Beds are clean and comfy. Balcony & rockers allowed us to relax and breathe in the mountain air!! The Mountain View’s are unforgettable. The cabin was close to Dollywood & this was great for our grandchildren.
Brian is a great host & he has the cabin so nice & includes clear guest instructions that we did not have to call on him.
Thank You for a memorable vacation in the Smoky Mountains!!!
The Redick Family, from West TN"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Breath taking views. Very private. Game room was a really nice touch for enjoying family time while admiring the spectacular scenery.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Book here!!! This was an amazing place to stay. Can’t beat the views (absolutely gorgeous in the fall) and everything you need is here. We were able to cook and do laundry and relax in a hot tub! Home and from home. This is a fabulous cabin for families as well-my kids learned how to play pool and we’re thoroughly entertained with the arcade game. Brian was an exceptional host-if we’re able to make it back to the Smokies, we’ll definitely book this cabin again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved staying here and were so sad to leave! The cabin had gorgeous views! The beds were comfortable and there were so many fun things in the cabin to do to keep us busy. Everything was clean and Brian was easy to chat with if anything came up. We would definitely recommend staying at this property!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, near dollywood and quaint downtown Sevierville. The jacuzzi was a great way to soothe the muscles after a day hiking in the Smokies with a gorgeous view of the mountains."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely Amazing breath taking Views!!! Brian was very nice and welcoming. Everything was clean and just as the pictures and descriptions say! Awesome location! Overall we had such an amazing time and will definitely be coming back!!!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Brian was a great host. He did a great job of communicating & was very responsive. The property was exactly what we expected...beautiful views, cozy space downstairs & plenty of fun stuff upstairs that kept our kids entertained (& off devices) when were hanging out at the cabin. The location was close to Pigeon Forge & Gatlinburg for restaurants & things to do. Close to hiking in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. There was also a convenience store & Family Dollar just down the road (within 5 minutes) for odds & ends. We really enjoyed our stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay here. The cabin was clean with plenty of amenities. We had some trouble with the air conditioning not working properly, and Brian was quick to respond and send someone out to take care of it. The view was incredible! We hoped to see some bears, but we didn't get to during our time there. This cabin is within good driving distance of both Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg, with many things available to do. There was a book with a bunch of suggestions for places to eat and things to do nearby. We would definitely recommend staying here to anyone looking for a place to stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,we absolutely adored this cabin. the views were spectacular and the amenities including the tub and game area made it a great family destination. we would definitely come back and will enjoy the memories we made thank you
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an Amazing time in Tennessee for a wedding! We stayed here and the views were INCREDIBLE! It’s at the end of a dead end so lots of privacy too! I can’t get over the amazing views, and the cabin was perfect for us! We loved the hotub too! Also close to
Great restaurants and downtown!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,The entire family loved our stay. Playing air hockey was one of the highlights along with the amazing views while sitting in the hot tub. Will definitely be back!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice stay at the smoky mountains cabin. Cabin looked exactly like photos. Plenty of space and beautiful views.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I had a great experience. Definitely recommend, very welcoming and quite community."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Brian’s cabin exceeded our expectations. Kitchen is fully stocked along with the necessities such as soap, napkins, coffee, etc. that helped us get started for the first few days. Tons of linen, extra blankets, and pillows. Home was clean with plenty of family fun games. Best part is the view from all parts of the home and jacuzzi on deck. Can’t wait to come back. Thanks Brian!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brian was absolutely amazing and quickly responded to any messages I had sent to them! I HIGHLY recommend staying here! The GPS in the vehicle we drove took us almost all the way. I think we were 4 houses away.
Everything was clean and orderly. The bed slept well!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brian was a flawless host. Husband had to log in to a meeting before check in time, and Brian got us in early to make it happen. Loved the book with recommendations. Everything he recommended was good. It was a beautiful relaxing stay for our family. If we’re in the area again, we will be back."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great views! Perfect for small family
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Brian was very helpful with the whole process. The cabin was as advertised with a beautiful view. Our family had a great stay.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved our stay in this cabin! The view is breathtaking and the cabin itself is beautiful and well-stocked with all the essentials. The location is convenient for getting to both Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge, but still remote and in the woods. The beds are comfy and my kids loved the entertainment in the loft. We will definitely stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The view from this cabin was absolutely breathtaking. My family and I had the best time. My 6 year old loved the air hockey table, and the kids loft. I highly recommend. Just as beautiful as described."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The cabin is beautiful with amazing views! I loved every moment of staying here. My teenage sons loved the pool table, air hockey table and video game machine. My wife and I enjoyed sitting in the hot tub and admiring the views. It was even better that we were here over the 4th of July and we got to watch the fireworks over the valley. The cabin is within driving distance of all attractions, we were out each day and loved all that was around. We would definitely stay here again, if we return to Tennessee."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great time staying at this beautiful cabin. The views were amazing and the Hottub was wonderful after a long day walking around.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Now and Forever was a beautiful cabin with picturesque views. The cabin itself had plenty of amenities, and kept the whole family relaxed, and entertained. This ended up being one of our favorite vacation memories, I would highly recommend to anyone."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Family had a great stay, views can be beat."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The views!!!! This cabin was absolutely amazing. The views were breathtaking! 100% recommended this cabin. We couldn't decide which hike we wanted to take. There were descriptions of the hikes in the welcome book and a list of popular restaurants. That was very helpful we decided our hike from the book. The host was very responsive. This was a beautiful cabin. I really enjoyed my stay. Driving has beautiful scenery, and everything is about 20 to 30 minutes drive. Wacky tacky tacos is a must. The tacos and burritos are amazing. About five minutes from the cabins. If we ever go back to severeville Tennessee, will definitely stay with Brian in his cabin again. Thanks again for an amazing honeymoon!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great cabin with fantastic views of Mt Leconte, privacy and nice amenities! Friendly host!"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Great location, about 20 minutes to Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge. Fun activities inside and an amazing view."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brian's place was a great, relaxing cabin for our honeymoon! The view was amazing and the location was super convenient for shopping/exploring in Gatlinburg. Brian was a very responsive host and everything about check-in/check-out was easy and smooth. Would definitely stay here again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brian’s place was absolutely gorgeous! The view from the balcony alone was worth it, but it was also clean, spacious, and had everything you need for a fantastic Smokies vacation. The host was also very helpful and communicative and the hot tub and game room were a much appreciated bonus. Would definitely stay here again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Brian is a super host. He is proactive, and super responsive, even at late hours. He gives you his undivided attention during the entirety of your stay. Immediacy after we made the reservation, we received a brochure with all you need to know about the cabin, the local stores, restaurants and even recommendations on the must-see places.
The kids just loved the loft, the brand new hot tub and the games in the cabin. They even refused to go hiking/site seeing and just wanted to stay at the cabin.
The cabin itself is just as you see in the pictures. The view from the deck is almost indescribable. You would think you are nestled in the heart of the smoky mountains. You can sit on the deck and just soak it in for hours together. You just cannot have enough of it. I would go back to the same cabin without missing a beat."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Bed was a little broken but I loved the stay in everything about the cabin
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great stay! Brian was a great host and super helpful! We will for sure be back in the future!
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful cabin. Great host!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cabin has a breathtaking view from almost everywhere in the cabin. I was taken aback every morning by the beautiful view out the window right from the bed upstairs. Even at night the moonlight view is beautiful.
Brian was very helpful and even gave us a call about something we didn't even realize a previous guest had broken. It didn't bother us so we opted for peace and quiet instead of a fix as it could wait.
Brian also was kind enough to let us slow charge our car from the regular wall outlet at the top of the front steps. Our car's cord reached it from a reasonable back-in parking position.
The 30min drive to the Sugarlands Visitor Center is easy; I recommend taking a route other than the Gnatty Branch route at night and your navigation app should show an alternative. We really enjoyed riding rented bikes around the Cades Cove loop on a closed-to-cars summer Wednesday.
We look forward to staying here again sometime!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We travelled all the way from Maine for our first official family road trip and were amazed by the beauty of the cabin! Everything was top notch! We hope to travel back again someday!!! My boys had a blast!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I had a wonderful stay at this beautiful cabin! I can’t stress enough how incredible the view is! The cabin itself is clean and comfortable, we felt right at home. Brian is an excellent host, he responded to all our questions quickly and kindly! I would highly recommend staying here to anyone visiting the area!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely loved Brian's cabin. The location is quiet and the views are stunning. The games upstairs also kept my kids entertained when we weren't out exploring the area which was great to have. Brian was very responsive and checked in to ensure our stay was going well. Would come back again!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This cabin is in group of cabins that are on switch backs, we had no issues locating the cabin and our minivan handled the grade fine. Parking was easy and the cabin itself is beautiful, the 2 balconies and the view are stunning. We really enjoyed the hot tub and the kids liked the old school video game. The bedding was very comfortable the temperature was easy to adjust. The kitchen had necessities. We had a small issue with a beeping smoke alarm and a malfunctioning faucet, the batteries just needed replaced in the smoke alarm and a handyman fixed the faucet the next day. I would definitely recommend staying here. Brian was very quick to all inquires and helpful."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful views and gorgeous cabin
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Came up for spring break and both the cabin and Brian did not disappoint. Brian was very responsive, even sent our pillow to us that we left. We will definitely come here again and recommend to our friends."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely stunning views and gorgeous/cozy cabin. My husband and I took a quick weekend trip for his birthday and this one will go down on our redo list for sure. This trip just the two of us went for a couples weekend, but will be coming back with our kiddos in the future. Thank you again Brian for sharing your home, for all your helpful recommendations & for ensuring our stay went flawlessly. We will be back."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place to stay. Will book again
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Came here for our honeymoon. Absolutely great venue! Every aspect of this cabin was shown in the photos. Both floors were great in their own ways. The first floor is cozy with the closed bedroom, fireplace, and rocking chairs on the balcony for morning coffee with a view. The upstairs loft is a cool vibe with games, an extra Nook with a TV, and a hot tub on the upper balcony with an amazing view! Brian was great with all of the hospitality and warm welcome gifts for my Wife and I. His cabin was already warm, he had a guide book already laid out and even text us to make sure we made it. He's great, the cabin is great and we'll for sure be back!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Brian really helped us emjoy our vacation right from the start. He responded quickly and described the property perfectly via airbnb. The views were better than what was described and we will definitely be back to enjoy the cain.
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,Best view I’ve ever seen!!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We paid for our son and ""bonus"" daughter to spend a week for their honeymoon. Both were excited and impressed with the cabin and their entire stay. The views they shared are aaaahhh inspiring!! Beautiful! Safe surroundings also!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Brian is a great host, very helpful and responsive, personable too! We found upon arrival the knob to the fireplace was missing and he promptly had his handy man come out to replace it! This was our second time here & it's always so much fun! Love the top floor. Open concept with lots of games to play. True family time. The location is also very nice and quiet, and about 20 min from Gatlinburg or Pigeon Forge."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Views alone are worth the booking. Had a great stay and could easily recommend this stay to others.
Quick note: there is only one true bedroom which is downstairs - the upstairs is more of an open living room that houses another bed."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you are looking for a cabin with spectacular views, great amenities, a responsive host, and is squeaky clean, this cabin is perfect!! I searched the internet for hours looking for the perfect vacation cabin for our family and hit the jackpot with this one. It was everything described on the listing and more. The views of the mountains from the loft, porches, and hot tub are spectacular. The cabin was extremely clean and cozy. The games were an awesome addition and my kids loved the extra loft area with a tv. The location is great and the roads are paved and easy to drive. This my newest favorite vacation spot and I’m super picky. :) Brian, the host, was a great communicator and very responsive to any questions or needs during our stay. The entire stay earned a 20 out of 10. If you are still on the fence, pick this one!! We will definitely be back! Thanks Brian!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great location, responsive host! Will definitely be back soon!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was absolutely beautiful but in paled in comparison to the view!! Brian was incredibly accommodating. There was an issue with the upstairs thermostat that I was unaware of and he had a technician out there on a Sunday afternoon so my family wouldn't get cold as it was in the low 20's at night. Highly recommend and we'll be back
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brian is super responsive, communicates very well! We had a lovely time at his cabin. He even had a lovely gift basic for us waiting for our anniversary. The view is absolutely breathtaking! This is our third time staying at one of his cabins. We will be back again!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,The location & views from this cabin were awesome! Breathtaking to watch the sunrise from the bed upstairs.
2022-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The View??? All I can say is the views are just SPECTACTULAR from this cabin! It is only about 15 min to Pigeon Forge and 20 min from Gatlinburg, Perfect! Brian made everything easy and a breeze to check in and out. Brian is a wonderful host and responded to our questions and concerns very quickly. Even when there was an issue that was out of Brians control (water line break in the community), but Brain made sure everything was taken care of.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I stayed at this cozy cabin for our honeymoon and it was everything we could have dreamed of! The pictures don’t even do the views justice.

I would recommend to anyone wanting to stay in the area."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,The cabin was just what we were looking for. Perfect locations and saw bears next to cabin which was amazing. Kids enjoyed the loft bed and games in the mornings before leaving for the days adventures! Hot tub was perfect after our day adventures to relax.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Views in the pics are exactly you get. So relaxing to sit on the porch or in the hot tub looking the Smokies. And keep the kids busy with air hockey, pool, and the arcade table while using the full size kitchen to cook dinner."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome cabin with great amenities and the best view I've ever seen!
2022-06-01,4,Group trip,Perfect location at the end of the block. Quiet peaceful. Only thing is there is only ONE bedroom. It was 3 couples and we did not realize there was only one room until we arrived so not much privacy. But perfect for a family trip w the kids! Brian is an amazing host who is quick in getting back to you. Zip line is about 3 minutes away make sure you make reservations. Very close to stores and necessities.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect little house at the end of a the road.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect cabin! We enjoyed all it had to offer-playing the games upstairs as well as sitting in the hot tub. The cabin is located at the end of a road with other cabins, but it is tucked away enough to not feel crowded. It was close in proximity to entrances to the Smoky Mountain National Park as well as things and restaurants in Pigeon Forge, Gatlinburg, and Sevierville. It was remote enough to feel like a mountain getaway, but there is definitely options to go into the city if you’d like."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is spacious and beautiful as were the views, and it was very clean! There were lots of ammenities including pots and pans, cups/glasses, etc. so we did not need for anything. We look forward to staying there again. Brian, the owner, was very quick to respond and was a pleasure to deal with."

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing views. Very clean and comfortable. Great location
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time at Brian’s cabin! It was the perfect amount of room for our family of 4 (2 adult sons).

2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Brian was an awesome host - very responsive and helpful. The cabin was so much fun. The kids loved the pool table, air hockey, arcade game, sleeping in the loft.

We highly recommend."

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin and the views were breathtaking! A short distance to everything.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything was perfect and as it was described! My teens loved the games, especially the ""old school"" video games. The view was fantastic! We could have sat in the cabin all day. This was our first trip to the area and we were so happy to be 30 minutes from Smokey Mountain NP, and NOT near the busy hustle and bustle of Gatlinburg. We were able to get around without driving through busy traffic. Huge thanks to Brian for keeping us updated when fires broke out a couple of towns over. We can see why he is a Super Host! We would stay here again!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at this cabin. We played and had a nice relaxing time.

2022-03-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful stay with a perfect location just outside the National Park. The cabin is a short and pretty drive from Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge, but just far enough that you're away from the noise/light. We were drained early each day from our hikes so the amenities were amazing for our stay, plenty to do right there in the cabin. Our family loved the stay and would definitely stay again."
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,Our stay was exactly what we were looking for. Communication was excellent. The house had everything we needed! We will definitely be back in the near future.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfectly Cozy and Amazing
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our favorite place to stay yet! The view definitely beats any other place we've stayed at while visiting the mountains. There are cabins around, but this place sits on the end and we still felt secluded. Brian always responded quickly to answer any questions we had. Our kids absolutely loved staying in the top loft area and we all loved playing pool, air hockey, and the arcade style video games. Everything was amazing and we most definitely will return to stay here again!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Better than we expected. The cabin was an end unit, quiet, beautiful, and very comfortable. We loved the hot tub and the fireplace. We WILL be back!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cabin of course had amazing views! The host was very helpful and willing to do what he could to help! The cabin was very clean and cozy all around. We even got to see a bear before we left!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This cabin was one of the highlights of our week in the Smokies! The location and view are perfection. We were so happy to be away from the crowds in Gatlingburg and Pigeon Forge but close enough to everything to make it convenient. The cabin has all the amenities you could need. A full kitchen and laundry are so nice to have. My kids enjoyed the air hockey and other games. The pool at the top of the mountain was an added bonus! Check in and check out were easy and convenient and Brian's communication was thorough and quick. Highly recommend!!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cabin is very clean nicely decorated and very kid friendly. We were there with our daughter and her family.

We had a couple of questions and Brian the host answered right away and helped us. Will definitely stay there again!!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our third time staying at Brian’s cabin and it truly still felt like our home away from home! We wish we could bring this cabin with us on all of our vacations! There is so much to do in the cabin for kids and adults, and the location is simply breathtaking. Brian is also such a wonderful host who is quick to respond and solve the problem if you have a question or are in need of something! We couldn’t recommend this place more!"
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"When we were first looking for a place to stay, we weren't really sure where to go in the Gatlinburg area that would be good for me and my girlfriend, her 2 teenage daughters, and my 60+ year old parents. We looked at so many hotels and just couldn't find one we were satisfied with. We had heard of Airbnb, but had never booked anything through them. However, we decided to check it out. When we saw Brian's Place, we knew that was the one we wanted. We booked within 30 minutes of looking at it online. As the time got closer, we worried that we had made the right decision. We kept looking at the pictures over and over and decided we'd just make the most of it. Let me say that when we arrived and walked in....it's beyond what we expected. It's better than the pictures. I mean, there will not be enough positive things i could say in this review to help you to grasp how amazing this house was. The views are enough to make the trip worth it. We got rained out at Dollywood, but so what! Lol. We got to go back to this beautiful cabin and look out at the mountains that made us feel like we were living in some kind of dream that we wished never had to end. So, to let you know, there was more than enough space for all of us. There was a Pacman arcade game that may have been intended for smaller children, but we all enjoyed it! It seemed like we were going to be on a road with no one for miles, but don't worry! There are other cabins close by, but not too close by any means. It was such a quiet area and peaceful. We got some of the best sleep that I know I've ever had and everyone else said the same. We honestly can't wait to go back again as soon as possible! Thank you, Brian. You were great at keeping in contact with us and making sure our stay was as wonderful as could be. You truly live up to your name as a Superhost!!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is amazing! The views, the games and all the amenities really made our trip. We were close to all the attractions but felt far away and secluded back at the cabin. We loved our stay and would highly recommend! Thanks again!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Beautiful cabin. Brian kept in contact all phases of the stay.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Brian's place was everything that he said it would be and he was very helpful with questions we had about the area.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The location is amazing! You are on a dead end road with amazing views! We stayed here while participating in a Ripken Experience baseball tournament. The location for that was ideal. A quick 15 minute drive to Ripken that avoided the craziness of the main drag in Pigeon Forge. The cabin is well stocked with everything you could need. Beds were extremely comfortable. Brian was quick to respond to any needs which was greatly appreciated! Highly Recommend!!
2021-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,Beautiful location!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a great place to stay. We had easy access to the national park without being in a busy and crowded area. Brian gave us some great suggestions on what to do with our kids. We loved our stay!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A stunning view of Heaven. From every color of green to the ever changing backdrop of the Smokies, the location was perfect. Easily accessiblility to Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg. We were having an already fun trip, but the cabin dumped it up a level. Watching the lightening bugs from the hot tub made for a perfect night. Thanks Brian for helping us make memories."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cabin is perfect for just about anyone!
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"Amazing little getaway! Wish we could have stayed longer. The cabin was perfect and the view was stunning. Being a single mom, it’s very rare that I actually get to rest and relax. I loved being able to sleep in and wake up to the gorgeous Mountain View. My girls and I enjoyed all the games and the hot tub. Brian was awesome with any questions we had and was a great host. Highly recommend"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay in this cabin! The view was amazing and the cabin was perfect. We have a 5 year old and 7 year old and they loved playing in the game room. We didn’t know if the kids would enjoy the drive to get to Pigeon Forge but the drive wasn’t bad at all, only about 20 min. We enjoyed being more remote. The pool was also very nice with a beautiful view."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This cabin was perfect for our family vacation. The views are amazing, the zip lining at the bottom of the mountain was our favorite activity, and the pool and restaurant at the top of the mountain were wonderful too! We had everything we needed there, great location and just overall a fantastic stay!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Brian was the perfect host! His communication was 5 star! The cabin was beautifully located with an easy drive to access. It was clean and just as described. Couldn't have asked for a better experience! Thank you Brian!

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home with great views of the mountains. Secluded with most activities/needs within a reasonable drive (i.e. - hikes, Gatlinburg, groceries, etc.). Great internet connection should anyone be 'working from anywhere'."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The views are amazing, and the cabin feels so secluded. The cabin is located in between Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg so it’s equidistant to either destination. The cabin was clean and had all the amenities you could ask for while staying a week. There were a few minor inconveniences while we stayed, but some were not the owner’s fault and they were fixed quickly (power outage, batteries were low in the smoke detector, and there were not enough garbage bags in the cabin.) All in all, our stay was amazing and this is a truly 5-star experience with 10-star views!"
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,Absolutely stunning. Could not have asked for a better place.

2021-04-01,5,Group trip,"Had an amazing weekend! Beautiful cabin with lots of privacy, would definitely recommend this place to someone who's wanting to stay in Sevierville. The owner was great when it came to communication. Super easy check-in, Plenty of things to keep you busy while staying here. Had breathtaking views, especially from the top deck. You could see the Zip-Lines located at the very top of the mountain, which was pretty cool. The hot tube was clean, very easy to work. Clean showers and beds. It was a great family weekend, thank you for letting us stay!"

This cabin is truly a bucket list spot if you enjoy the mountains!

Kudos to the host couple on the amazing property, I can only hope to one day own a property similar to yours!"

The swing was under repair when we went but the host let us know ahead of time. The water pressure was amazing. Loved the hot tub as well as the beautiful surroundings. She's very quick to respond to any little messages, and has great recommendations if you ask. Wish all the hosts were like Christina! Highly recommend this host and her property."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot for a getaway! We went for a birthday getaway. The hot tub and sauna were so relaxing, also the movie theater was great for after dinner.
Everything in the kitchen was amazing and it was such a joy to cook, Christina has the house stocked with very nice pots/pans, plates and bowls (my girlfriend actually ordered the same set while we were there because she like them so much) and not to mention all of the spices you could ever need.
The King size bed was so comfy, and the heated floors in the master bathroom might have been both of our favorite part! Such a nice touch of luxury.
Overall this is such a a beautiful place, we can't wait to come back!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful scenery, immaculately clean, very peaceful atmosphere. Family friendly and hope to stay longer next time. Thank you Christina"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great and restful stay will definitely stay here again!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely perfect. The place was so adorable, super clean, and had everything we needed! All the stars."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wow. It’s tough to put into words how we feel about this cabin. The views were absolutely incredible. The amenities were also amazing. My wife and I loved relaxing in the hot tub admiring the view. We also enjoyed lounging in the movie room watching movies on the big screen. I’ve stayed in many cabins over the years and this one has to be the best one yet. The thing that put this stay over the top was how incredibly accommodating and helpful Christina was. The communication and helpfulness was top notch. She definitely knows how to treat her guests and answer any questions they may have. My wife and I cannot wait to book this place again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place. Very well kept. Great communication with the owner.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"My girlfriend and I stayed here on our way from Chicago to Florida for a little mountain getaway in the middle of our road trip, and we had an amazing experience. The different amenities were awesome and we were able to drive not even 30 minutes to get into downtown Gatlinburg. During our stay the power went out in almost all of Sieverville for the night, and Christina was extremely understanding of our situation and gave us a generous refund. Great space and great area!! Will definitely come back."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Simply amazing property! Christina is a great host who is very responsive and polite! The cabin is very cozy and well equipped. The outside amenities make you not want to be inside! My girlfriend and I were there 2 nights and didn't even get to use the theatre room bc the hot tub/fountain/views were just amazing. Watching the sunrise from the amazing sauna and the sunset by the fountain. Just wow! We will absolutely be coming back to stay here! The town is very fun and it's not a far drive from other locations.
Amazing trip made better with this amazing cabin!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Christina is awesome and so is her property. This was a much needed getaway for my fiancé and I. Everything was clean and comfortable. She is very accommodating and the view alone is worth the stay. Will definitely be coming back.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was awesome. Christina was responsive and making sure we had everything there. The curves on the road are little sharp but it’s gonna be worth it once you get to the top. Apart from that, try to not stay outside after 12 or so. I got to say hi to the bear around 12:30 am. But it’s not recommended. Thank you for the great stay Christina."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,It was amazing! We enjoyed the hot tub the most! It wasn’t far from Gatlinburg and was in such a perfect spot with an amazing view!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, all the amenities here were awesome, views were great, Christina was a great host. The theatre room was our favorite & the house was very homie. We would definitely stay again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a truly stunning and cant wait to get back for a longer stay!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful views, plenty of cabin amenities, and very responsive hosts!
From the moment we requested the booking, Christina acted professional and polite. Once she found out prior to our stay that we were bringing our little ones, she notified us that she proactively supplied bean bag chairs within the movie theater room so not only can my wife and I sit in there but the kids can comfortably too. This was such a thoughtful gesture and that only started her fantastic hosting experience!
The cabin was fairly clean (maybe needed some extra dusting), organized, and just felt like a home away from home. The views are unbelievable and the outside amenities allow for plenty of relaxation. Inside the cabin there was plenty of space for my family of 4. We were provided a complimentary ""welcome basket"" and even robes were provided to be used when going in the sauna! Talk about resort-style treatment!
We look forward to booking this location again in the future but for more than one night!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Christina was a fabulous host! I wanted somewhere special for my wife's 50th and this place delivered! 5 star service and accommodations. Christina was extremely responsive and every need was met. My wife loved it! Thanks Christina for helping make her 50th so memorable!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property was exactly as described. Set in a private, serene spot, this was exactly what was prescribed for our four-day stay.
Christina was so responsive and friendly. It felt like we had met a long-term friend.
The amenities were incredible--Movie barn, hot tub, sauna, firepit with a swinging seat, private pond, and decking that went on forever. The king-size bed was so comfortable! The fully-equilped kitchen had every utnesil, pan, spice, etc. All three tv's were Rokus and were guest check in with a departure date so we didn't have to remove all of our personal info. (Very convenient!)
We only ventured out to Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg only twice. A full day of rainy weather left us with plenty
to do on the property--especially a movie room marathon! (The Dolby sound bar, a 75"" Roku tv, acoustic walls and theater seats called for the popcorn!)
Oh the beautiful views!
It was so difficult to pack up and leave! We are planning on booking another stay next year"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying here! There was so much do to around the cabin that we had a hard time leaving to explore! We will definitely be returning.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was truly one of a kind. The movie theater, the hot tub, the beautiful view with the swing! it’s just everything you could ask for and more. Me and my boyfriend were looking for a way to have a vacation but also connect this was exactly what we needed. This place is a treasure nothing compares! we stayed for 3 nights and it was so relaxing. Christina was always checking in and making sure our stay was perfect! thank you again will be back soon!! ❤️"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A Retreat it was!!! This cabin was absolutely beautiful! From the peaceful pond, to the gorgeous views, I didn’t even want to leave. Christina was very responsive to any questions and checked in daily. So happy to have found this gem. I will be booking again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Christina and Robert were fantastic! Even though I only had a short stay, they checked in with me multiple times to make sure everything was going good and there was no issues.
And just as importantly the property itself was immaculate. The inside was very clean and had everything we needed to make a nice steak dinner. Swinging in front of the fire pit at night and looking off at the mountains was an amazing memory to make, the theatre room was cozy and felt like an actual intimate theatre… and standing on the bridge listening to the crickets by pond at night was super relaxing. Looking forward to staying again soon.
If you’re on the fence about staying here over another spot like I was, I’d definitely recommend going with Christina and Bobby’s place!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a beautiful home! Perfect for a romantic getaway! Felt like we were on top of the world while we were in the hot tub, looking at the moon and stars.
Christina was an awesome host. Very responsive to all our questions."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place!! I fell in love with this place as soon as I pulled in the driveway. Peaceful and the scenery is breathtaking. I’ll definitely come back here; with every chance I get. Christina was on point with questions I need in a timely manner. She was just sweet ever since I booked her place. Don’t think twice about it. Book the spot!! I promise you, you won’t regret it ;)"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice place! The kids loved the pool, and I loved hanging on the porch!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"""Thank you, Samuel, for welcoming us into your wonderful home. The house was fantastic and spotlessly clean. We had an amazing time and will absolutely recommend your place as the top choice for accommodation. The indoor pool was a fantastic addition, providing a perfect way to relax in the evenings after enjoying the hot tub. A truly five-star experience!"""
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This stay was perfect the home was beautiful and super clean! The pool was so nice and relaxing. Sam was always responsive when we reached out the propane tank was out and we had a new one by the end of the day to enjoy the fire on the deck! We also had a run in with a bear on the front porch getting into the trash lol it was super cool! When we reached out to Sam to let him know he was super cool about it making sure we were okay first and then letting us know he was installing a cage around the trash, which is a great idea picking up all our trash the next day was not fun, but the one thing I wanted to see on the trip was a bear, which I didn't think was going to happen. So over all our stay here for our little family vacation was a 10 out of 10!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a beautiful home!
It's a peaceful setting within a short driving distance from The Island and tons to do in Pigeon Forge. Samuel responded quickly to any questions we had. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and we'd definitely choose to stay at this property again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Samuels place was super enjoyable! The pool was the best part, it’s nice and heated and just the right amount of room to swim around. The bedrooms were great and the views were fantastic."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,nice cabin great host
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had an amazing week at Michael's place! The view was absolutely incredible. The sunrise in the mornings is not to be missed. it was an easy trip to both Gatlinburg and Pigeon forge. We would absolutely stay here again!
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Very good view and fancy ,clean place to stay."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"There were only tiny, minor things that someone might nitpick, but it didn't make it any less worth it to us. The host was very kind and helpful. He was quick to respond to any issues we needed to address. I would definetly recommended this stay to anybody. Even with other houses around, they're staggering up the mountain and it still maintains good privacy. Michael made us feel very welcome."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michael’s Cabin was amazing! The view was breathtaking, and the house was spectacular. Every bathroom was extremely clean, and the bedrooms were as well. We were planning on hiking and enjoying the smoky mountains, but the view was so amazing we ended up spending all our time on the porch or in the hot tub. I cannot recommend this place enough, absolutely coming back in the near future!!!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The view here is truly outstanding, beautiful large windows to gaze upon the majesty of the smokies. Home is in a very quiet area, you can star gaze at night from the decks, house was clean with a very clean hot tub as well. Location is close enough to all major attractions, and can receive food delivery if required. Overall a great experience."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Michael place was phenomenal! We had a very short stay and hated to leave. The view was amazing! Will definitely stay again..
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was the perfect spot for a weekend getaway!
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Great views! Amazing beds! Our family loved this location wasn’t too far from attractions and was sooo peaceful on shell mountain!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I booked last minute and Michael was extremely accommodating. The property is as listed, very clean, comfortable and beautifully decorated. The views are amazing! I loved that he had house rules on the fridge so there was no guessing. There are books, recommendations for things to do and it is just a beautiful property. Michael responds immediately. We only left once because it was so homey. This was for my Husband’s bday and he loved it! I’m sure we’ll visit again. Thanks Michael!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Let’s just say what a fantastic experience!!! Michael was an amazing host the house was beautiful just like the photos! Mountain View was BREATHTAKING! We will definitely be coming back!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The view from the cabin made it hard to want to leave! The house was gorgeous and the views were everything we could have wanted. Michael was quick to address a few small issues we had and went above and beyond to make up for them!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My family and I had an absolutely wonderful stay at this cabin. The cleanliness was impeccable, creating a comfortable and inviting atmosphere. The host was fantastic - friendly, responsive, and always ready to help, which greatly enhanced our overall experience. The cabin’s location was also a major plus. It was conveniently accessible, making our travels smooth and hassle-free. One of the highlights of our stay was undoubtedly the amazing views. The breathtaking scenery added a special touch to our trip, making it even more memorable. I would highly recommend this cabin to any family looking for an unforgettable getaway. Five stars all around!”"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a wonderful spot with a wonderful view with a great host. Michael was on top of things, the battery was getting low on the door lock and he ordered replacements before we knew it was even getting low. No time wasted, he lives up to the 5 star ratings. The cabin was cozy, not huge but elegant and the view is wonderful."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything about the cabin was amazing!! The view was breathtaking day and night! Exceptionally clean and it even smells great! We loved it, wished could have stayed longer! So worth it!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great trip.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spent a week here with the family for spring break. The drive up was great, little tricky with the last couple of miles going up the mountain, but the view makes it worth it. The house is pretty close to perfect, great for bringing 2 teenage daughters. Each bedroom has it’s own full bathroom, very convenient. Easy drive to Dollywood and Pigeon Forge, but just far enough away that you don’t feel like you’re living in a tourist trap. We had a great week and I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for some peace and quiet but don’t want to be completely in the middle of nowhere."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This house was beautiful and the view was breathtaking! Perfect for our family getaway and party of 6 people! Michael was always very quick to respond and be informative. The drive up to the house is definitely an adventure but totally worth it.Would definitely recommend this property!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! The views were stunning and can’t forget about the fun Pac Man in the basement!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"incredible view, would absolutely return"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place to stay Michael was amazing as well to deal with very responsive will be back
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay; beautiful views of the mountains and very peaceful.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first Airbnb stay , and Michael’s place was nothing short of amazing with a beautiful view . Highly recommend 🖤"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was perfect for our mountain getaway. The location was fantastic as it is close to the areas you want to visit without being too congested. The cabin is secluded without bring in the middle of nowhere where no one would be able to find you or get to you in case of emergency. We used both Uber and Uber eats several times without issue. The views make the stay magical as we were able to wake up and see the sunrise every morning. We also used the hot tub almost every morning which helped me to relax. Later in the day it was nice to sit out on the rocking chairs or in the egg shaped chairs and just relax. Would definitely recommend booking this cabin.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,👍
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"Awesome views, quiet nice gated neighborhood! Pictures match the cabin. I’ll definitely be booking again soon. Hot tub clean, fireplace cozy… The decks could use more lighting so u can sit outside through the night but truly this cabin had no negatives!! This was a one of a kind experience thank you."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Incredible house with an incredible view and a very kind, responsive host. We will be coming back!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great Host, Beautiful property, Amazing view!!!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great views and beautiful place!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The view is amazing! The home welcoming & comfortable. We enjoyed our stay here so much!!!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was exactly as described and seen in the pictures. So cozy and private. Very beautiful sunset and sunrise views. I chose the perfect week of January because it started snowing since the very first day we arrived. Mid-January is the right time to go. Even took advantage of the hot-tub while snowing 😅
Michael was great. Very friendly and communicative. We forgot an item after we left and he immediately got in touch with us.
This has been one of the best vacations for me and my family."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a beautiful view and cozy home for our yearly family vacation!
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"We had a wonderful time here. The view is breathtaking and cannot be beat. We spent most of our time enjoying the hot tub and the view at all hours of the day and night. It was peaceful and the perfect spot for 3 couples to stay. We really appreciated that each bedroom has its own private bathroom. Our babies enjoyed both living room spaces to spread out and play. Couldn’t love this place more, will definitely be back!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic two night stay! Probably the best view of the Smokies that you can find. We especially enjoyed watching the sunrise from the hot tub on the bottom deck. If you're looking for a romantic getaway or a place to stay with the family that's with in 30 minutes of everything Gatlinburg, Pegion Forge, or Sevierville has to offer, I would highly recommend staying here! Great views, awesome amenities, clean and modern, spacious and comfortable!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice very clean cabin coincided with what was perfect to spend a few beautiful days with the 100% recommended sunrise view of the 100% recommended sunrise
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great views , nice beds, and fun space. Definitely perfect for a small family trip"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Michael is a proactive and communicative host. We were hosting an early family Christmas and leading up to the date, I had several questions. Michael answered each one in less than 30 minutes. As my check in approached, Michael was very attentive with the questions I had. This place is perfect for families or multiple couples looking for individual suites. The downstairs family room was perfect for gathering together or for some separate quiet time. We found it easy to still gather and spend time without waking a sleeping toddler downstairs. The hot tub was a bonus and if nothing else, come for the million dollar view. It’s probably best view on the mountain."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Witness something Majestic! checked off the bucket list!! what AMAZING Views!! outstanding communication with Michael. We loved it here!! Book your Smokey Mountains vacay here! you won't dissapointed!!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at Michael’s cabin! The place was exactly as described. The upstairs sitting room with the vaulted ceiling and floor-to-ceiling windows provided a great, warm space to relax and take in the view. The wrap around upper deck had a lot of space to enjoy the view outdoors with the family. The cabin had everything you needed to load up on groceries and enjoy your stay without having to leave."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful time here and really enjoyed the views!! With two small kids we had plenty of room to spread out and relax. And we skipped some of the local attractions since I’m certain our view was even better at our air bnb! We would enjoy coming back again. The host was very helpful and responsive whenever we needed anything. We could reach most activities within 30 mins.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful Stay! Best view, Cabin is situated in the center over looking the mountains and valley. Could not ask for more..🙏"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean and comfortable house with a magnificent view!
The swing chairs and hot tub make the stay extra fun.
This place makes a wonderful spot for a retreat from the busy world."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice modern cabin with an amazing view. Extremly responsive host.
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"Loved every part of our stay. Michael was truly the BEST HOST. He was responsive and truly went above and beyond to make sure we were attended to. And, the views. I cannot ever put this into words. The floor to ceiling windows in the bedrooms facing the sunrise was amazing. Would absolutely stay again!!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If I could give it 10 stars I would’ve. This home is private, peaceful and clean. If you’re looking for somewhere to decompress in nature this is the spot. The views were spectacular, the bed comfortable, the hot tub delightful. A place I could see myself visiting again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house has unbelievable views from inside and out, the pictures don’t do it justice. The house itself is beautiful and very comfortable. We would love to visit again in the future. Michael was a terrific host."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We stayed for our anniversary and wanted somewhere private but close enough to things to do and this place was great for both of these. Very beautiful property. Beautiful views, loved it! Michael was super responsive if we had questions. We had a small issue but Michael got it taken care of super quickly. This really is an amazing home and we enjoyed our stay. Thank you Michael for sharing your home with us."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,The views were amazing at this property! Michael was easy to communicate with!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful home, beautiful views, enjoyed every moment from relaxing and enjoying the views to relaxing in the hot tub. Michael is an excellent host and is prompt in communication, Will definitely be back and will recommend this vacation rental.
Thank you so much, Michael! Can't say enough good about this stay!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful space and the view was spectacular! It doesn’t get any better than watching the most beautiful sunrise over the mountains from our bed! Absolutely loved being in this home!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was very beautiful and looked exactly liked the pictures. This was a great spot for a girls trip and visiting Dollywood and hiking. Loved the hot tub and everything about this place.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was nothing short of spectacular! The panoramic windows offered a stunning view that we simply couldn't get enough of. The place came with plenty of entertainment options, ensuring we never had a dull moment. Michael was a fantastic host - friendly and always prompt in communication. The highlight of our trip was relaxing in the jacuzzi on the balcony, complemented by comfortable rocking chairs, all while soaking in the breathtaking scenery. Highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful house with a view that did not disappoint. Loved the two living areas, one was perfect for enjoying the breathtaking views and the other perfect for board games and old school video games. Michael was always quick to respond to any of our questions. Would definitely come back to stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The view was amazing.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nestled in the heart of Sevierville, this cabin is the epitome of Tennessee charm and elegance. From the moment you step inside, you're greeted with breathtaking panoramic views of the Smoky Mountains, painting a picturesque backdrop to your stay. The attention to detail in the cabin's design is impeccable, effortlessly blending rustic charm with modern amenities. But what truly sets this place apart is the unparalleled hospitality of the host. Warm, knowledgeable, and always at the ready to ensure your stay is nothing short of perfect. If you're looking for a tranquil escape with a touch of luxury, look no further. This Sevierville gem is an experience in itself! 🌄"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great views. enjoyed our stay.
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,The views are amazing! Literally have stayed in the mountains so many times and have never had these views being above the mountains! The only suggestion I would make is to add more porch lights to the deck because we liked hanging out in the night but it was really dark with the little lighting that was out there. Another minor thing that bothered me was the cleaning crew was there at 9:30 waiting for us to leave (I have horrible anxiety so this could just be a me thing). Other that that we loved the place! We definitely recommend. And loved that it was in a gated community!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great cozy place. Beautiful views
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home and amazing views.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved Michael’s place! The view is indescribable. We stayed during a full Harvest moon and had incredible skylines both day and night from every room of the house and the hot tub. The area is quiet but a perfect distance from the National Park and the attractions of Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge. Super clean and bright with all the amenities you need for cooking meals and R&R. Michael is an incredibly responsive and amenable host, we will 10/10 be back to stay at his place soon! Thanks again Michael!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was by far my favorite place I've ever stayed in over a decade of using airbnb. This was a peaceful spot for our anniversary celebration - we wanted beautiful views and a tranquil spot to rejuvenate after how heavy work has been the past few months. This place is beyond perfect - we literally skipped some of the attractions nearby to optimize our time at this beautiful spot. The place by the way was absolutely spotless. We have a shoeless household at home, we did the same as soon as we got to the house and the floors along with everything else was super clean. We ended up getting a mobile massage which a team of two massage therapists showed up and set up their tables on the wrap around porch - it made for the best massage imaginable, with fresh and cool mountain air rolling over us the whole 90 minutes. I took what seems like 100 photos, none of which can do this spot justice. We loved it so much we chatted about moving - and we also sent the listing to our families and friends."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place amazing views!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This destination is to die for, the views, the peace I HATED TO LEEAVE! Michael was very responsive and helpful cant wait to visit again…"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect! The home was beautiful and so was the view. We were looking for a quiet getaway and it was exactly what we wanted ! Michael couldn’t have been more accommodating. We will stay here again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cabin was absolutely beautiful inside and out! The views are gorgeous!!! Will definitely be booking this cabin again in the near future!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place and super clean! Loved the view, amazing stay!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"High in mountains, expect some turns winding-roads on motorcycle, just don’t miss the address and go up the hill as you ride, (beyond the hills become more steep). Dark roads. The views are an exceptional experience. The home is high quality. Good door locks. Felt safe. Extra hall half bath. Good lighting. Queen beds great with nice lights. M-Shower tiny but fine. Nice towels. Kitchen great. (Bring your shampoo and coffee). We had six people, (two were babies ) and it was just perfect, with lots of privacy. As grandparents we loved it…especially the clean Jacuzzi, fantastic views!!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing views, beautiful cabin bright and airy and cozy! It rained both days of our stay but we still had a beautiful view of the mountains."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Great view and nice place to spend time with friend and family, host was very responsive for texts"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Would stay here again in a heart beat! The views were absolutely stunning. During our day runs we always looked forward to getting back to the cabin and the views. The big windows pictured the view no matter where you were on the upper floor. It’s almost one of the best, and most relaxing ways to view the smokies. Hot tub was perfect in the evenings.
The kitchen had everything needed. The place is in a gated community and feels very private even with the next door cabins. 5/5 definitely recommend!
Michael is a great host, very responsive and helpful, and would definitely stay here again!"

Of course all of the basic stuff was good too, Wi-Fi, good locks, HVAC, etc. I also like the location, off the beaten path but a short drive to stores and restaurants. I'll definitely be back."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Michelle's Cabin has been the perfect place for us to stay. She was extremely communicative, friendly, and detailed about every single step during our stay.
I'l try to describe the cabin, but definitely it is something that must be checked in person to appreciate all the details it has.
Just imagine amenities as the highest luxury hotel, and probably we'll have a few more here. What ever you can think of, for sure is there and whatever you forgot even to ask, if it was available, that also will be there. Decoration, amenities, convenience, location ( close to everything), have exceeded all expectations. Having a background in the high luxury hospitality industry, I can tell you that every detail was set thinking not just about the guests convenience, but also to create an experience of each detail. Our kids will remember this experience for their entire lifetime. When we hear at the end of the day ""Mom I want to come back to the cabin"" it means we made the right decision."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Stop scrolling and book this place now! Spotless clean! Everything you need! Perfect for family of 3 or 4. Most comfortable bed we have ever had at an AirBnB. Conveniently located to all the things!

The craftsmanship of the cabin is stunning. The fireplace inside is beautiful. The decor is absolutely adorable and makes the cabin feel just like home. The place was absolutely spotless and the neighborhood is a very quiet, safe place. There were plenty of clean, fluffy towels and wash cloths. Plenty of cute comfy blankets, the bed was very comfy as well. The shower was so relaxing with two different shower heads with plenty of hot water for 3 of us to shower. I loved having two bathrooms as well, very convenient. The kitchen was stocked with more than you would need which is so thoughtful. Most of all we appreciated the kindness of the hosts leaving us toiletries, candy, water, Soda, milk, coffee, hot chocolate, moon pies. So nice!!!!

The best night of sleep I’ve had away from my home, ever. The kitchen is stocked with everything you might need. Having 1.5 bathrooms is great and they are fully stocked too.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Stayed at Tim and Michelle's for my birthday to the Gatlinburg/Pigeon Forge area. While I came by myself with my pup, the space easily accommodates more. Tim and Michelle were very sweet and recognized my birthday, and the cabin looked just like the photos. Dollywood/Dolly Parton's Stampede was an easy 15/20 minute drive away without being surrounded by tourists and rundown lodging that you would find on the strip. While headed to Gatlinburg, I saw another hotel I had seen on here right off the strip just a little less than the cabin, and I am so happy I picked Thirsty Bear Lair. Also, there's a Buc-ees about 35 mins away that is a must do!"

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home, photos don’t do it justice. Enjoyed my stay immensely. Had trouble figuring out how to get into the house.

Looking forward to possibly staying here again in the future."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Had a great stay. Very homey and welcoming place. A nice weekend getaway to relax but still very close to any activities we’re interested it. 10/10 would recommend and definitely plan on staying again.

We didn’t spend much time at the cabin because we were out and about. The location of the cabin is convenient but out of the hustle and bustle of Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge. Short drive to restaurants so it was perfect for us!
If in the area, this is the first place we would look to stay again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay at the cabin. Appreciated all the special touches,especially the tub upstairs which has a whirlpool.

The cabin was beautiful, cozy, and exactly what we needed to enjoy the holiday after a rapid trip through nearby Dollywood/Pigeon Forge. We would absolutely recommend anyone visit with Ron and Sheilah and enjoy this gem in Sevierville. Thank you so much for the memories."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had such an amazing stay and felt right at home. The cabin is cozy. We made breakfast and enjoyed movies.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,I would highly recommend this home! It was exactly what we needed. Close enough where you can get to things fairly quickly but remote enough to feel like your miles away from anything.. a perfect mix.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home with a well-stocked kitchen, plenty of space and lots of amenities. A great, jumping off point for many different things in the smoky mountains. Very peaceful and relaxing. The kitchen was so great for making meals to save a little money."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You can tell when a host truly cares about the guest experience, and Ron and Sheilah do. At the end of our stay, they asked if we had feedback to improve the experience. This cabin is cozy, with friendly thoughtful touches like a s’mores basket and bath products if you decide to soak in the tub. It is clean and well-maintained. The beds and linens were very comfortable, as was all the furniture.
Now, if you want to be in the thick of nightlife, this location is not for you. However, if you prefer a peaceful country setting, you’ll love this. We found we could get to stores, restaurants, etc in about 20 minutes and enjoyed being away from the hubbub. We would definitely consider a repeat stay if we return to the area."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at Ron and Sheila's cottage.
Everything was fine and the cottage had all the amenities one would need for a getaway.
Ron and Sheila were very responsive and we wish them all the very best with their Airbnb venture."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome location, very quiet and private. The cabin was clean and Ron and Sheila were quick to respond to any concerns/questions i had. Would book from them again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay. Loved this cabin!!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great host. would recommend them. look forward to staying there again
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were there for a volleyball tournament and ended up falling in love with the cabin, Severville and having a Blast. Place was spotless as described. Clear instructions on how to get in. Easy to find and a minimum 10-15 min drive to all major attractions in the area. We even joked that we interrupted our mini vacay for a volleyball tournament. The girls had a blast making s’mores…oh and try Ron & Sheila’s daughter s’mores recipe you wont regret it. Hope to come back one day."
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, we enjoyed our stay at this lovely cabin located just far enough out of town to feel secluded but close enough to feel like we could easily get to everything that Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge had to offer! Communication was good.
We had two concerns that kept us from giving a four-star review:
1) Cleanliness: we found a buildup of soap scum in both the upstairs tub and in the downstairs shower. I was able to remove some of it by simply wiping it down, so it looked to be an addressable issue.
2) Paper products: we did not find any paper towels, and the toilet paper provided was one-ply toilet paper. We wish we had known these things (especially the lack of paper towels) prior to our arrival so we could have brought some!
We would recommend this cabin as a good value, great location, and a cozy spot to spend time in the Smokies, but there was a little room for improvement here!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location close to attractions with privacy.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time, the cabin is perfect, and we definitely hope to come back soon!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"this cabin provided all the comforts of home, the hosts are wonderful, very responsive and friendly! we thoroughly enjoyed our time here with all the area has to offer and the cabin alike!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a perfect cabin! Very quiet and we felt at home.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very clean cozy little cabin. Nice and quiet at night and not too far from pigeon forge/gatlinburg. Ron & Sheila were very helpful and responsive when I had questions. Great stay.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice cabin. Far enough in the country that it was quiet but close enough to town that it was quick and easy to get to restaurants, stores, and activities"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So thankful for the extras provided! The cabin had the feeling of God’s presence inside, very relaxing!!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay and very welcoming hosts! Loved everything about the cabin and it was perfect for our stay!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was better than the pictures. It was decorated for Christmas because we booked during the winter time. The loft is very spacious and the jacuzzi was very nice and relaxing. The location is just a few minutes away from Pigeon Forge. In the listing the hosts tell you there may be some bugs found in the cabin. All we saw was ladybugs, which in my opinion, is not a concern."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at Ron and Sheilah’s Cabin. The cabin is very peaceful and in a great location. The hosts are very responsive and helpful, plus the s’mores supplies that they provided were a hit. Staying here was one of the best parts of our vacation. We definitely plan to stay again!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely great place. Took my mom for a little vacation in the mountains and this cabin was great. It was away from the hustle and bustle but close enough to drive into town for fun. Everything was exactly how it was described to me and I would definitely do this again. Thank you for a wonderful experience.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I highly recommend this place!!! We enjoy our staying.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay at Ron and Sheilah’s place. Everything was clean and comfortable.
2022-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Ron and Sheila were wonderful hosts and we would recommend this cabin. We appreciated the open communication and ease of check in/out. We also really enjoyed the access to laundry facilities. The only comment we have is that the deck/main entrance to the cabin was extremely concerning for us. The surface was uneven and the posts appear to be dry rotting, and just from the looks - the structural integrity of it seems to be compromised. This would not be something we’d consider a major issue, but since it is the main entrance to the cabin, we felt the need to comment on it at the least because it’s more than showing it’s age as stated in the description."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet, clean and cozy!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was wonderful! The place had a great location and appearance. Ron and Sheilah did a good job at making sure we had a memorable honeymoon stay. Would definitelystay again!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely home in a very convenient area. Shopping and things to do within a very short drive. Hosts were very easy to reach and all things in the home were exactly as described in the listing.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little cabin nice quite location
Everything was clean and the cabin was decorated so sweet."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have now stayed at both of Ron And Sheilah's cabins. Was not disappointed again. Two great places. Hard to choose. They are great hosts.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice cabin away from the traffic and crowds of town, but close enough to get to anything within 15 minutes. We enjoyed the firepit and the S'mores kit left by the host."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a gorgeous place in a gorgeous part of the world. Well equipped, super comfortable lounge area and beds. AC worked well. Have to bring your own detergent for washing machine. The stuff for smores was a nice touch."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Overalla great experience in a beautiful cabin. There were only a few minor things like dirty dishes in the cabinet and the floors were dirty. If you're looking for a cabin this would be my go to cabin.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,The cabin was nice and met the needs of our family of 4. The cabin is in a quiet neighborhood in the country and is reasonably close to the National Park and tourist activities in Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The cabin is very near Pigeon forge attractions but also on a secluded enough for privacy. The cabin was very well stocked with essentials for the stay as well as if you want to cook. The hosts communicated things ahead of time and we had no problems reaching them.
We had a great stay and will definitely recommend the place."
2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,A clean cabin good for a small number of guests
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is as sweet as its name, amazing to stay there. Everything you need is inside and Ron and Sheila are really super hosts, they are welcoming their guests as a family member. We can recommend this place to everyone! It is in a good place from where you can explore the nature as well as the cities."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cabin was super clean and set up well. Several amenities were available to make our visit more comfortable there . The hosts did a great job communicating and preparing the cabin. This is a perfect place to relax and feel at home !

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin is great! It was clean and in a nice location. Ron and Sheilah are great hosts. They always responded quickly to any questions I had.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was very clean and the location is very quiet. The cabin was stocked with all the amenities to make your stay wonderful, down to the deck of Uno cards.
Dishes, sheets, towels, were all supplied as stated. Check and check out was easy ."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking for a place to stay that's super close to town without being around a lot of people, this is it! It's perfect in that you can make it to Sevierville or Pigeon Forge so quickly but not feel like you're in the middle of town. It's a perfect and cozy cabin that was more than enough room for all four of us adults. It has all of the comforts of home and is definitely a hidden gem."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great place to stay!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Owners were very accommodating and quick to respond to questions or concerns. Peaceful location. We enjoyed our stay and would gladly recommend to other friends and family.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We can't rate this residence high enough! Every aspect of this stay greatly exceeded our expectations and the hosts went way beyond their call to accommodate us in light of our late arrival. Leaving this review, I feel like our family not only had a memorable experience, but also gained friends in the process!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a perfect space! Everything is exactly as described and instructions on checking in/out were clear and easy! Ron and Sheilah provided a clean, cozy and welcoming space with so many little details that make it feel like home! We will absolutely be booking again when we head back to TN!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great cabin in a convenient location. Everything was clean and comfortable.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed the cozy, comfortable cabin for two nights. We were traveling home from Florida to Michigan. It was a great location… away from the city but close enough to explore new restaurants and spend time in the Smoky Mountains."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Not our first stay and probably not our last either! Cozy and clean space, not far from town, with all the comforts of home and then some!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing host - cabin was great and location was perfect
2022-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"10/10 experience! Cabin was beautiful, well stocked, and hosts were amazing! There was a wild fire nearby while we were there and they communicated regular updates and kept us informed. Great location, close to tons of attractions but out in the country. We would definitely recommend it!!!"
2022-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay and hope to book some time there again soon! Thank you, again!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great time. The cabin was everything we wanted for our vacation.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,They offered a nice stay that felt as if we were at home. It was a great stay and I would recommend it to anyone.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a lovely cabin! Ron and Sheilah thought of everything! A lot of personal touches throughout! We couldn’t have asked for a nicer place to get away for the weekend! Location is perfect…away from the hustle and bustle, yet close enough to restaurants, shopping, etc! Quick drive to Smokey Mountain National park, Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg!
They were very easy to get in touch with and answered any questions quickly! Would definitely recommend to my friends and family! Hope to visit again soon!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and I stayed here and I t’s very cozy and has everything you can need. Farther away from Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg but at most a 30 minute drive and was perfect for us.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ron and Sheilah were great hosts! My boyfriend and I loved the cabin and the location it was at. We also appreciated the privacy. We appreciated the welcome sign with our names on it! It made us feel really special and we loved that about the place. Everything was perfect for us and the kitchen was nice for us to cook a meal and some snacks 😊 we hopefully will be back asap!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very humble hosts! The cabin has anything you’d need for a convenient stay. We weren’t sure what to expect but it by far exceeded our expectations, it felt like we were staying with a family member, without the drama! Within 15 minutes from town, not nearly as scary a drive as we thought either. Don’t let the driveway intimidate you, that gravel gives you perfect traction, a couple bumps never hurt anyone lol, I drive a little sedan and she did great! Very informative summary and manual when you book; left us with little to no questions to ask, but Sheila was still very communicative, making sure we were all set, while still giving us privacy. Very sweet and friendly touches were added too, we had a little s’mores basket and a bubble bath basket, along with little notes and pointers around the cabin. We really enjoyed the loft, and felt like kids again! Highly recommend. :)"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was just a described.
They left us a cute welcome gift and personalized board, we felt right at home.
We loved the cabin, it was clean and well stocked.
We would definitely come back again.
Host was very nice and responsive."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is absolutely wonderful! Ron and Sheilah were very helpful, and communicative about our stay!
Definitely will recommend to our friends and family 😊"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect stay! It was very personalized and they went above and beyond to ensure comfort. It was very close to everything. Would highly suggest!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,thank yall so much for letteing us stay there cant wait to b back
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything here is just perfect, from the awesome value to the energy of the land. Very cozy and quiet."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a lovely cabin! Great location- out of town but convenient drive to anything you would need! All you need to know is on the listing! Clean and very comfortable! We look forward to visiting again!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice, comfy, & clean place to stay, 10/10 . Had everything we thought we needed . Everything was in a good driving range 15-30 mins, depending on where you would like to go. Communication was great, everything was set up so nicely . Made my experience so much better ."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"An absolutely wonderful stay. The cabin was very thoughtfully put together and we had everything we needed! Ron and Sheilah went above and beyond with little touches and treats around the house, and things that made us feel at home. 11/10."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was absolutely beautiful. Ron and Sheilah are very communicative during the process and helpful with any needs you may have. Definitely look forward to staying again.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ron and Sheilah's cabin was great for our first trip to Tennessee. It looks just like the pictures and makes you feel at home. Communication was great and we received helpful tips while preparing for the trip. I highly recommend staying here, whether you want to go out and explore town or just stay in and relax."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice cabin. Form the s’mores to the mints on the pillows, the owner’s hospitality was amazing."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a great place. It felt like home. Loved the s’mores and the fire pit. The tranquillity of the space was amazing. It felt like God met us there. We want to come back again.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great crash pad while in town for an event. It was extremely well stocked- most cabins you are hard pressed to actually be able to cook in (ask me how I know 🙄) but this had everything I could need! The location is fabulous. one od the best locations we've had in many years of coming to town. Just a really quick zip into town! We will be back for sure!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,The cabin was amazing and would recommend it to anyone? We would definitely rent again.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An amazing experience. The cabin was warm, cozy, accessible and clean. Provided lots of amenities to make it an enjoyable stay. Everything was working in perfect condition. It was everything that was expected and more. The hosts maintained great communication, a great escape to take for vacation or visiting."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the cabin, location, and how well stocked the cabin was. We have never stayed anywhere that had supplied any little item that one might have forgotten to bring. We will stay here again! We especially loved the thoughtful smores basket that was provided. It made us very sad that the night we were going to enjoy them, it rained. My only comment is if you are a coffee smob like myself, you might want to bring your Keurig. Other than that, it met our needs and we loved our stay."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay. Clean cabin, easy to communicate with host, cabin is in a great location being close to the local attractions."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, not far from town alot of things to do around."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a beautiful cabin. The main open area was very spacious and well furnished and decorated. The kitchen was well stocked. I was impressed that they had all the makings for smores on the kitchen table and had a bottle of sparking juice for our anniversary. The bathrooms had everything you needed with large bottles of shampoos, conditioners, etc. The Jacuzzi had a basket with salts and other stuff to help you enjoy the experience more. A great place to stay, but you really need to stay more than overnight to truly appreciate all that the cabin offers. There is even a stocked firepit for a bonfire outside."
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I overall enjoyed my stay here. The cabin was clean and comfortable. It was close to pigeon forge and many places to eat. The negatives were the pillows were thin. Really thin. The TV is small. You probably won’t spend too much time watching it anyway, but if you plan to, be forewarned it’s a bit dated. Also I couldn’t get the coffee maker working and ended up just buying some instant coffee."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Their cabin is gorgeous and it’s in the perfect little spot away from the city. We really enjoyed the hospitality in the thoughtfulness of our hosts! We would love to come back and stay again.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,The hosts were very accommodating. Great and fast communication. The cabin was delightful. Beds were comfortable after a long day of motorcycling. It was great to be able to have a steak on the grill. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
2021-09-01,4,Group trip,"The cabin is beautiful. Aged in places but beautiful. We did have an issue on the first night but Ron & Sheila were quick to respond. There were nice little touches like the basket of S’mores and the chocolates on the pillows. We loved the decor. The downstairs bed was very comfy. The upstairs was a little less so but still nice. There’s no tv in the living room. The one tv is in the downstairs bedroom so keep that in mind if you are with a big group. The sun is on the front side of the house during the hottest part of the day so it can get a little warm because if all the beautiful windows, especially if you’ve been gone all day and have to turn the ac up as requested. The downstairs bathroom is the only one with a shower, which is fine, except it’s in the downstairs bedroom. So if your with a mixed group and people shower early in the morning or later in the evening, just keep that in mind. The water pressure was great though. Be careful on the inside stairs and the outside steps. Both can be a little slippery, as is posted. The cabin is on backroads but still very close to town. So you’re just far enough away to get the mountain experience but not so far that you can’t run out if you need something and be back in 30 minutes. Overall, this was a very nice place to stay. We enjoyed our time there."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place to stay we cant wait for a return visit
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is perfect! Clean, convenient to town, the hosts are great at communicating and the set up is perfect for a family. The hosts are great at communicating. We arrived earlier than expected and the hosts got us in upon arrival. You won’t regret this stay!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The cabin was very well supplied, clean, and a lot of fun. I would stay with them again.
The road to get there was a bit hard for someone who gets car sick easily, but I would still recommend them."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,The cabin was very clean and a delight to be in. Perfect distance out away from the city but close enough it didn't take too long to get to the Hussle and bustle of tourist attractions. Sheilah left thoughtful little extras for us in the cabin. My husband travels for a living and it's difficult to impress him. He was extremely impressed and pleased with our message from Sheilah that the cabin was ready early and also that the water was drinkable straight from the faucet. Both of which almost never happen. We will most definitely return if we are ever in the area again!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This cabin is cute and is a great stay. My fiancé and I visited for a night and it was so worth it, I wish we had been able to stay longer. There’s amazing personal touches and we felt right at home when we entered. We loved the sweet treats they provided and the great location. We would love to come back again and will be letting our friends know about this cute place."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute comfy cabin with lots of personal touches, and the fire pit was a bonus. We had a great time."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thank you for all the little extras. The cabin was very welcoming 😀
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time meeting up with friends at Ron and Sheilah's place and spent a few days hiking together in the Great Smoky Mountain National Park which is about a half hour's drive from the cabin. The cabin is airy and spacious and is perfect for a family or two couples. The setting is quiet and scenic. The hosts respond quickly to any questions. The amenities provide all the comforts of home. Wonderful experience. We would stay there again.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A cute cabin off the beaten path but yet still close to all the attractions. The kisses on the pillows, the smores kit on the table and the welcome sign were all nice touches to make sure we felt at home. Everything was clean and we didn't need much other than a few groceries. Everything else was readily available. My 2 kids had so much fun that they hated to leave. We will definitely be back again soon!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,
2021-07-01,3,Stayed with kids,"The cabin is cozy. It needs a little TLC, which the owners reported in the details. The one thing they did not report was the A/C can not keep up in the evenings. We left the Cabin in the morning with thermostat set on 70, came back at 5:00 and the thermostat was put to 77 (nobody in our family set it that high, so we figured someone came in and raised it while we were out) the temperature in the cabin when we returned from our excursions at 5pm was at 86 degrees. At 10:45 PM the temperature was at 75 degrees. Made for a long night. Supper was not cooked. If you don’t mind these conditions, this Cabin is for you. Book it and enjoy your stay!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A very beautiful cabin right near the greatest tourist attractions. Had an amazing stay with nice cozy comfort. Ron and Sheilah were amazing and kind. Very understanding. This is definitely the cabin you want to stay at while visiting Tennessee discovering Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge
2021-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Quiet area away from high traffic areas and tourist areas.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place, clean, perfect peaceful location, not too far from all the fun. We will love to stay there again!"
2021-06-01,4,Group trip,"Great retreat from busy days in Gatlinburg! Surrounded by nature and peace and quiet. Comfortable beds, clean, and well-stocked kitchen. If you’re looking for a cabin with cozy homey touches (like s’mores supplies), this is the place! It is about a 37 minute drive to Gatlinburg without traffic, but if you leave later in the morning, the drive may take up to an hour. If driving time isn’t a concern, this is a great place for the family to stay."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location. The cabin is super cute too.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,this was a great place and sheliah and Ron were so easy and quick to communicate. the drive was nice and away from everything yet minutes away from everything. my family and I both really enjoyed it!
2021-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,This cabin was a great experience it was very cozy and a nice get away for a couple days will definitely like to back
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was beautiful, clean, and the owners included some lovely kind extras. The downsides were the high cleaning fee added to the cost, and the upstairs loft remained quite hot all night. However we had a nice time!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Was far enough out to feel cozy in the woods but still pretty close to town & attractions at the same time. My six year old loved finding chocolates on his pillow & staying upstairs in the loft. Overall it was a great place to stay!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thanks for the stay! We had a great time! Hopefully we'll be back next year!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Highly recommend, a very convenient drive to Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge. You also get the cabin in the woods experience too. We will definitely stay again."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Everything was perfect and I could not have asked for more! The house is exactly as it is described. Quiet area close to everything that you would want to do there.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very comfortable home with easy check-in & responsive hosts.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great! Very clean and comfortable! We enjoyed the quiet area the cabin was located in and the yard space so my husband and 5 year old could practice baseball in the evenings while I strolled with our 2 year old.
2021-05-01,3,Stayed with kids,"The cabin is cute, definitely in need of repairs. I would not stay again for the simple fact of how strange/difficult it was to book. We reserved this cabin, money came out of my bank account and we received an email that it was non refundable which we knew and were okay with. After that we got multiple emails from the owners requiring us to give them detailed explanations of who is staying, why, when we would be in and out and they wanted copies of government issued photo IDs. I felt that I had to comply bc it was non refundable and I didn’t want to just be out all the money we paid. I have never had such an issue booking an air bnb. They did allow us to check in early and the house is in a good location. But I found the emails disturbing not to mention when I stopped answering them the owners oddly enough needed to stop by and get something from the house while we were there. Very very strange but ifyou don’t mind being watched and giving your life story it could be a good place to stay."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at the cabin! Ron and Sheilah were great at communicating with us from booking to check out. The cabin was actually cuter in person. We appreciated all of the personalized touches, such as our names on a chalk board welcoming us, to the cute little smores kit. It was far enough out to enjoy the countryside, but only 15 mins to Pigeon Forge. Overall a great experience!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cute place to stay and great hosts!!
2021-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,Sweet little cabin off the beaten path out of the hussle and bustle. Our family enjoyed it very much!
2021-05-01,3,Stayed about a week,"You get what you pay for. It was not cleaned before we checked in. Plastic plates, was not cleaned properly, leftovers in the freezer from another guest, extremely dusty, & holes in the sheets. Will not book here again."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My two friends and I stayed here so that we could hike at the national park and enjoy some of the touristy things in Gatlinburg and we were able to do both from this location. We loved the personal touches from Ron and Sheilah that truly made us feel welcome. It really did feel like we were part of the family. The kitchen was fully stocked and there was everything that we needed. We even picked up some firewood from town and enjoyed a bonfire one night. This may be my favorite AirBnb that I’ve ever stayed at!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,As expected no complaints.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a nice quiet cabin, but close enough to the attractions. We really loved our time at the cabin, and enjoyed the fire pit. The beds are comfortable and the cabin has everything you need."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great house right in the middle of pigeon forge and Gatlinburg burg beautiful scenery
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ron and Sheilah were excellent! Communication was great, location was close to town, and the description of the property is accurate. Driveway is steep and gravel as expected. Little outdoor fire pit was nice, even though we didn't use it. The welcome basket of s'mores was also a very nice touch! Plenty of creature comforts to make your cabin stay a little easier without having to go to the grocery store for every little thing like spices, coffee filters, laundry soap, bathroom soaps and shampoos, and things of that nature. If we are looking for a place to stay in the area again, we will definitely keep Ron and Sheilah in mind!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A cute welcome sign with all of our names on it.. And a little snack to make s’mores
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A wonderful place to stay at the end of the day, while exploring East Tennessee."

2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Clean, comfortable and all of the amenities you would like to have. We also enjoyed the personal decor."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ron and Sheila’s cabin was very welcoming and beautiful. They even left Treats, and a s’mores kit for us to use at the cabins fire pit. Over all I think tho cabin was so good for the price and was just lovely to stay at!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Love this cabin! We stayed while on a family road trip headed to the coast. It was a great place to stop and rest and play, we wish we could have stayed longer than just one night! My kids loved the big jetted tub. We loved the big windows and how cozy it all was."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was perfect! When we walked in we were greeted by a personalized sign giving us a warm welcome into their home! It smelled fantastic due to the oil warmer. The house was well kept and lit up by strands of Christmas lights. Unfortunately, we didn’t get to try the big tub. But, it was definitely enticing! It’s a cozy, homey cabin that we wouldn’t hesitate to come back to!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was so amazing thanks to Ron and Sheilah for making it that way. Leaving cute little family traditions for us to try such as their own s’mores styles. They provided little snacks! The house was nice and clean, it was absolutely beautiful. We enjoyed it so much and hopefully next year when we come back, we can stay again!"

A plate of cookies, Valentine's flowers, lights, tree, chocolate kisses on the pillows, and much more made our experience unforgettable. The cabin is clean, cozy, and quiet. Everything that we wanted for our weekend getaway. We can't wait to go back and stay again."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Ron and Sheilah’s cabin was phenomenal. The location is prime - it is out in the country away from everything, however, you can get to key locations in only a few minutes. Not only was their cabin beautiful, clean, and cozy, but Ron and Sheilah were amazing hosts. They went out of their way to provide special touches in the cabin, they allowed us to check-in early, and they were even willing to allow us to check out late if we wanted to. My wife and I had a wonderful weekend and would love to return in the future!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful cabin! Has a woodsy, rustic decor that is cozy, warm and beautiful. The cabin was impeccably clean and was furnished with nice touches.

2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely cabin about 30 minutes from Gatlinburg. Hosts are very responsive and hospitable. We felt very welcome.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Far and away better than expected. This cabin is all we wanted and more. A short, 10 minute trip into the heart of Pigeon Forge, but seems to be a mlion miles removed.
Every detail was attended to and the personal touches put this place over the top. We will be back. We didn't experience any problems but did have to contact the hosts, and their response was immediate.
Clean and very well furnished, and the downstairs bed is AMAZING to sleep on."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,We would highly recommend. The cabin was probably one of the cleanest places we have ever stayed in while on vacation. Also all the little things that was done to make us feel welcome like the s’mores basket and cookies and also my kids loved the chocolates on the bed. We look forward to staying there in the future. We also loved that you aren’t right in the middle of town...it was so peaceful and quiet.

2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Sheilah did such a great job with little personal touches. She had a little
S’mores basket for us (with a family tradition of icing in lieu of chocolate bar), our names on a chalkboard, and fresh baked bread. Cabin was spotless and felt very homelike. Would def stay again!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My friend and I embarked on a short three day getaway to go to a Zach Bryan concert. Once we arrived at the cabin we were in awe. The surrounding nature took our breath away and the house was beautiful. We loved it so much we contemplated if we actually even wanted to attend the concert where we had pit tickets and paid a pretty penny! We will definitely be visiting again with family! Thanks for being great hosts!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful cabin with a great view. Pictures don’t do it justice! The owners were great communicators and everything was easy to access.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay and would stay here again if we revisit the area. The host was extremely communicative before and during our stay. What we loved most was the quiet beautiful space the home provided while also not being far from the chaos of town if that is what you want. Nearby Townsend provided accessibility to the National Park and had some cute locally owned restaurants. The cabin had everything we needed to make it feel like home, including very comfortable beds! We will miss having morning coffee along the creek on the very expansive deck."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Stephanie was very responsive whenever we had questions. The cabin was clean and matched the descriptions listing, we would stay again. No concerns"

The deck and creek out back are breathtaking and we will definitely return!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,I can’t even begin with how beautiful this home is. It was so cozy and really felt like home. Our favorite was the sound of the river behind the house. It made it sound like rain and just gave us so much peace. The host is so wonderful with responding back. We can’t wait come back.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Creekside! It was beautiful, and Stephanie was always quick to respond. We can’t wait to come back!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was an awesome cabin. Me and my husband really enjoyed our stay. The cabin sits by a creek that’s why we picked this cabin. It was so relaxing to sit on the porch in the rocking chairs and look out at the creek. There’s also a walkway out to the creek with seating on the walkway so you could just sit and look at the beautiful creek. The cabin was very clean and had everything that you could need. It’s a secluded and romantic setting. You will definitely enjoy your stay at the cabin and will want to come back again. Stephanie was an excellent host.
