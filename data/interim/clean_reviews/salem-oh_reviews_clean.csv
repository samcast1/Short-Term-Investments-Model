2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house is beautiful and tucked away in it's own serene environment. Very, very peaceful. Our visit included 4 adults and 1 child. There was more than enough room for everyone. Each morning brought hundreds of birds singing to us, and squirrels and bunnies were fun to watch to. The pond was also fun for catch and release fishing, and we enjoyed taking a kayak out as well. Fires in the evening at the fire pit added to our enjoyment and contentment. The property really is amazing. In response to other reviews: it is in the country, but an easy ride back to Salem for anything needed. The water does come from a well but the smell did not bother us in the least and there is a water softener installed. The amenities overall were more than we could have asked for and all agree: we highly recommend staying at The Cove. If we could rate it more than 5 stars, we absolutely would."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect!
You couldn‚Äôt ask for a better host, quick to respond if you needed anything, kind, and helpful. The place was peaceful, restful and immaculate . Definitely a place we will be coming back to. It was just beautiful, I felt right as if I was at home."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"This area is beautiful, and the property was perfect. We loved the pond and the yard."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was our 2nd time staying! We enjoyed it! It snowed this time around so we stayed in most of the time but it was still enjoyable and peaceful!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The best
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and comfortable. Property is lovely and would be great in the summer, with a pavilion and fire pit by a pond. Given the local options near Copeland Oaks, I would certainly stay there again.
Two relatively minor notes: The property has well water, which is not an issue, but they desparately need a better filtration system for the sulphur. The hot water especially smelled terrible. I live in a house with well water, so this is not just an issue of city vs. well. They did have filtered water for drinking through the fridge, which as acceptable, but showers in particular were moderately unpleasant.
The accommodations were relatively sparse and could use a couple of extra blankets/throws for cooler months."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was beautiful and peaceful. Everything we wanted it to be! We enjoyed grilling out and using the fire pit. The house was clean and spacious and was equipped with everything we needed. We will def stay here again in the future!! Thank you for everything!! üíó
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect place to stay for a visit back to my hometown. My family and I just loved it! It was very clean and had absolutely everything we needed to make our visit perfect. The house was newly updated and the surroundings were beautiful. We enjoyed a campfire and kayaking on the property‚Äôs pond.
We look forward to another stay at this great find!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our host, Justin, was very prompt, kind and attentive.
The home is beautiful, cozy-warm, and has everything we needed for our one week stay. Perfectly located in a private picturesque setting yet close enough to town.

2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay! Wonderful place, very clean and stocked well with the essentials. Rating this 4 stars as we feel there are a few things to note. The house is in a rural area, unfortunately the running water throughout the house is from a well. The water has a very strong sulfur smell when taking showers and washing dishes. We also found the beds were very very firm and uncomfortable. Overall a very nice place, however could be improved in some ways."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great place and hope to be back.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful house and an awesome property with a pond. Great place for the family, would definitely recommend to anyone in the area."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Staying at the cove was an awesome experience, everything was clean and pristine. There was a lot of things to do from relaxing on the beautiful balcony‚Äôs to fishing and kayaking we even did a little swimming in the beautiful pond on the property and in the evening you can relax and make a fire in the pit and roast some s‚Äômores over the fire with the kiddos. Everything inside and outside the home was immaculate very clean organized, and looked wonderful along with the kitchen and bathrooms being stocked with everything you would need for a stay away from home. I will definitely be back for another stay anytime I‚Äôm in the area. Thank you Justin for the wonder experience!!!!! 5/5 rating in my book.. NO complaints here"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, secluded cabin. Very comfortable."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our families really enjoyed our time at this peaceful and beautifully updated cabin. The area was so full of adventure for kids aged 2-10 and they played and fished each morning. We were in town visiting family for a graduation party and this gave us a comfortable and enjoyable place in town. It is remote, but the scenery is great! Thanks for making this cabin available!"

2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We rented this home for our annual extended family weekend. The pictures don't do this place justice in terms of space. It's beautiful inside! It is incredibly spacious and there are plenty of places to run away to for privacy. Check-in and out was very simple. There were a ton of amenities in the home include a garage full of arcade games, a large spacious basement with a pool table, bar, hot tub and giant tv. The only negative comments I have about this home is that there are lots of little things broken, however, the owner responded quickly to send someone out to try to fix the issues and they didn't impact our stay. We are excited about the additional bedroom being added and look forward to coming back to this home next year!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Just what it says on the tin - pictures and descriptions are spot on. Beautiful location and space. I was only there for one night so I didn't have a chance to take advantage of the beautiful grounds. Laura was very proactive in communicating around check-in time. Would stay again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Parts of the lower floor of a ""woodsy"" home nestled in the forest but a very short drive to shopping centers and restaurants. floor to ceiling sliding glass doors. look out onto the woods in the living room and bedroom. Very nice to wake up and look right out into the woods. it is a wonderful porch area off of the living room in the woods. Laura was a great host. she let us use a couple of hers camping chairs and then we drove West to view the eclipse."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Laura‚Äôs place is a gem tucked away in Greenford. It is spacious with a lovely view of a stream and we wish we could have spent longer taking it all in. It is inviting and had everything we needed.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I came here to spend a relaxing and calm Birthday weekend and I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better place to do this. Everything was perfect. The living space was decorated beautifully and the view was breathtaking. Laura was a wonderful host and gave me the privacy that I so needed but was available if I needed anything. Check in and out was easy and access to the lower living space was easy for me since I recently just had knee replacement surgery. The space was very clean and stocked with everything you would need for your stay. I would not hesitate to recommend this lovely place!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home and guest suite is situated in a wooded country setting. If you appreciate communing with nature, this is the AirBnB for you. The host provided a fire pit and grill, which we did not have a chance to use, but was a great addition. The amenities for meals we especially appreciated - spices, cooking oils, breakfast cereals and snacks. The host is not only responsive in communication, but genuinely cares about her guests."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We highly recommend and enjoyed our stay at Laura‚Äôs wooded sanctuary. We were greeted by Laura and had a nice chat. The place was true to the pictures and explanation of the areas. The bed was very comfortable and we enjoyed having the sliding door open in the bedroom to feel the cool breeze and listening to the night sounds. It was nice to be in out in the country but close enough to town to easily pick up some necessities. If you‚Äôre looking for some fun we highly recommend stopping in for coffee at Lil‚Äôs Cafe and a wonderful shop called Nature + Nurture both in Salem, OH. Laura‚Äôs place was a perfect spot for us to come back to every night after a busy day out and about."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We are adding this beautiful place to our favorites! Laura is a wonderful host who communicated with us in a timely and friendly manner.

We will definitely book in the future."

Looking for a quiet and peaceful space? This is it!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Laura met us as soon as we pulled up to her Airbnb on 10 secluded acres. She took the time to show us around and how everything worked. She even had a list of local attractions to do and included food, recreation and outings. She was outstanding and will be back next year and hopefully she has the availability. Book now!

The only downside for me personally are the places to visit in the area; there isn't much in terms of things you can do or places you can visit. However if you are spending time with someone and you want a nice place to stay then this is it!"

Thank you, Kevin!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Moon is where our love for Kevin‚Äôs properties began four years ago, and it's in the same beautiful condition today. It's a beautiful contemporary home tucked in a pocket of old growth hardwood forest with a spectacular view of the ravine behind it. Less than a mile from downtown Salem, the parcel is reminiscent of a state park setting. The Moon sits juxtaposed to its sister, The Stars, and about 30 yards from Dreamcatcher, the newest of the Creekside Cabins. Kevin‚Äôs clever building placement and smart design features make it so you barely see the other properties. The interior is stylish, sparkling clean and comfortable. The fully equipped kitchen provides all you need for meal prep on-site. We actually modeled our own bedroom after the bedroom at The Moon. That‚Äôs how pretty it is. The rain shower head in the bathroom is hard to leave. The hot tub is a welcome newer addition to the property. After your first stay, you‚Äôll be in love with The Moon like we are!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The cabin was a great retreat for us and even with the weather craziness and power outage, we had a great time. Kevin was always responsive and addressed any questions we asked. Additionally, the Keurig coffee maker was a surprise.

They loved showering in the spacious and spotless bathroom, giggling in the super clean hot tub together, eating take out and talking at the dining table, piling onto the fold out couch for a late night anime session after snacks and drinks prepped in the pristine kitchen, and snuggling into the ample King bed for a few hours rest! Clean up was made simple with the dishwasher and laundry room amenities. Thank you! We'll definitely be back! Maybe next time, no teenagers. üòòü§£"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The moon cabin was beyond our greatest weekend getaway. Coxy and simply modern, we felt right at home. The bedroom and bath felt like a luxury hotel. The deck is absolutely amazing. It feels as if you're nestled high in the trees, overlooking a gully. The beautiful leaf canopy above keeps the deck cool and comfortable for soaking in the hot tub, or daydreaming as the leaves dance with the sun on your face.
It was one of the best stays we've ever had. The Moon will be a yearly return for us. Thank you Kevin for hosting a cabin with such a magnificent layout and gorgeous feel to nature. It is perfect."

There were nearby shops and restaurants, but it was far away enough from the noise of the city. Kevin responded immediately with a quick question I had for him. Overall, wonderful experience."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed at The Moon for one night and wish we stayed longer! Absolutely beautiful place that was extremely well designed and well kept. Everything was pristine and clean. The view of the woods out the large windows and sliding glass doors was just what we were looking for and made it feel as if we were in the middle of nowhere but with the convenience of stores/restaurants nearby. And of course, gotta love being in the hot tub while feeling isolated in the woods listening to the birds sing. Highly recommend staying here. If hesitating to book, don‚Äôt! It‚Äôs worth every penny."

2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and clean, well furnished, communicative host. The only problem was it was marketed as a cabin in the woods so I expected it to be a lot more remote than it was not being from the area. It‚Äôs located about 2 minutes from a town behind a subdivision so it wasn‚Äôt the location expected. Other than that it was a really nice stay and something I‚Äôd be willing to visit again."

Absolutely beautiful and private farm. Enjoyed sitting on front porch with coffee/wine enjoying the quiet country surroundings. Kids loved the animals, especially lu lu the pig. Roxanne had a coffee maker set up with great coffee and tea options and tons of dishes and cookware for preparing meals at the house. Very comfortable space with cute country decor. Felt like a home away from home! Reminder to bring your own toiletries (shampoo and soap not provided). Also home is split/divided. It‚Äôs totally separate spaces but it is connected by a wall to the owners home so if you want total privacy this might not be perfect fit.

She popped in during the afternoon to set our heat for a day that promised to be chillier than May sometimes is. Pretty decorations and a lovely wood bed upstairs for parents with a beautiful quilt. We felt very welcomed as a transracial family with young kids. The kids had a great experience feeling at home during our visit. The kitchen had all we needed to do our meals, and there was plenty of room on comfy couches and a warm rug in the living room for lots of play and even a nap! The kids really loved the slide and walks around the house outside despite the rainy weather. Roxanne was very accommodating to leash her sweet dogs when a couple of our kids felt cautious to meet them, and they had fun saying hi to Jack from the doorway of his dry spot inside the barn. We are planning to return later in the season for any even longer stay and we hope next time they might be brave enough to pet the pig Lulu if she again greets us upon arrival from under the porch! She was a calm friend they talked about for hours and looked for on our walks. A quiet getaway (except for kid play!) we would recommend to any family."

We liked that each unit had its own privaye jot tub. The town of salem had a nice little main street with more dining options than i thought there would be.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful, clean, well decorated, modern space, tucked away in a quiet neighborhood but very close to food and shopping. The attached car garage was a great feature as the weather was rainy and cold during our stay. Quality linen, new appliances in a well-equipped kitchen, made the place more special. I cannot stress the cleanliness of the entire space enough. You could eat off the floor if you wanted. Not a hair or speck of dust in sight! The private hot tub on the back deck was La cr√®me and was a perfect 104 when we arrived. (Thanks Shelley!) When the beautiful dear stopped by the backyard for breakfast, I wanted to move in forever. The backyard was just as beautiful at night as someone took the time to give the trees landscape lighting. Thank you and your entire team for your attention to detail! We truly enjoyed our stay. This is what an Airbnb should be."

His construction and design is wonderful - always a perfect use of space, great furniture, great linens, and always a great location that is close to everything while feeling secluded.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect! It absolutely exceeded my expectations.
Things that I loved about the place...
there's a garage and a garage door opener remote that they supply you to put in your car. amazing.
the shower!! it was like being in a warm monsoon and I am all about that life.
hot tub was easy to uncover and use.
A GRILL! Made myself some yummy grilled corn one night.
shampoo, conditioner, body wash and lotion are provided.
there is a washer and dryer and they actually supplied soap and dryer sheets. it was so nice.
there are dishes to use as well as a Keurig. powdered creamer was provided. there was also oil and salt and pepper for those who want to cook.
a dishwasher! so wonderful. Soap for the dishwasher was also provided. so lovely.
The only thing about this place that I didn't love is that the walls are INCREDIBLY thin. This past week, my ears have witnessed so many things that I wish they could unhear.
But aside from thin walls...absolute perfection."

This particular place is definitely at the top of our list whenever we just want to get away . But I'm also happy to know that this particular host has other properties, and I will check them out the funny thing about it as me and my wife and I actually picking between this place and another place.

My days were booked so didn't spend much time there but it was very spacious."

I was honestly worried about not having a full kitchen but with all the local restaurants and places in walking distance, we never had an issue on finding places to eat.

2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,It was a short overnight but enjoyed the town and the pretty drive to get there
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second stay at the Lawson's place. So nice to have this option in town. The space is immaculate, large and has very comfortable beds. Being able to hop downstairs to Lib's for coffee is a huge plus. The owners are great with communication. They took my suggestions from our first stay to heart.
I will mention that the front bedrooms can be loud at night if there's traffic. Might want ear plugs or a white noise machine.
We will definitely stay here next time we visit Salem."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super cute place! Clean and homey. I would recommend!
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute little apartment in convenient setting. Everything is fresh and new.
State Street stays busy 24/7 so light sleepers will need to be in the back bedroom (rather than the 2 in front) or will need to bring earplugs to cover the noise of traffic and people on the street."
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a nice stop on our way back to Iowa from DC. Very clean and easy to access.
Just as listed, 2 of the bedrooms are city street facing and rather bright. All of the bedroom doors have windows at the top, and 2 of the rooms have a glass window between them, so if not everyone is sleeping at the same time it could be problematic with lights.
We were not there long enough to enjoy the Salem Main Street but it seemed really cute and worth checking out if you have time."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The facility is a great location for Salem and the management team did an excellent job of communicating and was very helpful.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Accommodations were perfect, in a great location, convenient to everything. And it‚Äôs a beautiful apartment. Will definitely stay here again."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place and the location was perfect.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We love downtown Salem, so this is a perfect new addition! shop, eat, drink, and then crash in town! it's a must do for locals & out of Towner's alike! will be booking more stays!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a wonderful stay at this Airbnb. Mike and Marla were incredibly nice and attentive, consistently checking up on us to ensure we were comfortable. From the moment we arrived, they made sure we had everything we needed and went out of their way to make us feel at home. The place was clean, cozy, and exactly as described. I high recommend staying here for anyone looking for a comfortable and welcoming experience. Thank you for making our stay so enjoyable."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Mike and Marla‚Äôs place was so lovely. The view of the lake while we sat on the deck around the fire pit was beautiful! The claw foot tub was an extra special luxury. We enjoyed using the grill to make breakfast and slowly sipped our coffee, enjoying the serene space that they have curated. There was much thought put in to making The A Frame a lakeside retreat and I will definitely recommend it to my friends!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mike & Marla‚Äôs place is stunning!!! Unfortunately I was not here for vacation, I was attending to my Dad‚Äôs Estate. But Marla was so caring and so helpful, it sure did feel like a vacation. Their attention to details is amazing, just like the view. Thank you so very much."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"When I say this was the BEST Airbnb I have ever been to‚Äîand I have been to countless ones. This one was by far the best and absolutely beautiful with incredible accommodations. It was cozy, comfortable, and felt like a home away from home. Host was perfect and attentive before and after the visit. The view was perfect and close to the lake. We will definitely be back soon for summer! I highly recommend THE FRAME!!!!!!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend reserving The Henry and The Thomas if you are having a get together of 25 people or fewer. There is a small coutyard outside with tables and chairs for gathering. Our brother-in-law, wife and two children (young adults) stayed in The Henry and they said the accomodations were great with the one bedroom and pull out sofa. My husband and I stayed in The Thomas. Both places have full size refridgerators, dishwashers, microwaves and stoves/ovens. We had lunch for the group at Sabi‚Äôs (reserved a room and ate buffet style) and brought the leftovers back to eat later. Later, we warmed up our trays of chicken, pasta, mashed potatoes and carrots in our two ovens‚Ä¶ate‚Ä¶cleaned up and went, a short distance, some walked, to enjoy the concert that evening. After the concert, some walked, others rode back in the Model T‚Äôs provided with the reservation to our places and enjoyed marshmellows at the firepit in the courtyard. Everyone had a great time!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed at the Henry on multiple occasions and it never disappoints! It is always well stocked with everything you would need for a trip. The town is full of amazing places to eat and getting to them in the Model T golf cart is super fun!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Gorgeous upscale rental, golf cart was a wonderful extra! Make sure to look at the map of Firestone Farms to see all the places you can go on it. Fun brewery, will be awesome when the BBQ restaurant opens. Bring a fan, the music can be a bit loud but not a huge problem, people are having fun. Can't wait to return! ‚ù§"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,amazing location with beautiful surroundings. easy to get to Boardman area
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kevin‚Äôs place was really lovely! Bed was comfortable, bathroom was great, living was really nice! Main attraction for us was the golf cart. We really had fun with that. We enjoyed the patio out front. And we truly appreciated not having to do anything but show up and then lock up when we left. It felt like renting a hotel vs. an Airbnb where you have to do all of these other things. Plus a noon check out! If we plan to be on the area again, we would definitely rent this Airbnb from Kevin again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was beautiful and spotless. The pictures don't do it justice. He went all out on this house. The best of everything was put in this house. Kevin had everything you needed plus the extra things you didn't think you needed. I stay at many places and never had such a quick response time from a host. The property sits right next to one of the best breweries around. The golf carts was an added touch to get to some great restaurants across the street. We will definitely be staying there again.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spot. Beautiful inside. Brewery next door. Great whirlpool. Thank you!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We felt so comfortable and the place was spotless! Lots of extra items that are needed such as shampoo and lotions!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very much enjoyed our stay in the Henry House! Lovely place, would certainly go back if in the area again. Kevin was so very attentive to keeping us informed and providing any assistance needed. Would recommend a stay here!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was beautiful! I wish there were two defined bedrooms, but the couch bed was honestly so comfortable. The bathroom was beautiful and the hot tub was amazing. The only thing that I will say is that the surrounding area didn‚Äôt seem to have a ton to do but that‚Äôs because we couldn‚Äôt go outside as it was pretty cold during our weekend! Anywho, props to Kevin for being so response, 10/10, would recommend! I will be visiting his other locations soon :)."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing weekend stay with our Pup, who we sadly have to put to rest due to a recent cancer diagnosis. We had an awesome stay at the Henry. Kevin was helpful and promptly responsive. This place is certainly high up on my list of places to stay. And the area is top-notch! Amazing food, local brewery, and everything is accessible using the model-T golf cart, or just walk out the front door! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed at Kevin‚Äôs places in the past
He does a excellent job! Above and beyond expectations
He‚Äôs always responsive and if you want a place that makes you feel like you would live there permanently, stay at one of his units. They are beyond your expectations
I am very picky and usually travel with my own pillow. This is my go to when I return back to Youngstown"
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The Henry was a wonderful place to stay and the town of Columbiana offered quite a bit to do. We were looking forward to going to the ill-will Brewery one night that we were there but unfortunately it's only open on the weekends. Only thing that we wished was different was just a heads up about the brewery only being open on the weekends, other than that place was amazing. And the model t golf cart was a lot of fun for my family and I."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at "" The Henry"" and the surrounding space. It was very cool and different. We would certainly like to return later in the week or on a weekend with more of the property open for enjoyment including the on premise ill Will Brewery. We had the entire area to ourselves and the only thing missing was some available firewood our first night. We made do with a couple old pallets and some firewood we purchased nearby.
The Town Center looks to be very enjoyable when in full swing and it has a great Mexican Bar and Grill called ""Mexico City"" and The Burger Joint ""Sespe"" was fantastic. We also tried frozen yogurt at Orange Leaf which was a very fun place with a number of options to choose from including the frozen yogurt, boba tea and acai bowls.
The accommodations were wonderful and a few times I reached out to Kevin through AirBnB he responded almost immediately. We certainly want to experience a few of his other places that are listed as well.

We would definitely stay at The Henry again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is perfect! Everything matches the photos, and the surroundings are beautiful and peaceful. The couch was comfortable enough for some binge watching and the high ceilings make you feel as though you are in a big space, not that the space is small in the first place. Both TVs are equipped with a sound bar which was great for watching TV or listening to your playlist
The linens and bed were so comfortable and there were extra blankets to cuddle with as well.
In the evening, I took advantage of the hot tub, local restaurants, and the Beer/Cigar bar. I highly recommend Sabi's for dinner, Birdfish Brewery for Sunday afternoon on the patio, and the Brewhouae at Firestone Farms.
Excellent stay, looking forward to coming back."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was simply awesome! We are big fans of The Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village in Michigan, so finding a Henry Ford themed Airbnb was a dream come true!! We had a such a wonderful stay here, and really enjoyed this little town. The historic downtown had cute shops with such friendly customer service. We had a great breakfast at Carla‚Äôs Corner Cafe located inside an antique store ( can‚Äôt remember the name, but it was fun to browse while we waited for our food.) Our host was friendly and responsive, and this place was cozy and immaculately clean. Can‚Äôt wait to visit again!"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I rented the Henry for two nights as a weekend get away and it was absolutely perfect for that. We enjoyed having a private hot tub and the closeness of good restaurants. The keurig in the kitchen was perfect for a morning cup of coffee. It was pretty cold during our stay so we barely used the golf cart, but the thing was amazing: it looked like an Model T!
Kevin was very proactive and helpful in the lead up to our stay."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful accommodations. Lots of nearby restaurants and shops. Had a fun ride in the Model T.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When was the last time you stayed at an Airbnb with its own Model-T for you to cruise the neighborhood in? Kevin‚Äôs Columbiana property The Henry and its next-door neighbor The Thomas have changed the game when it comes to experiential stays.
Electric golf carts built to replicate Ford‚Äôs famous Model-T are available for guests to drive around the Firestone Farms community, golf course and shops. What a fun and unique investment Kevin has made in his guests‚Äô experience! We enjoyed an hour-long drive on a sunny autumn afternoon and loved watching the surprised reactions of out-of-towners and the knowing waves of familiar residents as we passed.
Named for Henry Ford and Thomas Edison, the exteriors of these nostalgic properties are replicas of these historic figures‚Äô boyhood homes. To fully appreciate the homage to Ford and Edison, do a quick internet search for the pair‚Äôs annual ‚ÄúVagabonds‚Äù road trips with Harvey Firestone (a Columbiana native) and the famed naturalist John Burroughs. Or you can read the authoritative book about the troupe that Kevin has provided on the living room table.
Upon entering the house, we were struck by the larger-than-life mural of Henry Ford leaning on the bumper of his history-making automobile. If you stay at enough of Kevin‚Äôs properties, you‚Äôll learn that most of them have a similarly breathtaking central wall mural or contemporary furnishing designed and crafted by local artist John Shaw. They are yet another hallmark of Kevin‚Äôs unique places.

In contrast to the historically accurate exterior, the interior is anything but dated. High vaulted ceilings, sunlight-ushering windows, a stylish and comfy sofa bed, sleek kitchen cabinets and high-end appliances give the great room a warm and contemporary feel. The bedroom features luxurious linens on a sleep-inducing king bed, a dresser with plenty of drawers to stow your clothes and touch lamps fashioned to resemble period pieces with Edison-style filament light bulbs. Each of the rooms have various lighting options including infinitely dimmable ceiling light fixtures.
The bathroom boasts a black onyx tiled walk-in shower with the most intense rain showerhead my wife and I have ever experienced.
Outside is an expansive red brick patio area with brick inlays in the shape of a Model-T in front of The Henry and a light bulb in front of The Thomas. Brick fire rings provide a great gathering area to enjoy with family or your new friends from next door or the adjacent Ill Will Brewing, where you can enjoy eclectic brews with names like ‚ÄúQuestionable Life Choices,‚Äù ‚ÄúToxic Workplace‚Äù and ‚ÄúBackhanded Compliment.‚Äù We personally recommend their ""Genoskwa"" stout named after the native American term for ‚ÄúBigfoot,‚Äù for which Columbiana is said to be a hotbed for sightings.
You‚Äôll enjoy unwinding in the relaxing top-of-the-line hot tub after a long day of experiencing The Henry and its surroundings.
As bona fide followers of Kevin Jamison properties, we have been conditioned for increasingly higher expectations with each new offering. The Henry met and exceeded those expectations as anticipated. My wife owns a commercial cleaning business, so it takes on-point cleaning staff and attention to every detail to impress her, which The Henry does with a perfect score.
Kevin is a responsive communicator who is always available for questions, but non-intrusive as he allows his guests to enjoy their stay without interruption.
You can‚Äôt go wrong with a stay at The Henry. It will surely lead to return visits. If you‚Äôre anything like us, you will find yourself planning stays where Kevin‚Äôs homes are the destination and the reason for the trip."

It is generously and perfectly equipped with stellar accommodations. My partner is a three pillow sleeper and I deeply appreciated that there were extra linens provided and accessible which is exceptionally generous and thoughful. all of the appliances are new and work amazingly wellThe theme of this particular property was fun and executed spectacularly. It carries through the entire property without being forced or too much. and as a curvy woman I deeply appreciated that all of the furniture was of sound construction and well built. (there is nothing worse than showing up to realize you are afraid to sit wrong on the couch bc it's a futon. that's NOT anything you have to worry about with Kevin's property!) Kevin was also very responsive to messages and quick to answer a few questions I had. I will definitely be staying with Kevin again!!!"

The place was awesome- extremely clean, has everything you need, and the hot tub was a nice way to close the evening. And the model T cart was extremely fun to drive. The map that is provided shows you exactly where you are allowed to drive it, and I was pleasantly surprised at how many places you can go with it. And the brewery right next door is just the icing on the cake. I will most definitely be back but will stay longer next time. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to stay in the Columbiana area!"

The inside is beautiful and brand new with cathedral ceiling. The artwork on the wall is amazing! Lots of history here and we enjoyed learning about it. There was so much detail and heart and soul put into it by the owners. We didn‚Äôt want to leave!
We enjoyed driving the Ford replica golf cart around the whole subdivision grounds including great restaurants and bars. The courtyard at the shopping mall has free concerts every Saturday night! It is located on the same property as Ill Will Brewery! Great beer and super friendly people! Would love to stay again! Thank you for a great stay Columbiana!!"

A warm and cozy gas fire added to the atmosphere of Christmas as well as a wide screen tv with Christmas music and a decorated, lit tree!
The setting was perfect, the front porch and rockers inviting and our visit so peaceful and memorable!
At our request, Aimee suggested wonderful restuaruants, flea markets and thrift shops and things to see. We went to all of them!

My grandparents owned a little house in this lake about forty years ago, and I spent many Thanksgivings here as a kid. Aimee knew that we were coming to spend time with our father who was recovering from cancer treatments, and she was more accommodating than I could have ever dreamed of. The cabin was not only spotless, and fully stocked, but Aimee even allowed us to stay and watch the Browns vs Steelers game, with a complimentary late check out to have a little extra time with Dad. She was truly caring about our well being and happiness while we were her guests. Thanks for everything Aimee! We will return!!!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our second stay at the cabin. The first was in February of 2020. The lake is beautiful in all seasons, although I must admit it was more comfortable to be outside this time! We really enjoyed sitting on the porch in the morning. The fish we're jumping out of the water, and there were a lot of different birds to watch. The sunsets over the lake are spectacular.
The cabin was extremely clean, well equipped, and nice and cool inside. Our family of four was comfortable and had plenty of space. I highly recommended checking it out!"

The amenities were great, more than I would expect. They had the driveway plowed because we visited during a blizzard, which was also nice. I hope to visit next time with family during the summer so we can take advantage of the lake, and spending more time outside and around the cabin."

The neighborhood is quiet. We had everything we needed for a quiet weekend away. The furniture and bedding were comfortable, the water even tasted great! The shower was hot and powerful. Every little touch and detail was thought of from the throw blankets, to the board games and chess/checker table. Even got a little thank you welcome pack with some snacks. A great time. I can't believe it was available and reasonably priced! We sent links to friends to book a stay. Thank you Aimee!"

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great cabin with a wonderful view of the lake.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful experience to get our family out of the city fir a long weekend. The cabin was cozy and had many special and thoughtful touches inside and out. Extremely clean and well cared for. Well stocked with all the necessities and fun extras. Highlights- kayaks, cornhole, fire pit with firewood, gas grill, WiFi., and of course, the lake. Kitchen is small, but we were able to cook with no problem. No dishwasher, but we didn‚Äôt mind. The lake was beautiful, calm, relaxing and easily accessed. Close to a small grocery store and restaurants. Hosts were extremely hospitable and communication was timely and helpful."
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"My 1st impression when I walked in the door was ‚Äúhow cute‚Äù. It would be perfect for a small family or friends gathering. Kitchen was tiny but perfect for our needs. Love the bathroom with the huge walk-in shower. It was extremely hot outside (90 degrees, high humidity) when we stayed, so there was no hanging out on the cute porch or patio. The cabin was plenty cool enough as long as you leave the doors open and let the air circulate. It is a cabin, not a house and the ability to provide an air-conditioned environment to guest is awesome! Aimee has done a great job at providing everything.
Unfortunately, our family included our 2 grandchildren who are 4 years old & 18 months. Not ideal for babies and small children. One bedroom upstairs is an open loft and very comfy and does not have a door, but I liked it! The downstairs bedroom is very small with double size bunkbeds. It was way too hot to close the door or use the top bunk during the scorching summer heat. Our babies missed their bath time; and quiet place to sleep. Totally not Aimee‚Äôs fault, I knew there was no tub. So, with that said, if you love staying in a cabin, near the lake with fishing, swimming, and hiking, come here."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed kayaking on the lake. Great view from the deck. Our kids loved the queen-sized bunk beds. Guilford Lake is a hidden gem and the cabin was a perfect spot to relax at the end of the day.

We stayed on a particularly cold weekend, and stayed warm cozied up by the ‚Äúfire.‚Äù The kitchen had everything we needed to cook meals and snacks. We slept well and the shower was so nice. The lake was frozen over but nice to look at and visit. Our 5-year-old enjoyed watching the geese and swans, and playing on the playground across the street. Lots of movie and game choices, and we drove to Minerva to pick up some yummy beer at Sandy Springs. Would love to return in the warmer months to swim and kayak in the lake!"

We visited as a pandemic safe getaway for our daughter‚Äôs 13th birthday & Aimee left a sweet gift for my girl as well as had birthday signs hung up. We loved all of the beds ‚Äî- they are sooooo comfortable. The electric fireplace was the perfect touch for the cold winter weather. We drove to Salem for takeout food & it was very easily accessible from the cabin. We hope to return in the summer months so we can properly enjoy the lake. Highly recommend Aimee & Jerry‚Äôs cabin."

2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful cabin with a full view of the lake.

I had only briefly mentioned that it was an anniversary trip when I booked, but Aimee left little acknowledgments of our special occasion throughout the cabin. It was so thoughtful of her, and we loved it. The cabin itself is great - beautiful and cozy, with a great view of the lake. On our first full day it snowed, and it was so beautiful, like a winter wonderland! The cabin was extremely clean and had everything we needed. We had a wonderful time and would love to visit again."

Beautiful living spaces, large bed, incredible shower let alone they both had washer and dryer, hot tubs and handy Model T Ford replica golf carts to utilize exploring the area. We took full advantage of all the amenities and our friends were amazed and many of them want to rent these properties in the future.

We all had an amazing time and the general consensus is that we want to make this an annual event. Many thanks to Kevin on these very upscale and impressive units."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home exceeded our expectations. Online it looked like the perfect fit for our six night trip back to our hometown, and it truly exceeded expectations. First, a wonderful, communicative host. Second, the property has cool, industrial (Edison) feel with beautiful fixtures. Third, the walk in shower with rainfall faucet was quite nice. Fourth, the outside patio, near a local brewery was pleasant all day long. And, fifth, Columbiana is a Hallmark(esque) town, with a beautiful Park and quaint downtown. The Airbnb is certainly worth checking out - you won‚Äôt be disappointed."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay! Great location and the Airbnb itself was wonderful. I highly recommend staying here!

We loved the experience and will stay again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place that is as clean as any place I‚Äôve ever stayed. Place is like new. Golf cart was a lot of fun and you can use it to get to restaurants. Having the brewery next door was a bonus. If you‚Äôre not from the area, check out Birdfish Brewing in downtown Colombiana (6 mins away).

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Thomas is a very unique property. It along with The Henry share an outdoor area with the brewery next door. I enjoyed reading about the history of the area. The interior is beautiful, clean, and well appointed. I couldn‚Äôt stop looking at the unique decor. The shower with waterfall shower head was so relaxing. We had a beautiful night to use the very clean hot tub. There was a new grill which we didn‚Äôt get to use. The golf cart was so much fun. We enjoyed riding on the property (map included to show the route you are allowed to take). People would wave and yell ‚Äúnice buggy‚Äù. Kevin was quick to respond and very helpful suggesting restaurants. We enjoyed the Homestead and Sabi. Stopped in Mexico City for a drink and met very nice people. Next time we‚Äôd like to stay more than one night. We had such a relaxing visit and it was difficult to leave. But, we headed to The Dreamcatcher (another one of Kevin‚Äôs properties which is equally amazing) for one more night."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had our wedding at the barn and stayed at the air bnb for the weekend. I can‚Äôt recommend enough! The location was perfect for all of our wedding events. It was a quick golf cart ride away. Everything was clean and beautiful! We will definitely be back!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This might be one of the nicest AirBnbs we have ever stayed in! Nicely decorated, terrific location, upscale appliances. Some AirBnbs are just a hodge podge of stuff thrown together, not The Thomas. It was the best of everything and we really enjoyed our time! We are already planning to come back next year."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is by far the BEST experience we‚Äôve ever had with Airbnb. The Thomas is beautifully decorated and so so clean. It‚Äôs equipped with everything you could possibly need. Kevin, our host, was very quick to respond and super helpful. 10/10 experience and will definitely book with this host in the future."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at the Thomas, very thoughtfully designed. We had a little trouble finding it because it is back from the road so not immediately seen. The golf cart was a bonus that we enjoyed, along with the hot tub. Will definitely look to stay there again if we are in the area."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Thomas was as described. Very clean and convenient for our wedding at the Barn at Firestone.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Unique little place to stay! Very clean and updated. Everything is absolutely beautiful. Wonderful decorating touches. Nice location. Fun brewery steps away from the home. Quiet at night. You could hear frogs and see fireflies at night. We loved our stay!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The air bnb‚Äôs are replicas of Henry Ford and Thomas Edisons childhood homes and the characters of each is amazing. Inside is pristine and has everything you‚Äôd need for a quick getaway. Surrounded by a brewery and venue the view is amazing and peaceful.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place out-did the pictures. Ultra modern, the motif was of the historical Thomas Edison. It almost reflected what might have been his laboratory, but with a giant twist toward livability. All rooms were provisioned impeccably; we wanted for nothing. The coffee maker was new to us; it would make a cup or a pot-full equally well. We usually cook many of our meals; the full range of necessities were at our finger tips - all new!! Plenty of light during the day (if desired), but shaded from it in the morning,allowing sleep-in‚Äôs as late as desired. The shower was not only huge, but a delight. Plenty of storage, if needed, and plenty of clothes hanging space if multiple functions are on the agenda. The HVAC worked flawlessly for setting a comfortable atmosphere and the jacuzzi was the crowning jewel (wish we had used it more than twice!!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time we‚Äôve stayed at this location, and we loved it this time, just as much as the last.
Beautiful place, and a great location. We will most definitely be coming back. :)"

Book it. You won‚Äôt be disappointed!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The house was beautiful and yet so cozy. Loved all the details from the furniture to accessories that carry out the Thomas Edison theme and even the brickwork on the sidewalk outside the front door.
It was great being so close to activities and restaurants but also so peaceful to go back to the trees and quiet of the area surrounding the house. We really enjoyed our stay in Columbiana is a beautiful town with something for everyone in the family."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Thomas exceeded our expectations! My husband and I had an amazing time just sneaking away for a night from every day crazy life/work. The golf cart was so much fun! The house was absolutely beautiful!!! Kevin was so helpful through the whole process from reserving it -to a silly question while we were there! We will definitely be checking out his other properties!

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow. I barely have words for how incredible this stay was. But let me try. First of all we hung out at the brewery located in the front yard of whede we stayed. The beer was insanely good. Milkshake beers thats didnt even taste like beer, along with your typical ipas ect. Try the peabutter chocolate it will change your life.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Over the past several days I have gotten to enjoy Kevin‚Äôs two Airbnb locations one in Salem and the other Columbiana. First and foremost this host was so incredibly kid, compassionate, and generous. During an evacuation situation in my town where I was left homeless these locations felt right at home. The decor was impeccable, they were immaculately well cleaned, and fantastically equipped. It was a tremendous experience and true home away from home. Th Al you very much!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at ‚ÄúThe Thomas‚Äù for two nights during a trip to explore Columbiana County. This accommodation is spotless, stylish, and beautiful. Self check-in was a breeze using a keypad and the host was very communicative from our initial booking onward. The Thomas is located across the road from Firestone Farms, which is a neat entertainment district with nice restaurants and bars. We hiked in nearby Beaver Creek State Park and enjoyed the local food scene including the wonderful Hogan‚Äôs Bakery, Homestead Restaurant, and local craft breweries. In fact, ‚ÄúThe Thomas‚Äù is located on the same grounds as Ill Will Brewing - a very stylish craft brewery with very good beer. Other fine nearby craft breweries to check out are Birdfish in Columbiana and Numbers in Lisbon. Nearby, The Leetonia Beehive Coke Ovens Park, which is on the National Register of Historic Places is an interesting historic site. Walking through the archaeological remains of this site ( built in 1866) is fascinating and atmospheric. There is also the Liittle Beaver Creek Greenway rails to trails route for cyclists. We live 90 minutes away in Cleveland and the Thomas makes for a splendid weekend getaway both because of the quality of accommodations and the wealth of activities. We will return."

It‚Äôs tucked away on a quiet street and is within walking distance of Heggy‚Äôs! There‚Äôs was something so familiar about the place that made me feel nostalgic. It felt like home.
I usually book a hotel, but as long at this place is available during my visits, I will definitely be booking again and will recommend to friends and family when they‚Äôre heading to town.
Fun fact: I actually learned about this house from my cousin Amilia who stayed last year around this time."

We felt so at home, and being allowed to use the supplies there at the home made our short notice trip much less stressful. We felt like we had our own home and privacy. We are so grateful we found this home to stay in, and the price made it unbeatable when considering a hotel room would have been the same or more for just a room versus having an entire fully equipped home.

The home has a comfortable queen bed and bathroom located in the first floor. There is a lovely backyard and Jeremy provided extra amenities such as coffee, condiments and snacks. The central air was greatly appreciated during their summer stay. They traveled to my sister‚Äôs home which was only a mile away and spent all day there. They were very comfortable arriving back at the house during the night as the neighborhood is quiet and safe. There is local eatery, Heggy‚Äôs right down the road which they enjoyed getting coffee and some candy. This is a great place to stay, and the value is outstanding!

,,,"A terrifying experience, a friend and I came out to relax and have a girls weekend, upon arrival we where excited, it was beautiful. And I had never done anything like this. We spent a couple hours getting food, taking pictures, and settling down, that‚Äôs when there a was loud sounds coming from outside, we went out and couldn‚Äôt see anything but heard what sounded like explosions going off, so loud that we could hear them inside with the tv turned up. Along with sirens and screaming. After over an hour of trying to drown out this noise around 12:00am we decided we are not safe and so we packed up and drove the almost 3 hours home. Nearly in tears. I was so let down seeing all of these incredible reviews‚Ä¶"
