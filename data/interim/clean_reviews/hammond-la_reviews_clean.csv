2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We wanted to stay in Hammond, so we could visit our friends who live there, just a few miles away.
We really enjoyed our four night stay at this adorable country charmer, and it was a huge plus to be walking distance to town, where we went to bars and restaurants and visited a few shops with our friends. We also enjoyed sitting on the beautiful porch, Relaxing with our golden retriever and taking her for long walks in the beautiful neighborhood. It was also nice to have a fenced in backyard to let our dog do her business first thing in the morning and before bed at night.
The home had everything we needed to feel very comfortable, and it’s located in a very safe area!
Tasha was very good at communicating with us from the time we booked until our departure. We would definitely stay there again… Maybe even next spring! 😊"

2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Wonderful weekend, very peaceful and accommodating."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed staying at this house!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is very much worth the rent. If you are having a small family get together it is much better than 3 hotel rooms. It has plenty of beds and bathrooms and the Dining and Living areas are great for sitting around talking. The front porch is also great for sitting and talking. There's plenty of Parking.
We were very impressed with the wood floors and the furniture. The quality was way beyond our expectations. There has been a lot of thought and effort to keeping everything neat, clean, high quality and in excellent condition. We pray that all future guests take care to treat the home with respect so others can enjoy it as much as we did.
Tasha was very helpful and accommodating during our stay. We had a glitch in communication caused by the AirBnB App. When Tasha would put a message for us on the App, it would send a text message copy to our cell phone. So we would text back. We didn't know that our texts were not going anywhere. Communication improved after we figured that out."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Tasha’s home was lovely. Clearly old, but not outdated. It was very charming. Plus there is so much within walking distance. It was terribly hot outside but felt great inside. Saw nearby homes mention the train nearby, we could hear them but not loudly and it never woke our toddlers. Speaking of, we used the high chair and pack and play and they were in great condition, the extra padded mattress for the pack and play was so helpful."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Lovely house!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful place! It’s clean, comfortable, in a great location, and supremely well stocked. I came with my husband, baby, and two kids. Everyone liked this place! It’s one of the most comfortable airbnbs I’ve ever stayed in. I hope to come back next year!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A perfect location! Close enough for walking downtown for dinner and drinks, but far enough to escape the bar noise. This house oozes charm with gorgeous wood floors, a clawfoot tub, built-in cabinets and a huge front porch you never want to leave. We stayed there with my 10-month-old baby and Tasha had a ton of baby items we could use, including a pack-and-play, a baby mattress and a high chair. It really felt like home away from home."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice and close to downtown. Tasha was great with communicating check in and even offered an early check in if we needed it. The only negative is the train coming through nearby, it is very loud. Even with the train I would recommend staying here, and I would stay again."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This home was in a perfect location for all the activities we had planned. Tasha was a fantastic host with fast communication and the easiest check-in process we've had. This historic home had a wonderful feel, and we loved the size of the front porch. If you are planning a trip to Hammond, definitely consider staying here!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"If I could give this home a 10 out of 10 stars I completely would. Tasha took very good care of her home when it came to cleanliness and always made sure we had everything we needed. This beautiful home has the southern charm of a historic home while also keeping up with the modern amenities that every house needs. It was in beautiful downtown Hammond where there are plenty of things to do and restaurants to explore. It really was such an amazing stay, very well worth the money."

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Nice house
2022-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"An absolutely lovely, charming older home that's been beautifully expanded and updated. According to the owner's write-up the home is roughly 100 years old. If so they've left just enough of the old to give it character, but with all the modern comforts and conveniences.
The kitchen boasts rich distressed deep brown wood floors, beneath equally aged cabinets but with all updated hardware and topped off with well matched marble countertops and backsplash. The 5-burner Kenmore is a chef's dream stove. Leaving the kitchen, pantry, and power room area you step into the dining and living rooms with more rich cherry hardwood.
The kitchen was well appointed with everything we needed to prepare meals for our family of five.
Check-in and out was as easy as it gets. Communication with the hosts was flawless. The neighborhood is quiet. We noticed several people out for evening walks. Had our schedule permitted, we might have done the same.
The home appeared to have sufficient closets, however two of the three closets were locked and not available to guests. The third was also being used for storage leaving very little closest space. Given that we were in town for a wedding with multiple long dresses and suits to hang up the limited closet space presented a minor challenge. There were some oddities such as a bedroom that locked from the outside which provided our kids an opportunity for pranking mom & dad by locking us in our room. 🙄
Overall we greatly enjoyed our stay and would definitely love to stay again should we find ourselves back in Hammond."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Tasha’s historic and beautiful home was worth every penny. Outstanding location and within walking distance to downtown. Very quiet neighborhood.

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Tasha keeps a clean and well maintained home. The house has high ceilings and beautiful architectural details. She communicated promptly with clarity.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was our first time staying at an Airbnb and we couldn’t have been more pleased. We only had one issue and that wasn’t the host’s fault at all. The house and neighborhood are beautiful. There is so much to do in the area. The smell of the house reminded me of when I would stay with my great grandparents. Brought back some good memories. We would definitely stay again. Thank you

Location, Location, Location? 5-stars!
Cleanliness, Friendliness, & Comfort? 5-stars
We travel a lot and stay in a ton of different places. We had a last minute trip pop up to Hammond and thought it would be nice to stay in an AirBNB instead of a hotel. We needed somewhere to stay for a full month. Tasha responded very quickly with an approval to rent her beautiful home.
When we arrived there were fresh flowers on the table. We explored the house with excitement. This 100 year old home was meticulously kept. We were so surprised at how nice everything was. The front porch swing and rocking chairs were our favorite place to hang out every morning with a cup of coffee and every night with a glass of wine.
Tasha was great. We communicated several times via text. She is very knowledgeable about the surrounding area.
I can’t recommend this place enough. We truly had a wonderful time."

2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Petra and Brian's home was the perfect place for myself, my husband, and my four grown children who reunited after 9 years. They had a blast and we had some fun kayaking stories that we won't soon forget. We came for a funeral and Petra wrote a comforting message on her kitchen sign.

Petra & Bran really put a lot of time, thought and effort into making their guest feel like they were valued. Every detail in the house was well thought out to provide comfort, luxury and security. The communication was given promptly and respectfully. It was a pleasure to meet them in person during our stay and learn the history of how Harper’s Haven came to be.
The location is perfect! It is near the interstate and town but remote enough that you feel nestled in the woods. The outside area provided plenty of room for an outdoor gathering day or night. The inside was beautifully decorated, with a well stocked coffee/ tea bar and snacks for those who are too weary from travel to prepare a meal. The beds rooms a very comfortable with plenty of space and bathrooms are well stocked with necessities for things that might get overlooked when packing. This was one of my favorite stays. We will definitely be back"

The little touches like the welcome sign, snacks, and bottled water were really sweet and appreciated. Providing logs for the fire pit and bait for the fishing poles went above and beyond expectations, incredible! The space to play, fish, and lounge was just what we needed for our long travel.

I absolutely enjoyed my time with my group of friends and it really felt at home. From the sweet little message on the board telling me happy birthday to them also providing snacks and bottles of waters for everyone. I really enjoyed my stay with them. They are all around nice people. The house and the surrounding area is quiet and peaceful you couldn’t even tell it was a neighborhood how quiet it was and that’s one of the best part.

Well stocked kitchen, basket full of snacks, another basket in the bathroom filled with anything you may have missed packing. I'm on the road a lot for work, and this was about as close as it gets to feeling at home when I'm not.

I was lucky to find this beautiful gem while searching for a place to rent for my cousin, who was visiting us from NJ for a few days. Debra responded to my messages immediately and answered all questions within minutes. I knew right away that this was the best place for us!!
The apartment is centrally located between downtown Hammond and SLU, with sidewalks leading to both destinations.
Debra and Rex’s place is perfect!! It was exceptionally clean, comfortable, well decorated and included many extra supplies in the kitchen and bath area, something you rarely find in other vacation rental spaces. The apartment has a cozy outside covered patio that is safe and comfortable!
My cousin said that Debra was the perfect hostess, and was always available to answer questions.

Within walking distance to all things downtown Hammond. Loved the porch. The only heads up is that the house is on a main road. If you have light sleepers, don’t forget your sound machine and ear plugs. Otherwise, this house and the owner were wonderful!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,This was one of the best and coziest Airbnb I’ve stayed at. It really felt like I was right at home. Everything was so well organized and clean. Amanda was great and responding and gave very clear directions. I will definitely be going back again!!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were in Hammond for two college graduations. The house was located just far enough way from campus to avoid the worst traffic at the school both getting in and out for both ceremonies. The house is lovely and perfectly situated in downtown Hammond, near restaurants and other things to see and do. The house was spotlessly clean and well-appointed. We enjoyed the house a great deal and it made our visit all the better by its perfect location. Amanda was excellent throughout the process. Would certainly recommend and book again."
2024-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Amanda did a wonderful job as a host. The place was so well decorated and in the cutest location. She was very responsive when I had a couple questions. Amanda even had salon hair products for us to use which was a extra touch that we appreciated. Would definitely stay here again!!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location,listing exactly as described,.the only thing I would add and it’s an easy fix is towel hangers in the bathroom,over the doors or on the backs of the doors,otherwise all was well"
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Amanda was great! We got on at midnight and she was sure to have the lights on for us. Home was beautiful

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Fabulous place!
Lovely communication !
Clean
Well organized and the Aveda products were a great touch❤️"
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"￼Overall, this is a lovely home and great place to stay. The rooms are quite large, and the space is aesthetically pleasing. We did have an issue with Wi-Fi and the door keypad, but Amanda handled it quickly. The only thing I can suggest is to change the door keypad because it was not working correctly. This may be because it rained pretty heavily the first night we were there. With that said, I would not park under the large oak trees on the side street next to Lee’s if it rains. I had a lot of tree debris on my car that was sticky. On the second day, some yard maintenance workers were there about 30 minutes. It was really loud at times which￼ caused a problem with my autistic son. Maybe let customers know ahead of time if you have scheduled yard maintenance."
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place. Loved it!! Had everything we needed and was so nice.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a great place to stay
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very clean and nicely furnished. Amanda was great. Everyone who stayed in the house thought it was well worth the money paid. Cute neighborhood, the only draw back would be, that if you are a light sleeper, the house is on a busier street and can be a little noisy at times. (There is one bedroom, not on the street side.) Even with that, I would gladly stay there again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Lovely, spacious home in the heart of downtown Hammond, LA. Great outdoor space to congregate, comfortable interior, and just the perfect balance of style and comfort."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Very nice play to stay and would go back again.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lovely home in downtown Hammond. Great space with comfortable furniture. We only stayed one night but we would definitely return if we come back to the area. A few things worth mentioning: there is only one tv, so if you are traveling with teens or young kids, sharing may get tricky. Also, the house is directly on a two lane busy street. There is traffic noise all hours of the day and night so if you are a light sleeper this place may be unpleasant. The house is also very close to plenty shopping and restaurants."
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"We made a weekend trip to Hammond with friends and had plans to tailgate in BR for the LSU game, but with the weather predicting rain, we skipped out on tailgating. However, we still managed to have an awesome time exploring Hammond and visiting the local spots in the area, which were all only a short walk from the Airbnb! The location was perfect!! Not having to fight traffic and drive everywhere let us really enjoy our weekend with friends!"

Kitchen: very clean and spacious for cooking (even though we did not cook) she made sure we had snacks for when we got there, as we didn’t get in until midnight. Coffee bar was very well stocked with great choices.

Jovita informed us promptly and kept us informed and up to date! I am absolutely blown away by how hard she worked and all the efforts she put forth to ensure that my family found a safe accommodation alternative relatively nearby. If ever I am in the area again this is the first place I will seek out! Exemplary customer service! I regret that our accommodation fell through due to a bout of very severe unexpected weather. After our transactions with Jovita, Air BnB did a phenomenal job also making sure we had safe accommodations. Nothing went as planned but everyone involved handled it with so much promptness and professionalism!"

Tim is an exceptional host, who communicated readily, providing all the information needed to get settled in and explore the area. I was in town for business, so I did not get to see much of Hammond, unfortunately. The cottage is very well appointed and extremely comfortable. I rested wonderfully after my long days.

I would gladly stay at the cottage again when I return to the area! Thank you, Tim!!!"

The guesthouse offered privacy and the layout of the property gives you space to use the hot tub and cone and go without fear of being a bother to your house. It's charming and comfortable.
A few things of note:

Great smells of ginger and cleanliness
Tim is super responsive yet unobtrusive

Big, comfy beds/ clean, fluffy towels and linens, soft blankets and pillows everywhere, exposed brick, tall ceilings, skylights, great water pressure, very clean, and they made it super easy to find with a slideshow of how to find the right door to enter. They put a pack n play and a high chair in our unit since we have a 2 year old, which was super helpful. We walked to street side market and yellow bird cafe for meals. Farmers market was set up right outside of our place one morning. It was such a wonderful little weekend in downtown. We can’t wait to go back!!"

We loved the walkable location and the easy free parking in the lot right across the street. There is also street parking. The hosts were always very responsive. The one thing to note is that the trains are loud. Didn't bother us but if people are sensitive to sound, it could be an issue...though there is a back bedroom that doesn't get the noise.
We will definitely be back when to Mitch & Jeannie's place when our travels take us back to Hammond."

- Super unique spot in a historical building with exposed brick and adorable decor, just as pictured
- Super clean
- Wonderful layout with plenty of room
- Clear instructions to access and check out (be sure to check out the presentation they send before you arrive and instructions on the fridge for check out)
- Comfortable beds and couch
- Great communication and friendly hosts
Cons:
- This is a second story unit so you are required to carry luggage up the stairs.
- Because the location is downtown, there are a few bars around so if you’re there on a weekend like we were, you may hear much yelling and such into the morning hours
- The train is LOUD and super fast and comes by kind of late so be aware if loud noises bother you
- No hooks for used towels in bathroom and no folding luggage rack
Overall wonderful experience and we would probably stay here again when visiting!"

It is beautiful, convenient and very stylish. The room was very clean and inviting. Great towels and bedding. Shower worked well and the internet service was great.
Be sure to plan on the great farmers market on Saturday morning right across the street. We did hear the train from in the unit but it added to the charm of Hammond.
We will happily stay there again and recommend it whole heartedly."

The decor and amenities were breath taking. Coffee bar was a thoughtful touch. Kitchen was large and stocked…not that you will use it with all the restaurants and cafes nearby. The bathrooms were stocked with lots of soft towels and high end toiletries. The beds and pillows were super comfortable. Large TVs everywhere. Parking right outside entry was convenient. This is the place to stay to experience eclectic downtown Hammond!
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,This was the perfect location with plenty of space for our group of 10 as we came to attend SLU graduation. Host communicated upon booking and prior to our stay to make sure we had all information. House was exactly like pictured and check in code was ready on time.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The home is completely renovated - an HGTV modern remodel. The beds and furniture were very comfortable.

Great hosts and a great experience.

We have family in Hammond and hope to make this our permanent destination whenever we come to town. I can’t imagine a better place to stay. It’s pristine, has lots of room, has a large washer and dryer, crushed ice from the fridge, three full bathrooms, large carport, easy combination door lock, three really nice bedrooms with comfortable beds, and so much more. Can’t say enough nice things about it. Highly recommended!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Will definitely try to rent her place again when visiting.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Location, location, location! This Airbnb is in a prime location. It took me less than 5 minutes to walk to Southeastern’s campus for my conference. Saved me a headache of trying to find guest parking on campus. Then for dinner, it was a 5 minute drive to downtown hammond which had plenty of food options. Thanks Renee for the local suggestions!
The hosts are very responsive and made sure I had everything I needed for a nice stay. This Airbnb had to be one of the nicest I have ever stayed in. Everything was brand new! Not to mention so many beautiful touches throughout the house. I slept great as I drifted into sleep on a comfortable bed. I also liked the covered parking area so I didn’t have to worry about the rain when I arrived.
I had absolutely no issues with my stay. I would highly recommend this house especially anyone with families or anyone having to visit Southeastern’s campus. Open, spacious, and clean. Thanks again!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here while visiting Hammond during Thanksgiving. It had the perfect amount of space for our family of four (2 teenagers). The house was beautifully renovated and had all the amenities that we needed. It even had games and puzzles to keep our family entertained. The beds were extremely comfortable, and we all slept great. It also has a great location close to the college, downtown Hammond and many restaurants. I highly recommend it, and we plan to stay there again the next time we are in Hammond visiting family."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The house was exactly as advertised, totally updated and very roomie. The owners were beyond easy to work with. I would highly recommend this home if you need to be in the area."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location - walkable to park, restaurants, coffee shops, etc. Very clean and had all the amenities we needed during our stay. PHP was responsive and check-in process was very simple. Would definitely stay here again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute little place, perfect for our family. Great location as it is in walking distance to everything! Loved how homey it felt. The live plants and the diffuser with the assortment of oils made us feel right at home. The beds and pillows were perfect for us. I especially loved it had a washer/dryer. We loved the digital keypad entry to the front door as it was convenient and easy to use. Loved the Keurig and the entire coffee setup!
We will be booking this special place again. :)."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at this apartment in downtown Hammond! It was close walking distance to all of our favorite restaurants and the Saturday morning Farmer's Market. There were live bands and the train at night but once in the house (with a sound machine turned up) none of the downtown noises bothered us light sleepers.
Php did a great job in promptly responding and communicating when we reached out. The check in/out process was very easy.
The mattresses were pretty hard and we had a little bit difficult time getting to sleep but hanging out downtown and listening to music until we were worn out made it a little easier to crash at night! I would definitely recommend this apartment if Hammond is your destination!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was just as described. Perfect for a three day stay with my husband and son. I enjoyed the bed and the shower pressure was excellent! A few icks about the place: dust build-up on the nightstands, on the window sills, under the bed, the jets in the tub had hard water build-up and every night there were tons of snails outside the door. One last thing, the departure list was more than what we’re used to-wash the towels, take the trash to the dumpster."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I felt we were accommodated very well. I would recommend this place.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location, very cute, and super clean. Php’s place was the perfect spot for our girls’ weekend. I did not need my car once—we were able to walk everywhere. Will definitely be back!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location, location, location. Tons of restaurants and bars within walking distance. Easy in, easy out. We’ll be back"
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was a great location and loved that we could walk everywhere. Decor was really cute and welcoming. The only complaint was the bed was super hard but some people like that and the train was loud which we knew going it. We brought our sound machine which helped and it was worth it to be so close to everything. I wouldn’t stay long stays due to the bed and my back but other than that it was great!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host everything was as expected
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice stay.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Exceptional location
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great apartment! So many restaurant options nearby and the park across the street came in handy with the kids. The train is loud and frequent, but stops by 9-10pm so it didn’t interfere with sleep. Very clean, cool place to stay."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We were very please and will definitely book this again!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic location. This was a perfect space and had everything we needed during our stay. We will definitely be back!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great host, beautiful place, perfect location, and why I just booked with them again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Looked exactly like the listing. Can’t beat the area with many walkable restaurants and shops from your front door. Located in the middle of downtown so you can see people walking by outside but there were privacy shades throughout the unit. As other reviews noted it’s one block from the train station so you’ll hear very occasional trains. Great amenities inside including large TVs, very comfortable mattress, and lots of coffee. Had a quick question about parking and the owner got back to me ASAP. Wifi was the fastest I’ve seen at a rental. My favorite place that I’ve stayed in Hammond so far!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved it , everyone was just like the pictures ! The space was very nice and clean . It is also a calm and quiet area to be in . Definitely would recommend ."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect place for a family, girl’s getaway, or exploring a new town! Location is great and so close to so many things to do and eat! Passenger railroad train can take you to New Orleans for $6 for more adventures! Host was very responsive and so nice! I plan to book again in near future!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location to many restaurants and the Farmers Market on Saturday. Spacious AirBnB with many amenities. We really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend this AirBnB. The hosts were very responsive and friendly.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a great place to stay and I would stay there again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Second time I’ve stayed here. It is what it says it is. Close to everything. 3 minutes from the college. Can walk to several restaurants and many other things. I’ll be back.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location, location, location...and did we mention spacious. Great location in downtown Hammond walkable to all of downtown. Great restaurants, coffee shops, bars and shopping. In addition, there were 2 fantastic breweries within a short 2 mile drive. Communication from Php was fantastic. We did have an issue getting in at first. Communication was so good that they almost overdid it. Thetell you to download their app which isn't necessary to gain entrance. Took us reading the directions, again, that were emailed in advance of our stay. The apartment was very spacious and not overfurnished leaving plenty of room to make ourselves at home.
We were travelling with 2 small dogs, so the city park diaginally across from the cottage was a plus. We would not hesitate to stay here again. Don't be fooled by a musty smell at check-in as noted in other reviews. It disapates quickly once the AC starts up. Running the ceiling fans, at all time would probably eliminate the issue, altgether."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Throughly enjoyed my stay, everything was clean, location was excellent, I did however notice the connecting space lent itself to peoples private conversations, we heard it just as quickly as we ignored it, would definitely recommend the communication was great and they allowed early entry with our newborn that definitely sealed the experience"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great value. Perfect location. Walkable to multiple shops and restaurants. We did occasionally hear the train at all times of the day. There is a funky smell to the airbnb that I noticed and brought up which the owners were very responsive and brought over an air purifier. It smells more like an old place, musty, however everything was very clean."

If you’re into the nightlife/club scene, this is the place for you. Located in Downtown Hammond, you are within walking distance of several vibrant businesses to choose from.
The train schedule was a surprise, but that’s the type of thing that happens."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hammond is a gem of a town, with a particularly vibrant and walkable downtown with dining, shopping and entertainment. This property is as close to perfect as is possible in its location. It's practically in view of the Amtrak station, and literally the middle of the downtown scene. The Southeastern Louisiana campus is only a five minute walk away. The property is a well-equipped, clean, cute and functional respite from a long day of enjoying everything Hammond has on offer. The kitchen is well set up. The bath even has a whirlpool tub! At the end of the stay, check out is super simple with few steps. No hotels put you car free in the middle of downtown the way this place does!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location but a bit loud due to it being downtown if you were looking for quiet.

2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"I’ve stayed at several Airbnb properties over the years. This home is #1 on my list of places I’ve stayed! Everything as advertised. Such a beautiful and very well appointed home and nicely decorated. It’s obvious the home is well taken care of. So very comfortable and welcoming, plus loved all the nice personal touches that made us feel that way. When we return to Hammond, LA again, I have an easy decision when it comes to accommodations. This is the place I will be looking to book first. Thank you so much for a wonderful stay!"

There were snacks laid out for us, plenty of coffee and accessories available along with laundry and dish washing supplies. This is a first for us! We travel a lot and we’ve never had this offered, and we were also able to choose our own check in code. That’s makes things so much easier when you have a busy weekend! We went for a soccer tournament, and it was very easily accessible to the park, and places to eat and shop, all within less than 15 minutes. We will definitely book again! PS: we highly recommend this house and Aguacates Mexican restaurant!!"

We will definitely stay here again when in the area!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful visit at the Hammond Hideaway and loved greeting the cattle across the street each day before we ventured out. The house was conveniently located to the main street that had all the necessary amenities as well as a short driving distance from the Southeastern Louisiana campus.
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,I cannot say enough good things about this place. This has is so gorgeous on the inside. They went above and beyond to make sure that you had everything you needed!

I can really give a 5 page essay, about me and my family’s stay at, Carla’s place.
ThIS home is really exceptional! The description and photos are accurate and home is even better in person. This home is beautiful, comfortable and VERY CLEAN! Instantly, feels like home when you enter. The house has everything that you and your family may need, from cooking, laundry, cleaning, disinfectant and bandaids! Everything! Home is located near several great restaurants, and shopping. I highly recommend this home, if you’re visiting Hammond. My husband and I expressed this is now, “our home way from home”, whenever we visit Louisiana. Carla went out of way to ensure we felt welcomed. Left nice notes around the home and snacks, that our children thoroughly enjoyed. Carla, thank you again for hosting this beautiful, warm home and showing that great southern hospitality, to us.😊"

I was apprehensive traveling alone to an unfamiliar area , however, I always felt safe on my morning walks, and returning home after dark. Beth was a perfect host , answering all my questions about the area, and making some great recommendations to try. The space, well, words can not do it justice. When I walked in the door, I felt like I was home. All the little touches, from local LA snacks to fresh coffee beans, beautifully decorated, white glove clean, and even a personal welcome note. Beth thought of everything.
I will definitely return on my next visit to the area."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beth's guest house was wonderful! The place is extremely clean and neat with everything needed for a fantastic stay.
The guest house is private and quiet. There's great heat for the chilly nights, and the parking was right outside the door. The kitchen had a Keurig, a stove, and a full-size fridge. There's a work area with a printer and a nice little table by the kitchen. The tv has lots of choices-
The main part of Hammond is right down the road, maybe 1/2 a mile, where there's a very nice modern type coffee shop located in an old drugstore building from 1896.
I'm challenged when it comes to lock boxes, I can't ever figure them out, but Beth responded right away, and I was able to get the key. I came and went as I needed.
I loved Beth's guest house and would definitely stay there again when I'm in town! It was a little oasis from the conference I was attending and also while I was dealing with a difficult family matter at the time!"

Jessica provided all directions and check in information in a timely manner. She was a super responsive host throughout including promptly answering our very early Sunday morning 911 email. When we thought we were locked out (we weren’t - just delirious without enough coffee yet!) she called us right away and was ready to drive over to help! We found the loft equipped with everything including extras we might need, good snacks and coffee. The studio has a nice vibe, is spacious, clean, comfy, and full of original art and local Louisiana decor. Highly recommend!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved this little spot!! Jessica was such a great host. If i had one complaint, it'd be that the mattress on the bed is so incredibly firm. I love a good firm mattress but that was tough to sleep on for me. Everything else was great though. Jessica was super sweet and responsive and I loved getting to be right down the street from some of the local businesses I often find myself coming to Hammond for.
We will definitely be back ◡̈"

The apartment is fully equipped, cooking is not a problem, everything is available for this. Also, the apartment has a washing machine and clothes dryer. Everything is within walking distance and right in front of the door is a parking lot ( about 12 vehicles ) for the rental car. Hammond University is also within walking distance.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jessica was proactive in communicating with us, making sure everything met our expectations. Her place was spacious and stylish, clean, and well-stocked. One word of caution if you're a light sleeper, use a white noise app...the parking lot noise woke us both nights, 3:30 am food service delivery to the restaurants and some rowdy partiers-none of which is a reflection on Jessica as a hostess, just simply the location."

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place in the heart of downtown! Jessica made the stay very comfortable. She also ensured that I had a fun trip and made the whole process very easy. Will book again on my next trip!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is in a great location in downtown Hammond. I am originally from Hammond, but I live in Chicago. My husband and I came into town for my class reunion, so we decided to try something different rather than staying with family. We had the best time! This place made us feel like we were on a weekend getaway - a vacation in our hometown.
This place is within walking distance to every restaurant in the downtown area. We were able to try out some new restaurants, plus visit some old ones, and we just enjoyed the experience of what downtown Hammond has to offer.
The place itself is very charming and comfortable with plenty of space for two people. It was quite at night, so you can definitely get a good night’s sleep, and you can hear the hustle bustle of the surrounding businesses during the day, but that didn’t bother us at all because we weren’t there half the time during the day anyway.
The communication with Jessica was great. Whenever I sent her a message, she responded pretty quickly and was very nice.
Overall, I would definitely recommend this place. I’m for sure going to recommend this to some of my friends who live out of state but come back to Hammond for frequent visits. Thank you, Jessica!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was everything and more than hoped for! Very clean. Very safe feeling… Although I didn’t meet the owners they were always available to communicate and accommodate. I’d love to stay here again!

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I booked this for my wedding suite for my girls and I to get ready and for my wedding night. It was simply perfect!!!! We definitely will be back as we stay in Hammond! ♥️
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The host was very flexible, communicated effectively and provideda very nice place to stay while visiting beautiful downtown Hammond. Highly recommend."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My job had me come out to the area to assess the damage from Hurricane Ida. There were little to no hotels available for me to stay that were within a reasonable driving distance. My wife came across this location, and based on the reviews I committed to it quickly.
The loft is right in the middle of Hammand, LA, a college town I had not heard of before this trip. The town is lively, with several great food options as well as quite a few bars. The town overall a fun time.
The loft was clean, stocked with snacks and water, and was a breathe of fresh air from the usual stale hotel chains I tend to stay at for work. It has all the ammenities you need. The hospitality provided by Jessica is hard to beat. I would 100% recommend staying here."

Jessica’s loft was spacious, clean, and cozy. She provided waters, beers from local brewhouses, snacks, and plenty of linens for our stay. If we’re ever in the area again we’ll be booking here. Great loft for the value."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay! VERY clean and such a cute place! Jessica gave very detailed instructions on how to access the alley loft and was always quick to respond. It’s in the perfect location for walking to restaurants. Yellow Bird Cafe is a must for breakfast!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jessica, I’ve stayed at a LOT of AirBnBs… like, a lot. This is the most thoughtfully equipped setup I’ve ever seen. You’ve thought of everything. Sauces, q-tips, makeup remover, corkscrews. I’m through the roof. The style and decor is rad. The location is incredible. This is a gem. Thank you."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was quiet, clean but still up in the mix of the downtown area. The atmosphere was so comforting with the exciting feel of a NY loft apartment.

Hammond lies about an hour drive north of New Orleans--a bit longer if you drive the causeway across Lake Pontchartrain (which everyone should do at least once, but you may want to do again).
 
Hammond's historic neighborhood, around East Thomas Street, is small but is and full of great shopping and restaurant choices. We stayed in an apartment above a  salon. One bedroom and bath, a good size living room/kitchen area, cable television and internet.
 
Street parking only, but we had no problem finding a spot right outside our front door. That ""front door"" is in the alley behind the salon. Not the greatest first impression, but the apartment itself is quite fine with vintage brick and very well appointed It is also totally quiet and private. We will definitely stay here again.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jessica was a great host. She was very communicative, and I was grateful she was able to accommodate an early check-in."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jessica was absolutely the best owner I’ve ever dealt with renting a condo or apartment! She will go above and beyond to help you! The apartment is adorable and in the heart of downtown Hammond!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This must be the most beautifully decorated and bright and airy space to stay in the area! The art work adds color and interest; the king size bed with extra pillows is ultra comfy and the breakfast nook and sitting areas are spacious to relax in.Jessica went above and beyond to provide everything one might need! Loved that fresh coffee plus filters are provided and even snacks and all toiletries! The air conditioning was perfect, too! Jessica is a great hostess and responds immediately. The location is perfect for walking access to the many wonderful food and drink venues of this historic town.We know we picked the very best place to stay and had a great time!"

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Jessica's place is Amazing! So great I really didn't want to tell everyone because I want it to myself lol. Being a business owner I know how much reviews help so that's why I'm not going to be selfish and leave one for her :-) Jessica responds very quickly and was an absolute pleasure to work with. We also met her husband outside of the apartment a couple times and he was just as kind and friendly! This place is a little hidden gem right smack in the middle of the best places fro drinks and food. We loved being able to just walk out the door and have cocktails or eat! So many great places all around to choose from. I will tell you that we always needed up downstairs at a place called Tacos and Beer for drinks and late night snacks! Also Cate Street Seafood Station is a must for seafood or my favorite the Cate Street Sushi Roll!!!! Right across the street at Red White and Brew you can have your favorite beverage to include hundreds and wine! I went over on Saturday and caught some great live entertainment as well!!! The apartment was very nice and the bed and bedding was great! She also provided us with an assortment of little snacks that was very appreciated! The apartment had everything so no need to bring anything to this place. If you get a chance and this place is available I Highly Recommend it!!! Overall this place is a solid 5 STARS!!!! Thank you Jessica for sharing your little slice of paradise with us! We can't wait to stay again! THANK YOU!

2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was mine and my partner’s first time in Louisiana and we enjoyed staying in Ponchatoula over New Orleans. Luke’s place was cozy and walking distance to great restaurants. We walked to Paul’s Cafe and Toula Burger Co. Having an AC in the AirBnb was great! Being from the Pacific Northwest, we weren’t used to the humidity."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We very much enjoyed our stay at the location. It placed us close to relatives in Covington but with a new set of sights to see in town and in the area.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Luke's apartment is the right plan.
45 min from New Orleans by car, her apartment is large, bright, super comfortable and tastefully decorated.
It is more than perfect for people who want to be near NOLA without having the noise from the city.
On the price side, it's a rare find during Mardi Gras.
We were delighted to stay here, Luke is super responsive and adorable. Some snacks in the area are available (it's always nice when you arrive a little late)
In short, you couldn't dream better than starting our vacation!
A real joy to be in Ponchatoula at Luke's:)"

The cottage is equipped with everything you need and quite comfortable. I'm a fan and recommend this cottage.
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"There was the present of a odor. I do not know where it was coming from, and did not complain as I was there for a funeral, and knew I would be in and out. I do not know if there was a great deal of time before we were the guests, but the cream that was left for coffee, was rock solid. Minor issue, but somewhat important. and a inconvience. Overall very quiet, nice area, and kind of vintage setting of Louisiana's southern charm."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Lovely little apartment in a quiet, safe neighborhood that is close to downtown. When you enter, it smells very clean, and like a spa. It was within walking distance to Stowaway Coffehouse, Paul's Cafe and Berrytown Cafe that we frequented often during our stay. The faint sound of church bells and a distant train whistle were soothing and made you feel like you had stepped into a time of long ago. Luke was very responsive to all communication."

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Luke’s place was great. I enjoyed the natural light through all the windows and it had a great feel. The neighborhood is nice and convenient to walk to town for food.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was THE cutest little place to stay. We drove all the way in from San Diego and definitely needed some comfort and quiet and we got exactly that. It was so spacious and the decor was on point! Would definitely stay again

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed for the weekend with our grown granddaughter and our great grandson and we had a great time. The cottage is cute and picturesque with some great windows. Luke was a very nice man and very interesting to chat with. He was also very responsive to our needs. More than 2 people can stay here but I think its perfect for a couple. Television in two areas and the master bedroom mattress was remarkably comfortable. As you can see in the pictures the access is upstairs so keep that in mind if you have bad knees but we felt like it was definitely worth the visit and hope to stay there again. Everyone in our party was happy.
If you stay tell Luke Mike and Donna say hey!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay for your Pontchatoula visit!
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Luke was a great host with a comfortable, roomy, and stylish place to stay. The bed was super comfortable and so was the couch! The kitchen was fully functional, and we used the stove, oven, toaster oven, fridge/freezer, and coffee maker while we were there. The place was decorated well, comfortable and enjoyable to come back to at the end of a great day in the Louisiana outdoors! Luke spent some time checking in with us when we were there and offered suggestions for us on things to do and see and where to eat in the area."

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Cottage is a superb place to stay for your trip to Ponchatoula! Close to all the hot spots in Hammond/Ponchatoula, and directly across from a park. The bed is extremely comfortable and the kitchen is well appointed. You will not regret reserving this for your stay."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We came to stay for just a couple days to escape the chaos of hurricane delta aftermath.
We were without power and just wanted a comfy place to stay and this was perfect. Very kid friendly; our daughter had a great time and loved the park across the street."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and value. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. They do not offer ESPN so if you are a big sports fan, you need to make other plans to watch a big game. We will definitely be staying here in the future when visiting our son."

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If ever in the area again we would stay there again. We always have a great time in Ponchatoula!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Luke’s place was excellent. I booked due to the location which was perfect. It was less than 2 miles away from the venue I was getting married at. He even went so far as to leave a card and bottle of wine for my husband and I the night after our wedding. The apartment was just as pictured. Thanks Luke
2020-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfectly clean, had great AC, and was in the ideal location for our trip. You only have to walk a couple minutes to get to restaurants, plus the park right across the street made a perfect spot to visit with my nephews and niece. The only thing we didn't love about our stay was the very low water pressure in the shower, which made taking a shower a very long ordeal. Luke said this was due to an unexpected problem with the city, and since everything else about this place was great, I would still recommend this airbnb to anyone."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a cute and cozy place. Great location and the bed was super comfortable!
2020-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Apartment was very nice and great location.

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We very much enjoyed our stay. The apartment was very clean and cozy. Luke is a pleasant host.
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thought it was such a cute and quaint airbnb! Very clean and stylish, the bed was incredibly comfortable, and the little town was so cute!"
2020-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,This above the garage apartment has been updated with vinyl plank wood floors throughout and nicely painted walls and ceilings giving it a nice open and modern feel. It is up a flight of 17 steps and overlooks the owners backyard. It is in a very safe environment and is situated directly across the street from a city park that has a nice playground for children and a great walking path. The unit has charm and is equiped with an apartment sized refrigerator/freezer as well as a range so you can have the convenience of a kitchen during your stay. The bathroom is small but adequate not much counter space but there is a mirrored medicine cabinet above the sink which helps to store your things. I enjoyed an extended stay here recently and would say that the only negative is the lack of water pressure in the shower. The wi-fi worked really well and there is plenty of storage in the apartment. The bed was very comfortable. I would suggest you bring a sleep mask if you like to sleep late as there is a lot of natural light that streams into the bedroom. I would not recommend using the fold out bed on the couch as it is extremely uncomfortable - there is plenty of room in the living room to bring a blowup mattress if you need to sleep more than two guests.
2020-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great host and stay!
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I can’t say enough about this lovely Airbnb! Bed super comfortable, kitchen very adequate for making meals, quiet and peaceful. We will definitely be back!"

2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very pleasantly surprised! Super cute inside, nice neighborhood, privacy, and near lots of places to eat/shop. There was plenty of space for myself, my husband, and our two daughters who are 1 and 2 years old. We would stay here again in the future."
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The carriage house is exactly like it looks in the photos. The bed is soft and comfortable. Plenty of pillows and blankets and towels. Everything I needed. Plus a short walk to the cute town square. Thanks!!
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Luke’s space is adorable and centrally located. I booked the space for my bridal party and I to get ready for my wedding and Luke was totally okay with that. The space was perfect for photos and spacious enough for all of us to be comfortable. Highly recommend!
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,This place is the best. Very quick and private. Mr. Luke answered any question I had very quickly. Soon as you walk in you will be amazed to see how beautiful it is and how wonderful it smells.

2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,So much more beautiful than the pictures can show! And right across from a park! Overall a very nice stay.
2019-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Very cute apartment. It had a nice feel about it. Snack were left for us on the table. That was a nice
touch. The space itself was clean, if only a bit dusty. My only real complaint was that the walkway, the stairs leading up to the apartment and the porch area were extremely dirty. Definitely needs to be power washed. Also, cigarettes butts in an ashtray on the deck from previous guests. First impressions are everything, and this was a poor first impression.
On a positive note...most comfy Airbnb bed I’ve ever slept in. Kudos for comfort!!"

2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"One word to describe my experience, awesome. Very beautiful space that was sparkling clean. Location was ideal as my family spent one day in New Orleans and another in my hometown of Kentwood. Also the space is in a very nice neighborhood. Highly recommend if you want to spend the day in the city but come back to a cozy space."

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying here! Was worried on the size as we were bringing our 11 month old along. However, the apartment was much bigger than anticipated and there was a perfect little nook where we stashed his pack and play! Great get away and such a cute little place!"
2019-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Super communication from the owners, and they checked in with us to make sure all was good when we got there. The rooms where tidy and trendy (beautiful white and gold accents) and small ""treats"" which were a nice touch. Bed was super comfy, and my biggest compliment is the bathroom (I'm picky) as it was very clean and quaint. They might want to put a ""watch your head"" or paint a bright color on the overhang above the stairs, tall guys helping their wives with lots of pillows and bags might miss it 😉. VERY QUIET area and lots of peace from traffic and people... You won't be disappointed!"

2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot for the Hammond/Ponchatoula area. Luke was kind and very easy to communicate with. The Main king bed is great, Sofa bed was pretty uncomfortable. Would stay again 👌🏻"
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Let me tell y’all about this place. Right off the bat, I give this place a 12/10. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.
First, the place itself is super adorable. We thought it was above the house, but it’s not. It’s above the garage in a separate building, so we didn’t see or hear the hosts at all except for our initial check in, which we prefer in our Airbnb’s. Everything was super clean, lots of stuff available if you forgot anything at home bath wise and some snacks and such. The neighborhood was cute. Small corner cafe right around the block.
Second, although we didn’t communicate with Luke a *ton,* he responded quickly, was accommodating of our late arrival due to road trip delays, and sent us to eat amazing fried chicken when we finally made it there exhausted. He was very friendly and made himself available to us if we needed him at all, which was nice.
Third, we went into the city for lunch, then went back to the house with the intent to take a quick hour nap and then head back into the city for dinner and drinks....but instead we slept 15 hours straight, and we were completely happy with it. The bed is so comfortable, I could have stayed in it the whole time we were down there. I slept like a starfish and still wasn’t touching my boyfriend. The comforter is fluffy but not too hot. Best bed I ever slept in. The AC unit is a little loud, but I found the hum of it comforting, and it was very efficient in keeping the place as cool or as warm as you want it.
I was very surprised at how nice the little place was, we even joked about moving in. Well worth every dollar we paid to stay there, and I would definitely recommend checking it out. Its one of the nicest, most comfortable Airbnb’s we have stayed in. It was the best part of our trip and we greatly enjoyed it!! :)"

,,,House was clean check in was smooth but the owner flip out on us because we pulled off 30 mins late told me I wasn’t getting a penny back for a deposit because it was make up on the pillow cases that are washable lol we smoked on backporch she said we smoked in her house she kept coming in leaving notes when we would leave and come back to the notes I just think she shouldn’t do air Bnb she should just rent her property out with lease agreements she’s not ready for the air bnb life lol
