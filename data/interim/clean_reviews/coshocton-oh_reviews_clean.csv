2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A little difficult to find, but a nice gem off the beaten path. Very quiet and relaxing getaway with wonderful secluded hot tub to relax after long day of hiking"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Barb‚Äôs place was a great place to stay. Private,relaxing,clean,comfortable, couldn‚Äôt really ask for anything more. Didn‚Äôt want to leave and would suggest to anyone. Hope to go back to the area sometime and would book this place again in a heartbeat üëç"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our weekend getaway at this charming cottage was absolutely unforgettable! From the moment we arrived, we were enchanted by the beautifully curated interior and the picturesque surroundings. The hot tub was a dreamy oasis, providing the perfect way to unwind after our adventures in Amish country. Fishing by the cottage, cozying up in the super comfortable bed, and roasting marshmallows over the fire made for cherished memories. Exploring nearby attractions like Sugarcreek, fondly known as 'little Switzerland,' and the historic Roscoe village added to the magic of our stay. The only slight downside was the sulfur smell in the well water, which took some getting used to. However, it was a minor inconvenience compared to the overall perfection of our weekend retreat. Without a doubt, one of the best weekends we've ever had!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had very specific plans about our Ohio trip and the gravel bike riding near Barb's place we hoped to complete. The weather, too, had very specific, and unrelenting, plans that held our plans in very low regard. Barb was so incredibly responsive to the myriad severe weather-related issues that arose; she is simply the best! Her little cottage was a warm and cozy place to hunker down in during the storms, and was a welcoming spot for the sunny days, too. The cottage is peaceful and quiet, but is close to wineries, Wooly Pig Brewery, and the places that attract visitors."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Only stayed one night there, but it was beautiful, came at a bad time so the river was flooded so we couldn‚Äôt enjoy the fire pit, but the hot tub was nice, the cat was so friendly and cute, which made it an even better experience! Host was available the entire time when we needed help. Would definitely come back again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was perfect and very cozy!!!! Just what we were looking for!!! Barb was great!!!! Even when mother nature threw us a curve ball, she was right there with the support and service needed. Will definitely book again. Thanks Barb!!!!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was very peaceful and nice. The hot tub was great. We didn‚Äôt get to have a fire due to the wood being wet but that‚Äôs no big deal. Inside electric fireplaces were a nice touch. Would love to come when the weather is warmer and do some kayaking and fishing !
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Barb responded very quickly and wished us safe travels back home! The cabin is very homey and serene, with a hot tub and great amenities."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,it was a great get away from every day life. it was nice to just kick back and relax. it was cozy and very welcoming. would definitely recommend
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Barb‚Äôs cottage was a really nice space. We were there in early spring and the wildflowers were already bursting. I‚Äôm sure in the summer and fall months the surroundings would be gorgeous. Did not get to use the hot tub or the out door fire place or pit by the river due to the weather but I‚Äôm sure those are really nice. I would definitely recommend the cabin to others. Barb was a great host and had everything we could need in place. It was very clean and well decorated.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Barb was absolutely amazing. we had an issue that was completely out of her control and she was on top of it and had it all fixed by the nights end. the place was as absolutely beautiful was so sad to leave. will definitely be returning
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,perfect weekend getaway spot
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great hide away place!!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Barb was an awesome and accommodating host. She made sure grill had propane, hot tub had filter, and even dropped us off some waters. If you‚Äôre looking for a peaceful/ relaxing weekend at a fair price along with some cozy decor this is it! Thanks Barb üôèüèº
With the cold weather the hot tub can while to heat up to desired temp (We like between 100-102). So be sure to set it as soon as you arrive. Also the bubble feature drops the water temperature very fast in the cold, if you want to keep it warm. But hot tub felt amazing, just thought I‚Äôd share our insights!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cute, clean place. Great location, easy to find & Walmart is only 10 mins away. Felt likely a home away from home with how cozy this was decorated. The back patio and heated sheet was definitely my two favorites!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My parents stayed at this location for their wedding anniversary to get away for a weekend. There was some concern for the snow and temperature for the weekend, but it ended up not being an issue at all. They had nothing but great things to say! They had one little hiccup turning the hot tub on, but sad that Barb was very responsive! They said they would go back in a heartbeat!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"as soon as you pull up to the cabin, it grabs your attention because it is so cute and quaint. When you walk in, it wraps you in a hug because of how cozy it is!!

It's definitely a great stay!"

She had plenty of things to do on the property from having a fire pit, a grill, and hot tub on the outside to providing a nice kitchen, board games, and TV inside! Her cabin is a peaceful place and was a great escape for us! I have already recommended her place to several of my friends!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Very peaceful. Just what i needed to get away for a few days. If you do stay, please feed the cat that comes to visit at night. If you get hungry try The Warehouse, it was very good."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I celebrated our one year anniversary and wanted to stay the weekend somewhere peaceful. Barb's cottage was the perfect spot for serenity and beautiful surrounding. Her place was very cute and very clean. It had everything we needed and we enjoyed the quiet away from the city. I would highly recommend this as an escape from your daily, busy life. Thank you Barb for opening your home to us!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful cozy place. It was a wonderful get away. My boyfriend and I loved how clean and cozy the place was. Definitely will be staying there again!!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was as advertised. Everything was clean. Everything worked as expected. They have thought of everything and I would definitely stay here again?
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful cabin out of the way of the hustle and bustle. My husband and I enjoyed our stay for our annual fall get away. Make sure you follow the directions given by Barb to get to the cabin, Apple maps will take you just past the drive to an abandoned cabin. After we realized that, we were able to turn around and go down the driveway.
The pictures of the cabin do not do it justice. I didn't realize there are actually two beds upstairs and a couch downstairs with a TV. There is wifi that works, which was super helpful because our phones don't get good signal there. The cabin was decorated super cute for fall which made us feel right at home. There were plenty of fireplaces and even an air conditioner up stairs if needed for the summer season.
The only thing I would have liked is to have a TV upstairs as well but most people won't be spending much time watching TV anyway. We enjoyed making a fire out back and getting in the hot tub as well. Definitely will be back!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quaint little cottage in a beautiful location. Place is very well kept and nicely decorated. The out door location is stunning. The back patio is just amazing, with the fireplace and the hot tub. A very nice anniversary weekend!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Barbs place was the perfect little getaway me and my husband needed. It‚Äôs secluded but not too secluded. Barb was a great at host. The AirBNB had everything we needed and then some. We would definitely stay again if we visit the area in the future!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect spot for a getaway. Very clean, the bed was comfortable and the hot tub and outdoor fire place was wonderful."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place. Very nice host.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, peaceful, secluded place. Nice little getaway! Will be back!"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The pros: This place is gorgeous! It‚Äôs looks decorated by a designer. So pretty and so homey. It was immaculate. No dirt anywhere. The beds were comfortable and the bedroom is huge! There‚Äôs another double bed upstairs that you can‚Äôt see in the pictures. The back porch is so cute! We really enjoyed the huge fireplace and making s‚Äômores. The home was very well equipped. The host responded quickly to my questions. The host had the place decorated so cute for fall with pumpkins, cornstalks and leaves.
The cons: The cabin is out in the country but the cabin sits about 20 feet off of a gravel road. There are 2-3 houses at the end of the road so there were quite a few cars coming and going in the morning and at night. We were there on a Sunday night.
We noticed the smell of the well water as soon as we entered the cabin. It smells very sulfurous. We are city people so we were not used to it. Not sure if a water softener or filtration system would help."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!! Just as described!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place and area. Barb was very responsive if we needed her. Also, it was nice accidentally meeting her as we were leaving! Highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,stayed at barbs place while me and my wife were getting married this weekend in coshocton and it was perfect for us. hot tub fire place secluded and quiet. very comfortable bed and close to everything in coshocton‚Ä¶ not far from amish country either‚Ä¶ do yourself a favor if you need a quiet get away in nature check this place out
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the cutest, most perfect place for a peaceful 10 year anniversary getaway away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Barb was the best host. Her place was very clean and had everything we needed to feel welcome and at home."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Adorable little cabin. We played board games, went for a walk and just reconnected. The home was very clean and she had everything you may need! We had an issue and texted Barb she immediately answered and offered to call. Definitely an amazing anniversary celebration."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you're looking for a retreat to escape to for a ""reset"" this is an excellent option!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was exactly what I needed the past few days. I enjoyed everything there from the fire pit near the creek to the covered back porch. It rained one day so I sat and listened to it hit the tin roof. And who can forget the hot tub. The house was decorated beautifully and felt like a home away from home.
Barb was extremely helpful when I had a question and got back to me right away! I would definitely stay there again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a cozy and well decorated cottage that was wonderful for a peaceful and quiet getaway. Loved the visit and how Barb very thoughtfully provided a relaxing stay.
2023-09-01,2.0,Stayed one night,The inside was nice. The water had a really bad smell when turning on in shower or faucets. My husband and I had to use a whole can of fogger both front porch and back area due to so many spiders. The back area furniture and front had spider webs and dusty. The inside fixtures had spider webs. I was unable to get any sleep due to my phobia of bugs and the attention my spouse and I had to clean and spray and wasn‚Äôt able to really enjoy the outside amenities.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This peaceful and super cute cabin was just what I needed for a relaxing couple of days. The cabin was even nicer than the pictures depict. Beautiful surroundings. We used both fire pits and enjoyed them very much. I even took one of the kayaks out on the river for an 8 mile trip and that made the stay even better! Barb was very helpful and responsive to questions I had regarding kayaking, she even offered to pick me up after my trip which I thought was such a lovely gesture! Definitely recommend this place and can‚Äôt wait to return sometime in the future.
I would suggest bringing your own drinking water and a couple gallons to have on hand for cooking etc."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super cute place, we very much enjoyed it!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was perfect for a quiet girls weekend! The river fire pit was the perfect location for deep conversations and girl talk.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"it was nice, clean and quiet. Barb was a great host."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our stay! It was so peaceful and exactly what we were looking for. We celebrated our 17th wedding anniversary!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice quiet little cottage. Looked just like the photos. Barb was very nice and responsive. We had a good time. We couldn't go for a walk because of it being on a private road, so the neighbor made sure to tell us we weren't allowed to walk up the road. Also, there were lots of bugs and we wish we knew it was well water and it smelled like rotten eggs, but that's country life for you."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Barb‚Äôs cottage was beautiful! Such a nice quiet getaway, we will be back üòä"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The photos don‚Äôt do this spot justice. It‚Äôs absolutely serene and gorgeous. We will be back.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cutest farmhouse decor inside a cozy cabin. We relaxed on the patio most of our stay.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice little place for a relaxing few days away while golfing at some of the local courses üòä
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stay was great! Do agree with previous patrons, waters is quite intimidating. Beautiful area and was wonderful place to come back to for relaxation and quiet. Would stay again for sure!!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. Barb responded very quickly.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"So many personal touches (bug spray, flash lights, popcorn, coffee, cream, candles, etc...) made this an amazing little getaway. It was exactly what I needed to escape my busy city living. I will be going back soon!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay for me and my new wife!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Barb is an amazing host, the best I've had so far! The cabin is out in the middle of nowhere for complete peace! The kayaking and the beautiful town and good restaurants are all worth it!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice little get away
Location is within minutes of many restaurants and shops"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay at Barb‚Äôs. She was so accommodating. The hot tub was our favorite part. Everything was so clean, and the surroundings were so private. Be prepared for a lot of bugs outside (as you are in the woods), but Barb had already left bug spray and citronella candles that helped us a lot. As other reviews noted, the water does smell slightly off, but there was plenty of bottled water already in the fridge. Thank you, Barb! We plan on coming back!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I booked River‚Äôs Rest because I needed some time for reflection and relaxation. I got exactly what I was seeking!
Barb was more than a gracious hostess and made me feel safe as a single female traveling to an unfamiliar area. She offered suggestions and guidance for what I wanted to do during my stay.
The photos on the website accurately show how lovely the home is, and since they were taken, Barb has even added some lovely touches to the back deck area, which is where I spent most of my time listening to the sounds of nature all around me.
I am absolutely keeping this cabin in my favorites list because when I need to gather my thoughts, this is the perfect place!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place. So many personal touches and amenities from the grill, outdoor fireplace, hot tub and kayaks. We used them all and had a great time!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"barb's place was amazing, I recommend the fire pit and hot tub! she was responsive and polite, an amazing host! will most definitely stay again soon!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,So much better than expected!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Barbs place was amazing, we only had time to sleep and do a quick dip in the tub because we‚Äôre on a road trip, but it was the most relaxing 6 hours regardless. The water does smell like sulphur but Barb puts plenty of bottled water in the fridge. I‚Äôm sad we couldn‚Äôt explore more and highly recommend staying at least two days."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a very peaceful retreat for my fianc√© and I. I wish we could have kayaked but the water was dry right in front of the cabin.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We wanted to take a break from the hustle of the city. This was the perfect place. It was super cozy. I loved the fluffy blankets to wrap up in while we watched TV. The bed was comfy. Wish we would have known about the well water (strong sour egg smell), we would have brought more water. The only place we went to was the Coshocton Lake Park, for a morning walk. I dont drink but the winery's looked super cute. We had a really peaceful weekend and would most definitely recommend!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I absolutely loved the property. Everything was clean and in place and she has really gone above and beyone to make someone comfortable. My only issue was the egg smelling water. I know its a well thing, we had this issue at my home but after our filtration system that smell is gone. Other than that loved it all!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very lovely weekend with my fiance. Would love to come back soon
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a great little spot.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bikers Respite
We needed rest and relaxation after a long bike ride. If you love twists, curves and uphill riding, you will want to ride to Fink‚Äôs Harley in Zanesville (50 mins). You will receive your map and patches for the Triple Nickel.
The countryside is zen, cows, horses and tractors! After a long ride, we stopped by Buehler‚Äôs food market. The kitchen has everything you need to prepare yummy meals. You will want to sit out back to enjoy the sound of birds and watch the sunset. Put on the off!
The location is peaceful and private for the most part. Neighbors are close by and were tending the fields (tractor work) at 9p. Soft tunes and television volumes did the trick!
Barb is amazing. She is a proactive and responsive communicator, which I loved. The cottage looks just like the pics. Super cute and cozy. Amenities were lovely. The wifi TV, coffee and special treat are an added bonus. You will want to experience this oasis."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Book this charming little escape! This small cabin is like new and decorated to feel like home. The open floor plan felt spacious for such a small footprint. And there are lots of windows and lights to keep things feeling bright and airy. The back deck is like a tiny oasis with a hot tub, comfy chairs and an outdoor fireplace. And the host, Barb, is so helpful, friendly, and even invited us out to her dairy farm to see the cows!
A few things to keep in mind to make your stay super pleasant:
1. You are in the woods. On a river. You'll appreciate bug spray and a citronella candle or two for the front and back porch areas.
2. The well water has a sulfur smell. Bring a couple gallons of filtered water with you and you'll be fine.
3. When you leave the house and want to lock the door, push the big button on the door lock for a second or two and then pull the doorknob so the deadbolt can slide. It's the tiniest bit off.
Go book your stay already! And be sure to tell Barb hello."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My stay at Barb‚Äôs place was great. We had a fun night in Roscoe Village and came back to enjoy the hotub. Even though you can see the neighbors it was very quiet and felt private. Overall this was a great stay!
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"My four sisters and I, had a wonderful,relaxing, safe visit. The home is beautiful, warm and comfortable."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Lavon was an excellent host, I would definitely stay at home again, I felt at home!!!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is actually nicer than depicted on line. This was our second stay here and we are very much looking forward to the same time next year. We asked if we could check in a bit earlier than 4:00pm due a long trip to the house and Lavon graciously aloud us to check in early.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I stayed here a few weeks and I can say that it was the best experience I have had, the house was very clean and matched the listing photos, Lavon is a very attentive and friendly host, I would stay here again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was down a country road off the beating path. Had 3 comfortable bedrooms and plenty of kitchen space and utensils to prep a breakfast. There was no tv which i completely didn't notice in the pictures, but wasn't a big deal as thats not why we were there. It provided a peaceful home base to check out some local wineries and coffee spots."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a cozy, beautiful home. I would love to stay here again next year for the holidays! It was so clean and beautifully decorated. The washer and dryer was amazing as well as coffee pot for the coffee lovers. Very spacious as well."
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Was are second year in a row staying there for our hunting trip! Everything was perfect!!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is by far one of the nicest homes we have ever stayed in. Its immaculately clean, welcoming, and the beds are so comfortable. There is so much to do in the area, but relaxing on the porch is also such a great place to restore one's own inner peace. We love the sounds of the fish ponds nearby, the nature all around, and just the peacefulness. The porch furniture is so nice too. It's a wonderful place to stay. We love it there."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time we've stayed here, and we plan to come back! Lavon and Rachel are so sweet and quick to respond to any questions or needs. We had an issue with not having hot water, and the issue was addressed and fixed within an hour
The house is nicely furnished with comfy couches and fuzzy blankets if you get cold. The fire pit is great for those cool nights. I will say the beds are pretty firm, so if you like a soft mattress, you will probably not sleep well.
We love that it's off the beaten path, yet still close to area attractions. All in all, this is a great place to stay, and I would highly recommend it!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Of all the airbnbs we've stayed in over the years, this was one of the nicest we've stayed in. So much room with every comfort provided. Everything was top-quality! A beautiful, private, lovely place to stay. Definitely worth the cost."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Highly recommend! Roomy, comfortable, great furniture, lovely views"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a nice house in a quiet rural location, not far from Roscoe Village, Wooly Pig Farm Brewery etc. The house was very clean and spacious. There was a nice grill and deck as well."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the house layout. Very nice place.
Nice gift of eggs.

2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"I grew up in the area and for the first time came to visit my Mother after selling our childhood home last June. This being our new norm ‚Ä¶.it was perfect. My Mother being handicapped could be there to visit easily. The location was perfect and we enjoyed a peaceful early Christmas with our entire family together. My only suggestion is to advertise that the home does not supply a television. I understand why one is not supplied, but we are avid soccer fans and the USA was playing in the World Cup at 10 am our first morning so we scrambled to get a TV in to watch. With that being said ‚Ä¶.we will most certainly be back to this super clean beautiful home. We will just bring a TV. Thank you LaVon and Rachael for sharing your home.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Maxx‚Äôs place was perfect for our stay. My husband and I were just looking for a quick getaway and it was perfect. The instant book option was great and everything was as advertised.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Maxx's place was perfect for my team and their work trip. They were very comfortable and felt right at home. They had all the amenities they needed and more. Maxx was a great host, very friendly and accommodating. Overall 5 stars. Highly recommend."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Caroline's Place is a charming old apartment in a very convenient location. It's easy to walk to Roscoe shops and a quick drive to access Coshocton across the bridge and access the highway for other sites nearby. I would definitely stay again.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The building was historic and took us back to a time long ago.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect and quaint! Location is superb and in walking distance to everything in the village! Can‚Äôt wait to stay again!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Excellent location! Lovely suites! Eclectic and tasteful! Quiet. Roomy. Dog friendly. Plenty of hot water. Kitchen stocked well. Toiletries in bathroom. Direct TV in living room!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"You can't beat this place if you are interested in enjoying Historic Roscoe Village. It is an historic building, so walls are thin and the place is not new but it was perfect for our family. Appreciated not having a huge list of things to do for check out and the responsiveness of the host. We would happily stay here again!"
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed our stay at Caroline's place. It was exactly as described. I would love to give it a 5 star rating. However, just a few small details prevent me from doing that. The host was fantastic, the place was clean, and everything was how it should be. However, we were staying in early November for a hunting trip and after a long cold week in the woods it was assumed a warm place and hot shower would be readily available, this was not the case. The single pane windows allowed alot of cool air in and with no sign of a thermostat anywhere we were hard pressed to warm up. Let's turn our attention to the shower, there was no tub available it was a single stand up shower that went cold within just a few moments of running, we had better luck with the hot water a few days into the trip early in the morning(3am), not sure what the situation is but im assuming this unit shares hot water with multiple other adjoining units. Other than these two items, our stay was well worth the trip."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay at Caroline‚Äôs place was great. The instructions for getting into the apartment were very clear and easy to follow. Once in the apartment we reached out to the host- Maxx about the thermostat/AC and he responded within minutes. There is a binder with local restaurants, things to do, and more on the history. Checkout was simple and easy."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed at Caroline's place in the heart of Roscoe Village. Although it was on the 3rd floor there was only 1 flight of steps since the building is on a hill. Very quaint and in keeping with the Ohio canal era. I loved the old wood floors. There was even chocolate for our arrival, which was yummy. A restaurant across the street was open late for evening dining but no place walking distance for a sit down breakfast. Other than that, our stay was great and trouble free!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Maxx was a wonderful host. We enjoyed our stay very much!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time during our stay at this Airbnb! The place was just as beautiful as the pictures described, and it provided us with the perfect setting for a relaxing and enjoyable getaway. We rested well and had a blast exploring all the exciting activities available during the festival. The only minor hiccup was that the hot water didn't last very long, but that didn't dampen our fantastic experience. We would consider coming back in the future!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a great stay is this little adorable village. We enjoyed some of the wineries around too.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We (two couples) stayed in Caroline's place for two nights. It is a quaint, old apartment converted to an AirBNB. The parking and entry instructions were some of the best I have ever encountered. It is an older building and that is part of its charm. It has a nice kitchen, living room, two bedrooms, and a nice sized bathroom. Maxx was always very responsive to my questions before and during the stay. The bed was a little soft for my back but it still was an enjoyable stay. It was nice weather and Huck's Tavern is right across the street so we had some noise from that but that's what you expect when a tavern is next door. We loved being right in the heart of Roscoe Village and walked up and down the street several times. There are a lot of events in the area if you look. We went to Wine Your Way Out on Saturday and had great fun."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Maxx was very accommodating and quick to respond for a last minute stay.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Unfortunately I was in town to lay a loved one to rest.
Upon arrival I was able to get in without issue, however, I had no power in the unit. There were parts of the building that had power. Maxx left his number and answered immediately. He apologized and was quick to explain and mitigate the issue. Tammy (housekeeping) showed onsite and tried many things to help. She did not leave. After some time the resolution was not going to be resolved before dark. He offered then to move to a unit that had power. I moved and only to not have power in my bathroom. Maxx‚Äôs grandfather came to replace fuses set me up with a lamp in the bathroom and a call was placed for someone to come from a neighboring town. He was promptly giving updates. He checked in and resolved my issues and put me at ease.
While it was rocky he did everything to get to a resolution. You cannot get any better than that and all while grieving.
Thank you Maxx and Gpa for the hug!!!"

I was surprised that the beds were comfortable and provided a good nite‚Äôs sleep. Our apartment didn‚Äôt have control of the temp in the apartment, with that being said, it was very comfortable. Liked that the location was convenient to many attractions, of which there were many pamphlets in the apartment to browse thru. Enjoyed spending time visiting historic Roscoe Village, loved the shops. If I ever get back to the area I would definitely stay at one of Maxx‚Äôs Airbnb.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved this spot - one of our favorite airbnbs! The space was even better than described. SO much space to spread out. The finished garage with all the indoor/outdoor games was so fun! The kitchen was well stocked for 12-16+ people. Even had bottled water, coffee/creamer, and paper products. Bathrooms stocked as well - I had forgotten a toothbrush and i was happy to find there was one on hand! Our grandkids loved the big backyard, beautiful deck and outdoor space. Home was immaculate and beds were comfortable- the 4 bedrooms were large and comfortable and there were two additional trundle beds perfect for the younger ones. Roscoe Village and Wooly Pig Brewery are must sees very close by. We had so much family fun and plan to return!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a very clean and comfortable place to stay with our family. The children enjoyed the games and the books. Everything was very lovely.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"House was super clean and well stocked...Towels and wash clothes, paper towels, coffee, water in fridge, plenty of dishes....definitely 5 stars!
Beds were very comfortable and furnishings were in excellent condition and clean. Garage/rec room had plenty of options for the teenagers, and was conveniently located off the main living area but still attached for easy and convenient access.
Three bathrooms and lots of sleeping options made it super convenient for our family, and the neighborhood was quiet and peaceful, even though there were multiple houses within sight. The outdoor patio and grill in the huge back yard with fire pit made us wish we could stay a few more days and just chill out instead of just being there evenings and nights!
Definitely check this place out if you are going to be in the Coshocton area! Joseph and his wife were more than accommodating and pleasant to work with throughout our stay.
Thanks!! and Blessings to you and your family."

She appreciated that the living and sleeping spaces were all on one level, with no interior stairs to climb. The neighborhood was quiet and the house is a quick and easy drive to anywhere in town. If it's available, I'm sure she'll want to stay here again on her next visit!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jade's property is on a quiet street with a spacious backyard and porch. We were very comfortable and could tell she put a lot of thought into the space.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super cozy, and plenty of space for a small group of people. We enjoyed our stay!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Thank you Charlene for another great stay. The Red House was perfect for our family and had an amazing yard for the dogs. Everything was very clean and we felt right at home. See you again next year!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was our 3rd year staying in one of Charlene‚Äôs cabins. She and Kristi, the caretaker, make you feel so welcomed. Fresh flowers, everything is super clean, well stocked, and ready to relax! Hoping to visit again next year!!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"well. this is an extraordinary place. I am a novice on Air bnb, and Charlene was an enormous help guiding and helping Me. The team at the cabins is so incredibly kind and helpful. don't miss out on this place. can't miss and an absolute joy spending time here."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This cabin had tons of room, great for 6 people, 2 renovated and spacious bathrooms, renovated gorgeous kitchen with updated appliances, Master suite bathroom was huge with a walk in shower and double shower heads, spa like feeling. This cabin would be great for a family. Charlene supplied everything you could imagine in the bathrooms and kitchen to start your vacation off even had 2 different types modern coffee makers, insta pot and grill. We felt right at home. Highly recommended this quite place with a wrap around porch. We didn‚Äôt have time to use the fire pit but it does have one on this lot. We will be back.
The red house is the cabin to the right of all the other cabins (private drive) ‚Ä¶ we got a little lost when we arrived as this cabin was not numbered. Other than this directions we‚Äôre spot on."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at this location wanting something close to Clary Gardens for a wedding. At booking, we didn't know if we would have other family with us but in the end, it was just us. It is cozy, clean, private and well decorated. We had everything we needed and would stay again this time with family and friends to share this wonderful place."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was a dream! We loved sitting on the deck to have our morning coffee, and watch the wildlife play around us. The finishes are absolutely stunning and we had plenty of room to stretch out, hang out, and cook food for bringing to the park. Definitely bring your bug spray, and I do not recommend trying to walk to Roscoe Village - the road doesn‚Äôt have a designated walkway and it‚Äôs tight and winding. It‚Äôs is just a quick two minute drive though and we got to enjoy it during our stay. This will not deter us from staying there in the future. Highly recommend checking out the cabins if you have not already!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had another wonderful visit to Charlene's house. It's so well equipped, comfortable and clean. We love everything about it. Charlene is very thorough and helpful when making reservations and checking out. They even left cupcakes for our daughter's birthday.

We look forward to returning."

The host is very responsive and proactive in making sure that everything is going well.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Near Roscoe Village and all it has to offer. Easy drive to places within 30 minutes.
Bed comfy, shower amazing, kitchen has everything you need, comfortable couches, fantastic porch and rocking chairs, and a private place yet fairly easy to walk to Roscoe Village.
WiFi worked for streaming on my laptop and iPad. Nice layout as we had friends join us. They had their ‚Äúwing‚Äù with a full bath, and us ours. Highly recommend."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a lovely stay. Charlene was an awesome host. She answered most concerns and/or questions before we even thought of them.

We look forward to returning in the near future. Came home feeling relaxed and very happy we chose to stay at the Cabin on the hill. It was equipped with everything and more that we would need. Thank you again Ms. Charlene. We hope to be in touch for future stays. Kim"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We truly enjoyed our stay at Charlene‚Äôs cabin. We booked very last minute as the place we had was flooded, but we are so happy it did as Charlene‚Äôs cabin was probably the best Airbnb we have ever stayed! It was clean, nicely located with a wildlife area out back. The beds were comfortable, the kitchen had everything needed plus some! Will definitely stay again!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We were in town for a youth baseball tournament at Kids America. The cabin was only about a 10 minute drive to the field which was welcomed at the end of a long day. This cabin is well isolated up on the hill and surrounded by trees, with a beautiful wrap around porch to relax on. The cute village of Roscoe Main Street is 1/2 mile down the road.
The inside of the cabin was spotless and plenty big enough for 5 adults and 1 child. The beds were ultra comfortable, the kitchen was well equipped , the living room has plenty of seating, the master shower and bedroom is huge. The only thing to be aware of that there is no closet space available in any of the bedrooms and the only room that has a dresser is the master, but other than that, it‚Äôs amazing and I would recommend staying here."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nice, clean bnb. Private but close to everything‚Ä¶ nice to be able to bring our dog. Loved the furnishings. Thank you!"

Jared knows and appreciates the history of his hometown and does a remarkable job promoting its highlights and supporting local businesses with glowing recommendations. Jared's home, The Spangler Inn, is an absolutely beautiful 1910 Craftsman style home which Jared has renovated while keeping its original charm. The beds and bedding were so comfortable and both bathrooms are very spacious and nicely laid out. The kitchen is huge and very well stocked with everything you could possibly require. The home is centrally located to many restaurants, Roscoe Village, Clary Gardens and Coshocton Lake Park and Coshocton Antique Mall; all of which we visited and would also recommend.

Jared was very communicative about what we needed to do for getting in/ leaving at the end of our stay. The house was spic and span with plenty of rooms and lots of space to move around for 7 people. Rooms were quite large, especially the bathrooms and kitchen area. you could tell that Jared took much attention in the recent renovations he has made to the place. The front porch was wonderful, with enough seating arrangements for us to all hang out and have drinks on and enjoy the cool early summer breeze. The location was perfect for walking to dinner and even got to see a local fair at the town square. Thank you!!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jared was very responsive and communicated effectively. The place was just like the pictures with plenty of extra pillows, blankets, and toiletries. It appears to be newly renovated and by the looks of some of the Reno pics on the walls it underwent a major transformation.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed the stay so much, the bell tower is so unique and qauint.
The bed is very comfy and clean
We appreciated the cleanliness of the whole air bnb, and the attention to detail, the charm of the bell tower alone was worth it, but the town a short walk away was so charming and had so many neat stores and historic buildings.
The veiws surrounding the area are breathtaking, the tower having windows on everyside is amazing to look out at night, its very romantic and it allowed me and my fiance time to decompress from our normal hectic lives.
The owners were very clear on instructions and descriptions and also very inviting and friendly, that always makes the stay easier!
We plan on being back soon! We will be recommending the bell tower to others :)"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Bell Tower was fabulous!!! Zach and Janae‚Äôs attention to detail is simply amazing. This may be our favorite Airbnb ever - the bell tower idea is just so clever! The coziness is sweet, the use of space is so fun, and the view from the top is spectacular! The location is amazing! You can even walk to the restaurants if you‚Äôre a walker! We felt completely safe and everything was pristine clean. The bell tower was the perfect place to celebrate our 18th anniversary! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing use of a unique space! We were looking to get away for a couple quiet days. This was the perfect, peaceful spot. The hosts' attention to detail turning this into a functional place to stay was awesome. It was extremely clean and just as listed. Good restaurants and shopping nearby in Roscoe Village. Will definitely recommend."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The suite was very nice, and a great use of a local historical building. They did a great job turning a small functionally obsolete bell tower into a cozy and unique space. It‚Äôs was a nice relaxing stay!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This unit was absolutely adorable! bedroom is small but that's the expected and shown in the photos. The overlook living room up top is fantastic. I only wish there was some kind of couch or something up there, I understand that getting furniture pieces up a spiral staircase presents its own challenges though.
There's no kitchen but there's a microwave, a small fridge, and a coffee maker, and that's enough. Bathroom was really clean and the shower was spacious and the water was hot.
Word of warning to everybody, don't stay in this town on a Sunday night. Everything is closed, well not everything, but most restaurants are closed and the few that are open only serve beer and wine. And then Monday morning most places are still closed until mid-week.
My one complaint was it's a little bit pricey for what it is. It's adorable and awesome but it should be a third less the price. I don't feel bad about spending the money though.
Altogether I highly recommend this unit."

On top of this, it was clean and cozy, the bed was incredibly comfortable, and the view was so pretty."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had an incredibly exciting and refreshing time during our stay at the Bell Tower. This a very well-done ""repurposing"" of a historical space, and the unique setting alone is worth experiencing just to get away and enjoy a change of scenery and pace.

Had a blast, thank you!!!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nicely appointed cabin in a beautiful area. The place was very clean and cozy, too.
The one drawback was the noise from traffic that was constant from the back porch. The view of the trees does obscure the cars/trucks.
It is very close to Roscoe Village/Coshocton, but still has the feeling of being away. We really enjoyed our stay.
It was frustrating trying to share pictures with family. They usually failed while at the cabin."

The little city was super cute and charming, though we unfortunately didn‚Äôt get to explore it. The living room lighting is very dim and it could use more overhead lighting.

The cabin's location is very close to Roscoe Village, dining and other attractions in the area. We really enjoyed that we were able to bring our two dogs with us on this quick June get-away.

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We can't say enough about the wonderful, relaxing weekend we spent in the Deer Cabin. I didn't want to leave. Charlene, the Host, stayed in touch to make sure everything was OK and it couldn't have been better. No complaints whatsoever! The cabin was immaculate and I slept better than I do in my own bed. Kristy does a fantastic job maintaining the cabins. I was concerned about the fact that pets were allowed and my allergies, but there was NO sign or odor of any pets ever having been in there. You felt like you were out in the country, but you were close to everything in Coshocton and Roscoe Village. I can't recommend Roscoe Hillside Cabins enough! Just fantastic!"

2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,The cabin was nice and very clean. The bed was comfortable which is always a huge plus! It was close to Roscoe Village which is such a cute little street with fun little shops. My husband and I loved talking to all the locals. We were extremely disappointed upon arrival that our cabin did not have a large double jacuzzi tub (like the pictures showcased) and instead had a single tub. We wanted an outside hot tub or double jacuzzi tub and chose this Airbnb because it showed the cabin having an inside double jacuzzi tub. We were also taken back when we could not get a message to go through in Airbnb to receive our code to get in the cabin and after several attempts at trying to send the message we called the host to see what we should do and she sounded annoyed that we called even though the messages we had previously received said to call with any problems.

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was well appointed in a great location for a very fair value! Most of the people that were staying were hunters also so there was great camaraderie! Around the block is roscoe village where there are a few places to eat and have a drink! The property is close to woodbury wildlife area and is just all around the perfect fit for either a stay to just to relax or to go on a hunting trip and unwind after a long day! Charlene checked in a few times to make sure everything was good but we did not need to communicate much because everything was set up already prior to our arrival! My brother and I will be back and when we go back this is the only place we will stay! Looking forward to making many more memories in Deer Cabin!

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and high end cabin. Was very clean and well equipped with everything you would need. Check in and check out process was very easy and required no contact. All of the furnishings including the front porch rockers were very high quality. I have no complaints. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 on the value is because we really didn't need 2 nights but could not book for 1 night only.
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"enjoyed our stay, great location if visiting Roscoe Village."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We live in the FLAT part of Ohio (Wood county) and we COMPLETELY enjoyed coming down to the southern part of Ohio with all of the hills! It just amazes us that this beautiful scenery is in Ohio! We feel so lucky to have found this wonderful cabin to stay in that is pet friendly and super clean! We asked ahead of time when making the booking reservation about parking arrangements for our motorcycle trailer and Charlene let us know we could park it on the property and then when we got there we asked Kristi (the caregiver) where to park it and she got back with us right away. We saw Kristi a couple of times during our stay and she was super friendly and let us know that we could contact her if we needed anything. We were very pleased with everything about the cabin and our stay! And a bonus that the weather was absolutley PERFECT during our stay to go riding on the motorcycle around the area in God's country in a beautiful little part of Ohio! We will definitely be back with pets or no pets! We thank you so much for being pet friendly!

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Charlene's cabin is an amazing place to stay for a weekend getaway. The cabin was very clean on our arrival and had all the amenities needed to get us started before we were able to get to the grocery store for snacks and perishable food. The location was great with lots of parks and hiking trails nearby for daytime fun and great restaurants for takeout in the evening. The only thing that wasn't perfect (but I wouldn't call a complaint) is that our cabin (#4) faced a busy road and there was a lot of vehicle noise and the occasional semi-truck which took away from the overall experience of being in nature but is completely outside of Charlene's control.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice cozy cabin - minutes from Roscoe Village.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The peace and comfort of Roscoe cabins was so enjoyable! The cabins are nestled on top of a wooded hill and next to Historic Roscoe Village. The village has shopping and great food at the Warehouse! Also great food in Coshocton!
Our cabin was clean, comfortable, and so nice!
I loved the Fall decor and curb appeal of our cabin, nice touch!
You are close to great things to do and see;
Amish Country, Ravens Glen winery, (many wineries all around) and wooly pig brewery.
If you go to Sugarcreek, check out Park Street pizza (the Best!) or Bags Sport Pub for a great burger, (Sugarcreek and Millersburg)!!!
Enjoy your stay whatever you do! We sure did!"

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, cozy, and excellent value. The cabin is so cute and very spacious! We only stayed for one night but I‚Äôd love to visit again as nearby Roscoe had lots to see, and the cabins themselves are extremely comfortable and feel very remote despite being located near lots to do (during non-Covid times of course). Loved the deck, and we even got to meet a sweet feline guest in the morning. We loved it!"

Very clean and had everything we needed. Had the most wonderful time."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cabin was really nice. Parking was close. Easy to find. Liked the fact she provided morning coffee with a reusable keurig cup. The blanket near the easy chair was wonderful. Everything worked. Cabin was comfortable at all times. Enjoyed the front porch...nice cat and saw deer one morning. Ice maker was nice to use. Shower was impossible for me to climb in despite one grab handle....not disabled but I have balance issues. Front door keypad was problematic, but we worked it out....did not know to lock.... ""just reverse"" the procedure. Very close to Rosco Village without going onto a major thorough fair.
If it were my cabin ....I would communicate, as you do, with the addition of letting folks know of your ""complementary coffee with a keurig"" ....nice touch! ...extra instructions on the door lock...I would replace the ""shower tub"" with a walk-in shower.
I will definitely consider returning with different shower. Thanks"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Second time I have stayed at the cabins. Sort of bittersweet weekends since both times were to attend memorial services. However, the cabins are great, Roscoe Village is very cute and the park around the canal basins makes a nice walking spot."

My granddaughter loves this place and calls it our Thanksgiving house as we stay here while visiting family in the area. She loves the loft. We do a lot of cooking while here and the kitchen is perfect for getting our meal ready to take to the great-grandparents. We brought our dog and that is a must during a family holiday. Thanks Charlene!
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great except for that it's not a good place for walking. I didn't expect that it would be though since it is on a hillside.

2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Absolutely fabulous experience from start to finish! Cabin was clean and beautiful with plenty of towels and kitchen equipment. We loved our time spent on the porch and our days in the village. Fabulous and would highly recommend!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Good Value, Beautiful surroundings."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was my 2nd stay at Roscoe Hillside Cabins. Thank you for providing a nicely equipped dog friendly place for a weekend excursion. I will be back.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice place, cat was a plus. Parking seemed tight for other cars to get by. Loved the roominess and decorations. Bed was very comfortable. Really enjoyed the little town of Roscoe. Host seemed very nice."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great. Communication was sketchy with Charlene meaning partial text. I am not tech savvy so I have no idea why. I am older so it was a bit difficult booking but again not tech savvy. So not tech savvy people are potential renters as well so keep that in mind. Local contact was beyond amazing. Forget her name but she was GREAT! Thankful for her- she made everything better!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location, and the cabins are in fantastic shape! It was like staying in Gatlinburg, TN."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was beautiful inside and out. Pictures don't do it any justice. Peaceful, serene and semi private. We spent a lot of time on the porch. When chilly outside the couches just sucked you in and didn't want to let go. Immediately felt right at home. Close to downtown with plenty of food options. Really close to Roscoe village. With plenty of little shops to explore. Didn't really have to leave unless you want to. Full kitchen with everything you need to cook full meals. Value wise, I would rather stay at a place like this over a hotel any day. Only downside, ( and this is just me) is the toilet is kinda low for taller people. We enjoyed ourselves and would stay again and will recommend to others."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We‚Äôve been to the area several times and Charlene‚Äôs place was very comfortable and convenient for all we wanted to do. Would definitely stay there again.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We received the wrong code to get in the cabin, but Charlene was quick to send a code that worked. Cabin is VERY nice and VERY comfortable beds. Fresh flowers were on the table when we arrived.
The smaller cabins are better priced for a weekend getaway, however, her smaller cabins were all booked. We paid more than we wanted for two days, but had a wonderful weekend.
Charlene is an awesome host."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We have a greqt time! It was a perfect place!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay as usual! I told her it we were there to celebrate my birthday and she had cupcakes, a card and flowers waiting!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice cabin. Very comfortable and clean. Would rent again if I come back to the area.
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a great time in a cozy little cabin! Charlene was a great host that we had good communication with!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"These are great little cabins, if you happen to be here I would highly recommend these over a hotel"
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Charlene was very easy to communicate with from the beginning of the process through the end. She made sure we understood the hill and the roads surrounding the cabin since it was snowing. The cabin was exactly as shown in the photos. It's a great place to stay near Coshocton!
2022-12-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Second time staying at this place. Beautiful place with great amenities. Roscoe Village is an awesome place to visit. Only downsides were the check-in process and the lack of instructions or response to a question about the electric fireplace in the unit. No obvious way to turn it on and they didn‚Äôt reply when I asked about it.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Charlene was easy to communicate with and she was very helpful in us getting a driveway level cabin. The cabin had everything you would need and was very clean. We will be returning again in the future.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great time!!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had an amazing time. Would definitely recommend!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Buffalo cabin #5 was great! It was clean and comfy, just as described! Charlene is a great hostess and quick to respond! It was a great location for Roscoe Village and we really enjoyed it!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Awesome
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice clean cabin! Peaceful and easy to access. Loved it!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cant say enough about how nice cabin was. Really enjoyed myself. Definitely would be a great place to stay for a girls ngt out or a guys ngt. Plenty of room and beds.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A very nice, clean, spacious place for our family to stay! We enjoyed it very much! My 6 year old said a couple times, ‚ÄúIt looks like Indians lived here!‚Äùüòä Nice rustic decor."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"After a last minute change in plans, my family decided to stay at Charlene's place in Coshocton. We had an issue with the air conditioning in the first cabin, but the caretaker responded quickly and offered a full refund if we decided to stay elsewhere. We stayed through the night to see if maintenance could repair the unit the following day, but after determining that it was not possible, we were offered a different cabin closeby. The second cabin had working AC and was clean and well-maintained. We brought our dog with us, who thoroughly enjoyed hanging out on the covered patios. The host was responsive and even offered to refund money for the inconvenience of the faulty AC unit. We loved these little cabins close to the adorable Roscoe Village; I highly recommend them for other travelers! My only suggestions for the host would be to ensure that all of the AC units are working properly and to add an accessible area for pets to use the bathroom. We had to walk our dog down a gravel path to only find a very small patch of slightly flat ground."
2022-07-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"The cabin and amenities were comfortable and fine. However, be aware that cabin 5 has a space under separate lock and key that serves as a work space for the caretakers of all cabins. In other words, workers are in and out to the extent that when we returned from an adventure, one of the workers was ‚Äúcamped out‚Äù on our front porch as though he had rented it. In addition, the ‚Äúcabin cats‚Äù are fed daily on this cabins front porch. As a consequence they hang out around the cabin and are a nuisance.
We also had an incidence where a smoke alarm in the loft went off at 1:15 am. The loft is accessible only by a steep ladder, approximately 10 feet tall with no rails to hold as you ascend or descend. This 71 year old senior was forced to climb and access the detector to see what the issue was as it was screaming ‚Äú Smoke detected in the guest bedroom, evacuate now!‚Äù Repeatedly between the siren going off. We immediately called the caretaker and after speaking with her and explaining that the detector had gone off and action we had taken she said ‚ÄúThanks for calling and reporting the issue‚Äù with no further discernible action taken. We felt unsafe and vacated the premises by 2:30 am at considerable inconvenience for us.
We will not rent from Roscoe Hillside Cabins again."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Roscoe Hillside cabins was wonderful. This was our 2nd time staying in the Buffalo Cabin, we plan on staying again next year. The cabin was clean and very comfortable. We were able to cook breakfast every morning in the nicely equipped kitchen. The kitchen table was plenty big enough to eat at as well as play games. We sat on the front porch listening to nature every morning and evening. All and all, a very pleasant stay."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Loved the place. Perfect for a getaway. Quiet, peaceful, comfortable, and clean. Very impressed, thank you."
2022-07-01,4.0,Group trip,"This cabin is beautiful! It is very clean and the beds were very comfy. The location is perfect if you want to be close to village and the rest of Coshocton! Also, the host is great! Super responsive and easy to communicate with."
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,We had the best time and really appreciated how clean and comfy the cabin was. The whole process was so easy and communication was outstanding. We will definitely go back
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautifully maintained property. Very clean and I slept so well in a very comfortable bed.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Hubby and I enjoyed our stay at this little cabin. It was very clean and comfortable. If you are in this area I highly recommend.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A fantastic adventure awaits. The cabins are very clean and the grounds are well maintained and offer alot of personal touches. The decor is unique and full of treasures. There are plenty of exciting things to do such as Roscoe Village, wineries, Amish Country, and cheese factories to name a few. I full heartedly recommend a visit!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful cabin!
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin sets in a serene area, is beautifully decorated, spacious, clean and comfortable. The price per night is a great value, especially if the cost is split between multiple guests. The host kept us well informed every step of the way. Check-in and check-out was very efficient. Highly recommend."
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Spent Easter with our family in both the top and bottom of this cabin. It was in a good location. Near some nice restaurants and shops. The kitchens were pretty well stocked with pots and pans, microwave, coffee pot, dishes and drinkware. Some extra silverware would have been nice but we made it work. Only things that would have made the stay better would have been a dishwasher but, not sure where it would have fit in the kitchen. We all pitched in and did up the dishes so it was fine and the parking. We had 5 cars and there were only 3 spots available for us. We knew this ahead of time and just parked in the lot the owners mentioned was available. There was what looked like a community fire pit that we didn't get to use but, looked like a nice place to relax in the evenings at.
We would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting to get away for a few days."
2022-03-01,5.0,Group trip,wonderful stay!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place and very clean! Would certainly stay there again.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful cabin, comfortable beds, whirlpool bathtub was a bonus."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The location of this cabin is gorgeous. It‚Äôs the perfect ‚Äúhome away from home‚Äù without being too far. We really enjoyed our stay and look forward to coming back!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great Cabin!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just as pictured! What a lovely cabin and nice location near Roscoe. Bed was comfortable, well stocked kitchen and plenty of towels. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay and are planning to come back again."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a beautiful cabin! Clean, comfortable, cozy, and well equipped. Had a great experience throughout the entire process (booking, communication to check in, and check out) with Charlene - she was very responsive and helpful. Would definitely recommend Charlenes cabin - I will absolutely be back!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Group trip,This was a great cabin with plenty of space for a group of 6 to spend the new year. Charlene was communicative and the place was very clean. There was some great hiking nearby as well! We hope to come back and visit again!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location, beautifully decorated, well stocked‚Ä¶100% would recommend!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Awesome cabin! Clean and spacious! Would recommend! Great communication!
2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and comfortable cabin. We had some issues with the parking and heavy traffic noise from the busy road below. Being able to hear conversations from the guests in the lower unit also wasn‚Äôt pleasant. The jetted tub was awesome and the fully stocked kitchen was convenient. The beds and furniture were also comfortable. Must love cats as there is a super sweet, outdoor cat that lives on the property and sleeps under the porch. It was scratching on our door in the night and scared us!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, which I really appreciated as I'm a bit of a neat freak. Very lovely cabin and we plan to return every year."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay . The cabin was very clean .
It is very close to Amish country."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you so much for the wonderful stay!!!
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,wonderful cabin that was private but close to Roscoe Village. We were in the Buffalo cabin that had plenty of beds for the 5 of us. Very fun trip.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"These cabins are beautiful and oh-so-peaceful! 2 parking spots are available for this cabin (which was wonderful), and the rooms and bathrooms are very spacious. The kitchen had everything we needed, and the couches are very comfy! The cabin doesn't face east or west, so they can be quite dark, but it made sleeping a night very peaceful. Within walking distance to Historic Roscoe Village, and other viewing areas :) Charlene checked in throughout or stay, and responded so quickly to any request we had!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"There was plenty of room for our party of 8 people, both for dining and getting together in the comfortable living room. Everything was spotlessly clean and close by to Roscoe Village. We had a wonderful time."
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"The Hillside Cabins in Roscoe Village are lovely! We stayed for the weekend while visiting family in the area. The cabins can be tricky to find at night. Make sure to follow the directions up the hill closely. The cabin was a perfect size for 4 adults and a puppy. The loft is a little on the small side and you have to climb a ladder up to it. If mobility is an issue, this could be a problem. We were fine though. The cabin was very clean, in great shape, and well equipped. We would stay here again! Thank you for hosting!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is beautiful and has a fun personality. It's well done, quality furnishings and much attention to detail. Comfortable and quiet, too--I wish we could have stayed and enjoyed it longer!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Great Place to stay!
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Definitely worth staying here! The cabin is beautiful and was very accommodating for our family of 6. Scenery is beautiful. Awesome rental. First time Air BnB here!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at Hillside Cabins was excellent. The cabin was clean, comfortable, and well appointed with plenty of sleeping space for a large family. Self check-in/out was easy. Parking was a little tight for a mid-size pick-up, but doable without hanging out too far into the gravel road."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place
Thank you so much"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The cabin is beautiful and very well maintained. Absolutely loved our visit
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Roscoe Hillside Cabins are a wonderful place to stay. We visited for a weekend to enjoy the local wineries. The cabin was very clean and so cozy. The supplied wood at the community fire pit was great. It is definately a place will we stay again.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is such a beautiful place to stay! The cabin is beautifully decorated and immaculately clean. The grounds are peaceful and comfortable. Perfect for families or friends.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cabin was great. Very clean and with nice amenities. Great proximity to Roscoe Village too. We enjoyed our stay!
2021-07-01,4.0,Group trip,"We had a great weekend with friends and enjoyed our stay at the Buffalo cottage. The cottage was clean and well-appointed. The decor was eclectic and fun, there was plenty of seating and room to hang out after a meal, play games or enjoy the front porch. You were very communicative and I feel certain that if we had any problems, they would have been addressed immediately.
There were a few things that we thought were not disclosed/accurate from the listing: the third bedroom is a loft with a futon. We all thought that the ‚Äúthird room with a queen bed‚Äù should have been more specific. A futon is not a bed (unless your a child or a starving college student) and the ladder to the loft was so precarious and steep that we had safety concerns (we are all in our 50‚Äôs - still capable, but well past the point of wanting to climb a steep ladder to get to an uncomfortable futon). I would have serious concerns allowing young children to sleep in the loft. We also thought that the communal fire pit should have been disclosed. It was lovely that you provided wood (we brought some because we didn't know). We enjoyed it by ourselves one night and enjoyed meeting our ‚Äúneighbors‚Äù another night but it was unexpected to have to share a fire pit. That wouldn't have been a deal-breaker but would have been nice to know in advance.
A few additional comments about the location - we loved how close the cabin was to Roscoe Village but also so close the highway. The traffic sounds were a bit distracting when sitting on the porch - kind of took away from the desired ‚Äúcabin in the woods‚Äù vibe. Additionally, the lack of privacy between the cabin porches - our neighbors across the street were likely annoyed by our laughter and good times and we felt like we were forced to spy on them because we had a direct view of their porch. Private is not how I would describe these cabins. I am surprised I didn't read any of these comments in the reviews because while these issues might not be important to some guests, I suspect, like us, it is important when renting a cabin. One last thing - it seemed a bit odd that you didn't disclose that our cabin had another ‚Äúcabin‚Äù on the lower level. They were not a bother but could have been and likewise, we could have been a bother to them. If we had had screaming children below us, I would have been very disappointed. They were fun and friendly neighbors despite the permeating smell of pot coming from below.
In all, my comments don't really matter. It wasn't a bad experience by any means. I just think the listing should be a little more accurate. We had a wonderful experience but next time will look for a location that suits our needs and desires a bit better."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is so great! The decorations are darling. The beds are super comfortable! The roof on the porch makes for nice shade. Roscoe Village shops have some amazing and unique finds. Perfect weekend getaway!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved the location. Enjoyed Roscoe Village and the history of the Ohio water canals. Numerous Amish destinations within 35 minute drive. Beautiful cabin and interior.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to come home to after enjoying the surrounding area. Don't miss Roscoe Village!
2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Great host and very accommodating. Thanks Charlene!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, relaxing setting! Friendly, accommodating owners. We have 5 acres of land by Woodbury that we are slowly cleaning up to build a house. While working, I fell down hill and broke my arm. Charlene was so helpful to let us stay another night at literally last minute notice. We have stayed many times, in each cabin and will definitely be back!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A great realaxing time
2021-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Everything was clean and accurately listed. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!
2021-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Awesome cabin very quiet and had everything we needed. Charlene is great and we loved Gabby the kitty.
2021-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean cabin in quiet area. Worth the cost and travel.
2021-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Located in a lovely ""woodsey"" setting, these cute little cabins are clean, comfortable and whimsically decorated. Charlene keeps tabs on all her guests and she is there to provide anything you need. The kitchens have everything you need, including coffee. Each cabin has an adorable loft bedroom, which is accessible only by ladder, so be sure the person staying in that bedroom is able to climb the ladder. Our group rented multiple cabins and we had a great time socializing on the outdoor decks. There is a firepit, great for storytelling and singalongs. Don't miss the cute shops and restaurants in Roscoe village, which is within walking distance of the cabins. We will remember our visit here always and we will definitely be back!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a delightful cabin in a wooded area just a minute or two by car or 5 minutes on foot to the village of Roscoe Hills. The cabin itself is very thoughtfully decorated like a hunting lodge with a wooden interior and interesting touches in keeping with the aesthetics. The bed was super comfortable, the bathroom was roomy as was the shower. Being pet friendly was much appreciated. Charlene, our host, was very efficient and responded within minutes to questions. She suggested some local areas of interest and walks which were great. I would definitely come back again. Thanks for having us!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful cabin with a very cozy feel!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a charming surprise! Great cabin, super easy check in and check out. Very close to a unique shopping. Loved my necklace from the blacksmith in the village! The cabin was just the right amount of space, very quiet and very comfortable. Loved the jacuzzi too!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This cabin is wonderfully laid out and very comfortable, like other reviewers say, the pictures don‚Äôt really do it justice. Nice bedrooms, nice large bathroom, big dining table to ply board games, comfortable living area, and a small fun loft: We had an unseasonably warm February Saturday and we‚Äôre able to sit in the rocking chairs on the porch ‚Äî a great surprise! Perfect for a weekend away!"
2021-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,very pretty area.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice and comfortable. Great place to stay, relax, and visit the area."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our long weekend stay at Buffalo Cabin! It had everything we needed and nothing we didn‚Äôt. As others have mentioned, it was very clean. We relaxed, played cards and explored Roscoe Village, which is very close by! A very much needed escape."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Buffalo Cabin #5 was spacious and beautifully decorated. It was super clean and the little extras like providing towels, hand soap, paper towels, toilet paper and other amenities made it so much easier to escape for the weekend. Charlene communicated with us daily to make sure we had everything we needed! The cabin is just minutes from historic Roscoe Village. We cannot wait to come and stay again and definitely will book cabin #5 again! Thanks for the beautiful relaxing weekend, we felt right at home!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice cabins. Fun decor. Great location.
2021-01-01,4.0,Group trip,Cabin is very nicely decorated and solidly built. Beds were very cozy. Friendly staff and great communication. This particular cabin sits near a busy road so if you are a light sleeper you will hear night traffic.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great for any age, perfect location for Roscoe Village! Clean, cute, great communication! Comfy beds, which a huge thing to me."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is the perfect cabin for a small family or small group. Space enough to spread out. 2 full bedrooms and loft. Such comfy mattresses!!! Slept great! Very clean and lots of nice touches. If you‚Äôre visiting Roscoe Village, it‚Äôs so close! We will definitely be back!!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, great value and beautiful when it snows. Highly recommend"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was our second time staying in the Buffalo Cabin and it was just as amazing as the first.
2020-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Great cabin. Very comfy and cozy

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place to stay. Its close to every thing. Gabby the cabin cat was an awesome added touch. She would come when I called. I also left my glasses and Charlene was quick to respond and found them safely!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cabin #5 was spacious, very clean and had everything we needed to make it ""home-like"" for 5 days. Gabby the cabin cat was so friendly."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean and well built cabin
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay at Buffalo cabin! It was perfect for a short weekend getaway - located very close to historic Roscoe Village and also a few small parks and the towpath hiking trail. The cabin was nicely decorated and super clean. We also appreciated that it was dog-friendly. I would definitely recommend this cabin and hope to visit again someday!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed staying in this cabin, the views are incredible and it‚Äôs very quiet and romantic at night."
2020-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"These are clean, well-built cabins. The Buffalo cabin was filled with great decorations and high-quality furnishings. There was a fully-stocked kitchen with everything needed to cook enough food to feed a crowd, and room enough for several adults and children to sleep comfortably. Roscoe Village is within an easy walk, and you can get a nice supply of goodies for the fridge while exploring a quarter mile stretch of quaint shops and restaurants. Drive North on route 83 to Millersburg and go East from there through Berlin and Walnut Creek to experience the best of Amish country. We found the Roscoe Hillside Cabins an excellent place to stay while enjoying these attractions, and we will likely stay there again."
2020-10-01,5.0,Group trip,A nice place to stay. Views were pretty since it‚Äôs fall. Loved the porch area and the space felt spacious. There were 5 of us and it was a perfect size. Will stay again if I‚Äôm the area!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place! Love the little town around it and the people there are amazing! We had Doug as our care taker and he was amazing to speak with! We enjoyed the many amenities and the beautiful cabin itself! Love it here can‚Äôt wait to come back!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is our second time staying at Roscoe‚Äôs Hillside Cabins and we will come back again. Beautiful cabin, convenient location."
2020-10-01,5.0,Group trip,We chose this location since it was the midway point for all of our friends who are spread out. We had never been to this area before and didn‚Äôt really know what to expect. The cabin and local area exceeded our expectations and Charlene was an excellent host. You can walk to the historic village and a local park in about 5 minutes. There are also multiple wineries in the area that you can visit.
2020-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"This cabin was amazing and exactly as described. It was CLEAN, which was very important to us in the middle of a pandemic. The location was scenic and the cabin was adorably decorated. It was very accessible and the host was so responsive! This was a wonderful place to get away for a few days."
2020-09-01,5.0,Group trip,The pictures don't do this place justice! It is absolutely gorgeous and inviting. Charlene and Doug are so incredibly friendly and helpful. We really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend this host if you're looking for a nice getaway!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a lovely place. Walking distance to Roscoe. Very cute and clean. Plenty of room. We would definitely stay again. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
2020-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was nice. We didn't have any problems during our stay. The check in and out procedure is very easy.
2020-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"This cabin is spacious, but also cozy. There are fun Old West touches everywhere you look. The kitchen is very well stocked for an ABnB. We were missing a cutting board, but I called the caretaker and he found us one by the time we got back from the park.
Helpful hint: don't believe Google maps, you can definitely walk to the park through Roscoe Village. Google assumed we wanted to start on the opposite side, so we drove, parked, and ended up walking basically back to the cabin. Nice mix of woods and botanicals."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My kids loved the upstairs loft!

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The stay was great! Had no issues with anything!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fine stay. The apartment was VERY clean and that is always the most important thing to me! We felt comfortable and at home. The beds were firm and comfortable. We had two minor noise issues. The dog next door barked for a few minutes each night around 11/11:30. It was only a minute or two but just enough to wake me up. There‚Äôs not much one can do about that and I was thankful that it was handled quick enough by the dog‚Äôs owner. Secondly, there was a higher pitched, shrill noise as the heat ran. It was not a soothing, white-noise type sound but rather grating on the nerves while sleeping. I ended up turning down the heat to 64 overnight so that it might run less. We popped the grate out from the wall which helped, but only a little bit. Overall, we loved the home and would certainly choose it for a stay again but we would perhaps pack earplugs to help us sleep more restfully."

Overall, our stay was great !!

2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,‚ÄúThe Roost‚Äù was much smaller than in the pictures that were posted. Bathroom door was a curtain which would have been difficult if we had guests. Building pitches down towards the river. Deck construction was questionable. Car on blocks across the street from Air bnb. After paying for the booking we were told additional fees were needed for having dogs.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The roost was exactly what my husband and I needed as a getaway. The cabin was clean, cozy, comfortable and had all the amenities that we could need. The details in craftsmanship added nice little touches. We were able to walk right down the road to the Grub and Pub and enjoyed getting to know some of the locals over a few beers. The fishing rod holder was cool, my husband was able to catch a catfish right off the deck. The view from the back of the cabin was my favorite. Great local places to eat and drink.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Had a few minor issues but Ryan was amazing and resolved everything quickly and was very friendly. Turned out there was just a very bad previous guest that had caused issue for my stay. I would recommend this host and place, it was beautiful!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great little cabin overlooking the river. Perfect get-away for a person or couple.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very charming old house that has been remodeled. Just a tad bit small for our family of 4, but perfect for a couple people and their pet. We did bring baby gates to block off the wood stove which we needed so be prepared to pack those if you have a little one. I wish it could have been just a tad warmer weather for us to enjoy the deck more having a small baby, but it's a beautiful site to look at and loved that the deck hung over the river. You're just a very short drive to the dam and we loved driving the area and site seeing. We would definitely consider coming back when it's a little warmer for our family. Great little quick getaway that's just a few county miles from town and worth the view."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,LOVED it!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had the best time with our stay. We were celebrating our 25th anniversary with original plans falling through two days before booking Ryan's place. The cabin was super clean, with so many unique features. What we loved the most was the picture window overlooking field and creek with deck and fire stove inside. The dining table was something we would like to make for our home. My husband caught a catfish while we were eating dinner thanks to Ryan installing a pole holder on deck. There was a grill on deck perfect for cooking ribeyes, which we did both nights. The refrigerator was stocked with water and all condiments you will need. He also supplied spices and coffee. There is so much to do in Coshocton. We went to Roscoe villiage and local wineries. The Yellow Butterfly Winery was our favorite with live music. We had rain both nights so we weren't able to sit at firepit. But we had the wood stove inside and made fire there. We highly recommend Ryan's place!"

The kitchen/living room were huge and we could have hosted more of our relatives if we come down again. It was perfect for my daughter and I.

There was construction in Coshocton during our stay which made accessing the Airbnb kind of inconvenient, but without the construction, it would've been a great location! It's right on the river with a nice sitting area outside. The roomy kitchen and living room areas made it easy for the groomsmen to get dressed here. Thank you for a great stay!"

,,,I‚Äôm writing and honest review. My first night there was a bug on my pillow and I didn‚Äôt think anything of it and used a different pillow. I did look around to make sure there was no more. The second night there was a cockroach on the bed even though it was dead I notified the contact and was asked if I wanted to move cabins. I wanted to just remove myself from the entire situation. I requested a refund and did get the full amount that Airbnb would allow. Charlene said she would send the difference in the mail. I‚Äôm sure she will but still needed to write a proper review. The explanation from the contact for the cockroach was that they just sprayed and it may bring them out. Still not a fan. I had to wash my entire bag items while in the road. Not fun. I was honest to the host and the contact and very upfront with them. Sorry for having to leave this review I hope I see the additional amount promised by host.
,,,"I traveled from out of town on Christmas eve with my significant other. We wanted to stay in a safe place during the Covid-19 pandemic so we decided to do something different & rent a cabin on our 1st Christmas together. As we traveled it was snowing bad & we could only drive 30mph on the highway. So it took us way loger than it should of to arrive & it was getting late. Once we arrived to our destination we were devastated that our vehicle couldn't get up the driveway to the cabin. We messaged the host & basically was told there was salt & sand put down & sorry we couldn't make it up the drive. We ended up having to turn around and drive to my boyfriends relatives house, which took us another 50 mins to get to in this snow storm. We weren't offered any type of refund, this was the most disappointing trip. This was my present to my boyfriend for Christmas & I am not happy."
