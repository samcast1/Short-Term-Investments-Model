2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great stay/ super cozy 3BR house remodelled to perfection. Just outside of hustle/bustle of Tulsa's traffic (but within 10 minutes of the world-reknown ""Gathering Place"" park), this home sits in a small, quiet neighborhood that is slowly being brought back to life. The kitchen is superbly equipped with everything needed to cook a great meal (spices, utensils, coffee, sugar, creamer, etc.). You just have to show up with family and ingredients! Bathrooms have fluffy towels, soap/shampoo/conditioner just like hotels, and the fenced in backyard is perfect for furry friends. The beds and linens are first class as well. Maliha and Nadir are fantastic hosts and super responsive. We will be back!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"While I wasn't unsure of the area when first driving in, this home sits on what seems like a private road with other rentals. It felt private and safe.
This home was very well stocked with all the amenities you might have at home. I normally travel with things to cook with but that is not at all necessary at this rental. ALL you would need to cook (knives, small kitchen appliances, cookware, and all the dinnerware) were provided and in great condition. There was even an InstantPot and air fryer available! There were ample towels, toilet paper, and paper towels provided for our large family as well as soap, shampoo/conditioner, and pods for the dishwasher and washing machine. We loved having a washing machine available.
Make sure the shower curtain in the master shower is closed ALL THE WAY before turning the water on or you'll be prewashing your feet 😂 Beds were comfy, games were provided for the kids, and Roku TVs are provided in abundance. Outdoor areas were also cozy and well kept.
We ran into a couple concerns during our stay and when we reached out to Nadir and Maliha, they responded almost immediately. They were so quick to make it right and make up for any inconvenience. They went above and beyond with communication. Would definitely stay again."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful little quaint home. Clean and comfortable. Has everything you need to enjoy your stay!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nadir homes are the best just wanted you to know if your ever in Tulsa ok and need a nice clean comfortable home to relax and enjoy yourself in please look his homes up and also he is kid friendly had games for your children and all HIS HOMES ARE THE BEST RECOMMEND TO ANYONE
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Nadir was highly responsive and accommodating from the start of the booking process through final checkout. The home was clean and had all of the amenities one would need for their stay from coffee and soft drinks to an iron and towels. Larger groups should expect to potentially share beds if it is more than 5 people (we were a larger group). The parking situation can be a little difficult if you have more than two cars and the location is not the greatest (coming from a Tulsa local). However, the home is a short drive from downtown which was nice.
I would recommend this stay, just would recommend reading the house rules prior to booking so there are no surprises."

Centrally located to have access to many things and attractions in Tulsa Area.
Was tidy and really enjoyed the home and it's privacy.
Large tree's in yard which lends it's hand to beautiful music from nature by birds when you wake up each morning to have coffee on patio. Your in the city but feels like your not because of privacy fence. The shower is a big highlight for me, my tired muscles from driving had relief to enjoy our day downtown Jenks antique shopping.

Nice Grill, as well…but we did not use. We experienced beautiful sunsets! Felt safe. Stephanie is responsive and helpful. Location good.

We stayed there for one night on a road trip home to Chicago from Phoenix, and my traveling companion and I both agreed that we would stay there again in a heartbeat. It is very modern - from the kitchen to the shower and the decorating and small, great touches everywhere made the place really special. It was too cold for us to enjoy the outdoor space, but it also looked amazing.
We decided last minute to go with an Airbnb over a hotel, and I am so glad we did! Stephanie was immediately responsive when we inquired about the place. If I ever go back to or through Tulsa, I will absolutely try to book it again (if someone else has not already snatched up the dates)!
Thank you, Stephanie!!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful home! Stephanie was very communicative and helpful and the Airbnb was exactly as described.

6 out of 5 stars if possible!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cottage was absolutely beautiful! Brand new smell and very clean. The shower was was literally the best part of the cottage, could have stayed in there all day lol. The master bed was super soft, I believe memory foam. Slept amazingly! You’ll love this cottage."

Spotless, modern decore and a peaceful feel to the entire place. The appliances are brand new and top shelf. I loved the cast iron stovetop including a griddle on top. A cooks dream. The refrigerator is large and modern and the place comes with a high end washer and dryer. The beds were also high end. Slept like a baby
I am disabled and the place met all my needs, even better than my home. Large doorways and lots of room to maneuver my walker. The shower is walk in and the place even has a shower chair. I felt very safe.
The host was very responsive to any and all my questions or comments. I will definately look for this place next time I come to the Tulsa area."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stephanie was very kind and accommodating.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I’m currently thinking of excuses to drive back through the Tulsa area just so I can stay at this adorable place again! Stephanie’s place was clean, quiet, cozy, and modern - my pup and I felt right at home and got a FANTASTIC night’s sleep. Her check-in instructions were detailed and made things very easy on me after a long day on the road, and the place was stocked with all the amenities I could have possibly needed. I hope I get the chance to stay here again - one of the cutest airbnbs ever!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"very cute and cozy! the location is fantastic, and super close to a lot of Tulsa's attractions. There is a private patio with a grill. If you are a pet-parent, the back yard has good space, and there is a secure fence. I definitely recommend staying here."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a great home away from home!! So easy to find, easy to get in and so clean and accommodating. Jennifer was so easy to communicate with and responsive.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Jennifer is super responsive, kind, and the home is perfect. We have been spoiled here and I'm not sure any other home will compare. If you are looking for excellence, then look no further. I can't say enough about this home... it's everything! ❤️💕"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Excellent place to stay! Highly recommend!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My 7yo and I spent 2 nights here. Very peaceful. We didn't need to contact the host during the entire stay. My son's favorite part was being able to meet and feed the mini horses. Worth it! We will be back!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was exactly like the photos and the description. Claudia communicated everything very clearly on how to access the cabin, and there was a note laid out that had everything as well, including phone numbers to reach them if anything was needed. The cabin was homey and very clean. The property is gorgeous and the cabin has a clear view of the lake from the front porch where there are rocking chairs to sit and enjoy it. It was a lovely stay!"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would have given 5 stars all around except that while the bed was comfy it ended up being a bit small for us. No fault of the owner, but if you are used to a king size bed this may feel small.
And the view was 5 stars but the photos in the listing really dont show that its right next to the lodge. Middle of the week it was mostly quiet but could be busier on weekends.
The highlight, besides the view were hearing the horses neigh and the lodge dogs that stopped by for a visit! That part was the Best!
We met and spoke with Claudias husband and a very nice man! They have another more secluded cabin with a King bed we might try next time, although I would miss visiting with the dogs! 🐾🐶💕
All in all it was a delightful get away!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely beautiful. So relaxing & just what we needed. Would love to go back!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The view of the lake with the sunrise/sunset alone is worth the trip. The cabin looks like the pics. The host was responsive. I would note the bed appears to be a Murphy bed which could fold up into a cabinet. It's not a king size bed, and there's about a foot gap between the bed and the wall where it would fold up. Not a bad thing, just something guests may want to be aware of. The place was nice and clean, the TV was a streaming smart TV that worked well. Internet worked well. There is an event center next door. We were fortunate enough to book when there were no events planned, so it was nice and quiet. You can ask the host or find when events are booked online, if that's a concern. Again, the location and views are terrific and worth the trip for those :)"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a very cozy, comfortable cabin in a beautiful setting. Very easy to find and an easy check in. Hubby quickly made a fire in the fireplace and it really warmed the cabin up. The bed was comfortable and everything was clean. Wonderful little spot to rest and recharge."

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We got there late at night so taking the road past the gate and trying to locate it was a little difficult, just not easy to see.
Cabin was great, good for a short stay. Wasn’t a fan of the Murphy bed as it didn’t match the bed in the photos and our pillows fell behind the bed easily. The shower in the bathroom wasn’t quite clean.
Overall, was a very cute cabin, beautiful view of the lake and was great for a short staycation!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect solo getaway! It was so refreshing, peaceful. I really enjoyed my stay and look forward to staying here again!"

The in cabin wood fireplace was beyond wonderful. . . I had plenty of wood to use and the looftlighter to light it! The little pond was so pretty and countryside around it made for great hikes. The bed was soooo comfortable! Love the cane rocking chair and the porch rocking chairs too (would have been out there more if it wasn’t 20 f. I call it an oasis in the middle of Jenks/Tulsa!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay here. We love the secluded cabin tucked in the city. Lots to do close by. Host has improved the hot water situation that used to be less than stellar. We have no complaints! Great host. Will definitely stay here again.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This listing was better than I had imagined. You get all the peace of a secluded area but your 5 min from local stores and 15 min from other entertainment.
You get a tiny home feel with the view of a lake, all the sounds of nature and with a ranch vibe.
I recommend Five Oaks Lodge to all couples that want to get away from the big city."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful cabin! Would not feel secluded if there was an event happening at the center. Would want to make sure it wasn’t being used before I booked it.
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Claudia was wonderful to work with. Very nice. The place was cozy and quiet just what we needed. The surroundings were very peaceful The only complaint is the shower does not get hot. Very tepid water. I didn't notice the review that mentioned it before our stay but future guest may ask if it's been fixed before visiting. Claudia did offer to compensate us for the inconvenience which was very nice. The shower is the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars. If it's ever fixed I would definitely stay again. 🙂
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,My husband and I loved every minute at Curley's Cabin. We loved the coziness of the cabin with a warm fire that we enjoyed eat night. The bed was very comfortable and the kitchen had everything we needed to make meals. Watching the morning sunrise on the porch and enjoying the quiet surroundings was a highlight of our stay.
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Five Oak Lodge was nice and great location. We enjoyed our stay there. I would liked to somehow have gotten the shower to get hotter than lukewarm, that was not pleasant at all. The wine bottle open was broke as well and had to find a utensil one in the drawer. The cottage is cute and it’s on a nice piece of property, but there is an event center right next to it that I was not aware of till the day of. Overall it was good, close to a 4/5, but would fix the things I pointed out."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful log cabin! Sits right next to a small body of water and it’s perfect for sitting in front porch in the morning and just taking in nature beautiful place!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our stay was fabulous and we definitely want to visit again. The cabin had everything we needed and the setting couldn’t have been more beautiful. From the cabin there are views of the pond and the herd of Scottish Highland cattle. We enjoyed drinking our morning coffee and watching them as they grazed and wandered along the pond. The property was decorated for the holidays with greenery and lights lined the main road as well as the cabin porch. It was very festive driving in at night. There wasn’t a thing I would change; a truly memorable visit!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is our second time staying. We love the location and the ease of checking in an out. It's wonderful especially for Tulsa area customers who want a little peace and quiet.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Host was very thoughtful turning cabin lights on since we were going to arrive after dark! the cozy cabin was just what we needed for some peace and quiet. It was close to food and activities but still nestled in nature. Would deffinately go again!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great cozy hideaway! The view of the lake from the front porch is fantastic and the inside is perfect for two to get away for a weekend stay!! Definitely some place to return to in all seasons!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay! Curley’s Cabin provided a beautiful and relaxing weekend away from our busy lives in OKC. Loved the highland cows, horses, chickens, and the view from the front porch. There were several events at the lodge while we were there, but we definitely had our privacy and were not bothered by anything going on. Claudia is quick to respond, and we had everything we needed at the cabin. Highly recommend, and we hope to be back!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,One of the most incredible places I’ve ever stayed in. There is the water view from the front porch and the horses and cows in the adjacent fields. Just amazing!!! Soothing and relaxing.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures only offer a glimpse into everything Claudia’s cabin has to offer. It’s more of a hidden peaceful retreat. The cabin has an old world charm and is very cozy. It’s set up much like a studio apartment, having the kitchen, living room and bedroom all in one big space. The shower is large and we never ran out of hot water. We relaxed in the evening with a nice fire outside. It overlooked the little lake below which was reflecting the bright light of the moon. It was really beautiful.
Her Scottish cows were so sweet. We also enjoyed seeing her horses and chickens. While we were out for a walk, we met Claudia’s husband, who was very welcoming and kind. He took a little break from building some horse stables to visit with us. He offered us a tour and shared their story of how they developed this beautiful area. The (rental) cabin sits adjacent to a beautiful venue to which he also built. His craftsmanship and their passion to host others is evident in the all of the little details you’ll experience, which are too numerous to mention. We will be coming back again. Also, check out their beautiful venue if you’re interested in a wedding or large gathering. Their whole place is so special."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a perfect little get-away. Easy to find! Easy check in & out! BEAUTIFUL view! No one bothered us! Cool animals too, as it's actually a farm. We definitely would go back!!! Jenks,OK. seems to be an awesome little town on the outskirts of Tulsa. With a riverwalk and an awesome downtown area with a lot of cool shops like The Cajun Blackbird, and Tulsa just across the river, we found lots to do!!! We were told by a few strangers in Jenks that we had THE BEST room in town!!! We are certain WE DID!!!!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Claudia is truly an exceptional hostess. The cabin was clean, comfortable, exceeded my expectations. Having a small kitchenette allowed me to bring my own food and I didn't have to leave the premises for the three days I was there. An extra bonus was the location of the cabin on the lake and the amazing views of sunrises reflecting on the lake while I drank my morning coffee. I definitely recommend Five Oaks for events and for cabin rental."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What an amazing property! My only regret is that I couldn't stay longer. Located on a gated private property, this was a comfortable one-room log cabin on a lake, with a great porch and rocking chairs, well lit at night. The cabin was lovely, with a great kitchen, well stocked and immaculately clean. The bed was very comfortable, as was the seating area. I loved sitting out on the porch with my morning coffee. In mid-August, the humidity was dense but the cabin's air-conditioning was up to the task. Also a great shower!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Claudia's place was tucked away on the edge of a lake on a retreat with a farm on it. My wife and I were just passing through en route to a family get-together and booked Claudia's place at pretty much the last minute. She was easy to reach if needed, the place was quiet, quaint, and cozy. My wife enjoyed watching the horses and cows. One of my favorite things to do is to drink coffee as the sun comes up over a lake, and it had been a long time since I'd had that luxury. Thanks again Claudia!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful experience and beautiful home feeling cabin! Only 15 minutes approximately from Tulsa and definitely a feeling of being in the country!

If a cozy home away from home and view of the lake weren’t enough there are many wonderful creatures and people who are kind and care about the land. Claudia went above and beyond to help us on our trip and get settled. We got to meet their baby calf in the pasture and the horses too.

The Rooftop is a great location to view, and take in that Oklahoma air, get some photos in, and relax. The Apartment is very comfortable, wholesome and clean. I love how the sunlight creeps into the window, illuminating the living room. The Bed is so comfortable. I love how the mattress shapes and molds you into it, snugging you in. The Internet is fast, and efficient."

Close to work downtown, and restaurants, etc. Would love to stay here during warmer weather when the roof amenities could be utilized. Would 100% recommend and stay here again
Be aware that this unit has no drapes and you can see clearly into the living room and kitchen from the street and parking garage across the street."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,So cozy and nice definitely will be back
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"For my first time ever staying in an Airbnb I was really impressed with the ease of check-in and with how nice and clean the apartment was. I gave it 5 stars because it is an overall great place to stay. I will say this, and this is not a negative comment for the host, but the parking on the street was a bit annoying as you need to update and pay for parking at a maximum of every 2 hours, due to the fact that it is paid street parking. It is inexpensive at only $1 per hour, just make sure you're not late on paying each hour or else you run the risk of getting ticketed. Lastly. I prefer a traditional type of mattress compared to a memory foam one, not saying this to complain about what they had, it's just my preference, as I found it harder to fall asleep."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host! Would definitely recommend.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is beautiful, spotless, new, modern and has everything you could need (including a clothes steamer!!!).

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Gorgeous apartment. Responsive host. Any inconveniences we’re handled immediately. Parking is difficult, but you should expect that when choosing to stay downtown anywhere. Follow the rules, or you’ll get a boot like I did haha. Dominos and subway are within walking distance which was a big plus. Sit back and enjoy a glass of wine on the rooftop with their provided wine glasses. 10/10 recommend!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I frequently visit Tulsa for work and usually stay at a nice hotel near my office. I was a little nervous about an air bnb based on prior experience, but this one was perfect. Amazing location, great value, well decorated and well appointed and very comfortable. It was even close enough to my usual hotel to grab a drink at the bar a couple of nights. Sunsets on the rooftop became a nice evening ritual. I will definitely stay there again!"

I wasn’t entirely sure about the location of the place since it was a tiny house and the description didn’t fully include what it was but it was just a little shed like building next to a bigger house. It shared the drive way. It was one room with a bed and a kitchenette. Then the bathroom which had the laundry. It was perfect for our weekend stay and our dog was welcomed with a doggy bowl and a toy. The back yard wasn’t enclosed but it was still a big backyard our dog ran around in."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This home looked to be brand new and with everything it offered I would expect it to cost twice as much as it lists for. My Wife and I both kept saying this is awesome! She didn't believe me when I told her how much it was. Folks looking for a rental that is very special should stop looking when you come across this one. We prefer a place that does not allow pets or parties and NO smoking. They even had fresh water and fresh condiments in the fridge. I could go on and on but simply I'll just say - THANK YOU Roi...
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Looked just as the pictures and actually was bigger than we thought it would be. Place was ready when we arrived and we got in super quick and easy. There were little things provided that made us feel at home (pots, pans, condiments, etc). Very happy with our stay!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is like nothing I’ve ever seen before! It’s a bit small, but the design and decor style is so unique. The attention to detail is amazing! I had no doubts about the cleanliness as it was obviously very clean. It is a “smart home” so that feature made it feel very fancy. All you had to do was ask Google if you wanted to play music or turn on some lights. This place serves one purpose and one purpose only. You’re not going here to vedge out and watch TV. So many fun and kinky items to play and explore with. Would 10/10 recommend!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a ton of fun here, great place to stay. Definitely coming here again."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our first time getting to play in a private sex positive, kink-friendly space. We were already wanting to visit again! And the RR made us wish there were more private adult rooms like this nearby. Amanda & Jake communicated and set realistic expectations for our one night stay. We thought the overall accommodations were top notch—right from the entrance and until we left. Highly recommend!"

The pictures don't do this place justice. A lot of love, planning, and care went into this condo to make it what it is and we appreciate it! Every inch is usable and clean. Great communication. No issues finding the place or parking. We are coming back this summer. Thank you!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We truly enjoyed our stay. The place is easy to find, it is near shopping and restaurants. It is extremely clean. The condo complex is dated but once you walk inside you are never aware of that. It is clean, and very modern, the condo is a complete smart home. It is designed for play and fun more than comfort and relaxing. This place has more toys than some dungeons I have been to and by far our favorite was the swing room. We also really enjoyed playing with the floggers the owners sell. We were able to see, feel and decide on what we want to purchase. Should you want to purchase before they will have item waiting when you arrive. We spent most of our time at the Condo only leaving for breakfast. Owners keep the fridge filled with water which was a nice touch. We will definitely be back and the only thing we will do differently is take our own pillows."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for providing a space for us. The sound proofing the layout everything worked.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I would recommend this to any friends looking for a fun, adult night away. The hosts were so helpful with everything. I tried to suprise my hubby for our anniversary and everything seemed to be working against me, but they were so kind and helpful. Parking is a little tricky after dark, but it's a simple turn to the right once you enter, then a turn to the left and you have a covered space. They were quick to reply (though they were probably tired of me), everything was clean, thought out and ready for action! Even the fridge was stocked with bottled water. A playground for two adults that never get enough playtime - and my favorite part was in the swing room -because I was inverted.
If you're a fan of Top Gun or just want to try out some fantasy play, do yourself a favor and book this place now.
Thank you for an awesome experience."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, it was an amazing stay! Hosts were very helpful with any issues (finding the parking spot was a bit tricky in the dark, and the helpful map provided was cropped a bit on the airbnb app) but once we got that figured out everything was perfect. I can't wait to go again!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing! Everything is so clean and spotless! The area maybe a touch sketchy, but the complex was very quiet and peaceful and the parking spot is basically right in front of the condo. The details inside are all so amazing, there is a lot to look at and touch. If you are thinking about staying here, do it, you will not regret it!! I am so happy to find a place like this in Oklahoma, we will most definitely be back!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a cool place and would go back again! I will mention it’s not in the best part of Tulsa however once your inside that quickly slips your mind! lol

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing place. we enjoyed our stay. Everything was as described inside.

Super clean, modern, fresh, high-quality, upscale and SEXY. Everything was amazing."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Riverside Rendezvous was exactly what had hoped it would be! We have never been to a cleaner Airbnb. It was absolutely pristine!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was spotless and comfortable. There were more than a handful of little details that take this place over the top. The photos and description were accurate but didn't do justice to the place. Completely exceeded our expectations. Very fun and relaxing. This is our new favorite place to stay in the tulsa area.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,It was a perfect stay!!
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Her dogs 4 were to close to where my dog could get out and my dog would go crazy barking at her dog’s barking. She did try to keep them in her house. The weather was very cold and the house was very cold the first day and night. They should have turned the heaters on sooner. The tv would not get local channels just a personal preference for me.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect location that is close to everything but still feels tucked away. The bed is so comfortable and we felt right at home. Pretty decor and roomy. We appreciate the water bottles and snacks. Having parking right next to the cottage was convenient and felt safe. Lori is very hospitable and helpful. We would love to stay here again if ever in Tulsa.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our quick stay in Tulsa at the cottage! Having an off street dedicated parking space was great, and the location was very convenient to parks and the main roads to get around town. The cottage was extremely cozy - very comfortable bed and pillows, a lot of street noise but very quiet indoors. The dog run is a great touch if you bring your dogs. Fully functional kitchen complete with thoughtful snacks for guests. We would recommend this place to anyone!"

his two pups with him. I was able to get away for the evening and cook my

It’s nice to enjoy a glass of wine at the end of the day out there while listening to the water feature. AND, there's a new fenced area in front of the cottage that is landscaped beautifully and has a woodburning fireplace!
Still the best AirBnB around!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cute cottage with all the amenities needed. The hosts were extra friendly and welcoming and went above and beyond to orient us and make sure we had what we needed. Finding the location was a little confusing because it’s begins the main house and you access it by driving around the block and up a side street. However our host jumped in their car and showed us the way which was so very kind! There’s a grassy lot down a few steps from the cottage for dogs to relieve themselves and a park right across the street. Great place to stay!

Still a good stopover overall, and Lori was very kind and accommodating."

During our stay, Tulsa experienced severe weather (thunderstorms/possible tornadoes) and our hosts went out of their way to keep us informed, which left us feeling safe and comfortable.
As for the cottage, it was super adorable. It’s definitely a great place for a weekend getaway. The location is perfect for visiting nearby hotspots, such as The Gathering Place, downtown, etc. Overall, the only thing better than the cottage was the hospitality. Highly recommend!"

Each room is climate controlled and if you like a very chilled environment during this hot summer, this is your place. Dmitrius welcomed me to the cottage and showed me around.

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"PERFECT! the safe enclosed yard allowed us to vacation in comfort with our dogs. The cleanliness, charming décor, thoughtful snack foods, awesome hot showers, easy check in, recommendations, green parks across the street and superb location made this the best Air Band B we have ever been fortunate to find!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay and renovated beautifully. The hosts really make you feel at home!
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful place! The decor is incredible lovely and stylish and the house is set up with everything one might need. Very clean! The location was wonderful and walkable and we had a great time exploring the river walk, Gathering Place, and nearby lovely neighborhoods. We loved the little yard, too! Lori was amazing to communicate with, she had a great book of recommendations, and she left us wine, cheese, crackers, and girl scout cookies! What an amazing host!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Was amazing, nice and spacious will come back again and stay right by everything."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautifully decorated, spotlessly clean cottage. Located minutes from downtown, river parks and gathering place. Lori is the best host I’ve ever stayed with. I’ve booked her cottage multiple times now. When was the last time your Airbnb host left (good quality) cheese, crackers, wine and cookies for you? Weighted blanket? Luxury linens? Those are just a few of the thoughtful touches you’ll find at this cottage. Look no further, you’ll love your stay here."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was amazing! It is so close to so many different activities!! Parks and reserves along with great food places for breakfast, lunch and dinner!! Lori made sure we had everything that we needed including for the dogs! We will return here!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect space for my husband and I and our dogs. Walk right down to the river. We only stayed for one night to get a good nights sleep and it was lovely. Very cozy bed and thoughtful touches. Super easy check in and out. Cute patio space. Definitely recommend.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was the perfect place to stay during our time in Tulsa.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lori’s cottage was perfect! So many small touches to really make the place feel like home. Check-in/check-out was so easy and she offered detailed directions on how to get to the cottage. If I’m ever back in Tulsa, I’ll definitely be staying here again!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute place. Just stopped for a night passing through. Directions were great and easy to find even in the dark.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We often stay here on our trips to Tulsa. It is always clean and well stocked with thoughtful touches and hosts. Probably our favorite AirBNB ever!
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A cute little studio with so many thoughtful touches. I would highly recommend.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a long drive and this AirBnb was exactly what we needed to relax and get a good night’s sleep. Homey, cozy, cute and welcoming."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lori's Cottage is sparkling clean and full of amazing homey touches. The cottage is in a prime location in Tulsa, close to some great attractions. Inside, the cottage is well designed and comes with everything one needs in order to make themselves at home. The kitchen and bathroom are fully stocked. The bed is heavenly (I hadn't slept that good in years!). The patio and water feature outside is the cherry on top of this package. Lori and Demetrius were so welcoming and accommodating to our family (including our doggo). Lastly, the binder they provide has everything you need to know about Tulsa. No need to google anything, as this binder is so thorough. We can't wait to stay again on future trips to Tulsa."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,L & D were so hospitable! They have the cutest and cleanest little home and I cannot wait to stay there again!
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lori’s place was wonderful! Spacious, well-decorated, with tons of thoughtful touches (like a weighted blanket!) and great recommendations. We’d recommend it to anyone stopping through or staying in Tulsa— we only wish we could have stayed longer."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed Lori and Demetri's spot on our way west so much, that we decided to book it again on our way back east. It was a great return experience. Super clean, great amenities, comfy bed with wonderful heavy blanket. Our little pugs also enjoyed the dog door and patio area in back. Sweet hosts, very responsive and generous. We will definitely return should our travels take us through Tulsa again."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a good time communication and cleanliness was great. Would recommend
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lori's space has EVERYTHING you need, from the bathroom to the kitchen - you're covered.

2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Really cute spot with everything needed for a nice travel stay. Our little pugs loved the little doggie door and back patio area.

We will definitely return!
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great cozy place for our family and pups
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great stay with our dogs at Lori’s place. It’s super convenient to downtown and super clean. It has a cute little patio and the bathroom space heater was awesome! It was exactly what we needed for our short overnight in Tulsa! Thanks!
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fantastic place, loved the hospitality and the amenities they provided!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A bottle of wine, cheese and crackers, yummy bread, lots of bottled water, chocolate snacks awaited me when I arrived. Great place from start to finish"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lori many thanks from my wife and me. We truly enjoyed the space and the central location to all the areas of interest!
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"All our needs were met. The cottage was safe, clean and comfortable."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ideal location for accessing River Trail and the GP.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location for a staycation if you are a Tulsan. Quiet and peaceful.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Hands down the best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in. Location is great. Cottage is beautiful and so clean. Lori is quick to respond to any questions. Private secluded patio is a bonus. Hospitality touches provided in cottage are above and beyond.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cozy and clean place in a nice and convenient area. Our stay was quick but the cottage was perfect for the two of us!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and amazing location! Was a 20 min walk to the Gathering Place which was very cool, and 5-15 minutes from just about everywhere we wanted to see in town. A bit close to the freeway, so might be a tough night sleep if you are a light sleeper (could here engines and what not lightly). Really well stocked and nice amenities. Would stay here again for sure."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This cottage was amazing! We were joking we could give a bad review just to keep it open for us! Can’t wait to go back!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great cottage. Clean and beautiful. Amazing location next to the river.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a lovely place! Lori and her husband were so kind and welcoming, and their studio was perfect and cozy. Thanks for your hospitality and for the great, personalized recommendations! We hope to be back."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a great experience.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, peaceful, nurturing get away only 30 min away from Tulsa… Lovely experience ❤️🙌🪷🏕️"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"my boyfriend and i loved the dome, or just the three ponds community in general. we had checked in a much later time, so finding the dome felt like a scavenger hunt, but the instructions and signs helped a ton. EVERYTHING was just as described.
my favorite part was the shower (or the farm, the animals were so sweet and lovely). i never knew i would need an outdoor shower, it was so relaxing. there are two or three other airbnb’s on the premises, so you may run into other guests, but we didn’t have a problem with that.
the only ‘bad’ thing i can say is that there was a spider in the corner of the shower, along with a spider egg on the shower curtain (i’m just a wuss when it comes to spiders).
if you’re thinking about staying here, do it!!!! joe was an amazing host. i will be booking again :)"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Highly recommend
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"great place to stay, beware spiders, sheets were kind of dirty?"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,10/10!! Very beautiful and peaceful. Would definitely recommend to outdoorsy people.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"From the hosts, to the property, to the animals, to the people that occupy the community - absolutely breathtaking. Joe and Hailey have cultivated quite a space and are very kind and accommodating.
The quaint Sunset Dome was much more functional than I anticipated, also! The two chairs that sit next to the fire are UNREAL, and look over just one of the pretty ponds they have to offer. Equally great are all the hammocks that lie along the trails. An absolutely wonderful stay that I will most certainly reserve again!
Also, if you’re lucky enough to get the pitter-patter of some rain during your sleep and stay, you’ll never forget it! Pure Bliss :)"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super cozy and peaceful! I slept like a baby. The outside shower was awesome!! The animals were lovely 🥰 thanks a lot!!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This unique place was fabulous! If you want a peaceful getaway in beautiful surroundings, this is your spot. I will be back."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Clean. Perfect for 2 people (and our dog). Reasonable price. Would stay again.
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Little bungalow duplex with lots of charm and comfort.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,had a nice stay for the weekend.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute place. Near town and convention for my purpose of travel. If I could change anything, it would be to have a tv in the bedroom!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,It was nice and cozy
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, easy to find and get in, and beautifully decorated. A lot of brightly colored pieces around the house really bring the place to life visually. Comfortable bed, and the extension cords were helpfully configured — it was easy to plug stuff in by the bed, is what I mean to say. (You know it's important!) Christina is a great host."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My two dogs and I had such a lovely stay. From the moment I walked in, I was squealing at how cute the place was! Everything was easy to find around the duplex, from toiletries/bathroom amenities to stocked coffee for the Keurig, and easy to find cleaning supplies! The place is close to Cherry Street where I was able to explore different restaurants and bars with my friends who are locals. Christina is amazing and very responsive; when I wanted to extend my stay for an extra day, she responded promptly, we updated my reservation. I am grateful to have been able to spend some time at this beautiful little getaway!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great location! Easy access to downtown and near plenty of restaurants and little shops. Super cute little space. Decor and design was adorable. Will definitely book here again for our next trip to Tulsa.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Christina’s home was exactly as advertised. Cute, charming & extremely cozy. The bed was amazing & I slept great! She even had very nice soaps & sulfate free shampoo & conditioner. Coffee was stocked & delicious & the washer and dryer were extremely nice.
Best of all, Christina was very responsive to all of my questions & was an excellent host."
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Overall a great place to stay. It was clean and ready to go when we got there. I will say make sure you read all the house rules. They are quite strict(especially for smokers). Location is great for going to the Tulsa Expo Square as it is only a couple blocks away. Christina was great at communicating when needed. I recommend her place if you’re going to the Expo square.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome host, great location, near restaurants and the expo halls. House was tastefully decorated and i would definitely stay there again. Perfect size for a weekend getaway for 2"
2024-01-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,It was Fine for what we needed which was basically a place to sleep while we’re at the event at the Sage Net expo center. The place does need some updating. Although we didn’t use the kitchen at all it was fairly primitive. Appliances are basic and aged but everything works. Pretty sure the countertops were painted plywood of which the paint was peeling off. It’s a duplex and you can clearly hear the people conversations in the unit next door so obviously they could hear ours. Bed mattress was comfortable and the bathroom was clean. Check in and out was easy.
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Great location and very nice host.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,It was clean and cute! We had a great stay.
2023-12-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"As a couple this is a great stay, minor cons. We were only left with a quarter roll of toilet paper so we had to go buy some, the toilet and shower could have been cleaner but there was cleaner available for us. The shower curtain was too short and unfortunately flooded the bathroom after one shower, but there were extra towels and rugs to clean it up with. The location is great and felt safe but the home was definitely not as nice as pictured, it was just a bit dated with bad worn down floors and lots of dust / cobwebs and the decor didn't fully match the pictures. When entering, the first thing we noticed was the size and a pair of dusty foot prints on the table as off it wasn't wiped down. An unpleasant smell in the bedroom as well. There was only one TV in the living room, it is not as big as the one pictured and there were issues with connecting that to the Wi-Fi but that was resolved. The washer and dryer were great to have and everything worked efficiently and properly!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Christina was a great host! Enjoyed my stay very much.
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"The bed was not what we expected. It was listed
as a queen with air mattress. It was very small, hard and no pillow top or comfort of any kind. I literally wanted to measure it, due to unbelievable."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host! Enjoyed my stay. Comfortable house!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was fantastic for what we needed, very convenient for where we needed to go. This house was spotless, nothing was dirty. Everytime i interacted with Christina it was a fast response with lots of helpful instructions/information. It was very quiet and unbothered. The AC control was tricky, but like i said above the response time/instructions fixed us right up in no time. price of the house was great. Im glad we found this gem! Cute decor as well!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It’s a great little place especially for the price! It’s in the middle of midtown so not the greatest of areas but we felt perfectly safe in the house. Christina was very friendly and the check-in and checkout instructions were clear!
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Cute house with artsy decor.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Close to Expo Center and location felt safe. No problems at all.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was really nice r and cozy here I would definitely stay here again
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,A few glitches getting in. Host was very responsive and helpful
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is very comfy and conveniently located. Christina is a great communicator. I’d highly recommend.
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed for a week and it was great. Not very far from everything. There was a noticeable smell through the house, but it wasn't too strong and the bed was a little rough to sleep on. Though everything else in the house was awesome. loved the artwork and the retro vibes!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was so far the nicest place I've ever stayed!! 5/5 would stay again and highly recommend!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Christina was very kind, always had quick response time to any questions or concerns my wife and I had, and was very generous and flexible. House was a bit on the old side- creaky as you walked around, and doesn't have a back door that leads directly to the yard which was a bit inconvenient with my dogs, but was overall a great place to stay, especially for the price, and would absolutely stay here again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay at this charming place! Would definitely book again. Everything was very clean and Christina is a great host!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Christina is super nice host and attentive with everything we loved this place! super nice and cozy will definitely recommend and we would love to stay here again
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Christina was an awesome host who responded to me immediately with any concern or question I had. Staying at her air bnb made me want to get my own little house in midtown tulsa and settle down there with my partner. It was beautifully decorated with cool local art finds and a killer little red vintage looking fridge. Everything I needed was at the air bnb like spices, pans, detergent and dryer sheets, even shampoo and conditioner. When I come back to see my mom and sisters I'd definitely want to stay there again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a lovely home that felt incredibly comfortable! Everything was in great working order and very clean. Would absolutely love to stay here again!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful Tulsa neighborhood tucked into a little nook of culture. Make sure you go up 15th St!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"great stay, nice and simple."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed the space. Kitchen was great and coffee, spices, pots, pans, toaster fridge, microwave. Washer and dryer really nice. bathroom is nice & clean.

The reason we didn’t give 5 stars is the mattress. It’s worn out with no support and sits on slats which isn’t good support either.
We are mid 60’s and need more support. Maybe it’s great for younger folks. We don’t have back issues but did after our 3 night stay. The last night we finally put the mattress on the floor. So this is info for older folks or folks with back issues.
If the bed doesn’t matter, it’s a really good place for a fair price."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, our stay was amazing!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Stayed for a month here and really enjoyed it! The house is spacious and nicely decorated. It was pretty cozy!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Staying at Christina’s was exactly what we hoped for. It had everything we needed for our week long stay. I was able to work remotely with ease and our dog enjoyed the backyard. Not to mention, the location was very convenient. You won’t find a better option for the price!"
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was a little older than anticipated, but great location."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Christinas place was clean and very comfortable. The front door lock was a little difficult to figure out but it worked out fine. Great location and very close to the fairgrounds. Would stay here again if it is just one person or a couple.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Loved my stay! Super cute but keep in mind, it is an older house so lots of creaks and such as the house “breathes”. Had pots, pans, and some basic cooking supplies so that’s nice for a longer term stay."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our stay was great. The place was clean and looked like the pics! Loved the art.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Precious place to stay, definite bang for my buck! Highly recommend!!!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect, affordable, exactly what we needed place! We would definitely recommend to others and stay here in the future."
2023-02-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"I loved the decor, location and sweet home touches she provided. I was a bit frustrated with some miscommunication in terms of a long term rental. I was sent from one side of the duplex to the other in the middle of a snow storm with snow and ice covering the front porch and sidewalk. Once I arrived on the other side of the duplex there was an empty condom wrapper next to the bed, a ball of hair/dust on floor, a rag on the dining room table and strong smell of cologne on the sheets like they had not been washed. I alerted Christina about the mess and ice. There wasn't any offer to correct these issues nor make any kind of amends to me. Additionally, upon checking out she blocked me as if I had been a bother reporting health and safety issues."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very tidy and lovely AirBnb duplex equipped with everything you need. A good bed and nice bathroom. Christina is a great host and there when if you need her. We had a great stay!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Location was key as We were attending an event just three blocks away. Everything was clean and just as in photos. This made for us a wonderful little getaway will defiantly be looking to stay again in the future years. Thank You
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Christina's place was exactly as described. Cozy and convenient place for a short stay or even longer bookings. Brand new washer and dryer, so convenient. Check-in was easy and the kitchen is well equipped. Clean place. I would stay here again. Thanks"
2023-01-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"The 3 star ratings are meant for middle of the road since we did not stay in the place.
Upon arrival there was a pile of trash by the front door and the upon entering we noticed several issues with the condition of the place and it did not match the photos provided. We reached out to the host and to AirBnb and she did agree to cancel our reservations and gave us a full refund."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is absolutely stunning! The art, the vintage aesthetic fridge, the openness of the space, we loved every aspect. Staying here is definitely worth your money. Thank you Christina!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"very responsive, clean cute place!!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent little place. Quiet and cozy. And just as described! Thank you for having us!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Christina’s place is just as described. I love an old house that’s been loved with the build ins and the crystal door knobs, what a cool place close to everything. Backyard was fenced and great for my fur baby, hope to be back!"
2022-11-01,2.0,Stayed with a pet,"Overall a less than desirable experience. Stayed 2 short days. The host was constantly messaging me, reminding about rules, expectations, and asking us to clean up the place. Me and my wife checked in late, left early and were still asked by the host to clean up, despite paying $65 of cleaning fees. This included us having to wash dishes, taking trash with us, stripping beds, starting laundry, etc. This house definitely is a money machine for the host and be prepared, you may feel like you work for her. The host also asks that you bring your own sheets and blankets if you have pets to cover her couches. None of the doors inside the unit close or lock correctly and the bed in the bedroom is almost on the floor. How does one prevent pets from moving around the place when none of the doors lock or close and the bed is one foot off the ground. The bed is also unlevel and the foot is higher than the head, which is not comfortable. There's an old moldy shower curtain in the bathroom. Not a huge deal but you'd think with all the cleaning fees and expectations the place would be spotless."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, pictures are accurate, easy in and out process!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Christina’s place for our 1st wedding anniversary. It was such a cute, clean place. We really enjoyed our trip and loved our stay!"

2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,a great stay. very clean and tidy. good price and close to the fairground. great communication.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place!!! Right by the street, very very accessible. It’s a very charming quaint house with beautiful wooden floors and great art from local artists. The bed was incredibly soft, i especially love the pillows and the comforter. Beautiful bathroom!! It felt like home for use during our weekend trip. Convenience store right beside where you can buy your quick needs. We had a small issue with the door in the beginning but Christina was able to send over his handyman the following day and it was good as new. Overall a 5/5 stay!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is Airbnb was one of my favorites. So peaceful. And they honestly thought of everything for their guests to have a well-rounded, memorable experience. I was sad to leave and hope to go back soon!"

2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a nice stay in the unit. It was well stocked with supplies, linens and kitchen utensils. It was near the Expo, fairgrounds and several places of interest. The host replied to questions or concerns promptly."
2022-06-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"Good spot to call home base while visiting town. Some aspects of house look nicer in pictures but it was tidy and clean. The noise from next door can be loud at times, the walls are thin. The door has trouble locking so that was a little inconvenient. Overall quiet neighborhood and easy access to all areas of the city."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying at Christina's place. It's super cozy and has all the essentials that you'll need for a quick weekend trip or several days stay. Christina was super quick to respond when we had issues with the alarm system beeping and was able to fix it quickly as well! It's super close to Cherry Street and the fair grounds and only about 10mins from downtown. Will definitely stay again when we're in Tulsa.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Christina’s place is super convenient and made for a great temporary home while I was getting settled in Tulsa. Hard to find a comfortable and pet friendly place, but Christina managed to make it happen!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I ended up not making the trip. I wish I had something to add to the reviews. Jason was very responsive and courteous in our interactions. I will definitely book again if I get to Tulsa. Be sure to read all of the details before booking.
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was nice enough. However, I did not feel very welcome. After booking, I received an email telling me that the place was under 24 hour surveillance and the security company monitoring the home would knock on the door if they felt anything was a miss. Then, when entering the home, there were several copies of the “rules of the house”. Most of the rules detailed how we would be fined if anything was missing, if anyone entered the home who was not authorized, or if we were Tulsa residents. I felt like I was being treated like a child or in a prison. Also, the bed was very uncomfortable, the iron didn’t work, and any time I moved outside I was told that I was being recorded. The whole thing made me and my wife feel uncomfortable during our stay. I understand people can be disrespectful to Airbnb’s, but maybe you shouldn’t assume that everyone’s intent is malicious when staying at your place."

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great communication
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Clean. Spacious. Plenty of room for several people etc. Not the most comfortable mattresses or the best or most blankets available but for the price I was extremely surprised with the house & it’s cleanliness & functionality! It’s a nice older home that has been updated & well maintained. Plenty of room outside if it’s warm. Extremely gracious && caring host. My ex boyfriend got extremely sick & she had absolutely no problem extending our stay for us. The host was very personable and understanding. Bring some extra pillows & blankets!! Once these mattresses are upgraded this place will be top notch. It’s not in the best part of town but the security really shines here. There are floodlights && cameras everywhere outside so it felt extremely safe & secure. If it’s wintertime bring a space heater for the bathroom. It’s a bigger older house with charm & an updated bathroom but it gets drafty!!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Felisha was communicative and helpful during and after the booking process. Her home is comfortable and cute.
My mom and I enjoyed our stay, and we were able to get to other parts of Tulsa with ease. Felisha also has an assistant who is nearby and willing to help too.
The welcome gift was a nice bonus and appreciated. Thank you so much!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What an amazing time we had at Pedro and Emily's place! It is a beautiful, comfortable and fun location to host a weekend with family. There is so much space and everything is well designed and thought out.
We were able to have the Lola's (grandma in Tagalog) playing Bingo at the kitchen table, mid adults playing ""Ticket to Ride"" (provided by Pedro and Emily!) in the den, and the younger kids playing skee ball, foosebal and Switch on the HUGE tv in the game room. The Lola's even used the gorgeous sauna on their first night and had a lovely time.
Lastly, Pedro and Emily were such gracious hosts that communicated with us every step of the way. Everything was clear and friendly. They even messaged us 20 minutes after we checked out to let us know we left our keys in the house! That saved us a world of trouble and appreciate them getting ahold of us.
We will DEFINITELY be using their space again as we created so many memories and had such an excellent time. Thank you!!!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,the house was large and beautiful in a great location.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Maps easily brought us to the correct address in a great Tulsa location. We used the concise directions to enter a well appointed foyer/mudroom. It was a great space to keep our winter gear organized and accessible. The fridge was clean and ready in a kitchen with great counter top space and, yay, filtered water at the sink. All the bedrooms and two full baths are located upstairs so the half bath downstairs was appreciated by family members who range from grandchild to great-grandfather as we reserved our trips up the stairs to bedtime. There were books for that entire age range as well. Board games are a necessity when we gather together and we discovered that we brought duplicate games of those provided in the excellent game room (SKEE BALL). The easy to clean high chair scooted right up to the table so the youngest player could be included. Too cold for the pool but lots of fenced space for the dogs. The hosts responded quickly to any questions we had regardless of time zone."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I had a great stay here on my recent trip to Tulsa. The location was perfect, near downtown Tulsa and the Gathering Place but still in a quiet residential area.
The house was very clean and new. The sauna was a real treat and the large pool was a great way to cool off and unwind after a day exploring.

Love that it’s pet friendly, the dog run is a nice touch. It was super helpful that they had dog bowls for us because we forgot ours!
Highly recommend. For the price, it’s a incredible value. I’d book it again!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I truly enjoyed my stay at Patricia’s place. I was traveling alone and the size of the place was perfect for me. The kitchen is a bit narrow, so if there’s more than one person it could be a little tight. The backyard is such a nice, relaxing, peaceful (shared) space. Patricia has done a great job making the Airbnb such a lovely space both inside and out. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I would definitely want to stay here if I had a longer stay in Tulsa. Definitely one of my favorite AirBnB stays. The AirBnB feels like the perfect 'Tiny Home'. It feels private and I loved the backyard. It was so peaceful and clean. Waking up to only hearing songbirds was lovely too. The only walkable thing is Brookside Diner but it is an extremely easy 5 minute drive to all things Peoria street. Trader Joe's, Whole Foods and high-end boutiques. It's less than 10 minutes from other cute neighborhoods/shops etc. I particularly loved the Coffee House on Cherry Street - and the shops there as well.
The only CONS in my opinion:
-the bathroom might be a tight squeeze for some, but really nice big shower and amenities.
-The bed is mostly firm.
-The pillows are small and the stuffing is not smooth. New queen size pillows might be nice.
But despite that, I slept comfortably. Like I said, one of my favorite AIRBnB's. You can tell everything had a thoughtful touch. Thank you Patricia!"

Cute place to stay."

No complaints what so ever. Everywhere I wanted to go was a 3-15 minute drive, so the location was perfect for me. Thank you, Patricia!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My second stay at Patricia’s place, and it was just as great as the first. Highly recommend!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The guesthouse is not only beautiful but it’s comfortable!! I’m a truck driver and I DIDN’T want to get back on the road; the space is extremely comfortable and there’s a feeling of safety. If you book this listing you won’t regret it.
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Worked well for attending a conference in town.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time I've stayed with Patricia, and I will be back! Her space is great and she is very responsive and communicative."
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very cooperative
2023-12-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The stay in the suite was fine, and the space had everything I needed. The heater was slightly difficult to keep on at night as the purple light on it was fairly bright, but I'm very light sensitive.
What was frustrating is that I had mentioned upon booking that I didn't have a car, was there for work, and that my co-worker (our VP) would be picking me up and dropping me off each day. I was there to lead leadership planning, company announcements, and our Holiday party. I had mentioned that he would be coming over to work each night so we could plan the next day, but would always leave as there is no way that he would be sleeping there with me. Patricia acknowledged this. However, I noticed a few days ago that an extra $45 charge had hit my work credit card and that something was submitted to AirBnb saying I had another guest, with screenshots of me getting in and out of my VP's car. This was very disappointing, and I wish the host had communicated during my stay to clarify."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I had a wonderful time staying here. The neighborhood is close to downtown Tulsa and you are within a few minutes drive to great restaurants, coffee shops, shopping, museums and grocery stores nearby (driving). Patricia was friendly and it was easy to get in. 10/10"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I must say this was one of the best places I've stayed. The effort to provide a stylish, hospitable and very comfortable stay in a studio space was very intentional and carefully planned by the owner. It was immaculate. I thoroughly appreciated it and would be very happy to come back and recommend as well. The view to the backyard is actually quite serene and lovely. Thank you so much Patricia."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was as stated. It was a perfect location with easy access to the airport and grocery. I would recommend to anyone that is attending the Farmstead Meatsmith courses as I did this past weekend.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Patricia was incredibly responsive and accommodating. She communicated clearly and quickly, and went out of her way for me. The space was beautiful-- by far the best studio I've stayed in. She fit a lot of amenities (full kitchen, washer/dryer) into a small space but somehow kept it from feeling cluttered. There were a lot of special touches, like teas and utensils and spices in the kitchen, an umbrella to use, etc. The outdoor area was beautiful and peaceful. Will definitely stay here again!"

2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Patricia’s place was perfect for my visit to Tulsa. It’s efficiency size, clean, lovely back yard, quiet. My only complaint was the parking. There was a dedicated driveway parking space but because of street parking of other neighbors, it was difficult to access at times. I chose to park on the street a couple of days."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Cozy little place. Essentially it looks like it was a back patio at one point that was walled in and a bathroom and a minisplit ac unit was added. My only complaint is that the blue LED light on the minisplit was crazy bright and made it hard to sleep. Easy fix, I just put some tape over it. Nice quiet place, would definitely recommend."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely loved this studio apt! Tucked back in a lovely neighborhood, in a great area with lots of restaurants and other resources. The apt was small but had everything I needed. The big windows provided lots of light and made the space feel bigger and brighter. Comfortable bed; big, walk-in shower; small but well-equipped kitchen, and a little sitting area that was comfortable for lounging and computing. My favorite spot was the little patio that looked out into the beautiful, private back yard. It was truly peaceful and lovely! I would definitely stay here again - in fact, I was sorry I had to leave so soon!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Patricia was an excellent host, she went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable and satisfied.

Even though I didn't cook there, her kitchen is fully appointed with all you might need to cook for a longer stay. The bed and pillows were comfortable, and the overhead fan and a/c made it very comfortable inside. A plus is that her backyard is lovely and there's a nice private sitting area just outside the studio door. I made immediate friends with both her cat and little dog; very sweet."

Washer and dryer inside your apartment! Plus off-street parking! The location is ideal. Whole Foods is around the corner, The Gathering Place and downtown are minutes away, freeway access nearby.

Perfect location, comfortable bed, and well equipped for my week long stay.
Patricia had two dogs that were out in the yard from time to time, however they were very quiet and very friendly.
The quietness and comfortable bed made my stay very enjoyable and relaxing. I hope to stay in this location again when I'm in Tulsa to visit family and friends.
I highly recommend staying there."

The garden is beautiful to relax in and the unit had everything I could dream of.
Patricia is an amazing host, she helped me settle into Tulsa as an international student, and went out of her way to assist me in settling into my own residence too.
Highly recommended!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My second time at this air bnb. I show horses and the place is secure, lovely and very comfortable and easy access to the fairgrounds. Patricia is on top of everything and a great communicator. Has a great eye for design and comfort."

The area is great for walking around if you need to get any food or items. Had a fantastic weekend just relaxing, wished I had booked a longer stay. Will definitely be interested in staying again."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Patricia was a terrific host. This stay was for my daughter who was doing a nearby ballet summer program. Patricia was very kind, and provided a nice, cute, cozy studio with AC near Tulsa Ballet which is what we were hoping for. Bonuses were that she has two dogs in the yard so that was fun. And there are cute rabbits hopping all around the neighborhood. The apartment itself was well equipped and there's even a washer/dryer inside the studio which was a big help to my daughter. The location was perfect to be close to the ballet and there were grocery stores and cafes/etc. very close by. And Patricia was such a sweetheart, she drove my daughter to the airport on departure day...really appreciated that special kindness!
As an added note, it's hot in Tulsa in the summer, very hot. The apartment had great AC so no problem there. Also, Tulsa is super buggy in the summer...think the tropics kind of buggy. Just be prepared if you are traveling to Tulsa in the summer. Patricia has regular fumigation service and bug spray to mitigate this, so much appreciated.
You couldn't ask for a nicer host or a better location for ballet dancers! Thanks again!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I came in very late and there were no clear house numbers so it was kind of tricky to know if I was in the right place or not. It’s a darling little place and I would stay here again. The owner does have dogs that bark right outside the door very early in the morning.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Perfect for solo traveler! Came in for the several days of excitement around the opening of the Bob Dylan Center. If you are coming to Tulsa for research at the archive (or for any other thing) stay here . It is perfectly supplied. Clean so clean . Happy little puppy set of hot dog and a bull dog to enjoy in back yard . 10 minute drive to downtown along the Arkansas River .

2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location. Clean and very well stocked. Just be aware that is a little hard to heat in the winter months. If you are wanting a place to be in the 80’s in the winter it won’t be.
Great other than that little thing."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place felt updated, clean, and very nicely decorated. It was perfect while I had to be in town for work for 5 days.

The kitchen was the perfect size and there was even bottled water in there. 1 minute drive from Peoria Street with a ton of restaurants and shops."

But the best thing was the hospitality of Patricia who helped us at all times, very friendly, a good person and a very very good host. If she could I would give it 20 stars and not 5. I recommend her stay 100%"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Patricia is wonderful at communicating by being quick to respond. She goes above and beyond to make sure you feel at home. VERY CLEAN & PRIVATE!!!! We will be back!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Patricia was an excellent host. Her space is so thoughtfully laid out and created/decorated, with the guest’s needs and comfort in mind. Easy access to local things, like a grocery store and restaurants, even by walking which is safe day or night. The Tulsa Ballet is only a ten minute walk, which was my destination daily for classes. Parking for my car was in a driveway just a short distance from the private entry door around the back. This space is attached to the backside of Patricia’s home, but completely separate living areas and separate entrances. In all regards, it is it’s own little efficiency apartment. The decor and appointments are high end and very clean and sufficient. The space is very quiet and the back yard is like a serene garden. The bed is comfortable, blackout shades under curtains, European wall mounted AC unit to set your own temp separated from the rest of the house. Beautiful shower, kitchen with stovetop, microwave and refrigerator. I stayed a month and it felt like my own little home! WiFi is very good as well and the stacking washer and dryer in the unit was super nice to have. If I ever come back, this is where I’d want to stay!"

We bought groceries and cooked there most days. The suite had various seasonings, cookware, utensils, Tupperware, foil, wax paper, stove, microwave, toster oven, keurig, etc. There was also coffee, hot cider, water...everything you need. Patricia also provided our own air conditioning and heating unit, a washer and dryer and various movie apps on the TV. Oh yea, there was complimentary wifi as well. The view from the suite was of her BEAUTIFULLY landscaped back yard. The walkway was well lit at night time and she has the cutest bulldog named Pumba (I believe), that will sometimes come and greet you if he's outside when you're out there. The water gets very hot and doesn't run out of hot water when you shower and the water pressure in the shower was amazing! All in all, Patricia exceeded our expectations and we will definitely book here again should we ever need to come back to Tulsa. One last thing, the location is in the middle of a whole lot of things to do! Stay here, you'll love it!"

This small apartment has everything you could need, and is as clean and well taken care of as any place you will find on Airbnb. Patricia and her family treated me like a member of the family during my stay here, and I cannot wait to return."

The backyard space is nice as well! I would definitely stay again."

2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely little treasure cove. It’s like a serene escape from the streets of Oklahoma. The place was immaculately clean and smelled great. Enjoying the scene of the garden added more character to this peaceful place. They had refrigerated water, coffee, and tea. Love the touch with the washer and dryer. I asked for recommendations for places to visit and Patricia gave me a few place to see. I would highly recommend staying there."
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was a great little space. It was clean, quiet and convenient. The shower is huge, the kitchen is stocked with basics like coffee, creamer, spices, bottled water. There’s a washer and dryer, too! Patricia was quick to respond when I had questions, and I just really liked her."
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cool little spot with everything you need to feel at home. Patricia was very responsive and the place was spotless. Perfect location for your stay in Tulsa.
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing!
2020-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Great location with easy access to brookside. Smaller area so I wouldn’t advise more the two suitcases worth of travel stuff.
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I enjoyed my stay at this air bnb very much. I was very comfortable because the space is exceptionally clean, organized and everything worked well. I appreciated thoughtful touches such as a quiet heater, washer and dryer in the unit, comfy overstuffed armchair, good quality towels and linens, etc. I also appreciated the safety features such as floodlights and security camera. I loved the neat, well-kept yard and patio which was perfect for sipping morning coffee. Neighbors were super quiet. Very nice and private. I would definitely stay at this air bnb again. You can tell the host really thought about the guest's comfort and convenience. Most importantly, the place was very clean. A+."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Quaint cabin feel in the middle of Tulsa. Great location!

Kitchen to laundry facilities. The bed was very comfortable. I will be staying again when I come in to see my parents."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely little space! Close to everything! Check in/out was super easy and everything was clean! If you have allergies to pets or fragrances be careful. Pets stay here often and air fresheners were heavily used. Patricia did apologize about the freshener.
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I would most definately recommend this home.
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was better than expected! Small and cute! About 15 minute Uber to everything. Super quiet. Saw 0 humans! We especially loved the Netflix, washer and dryer, and coffee! Quick responses from Patricia. Be aware that there’s a one person limit and if you have another person it’s a $30 charge per night.. I missed this on the description and ended up paying more than expected and probably could’ve stayed downtown for the same price. Felt a little watched via the security cameras, but at least it’s safe.. although the neighborhood is very calm. We ended up not bringing our dogs, but if we had the yard would’ve been perfect and secure. Bed was comfy. Place was cozy. If you need a simple place to stay, this is perfect."
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place- Would stay again!
2019-11-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"The studio is nicely decorated and stocked, and the neighborhood is quiet. I stayed two nights. I am giving two stars because the heater did not work and because of poor response. Nighttime temps outside were in the 40s and inside temps were in the 50s. I arrived late on the first night and slept very poorly because of the cold.
I contacted the host the next morning at 9 a.m. to report the issue, and made several other attempts during the day via text and additional messaging. I did not hear back until 7 p.m. that evening, when the host suggested that I press a different button on the remote control. I was out at the time and could not try this new thing until it was late in the evening and time to sleep. The heater was still inoperative.
I sent one more message of status the next morning before checking out. The host replied quickly, apologized sincerely, and offered a full refund, which I accepted with gratitude. Then two days later she sent a message to say that they would not offer a full refund but rather a refund of one night.
In sum, poor communication, slow response, and a broken promise."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean. Patricia was very helpful when problems occurred. Would 100% stay there again.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Patricia’s place was fantastic. A great value and had everything I needed for my stay! I would highly recommend and would stay here again.

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Patricia and her family were so welcoming. The studio is perfect for one or two people. The bed is comfortable, almost instant hot water in the shower and kitchen, a quiet and safe neighborhood, easy access to an enclosed backyard, parking in the driveway and close to everything you want to see in Tulsa. Located in The Brookside community makes it easy access to all the great restaurants, downtown, the Expo, The Gathering Place, etc. I hope to return soon for another stay."

2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this little spot! It was comfortable and spotless. The backyard was great and my two small dogs enjoyed it.

We were extremely comfortable and appreciated the lovely, large windows that brought in so much light. We found the patio a highlight and enjoyed many meals there enjoying the sunshine. The neighborhood is great with Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, and Reasors just around the corner. There are many great restaurants nearby. We especially liked Bin 35 Bistro."
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Second stay in two months. I recommend this studio and plan to continue to stay when I am in Tulsa.

2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was amazing ! Great location, great host, great space. Highly recommend if you're looking for a private space just a little ways from downtown Tulsa but close to anything and everything you need. The host left nothing untouched and was prompt with anything we needed."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Clean, fun place for the entire family."
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place! Would recommend!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow, this place was better than the pictures! It's modern, sleek with a cool layout that allows each room it's own space and bathroom. There was a game room and pool which was a great way to pass the time, nice amenities. My favorite part was being so close to Cherry Street, walkable to so many restaurants. Started with an amazing coffee at Summer Moon, worked out at Orangetheory, went shopping and ate dinner at Roka (it was hard to choose bc there are so many amazing restaurant options). This place is a hidden gem and a must book for any group. The host was really quick to respond and easy to communicate with!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is my favorite airbnb to date. Location and house were perfect. Comfortable and relaxing with everything needed to feel at home.
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Stunning home, beautifully appointed in a great location. Professional, responsive and caring team who prioritized our best interests. Actions spoke louder than words, with demonstrated willingness to go the extra mile."
,,,"I specifically asked about this location knowing I was going to be staying alone. I was told inaccurate information about who I would be sharing the house with as a duplex. I wanted to make sure I felt safe and comfortable, instead was left feeling anxious and that I couldn’t relax. I travel as a vendor and wanted to be able to come back after a long day to feel comfortable and be able to unwind, that did not happen here. Along with feeling unsafe, the fridge handles are broken off, the light by the back door didn’t work even when we changed the light bulb, the mattress was a different mattress from what was pictured and extremely uncomfortable and close to the floor. Being a female with her own business, you would think this host could be more understanding and up front with fellow lone women travelers."
