2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jos place was the perfect get away, the cabin is just a few steps from the lake & so clean & updated. She is the sweetest host. We will definitely be back."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"It is listed as a cabin, but it is more of a guesthouse. It's across a little deck from the owner's home. She has some dogs that sometimes are outside. They are small, and we didn't hear them barking. This guesthouse is beautifully designed and decorated. I loved all the little touches in the entire home that evoked water, lakes, and oceans. Even the silverware! I also appreciated how many towels there were! So many places only have two for two people, but I like to use two just for myself. They were also high quality towels. They really thought about all the little touches to make this home inviting and relaxing. The window in the bedroom looks right over the water and was lovely in the morning. Jo was also so kind and accommodating when we booked at the last minute. We were driving home from a vacation and didn't want to stay at a hotel; this was so much better!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jeri was responsive and assisted every step from booking to check-out time. I was there for a softball tournament and was going to cut it close for checkout due to game times. Jeri was flexible and understanding about it. From personal messages left at the home for us to some popcorn left out as a treat, I rate our experience there a 10/10. I will look at this place when traveling to this area again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Older townhome, but very clean and quiet. Everything was as advertised. Would definitely stay here again."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Kyles townhouse was an amazing little place for us while we are displaced out of our house. Kyle was extremely and quickly responsive. We felt right at home!! I would encourage anyone needing a cute place to stay, to book this townhouse!!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was clean and looked like the pictures. Kyle communicated effectively. It was great for what we needed, although the squeekiness of doors/floors wasn't great for the baby. Traveling with an infant is just hard though. Neighborhood seemed a little sketchy but we didn't have any problems and everyone was very nice."

2023-12-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Better than a hotel but certainly some things that could be improved. During our stay, we were unable to find extra toilet paper and the kitchen sink was broken. This is a suitable place to stay if you will mainly be using the space for sleeping. Larger groups should also be warned that there is only one small shower in the townhouse."

Place was clean! & it is in an area with plenty to eat, not far from the mall, walmart & other stores that you may need to pick up last minute things. We will definitely be back! Thank you Kyle!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Kyle was easy to communicate with and ready to answer any questions. The townhouse was clean and comfortable for our family. He provided a little extra treats for breakfast which was not expected and very much appreciated with five kiddos! The furniture and beds were comfortable and we felt safe.

2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Kyle was great to work with and we enjoyed our stay. Minor drawbacks were the temperature difference between upstairs and downstairs and some squeaky bedroom doors. However, the beds were great with super clean and snuggly linens. I don’t always sleep well when away from home, but I slept just like I was in my own bed! Kitchen was well equipped, and we really appreciated the little stash of breakfast foods. Overall a cozy little townhouse."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a perfect stay. Wanda was very proactive and reached out after my booking to inform me of a few key things. She also gave me the option to switch rooms based on my bed preference. It was a great experience all around.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What is there not to say about Wanda and Tyrone?! They were absolutely amazing! It was super easy to get into the air bnb and we had our own code for our bedroom. We had access to everything as they described! They made sure to have breakfast items out every day as well! They are definitely people you want to stay with whenever you need an air bnb in this area! We absolutely loved the attention to detail, from the WiFi password being framed sitting on a desk in our bedroom to the basket of miscellaneous items on the back of the toilet like makeup removers, face masks etc. it’s really those little things that make such a huge impression especially when traveling or needing somewhere to stay. I would absolutely stay here again in a heartbeat! Even if it’s just to get out of my own house 😜"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wanda and Tyrone were very responsive to our messages. We were not seeing a room for the time frame we needed and they were able to open a room for us to stay in. We had our two children with us and they made sure to tell us the staircase is not child proof. We stayed with Wanda and Tyrone last year and we had a great experience then as well. Wanda and Tyrone greater us as we arrived and made sure we had everything we needed as we got settled in. Wanda put a lamp in the bathroom for us as the light in the bathroom went out but let us know and provided a solution which was wonderful! Anytime we stay in Shawnee, we try to stay with Wanda and Tyrone as they are wonderful hosts and we recommend them to anyone who is looking to stay in the area."

Thank you Wanda!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wanda and Tyrone were amazing hosts—kind, friendly and very flexible.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"There are some AirBnb places that are adequate, get the job done for you, and you don't think twice about it. Then you have places that you'll forever remember as one of the best experiences you've ever had. I have been to a few that were absolutely memorable and I thought there's nothing that could top these places.
Just when I thought I knew what the best AirBnb experience was, then there was Wanda & Tyrone with this listing. This was by far the best experience I've ever had, which also includes listings where I've rented out an entire home!
Not only were Wanda & Tyrone accommodating in every way, but chatting with them was an absolute pleasure! Very friendly and definitely proactive in communication. Outside of my bedroom door needing a good push to open, I believe I found my go-to spot next time I visit Shawnee, OK.
Anything you could possibly think of, from providing heaters to toiletries and cosmetics, this listing is an absolute bargain!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was my first airbnb stay ever and I was not disappointed. Wanda and Tyrone were very gracious, welcoming, and went above and beyond to make sure our stay was comfortable. They even upgraded our room at no extra cost which was very generous. We had a great time hanging out with Tyrone and hearing his stories. Also his chex mix was excellent. The room was clean and orderly as was the rest of the house. Open use of kitchen was extremely useful and they had everything you could ever need as far as cooking utensils. They also have a gorgeous dining room that definitely stood out to me. This is the best place to stay in Shawnee by far. If we had any questions or any concern they were always very responsive. If you need somewhere to stay in town this is definitely the place. Wanda and Tyrone are good Christian individuals who go above and beyond to make sure your stay is pleasant and comforting. I can’t brag enough on them and their home and we will definitely recommend them to others."

I was a little nervous about my young teen and I being able to relax while staying in someone else's home. But, I can't say enough nice things about Wanda and Tyrone. They absolutely went out of their way to make us feel at home and constantly encouraged full use of the house. They were never in the way but always available to meet our needs. The house is super clean and quiet. Their hospitality is absolutely exceptional!! Their home is warm, comfortable and cozy and we were very at ease there! Mrs. Wanda's homemade scones and Caramel Apple Bread were a big bonus too! I highly recommend staying with this super sweet family! We will definitely be back."

Then one of the most restful sleeps I had in a couple of days. We definitely will come back. Thank you for making my 1st stay at a US Airbnb so comfortable."

2017-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wanda & Tyrone will make you feel at home. From the first communication to being shown to the door when you leave, Wanda and Tyrone treat you like you are part of the family. Quick response times by text, clean, casual, and convenient to local amenities. Light breakfast available the morning we left, including homemade banana bread. We will stay again next time we are in Shawnee."
2017-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I can't imagine finding anything better than Wanda and Tyrone's place near Oklahoma City. Everything was perfect! Close to 40, so quiet, so clean, so nice!
A great ending to my long trip with my son! Thanks!!"

2017-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our first experience set the bar very high. From the moment we walked in the door, we felt welcomed and at ease. My daughter was a little anxious, but by the morning, she didn't want to leave. Wanda and Tyrone are such gracious hosts and made us feel totally comfortable. Their home is beautiful and spotless. They will see us again!"

2017-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wanda and Tyrone were the nicest, most gracious hosts and their house was amazing. Of all AirBnB's we've stayed in, they may be the most accommodating and polite hosts we've met. Felt like we were staying with old friends. The room itself was perfect and the bathroom was clean - everything you could ask for. They offered us breakfast and even had extra toothpaste when we mentioned we ran out the night before. The house was near I-40, so a great place to stop for the night, but Shawnee seemed like a great community to explore as well. Thanks again Wanda and Tyrone!!"
2017-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,super nice hosts and a very comfortable place! would recommend to anyone! thanks again for letting us stay!

Thanks again W & T!
Looking forward to our next stay."

2017-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was quite comfortable and nice! The hospitality was more than expected! I had some trouble and was not able to stay one night. The host offered to refund that night! I would highly recommend staying with Wanda and Tyrone! And if the need arises I will stay there again.
2017-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is one of those places that you'll question what you did right to deserve such an experience. Wanda and Tyrone's house is a marvel, gorgeous hardwood floors, and winding staircase. It is so classic and spotless as well. Being an airbnb host myself at one time, I always love to see how and what other hosts do for their guests. The attention to detail here is phenomenal. Lovely, high end shampoos, conditioners, all natural body wash, plenty of fluffy, clean towels and wash cloths laid out, coffee, teas, orange juice, beautiful cups and bowls set out with breakfast goodies, fresh fruit, (I even got some to take for the road). Wanda and Tyrone have hosted exchange students and others for many, many, years, and they truly know how to do it right. I'm hoping that it works out for me to stay again, this time with my husband, on our way back through in June. This house, and it's people :) are gems!"
2017-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"A friend and I stayed with Wanda & Tyrone the first night of a 1,500 mile trip. This was our first Airbnb so we didn't really know what to expect. Before booking the private room I sent a message to the host regarding check in time. This was because I knew we would be coming in very early in the morning. Wanda said anytime before 2am worked for them. This was perfect for us as we checked in at 1:45am! Wanda & Tyrone gave us a tour of the kitchen, our room, and our bathroom. The bedroom had a full size bed and a twin. There were fresh towels and extra blankets for us along with a hair dryer, lotion, and other body products. In the morning we were left breakfast items (coffee, bagels, fresh fruit, oatmeal, and yogurt). We could not have had a better first Airbnb experience! Thank you again Wanda & Tyrone for a wonderful stay in your beautiful home!"
2017-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wanda and Tyrone were very hospitable. Thanks for a great stay!

2016-12-01,5,Stayed one night,What a wonderful and quaint home. I truly enjoyed my stay with Wanda and Tyrone.

2016-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful, welcoming home! Wanda and Tyrone are great hosts! Enjoyedcsharingva movie Tuesday night. As an AirBnB host, I'm inspired to do bigger and better things!"
2016-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Gosh, I didn't want to leave. This is a magnetic family.
What delightful people and what a delightful home in tranquil Shawnee. I could live here. Wanda mentioned the house was older but it doesn't look old, it doesn't feel old; it feels perfectly nice. They have clearly done many upgrades.
In my room I went barefoot, which is the Hawaiian way, and there was not a speck of dust or dirt anywhere. She told me she wipes down the floor after every guest. Personally, I do not feel comfortable staying anywhere that is not clean, and Dr. Wanda gets the gold star. Everything needed was provided. They let me open the windows too, because I enjoy fresh air.
Wanda and Tyrone are expert hosts. They have had a variety of visitors in their welcoming home for years from all over the world. They have kind of seen it all, and like the daughter they mentioned, they have a world view helping them to accommodate. They truly know how to make you feel comfortable. I loved everything about their place and I especially enjoyed our conversations. Tyrone and Wanda are educated erudite people who can pursue a train of thought into it's depths with discrimination and perception. I appreciated and enjoyed their observations.
I think we are all here in this world to learn, to grow, and to help others. They almost treat their Airbnb like a ministry in exemplifying this ideal. They said, live your life without fear and well, that is advice I can accept."
2016-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We absolutely loved staying with Wanda and Tyrone! I was traveling across country with my boyfriend. I had a few special requests that they were willing to accommodate which was such a relief! They were beyond welcoming and made us feel so comfortable in their beautiful home. I came to Shawnee to see where my parents met and check out my Dad's alma mater. Turns out my dad went to school with Tyrone! Tyrone pulled out yearbooks for me to see and found my dad in his yearbooks. What a trip! It made my visit so special. I would definitely stay with them again if I'm ever passing through that way!
2016-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was wonderful! We truly felt at home and we were so very close to OBU. Tyrone was such an amazing host; he was welcoming, accommodating, and attentive to our needs. He was always available via text or in person. This home undoubtedly receives our highest recommendation. Pictures online were accurate; the home is beautiful and warm.?If ever we are on Shawnee again, I hope we are blessed enough to return!"
2016-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely experience! Wanda and Tyrone were extremely kind, courteous and attentive! I only stayed the night as I was driving cross country but they made my stay so comfortable and safe. Thank you both so much!"

Felt very welcome"
2016-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wanda and Tyrone were extremely friendly and accommodating. The bedroom, bathroom and common area were exactly as presented. The neighborhood was pleasant and safe. When we arrived, they pointed us to a great local barbecue restaurant and in the morning we enjoyed a delicious selection of help-your-self breakfast items with our coffee. We enjoyed chatting with the hosts and they so much enjoy having other people come stay in their home. It's a very inviting environment and I had the best night's sleep of my whole week-long trip! Thank you! : )"

2016-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Wanda and Tyrone went above and beyond by waiting up for us to arrive at 1:45am! They were excellent hosts and their home is lovely! Very clean and nice! I just wished that we could have stayed a little longer to visit! Thank you so much for having us!
2016-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were at Oklahoma Baptist University for four days for a debate tournament. Wanda and Tyrone were wonderful and gracious hosts. Everything was clean and comfortable. This was our first Airbnb experience and it was great.
2016-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wanda & Tyrone were wonderful hosts!

Respectful of space, but also engaging in conversation. My girlfriend went to bed early, but they and I ended up talking until 3 in the morning.

Breakfast was good and they have a nice piano too. 5 stars!"
2016-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay in this beautiful home, warmly welcomed and hosted by Wanda and Tyrone. A brief stay, but memorable."
2016-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wanda and Tyrone are excellent hosts. The home is very lovely and clean. Shawnee is my home town and I was sadly home for a family funeral. The home is in a older part of town which I have always admired. The homes are large and with the charm of yesteryear. They have thought of every detail. The room is large and private with hardwood floors and a beautifully remodeled hall bath. I would highly recommend this listing if you need to stay in Shawnee. You won't be disappointed.
2016-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Tyrone and Wanda are absolutely wonderful hosts. I almost hate using that word...more like friends. Great connection with them and their home is beautiful. The house is clean, warm, and welcoming. I was very comfortable in every way. Wanda was sure to have several things available for me to eat and snack on. I was warmly greeted by both of them when I arrived, which was actually much later than originally anticipated. I highly recommend this place and will surely return."
2016-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tyrone and Wanda were warm and friendly, making us feel like welcome guests and giving us the run of their lovely home. The queen bed was extremely comfortable, and my husband and I slept like babies after a long day on the road."
2016-01-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a great place to stay! Lovely hospitality and a clean and comfortable room. I felt comfortable choosing to enjoy some conversation or going to my room to do work or read. I would highly recommend staying here.
2016-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"I spent a night here on a road trip west, and it was a great experience. Wanda was understanding of my changing plans and responded quickly via the contact tool. When I arrived, the room was clean, comfortable, and as described. Having my own bathroom was a definite plus. Wanda was very welcoming and inviting. I would highly recommend staying with her if you are in town."
2015-12-01,5,Stayed one night,wanda was really accommodating with our pretty late arrival (on our long road trip) at close to 11pm. we didn't get to stay long but we really enjoyed meeting wanda & tyrone... super friendly & helpful!! our bedroom & private bath were extremely clean & comfy!! really would have liked to stay longer & would totally recommend anyone staying with this wonderful family if in the area!! thanks for your generous hospitality! :0)
2015-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wanda is a wonderful host, she gave me a clear instruction to find the house, and a very warm welcome, and she spent a lot of time to help me planning my road trip. The room is very clean and comfortable, she put an extra heater in the room for me, and I have my own bathroom, will recommend this place to all my friends!"
2015-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Paula's entire Family was very welcoming and the room was just what the listing said. I would highly recommend staying with them!
2015-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The neighborhood was peaceful and Wanda offered the right level of engagement. She was there when I arrived and greeted me in a friendly way when I came and went. Then she left me to go about my business. A most pleasant stay. Highly recommended.
2015-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wanda is a friendly and welcoming host. Her home is cozy, with loving and artistic touches. The bedroom and bathroom are clean and spacious, and I knew that if I needed anything she would be happy to help. Thanks Wanda!"
2015-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,Wanda is an amazing hostess. She's thought of nearly everything a guest could need. The cozy room and private bath as well as the common area were very clean and comfortable. Wanda and her family made me feel welcome in their home and I would highly recommend this listing to anyone staying in Shawnee. I will definitely go back.
2015-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We had a great time staying at the house of Wanda and Tyrone. They were wonderful hosts and made us feel at home right away. The house is beautiful and there is enough parking space for a car. The room we stayed in was great, it was spacious and very clean, and the bed was really comfortable.
One of the best things was that we were able to cook our own dinner in an amazing kitchen and that Wanda provided breakfast!
Thanks again for everything!"
2015-08-01,5,Stayed one night,I don't know what else could be said about this exceptional host family and beautiful home they so willingly share with others! I look forward to many more visits!
2015-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't believe I was able to find Wanda and Tyrone in Shawnee, Oklahoma. They have to turn down requests -- and for good reason! They're amazing! They were so helpful and open -- I was there for a research trip on Seminole Indians and they were calling up their friends to see how they could help. The room is VERY clean and a true Midwestern home. They are very accomodating -- I felt like I was in a professional B&B. I hope another opportunity comes again where I can be in OK because they're truly one of a kind AirBNB hosts."
2015-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wanda and her family were great, we felt very welcomed. The house is super clean and tidy, she had fresh towels and breakfast! The house is huge and it has parking. Our stay was awesome!"

2015-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent Stay
Highly recommended"
2015-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very rarely do I take the time to write a review but this time deserves an exception to that policy. Tyrone and Wanda are beautiful hosts. I can't say enough about how welcome they made me feel. It was like spending the weekend with relatives. It would be very easy to return for no other reason than to visit with them both... The bedrooms were immaculate and detail oriented of course... the whole house was the same way! The beds were comfortable and I got a good nights sleep both nights despite a bad back and travel anxiety! I will definitely be staying here each time I am in the area...
2015-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed my stay very much. Wanda is a gracious hostess who thoroughly enjoys sharing her home. While very attentive, she also has a knack for giving the guest personal space when needed. The accommodations are spacious, comfortable, and nicely decorated. The house is well-located for dining, entertainment, and travel. I highly recommend this listing."
2014-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Wanda and her family were very sweet and welcoming. I truly enjoyed my stay and will be back to visit. The room was cute and cozy- great for a few nights or more. Thank you Wanda.
2014-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Staying at Wanda's was peaceful and the cozy room is perfect. Her home is immaculate and Wanda is a gem. She could not do enough to make my stay comfortable. This is my 2nd time with Wanda and I would return there in a heartbeat. It was good to find a place away from the city that was so fine. Thanks Wanda.
2014-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Very peaceful home. Wanda and her family were most welcoming and easy to be with.. The accommodations were very comfortable. I would definitely stay with Wanda again as we had little time to visit and she is a very inspiring woman as is her mother.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,A beautiful home away from home for us. We have stayed 4 times already with plans for many more stays (our grandkids live nearby). No complaints. Hosts are great.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was even better in person. Beds were absolutely comfortable. It was very peaceful and if you like nature you will enjoy this place being out in the country. Had a bonfire our last night and we very much enjoyed our stay.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Good location, host is very responsive. Clean house. No issues."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place was wonderful to stay at! It was quiet and peaceful scenery. The home was comfortable and so clean. The outside space is excellent as well! The home is out in the country with plenty of space which is exactly what we were looking for but was close enough for us to get to Shawnee in a timely manner. We certainly would recommend this place to anyone!
2024-04-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"Unfortunately, not what we expected!
It made me nervous to have the entrance gate open 24/7!
There’s no garage to park your car in, so your car is pretty much exposed to getting stolen at night.
The place is located on a busy road (it was really busy when we stayed) and is not too safe to let your dogs run around.We got there around 10:30 p.m., and none of the house lights were on, so unless you carry a flashlight, you'll not be able to see your surroundings.
Be aware that you won’t have any privacy.
The place was clean though.
Owner replied to my texts right away, kuddos for that.
It has all the amenities.
We cleaned the house before we left and followed the owners’ rules.
We cleaned up after our dogs.
I’ve been using AirBnB for over 3 years, and this is the first time we had to leave early, which is sad, but our safety comes first.
I guess this place is not for everybody."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed about a week,The property in a rural setting is very quiet and peaceful. A beautiful place for early morning birds and evening sunsets.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We absolutely loved the stay at this little home. It was comfortable and had so much character with all the added details to make for the comfy stay. Take advantage of the beautiful sunsets and sunrises on the back patio and front porch!! It’s close to both Shawnee and Seminole. We will definitely be back!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We would love to come back and stay longer so we could really enjoy the beautiful view and peaceful atmosphere! We absolutely loved this place, thank you Kent for a wonderful experience"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"There needs to be a 6-star and above rating for places like this. The clean, cozy, comfortable home, beautiful surroundings, and communication/support from the hosts put Kent's place in a tier above a 5-star rating. Simply the best."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"this place remains on our list for our next stay in Oklahoma.
thank you and see you soon"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is absolutely beautiful. We loved the privacy we had while staying here, but also liked that it was close enough to stores. We would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting to visit the area."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gaston Ranch was a great stay for us. It was far enough away from town but not too far of a drive to get to all of the amenities. The house was immaculate and had a nice design to it. I love that there was a guest book on the counter that we could look at and write our own little tidbit in. Tv had lots of sign in options (don’t forget to sign out!) and we were able to watch a little bit of one of our favorite shows one night. It was just the parent getaway we needed for a couple of nights! Thanks again for hosting us!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed every minute we were there. I loved watching the sun set over the back pasture. It was such a peaceful stay. The farm house was clean and a perfect home away from home. All of the furniture was very comfy and the kitchen was fully stocked with lots of dishes, spices and utensils. I loved the floor plan. We felt very much at home"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve stayed at Gaston Ranch many times over the past year. It’s peaceful, quiet, and Kent and Vicky are great to work with. Hope to come back again soon!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was the nicest place I have ever stayed at. The Kitchen, Bathroom, everything was so new and updated. Very nice and worth the price. Talk about space. There is so much space outside. My dog had so much room to run around it was amazing. Really if I wanted to pick one thing it would have to be located on such a busy road but when inside you do not hear it and when outside the road it 70 yards away. Really not that big of a deal. Also First night I even Doordashed Taco Bell so it is not all that far out. Perfect location to drive into the big city, or check out Rt 66. I recomend this place to anyone."

Even though we were there mainly to sleep, everything one could possibly need was supplied-cooking utensils, some food, toiletries, etc. We would love to stay there again to actually spend more time. Although possibly not available at all in that area, my only suggestion would be to provide for recycling.
It seems as though Kent and Vicky go a step beyond to make their guests comfortable-thank you. LOVED IT!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very nice, inside and out. Will be staying again in November and hopefully any other time we need accommodations in the area"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The location of Kent and Vicky’s home is beautiful. The house is adorable, clean, and comfortable. It is the perfect size for 1-4 guests. This is a great choice for a quiet, restful getaway as all amenities are several miles away. We will stay here again!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Love this quiet, peaceful little spot!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,We were visiting family in surrounding areas and needed a place to stay near them. This was a wonderfully secluded and peaceful place 😊 very clean and so relaxing. Loved it!! The backyard was fun for the kids and the fireplace was beautiful!

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great relaxing thanksgiving break! very peaceful, beautiful, and fun.

Definitely recommend this cute house for a peaceful vacation."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay for a private, quiet, and relaxing weekend. Have stayed here twice. Each time was sublime. Peaceful, tranquil, gorgeous views. Kent and Vicky are responsive and kind hosts. Looking forward to staying again soon"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely perfect stay here! The house is on a large parcel of land and set back from the road. The landscape provides beauty and privacy. The chairs on the front porch are so comfortable and it was so serene sitting on the porch feeling the cool breeze.
The house is perfectly equipped, any little thing I could think of was easy to find (coffee, fresh trash bags, detergent, etc). The furniture is super comfy, the kitchen is lovely and modern, and the water pressure/hot water was great too. Wi-Fi was plenty fast. Bedrooms are spacious and spaced apart enough you don’t hear each other snoring.
Dinner - plenty of great restaurants about 10 minutes away. We cooked out one night on the provided Blackstone (you need to request it in advance). We had a great time playing cornhole (and plenty of other games in the bedroom closet too!).
Kent was a great communicator and so nice.
We stayed here with our dogs while in town for a competition and would highly recommend Kent’s place!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a very clean and well kept house and surrounding land, this is the place for you. It is a country setting, very peaceful. The owners are very kind and respond to you if you need something. I forgot to request the Blackstone grill, Kent responded and took action. The grill was ready the next day. I emailed later in the evening the day before.
You will be pleased if you stay here like me and my husband did. We stayed September 12 to September 15th. We were very happy we picked this place to stay and I know you will too!!!
Enjoy your next adventure ☺️"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location with high speed internet to boot!! Love the farm life with the sounds of the animals and the quiet times. PET FRIENDLY! Perfect size home. Only 5 miles off of I40. The Hot tub was hot and relaxing. Great place to stay. Don't forget to stop by David's Cafe for the fried pies, stay away from the chocolate, but the fruit and cream pies are definitely worth the 2 mile trip into town.
(Do the roar daddy)"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was even better than description & photos. Was the perfect home away from home. Quiet & peaceful country living. The house is immaculate and kitchen cabinets have most everything you might need. Really appreciated the coffee that was provided. A short drive to Shawnee and Seminole. Would most definitely stay again.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This ranch house is so comfy and quiet for family time and relaxation. The owners provide extras that make a difference such as welcome goodie basket, meds for everyday headaches or stomach aches, games for indoors and outdoors & even a high quality water softener system. We didn’t use most of these, however it was good to know that they were there for our use when needed. The host answered our texted promptly and was very helpful and accommodating! If we are ever in the area, we plan to stay here again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Super happy with our stay! Stayed at this wonderful home for a vacation, the home was super clean with so many great amenities, our kids were super comfortable and we really enjoyed our time here.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Perfect place when you don’t want around the hustle and bustle of life but close enough if you want to go and do! The place is great for your four legged family members and we were so thankful to have a place for them to be part of our short mom and son get away! You will miss a great place and great host if you don’t book this jewel!!

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very quiet and peaceful location. Only concern was the camera on the back porch with the hot tub and looked like one inside the house. It felt uncomfortable feeling like we were being watched. Other than that everything was comfortable and clean.

House was clean and had literally every single thing you could need plus more! The hot tub was super nice. Kent was an amazing host and opened up the workshop so we could protect our cars in bad weather. We really appreciated this pet friendly home. I am a telecommute worker and was able to work on huge Teams calls, camera on and file share with no problem at all. Highly recommend this property!"

We booked last minute and everything was still ready for us. We had an amazing weekend and felt comfortable inside the cabin. It’s private but not secluded. Close to the highway and easy to find. Communication with the host was quick and direct. We hope to visit the cabin again. Great memories were made!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cozy, clean, well-kept cabin with great little extras like the welcome basket. We loved the unique setting.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Just like the pictures! This was a nice modern but rustic cabin. My family and I were here for a few days. Nothing about the place we didn’t like. The fire pit was a nice place for s’more. Close enough to town to get more s’mores supplies. Pablo communicated very well for check in and check out. Bunch of other touches but you need to stay her to find out!

2024-06-01,5,Group trip,This home and the hosts were outstanding! The home was just as described...even better! Lots of patio and inside space. I can tell a lot of thought and effort went into this home. Our family of six is very happy. :)
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,This Airbnb location was spot on from the description that was mentioned. Definitely felt like home! We will definitely be coming back! Thank you Jeremy for sharing your home with us.
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Had a great time at Monkeytail! Had a couple of last minute guests and Jeremy was awesome! Responded fast no matter what time of day and has a beautiful home. My only complaint is that me and my friends couldn’t stay a couple extra nights because of his wedding haha!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Stayed for a long weekend. Good little place for our family to stay for a wedding.
They owners were quick to respond when messaged. They even brought a baby gate when they realized we had smaller kids there! Appreciated that a ton!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Cleanest place we have stayed! Jeremy gave very clear and helpful instructions on checking in and checking out and we even happened to be in town when there was a tornado warning and he was quick to let us know and look out for us. Everything looked just like the pics! Def somewhere we will stay again!
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,Great stay at the Monkey Tail. Check in was easy and quick. We were able to enjoy the amenities of a home with our kiddos instead of a tiny hotel room. It was perfect to visit our oldest and watch him on the ball field only 15 minutes away! Would definitely stay again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Erica and Jeremy were amazing hosts. The place is even better than the pictures it is large enough that with 8 people there we all had more than enough space. The area was beautiful and the neighborhood was peaceful. It was my parents first time staying at an air Bnb and they were blown away. I've stayed at several before and this was by far my absolute favorite. Shawnee was close enough to all the areas we were visiting and they left a lovely recommendation of things to do in town. With extended family in okc and Seminole we will definitely be staying here anytime we are on town. The place itself was even better than the pictures, and I adored the hosts personality and sense of humor in their guest book. This place was more than 5/5 it was a 10/5"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our second stay at this awesome home! If we are in need of a spot this is always our top choice! The amazing hosts knew we had a little one & selected extra children’s books for the bookshelf, everything was easy to use & clean, & the home comes with everything you need & then some. We were able to make home cooked meals for our kids while traveling. The kids absolutely loved how fast the Internet was & we were thankful the basement bedroom was so big so they could hang out together down there. This is hands down one of the best airbnbs we’ve stayed in!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to spend a weekend with family
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a great spot to stay. Awesome location, plenty of room for everyone to spread out, clean,& fully stocked. Such a great deal & accommodating hosts we extended our stay twice adding several days.
Can’t not say enough about thought that they have put into this home. Our daughter picked a different book nightly for her bedtime story & the boys took over the lower level with bunkbeds to play video games! Highly recommended. We’ll be staying again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Erica and Jeremy were the nicest hosts ever! The Monkeytail was clean, huge,and beautifully renovated! I wish we could stay there longer! Erica and Jeremy were so kind and prompt with any questions we had!! We cannot fully express our gratitude!! If ever you need an air bnb, do yourself a favor and choose this one!!!"

2024-02-01,5,Group trip,The place was wonderful.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our 2nd stay at this home. We travel a lot and stay in a lot of Airbnbs. This one is our favorite in Shawnee. Will be choosing this one anytime we’re going to be there. It’s much larger than we need but it’s in a perfect location for us, has a comfortable home feeling, and the host’s are wonderful! Very quick to respond and very proactive. Highly recommend this place!"
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,We were in town for a corn hole tournament. We had a large group. This house was perfect for our group with six beds and two bathrooms and two living areas. The hosts did a great job of remodeling the house and leaving lots of information about things to do in the area.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great Shawnee stay
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a very nice place! They did a wonderful job remodeling and fixing this place up. It is very clean and has a lot of room. Very comfortable place to stay and relax. Hosts are very proactive and quick to respond. Highly recommend the Monkeytail
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very responsive host! The house was very clean, cozy, and inviting! We’ll definitely stay here again if traveling to Shawnee in the future!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Took my 9 and 6 year olds for some fishing in the stocked pond. We caught around 40 fish from bass, catfish, and sunfish. Really got the kids interested in doing more fishing. Win!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Just perfect 😊
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. Loved it. Will definitely come back
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We travel from Houston to Harrah several times a year. Now that we’ve found this place we will never stay anywhere else. Perfect spot. Peaceful. Caught a few catfish. Firm beds (which we love). Easy house instructions. Coffee & cold cokes provided too. 5 stars 🌟

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful property! We enjoyed every second of it. Thank you for your hospitality
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Couldn't have asked for better hosts and a better place to stay.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super clean, comfortable and spacious. Great setting even in rain and close enough to downtown OKC. Hosts even offered early check-in if needed. Couldn't recommend more. Thank you!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We stayed here as we were passing through on our drive from SoCal to Maryland. We felt right at home and loved the peace and tranquility of the space. We loved being able to plug in our Rivian R1S overnight in the provided Level 2 charger so we could wake up with a full battery. Our 10 month old loved crawling around and our two yellow labs loved exploring the property! We all slept very comfortably! The washer/dryer is silent and brand new - a godsend on a cross country drive with a little one. We had a phenomenal stay! Thank you!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a really stay at Austin's. Our host was responsive to our needs and went out of their way to accommodate us. Beautiful place to stay. We loved being able to see the cows from the front porch. We had a really nice visit and would stay there again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was by far our best AirBnB experience we’ve ever had. I wish I could say all of the things I want, but I’ll just say that the hosts went above and beyond to ensure we had a wonderful stay. Their place was PERFECT! It was VERY clean and had everything we needed and I hope we get the chance to stay here again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place. Definitely keeping it in mind for the future!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We travel regularly through Oklahoma and often need an overnight stop near OKC. We needed a place that would allow us to bring our pets and were particularly hoping to find somewhere that we could also charge our EV truck overnight. Austin's barndominium popped up in the Airbnb search and was perfect! The unit itself was very spacious with a huge living room, well-outfitted kitchen, and a beautiful bedroom. The rural location meant that we were free from the noises of traffic and the city. The hosts were available and helpful, but not too close! Initially, the EV charger didn't work with our vehicle, but Austin rode over and quickly got it working; we left the next morning with a full charge.
It was easy to find; the instructions for how to get in were clear and easy to follow. There were a lot of amenities including a barbeque grill and outdoor seating area overlooking a lovely pond. Wish we could have stayed longer!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Very spacious! Could see a small family gathering here.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Austin was very helpful in all respects. For us, the location was perfect since we specifically wanted something away from town. I would stay there again. In fact, I DID stsy there twice; once on our way to Texas and again on our return trip to Michigan."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Austin's place was perfect for our one night stay. Everything was just as described.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place in a quiet area.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great. This was our second stay on our return trip from Texas to Michigan.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Had a great, peaceful stay. The barn, though small, was clean and had everything we needed. The master bathroom has a little bit of construction but looks almost finished. We enjoyed fishing in the pond and the provided kayak."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Always enjoy the stay here. Excellent location and house is nice. My first choice for when I'm in the area.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect place for us and our pups. The host was great and very responsive! We will be coming back.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We only stayed one night but wished we had a few days at Austin's place. It was clean, comfortable and comforting. We especially liked the high-quality linens and towels. The mattess was comfortable. This is a gem."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We travel often as a military family and we have a toddler with autism so hotels are always dreaded and difficult to try to not disturb other folks. I don’t know why we never thought of renting airbnbs but we finally did it and this place was absolutely PERFECT. It was a gorgeous modern barn house with comfy couches, beds and massive TVS with WiFi. The sinks were beautiful and the shower was gorgeous. Check in was so easy, getting there was hassle free and so simple, and the area was AMAZING. The massive pond was so beautiful to look at even at night time, and it was peaceful and secluded. The hosts were incredibly kind and helpful and flexible, we felt right at home here. My stay was beyond perfect, my kids loved it and finally, for the first time in years we were actually able to rest and relax while traveling and didn’t dread the hotel stay instead were SO EXCITED to get there. I would 100% recommend but also not too much so I can book them again😂 all jokes aside this house is perf"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Austin's place was amazing! Austin is an amazing host. He was quick to respond and very accommodating. The place was clean, inviting, and we felt right at home. It has everything you need for a comfortable stay. The property outside is peaceful and beautiful. The front porch is wonderful to sit and have coffee in the morning. I wish we could have stayed longer."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home, inside and out. Even with on-going construction in the main bathroom (which I would say is 90% complete), we were able to enjoy the comfort of this spacious natural beauty. Comfortable clean beds for a good night’s rest had us ready for our morning coffee stroll around the pond and a session of catch for me and my family. Austin was quick to respond and assist as needed. We thank you for your hospitality and would definitely stay again. The peace this place provides makes the short drive to OKC worthwhile."
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay. We loved fishing at the pond and the location was perfect for our needs. We have booked our next stay already.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The air bnb was absolutely spotless and in such a cute area. The pond and barnhouse were absolutely serene and area was very quiet.

For us, our dogs loved having the freedom to get some energy out which was something we really needed."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"amazing place. we decided to spend the night on our way to OKC from the Wichita Wildlife Refuge. the price was perfect and everything was awesome! check in was simple, kids loved the place.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Austin and Jessica were phenomenal! They were always responsive and answered every single question we had and flexible when we had to make a modification. As for the home itself, when we arrived, it not only looked exactly like the photographs but felt just like pulling home. After a long 20 hour trek, it was such a blessing. We had two dogs with us for this journey and they loved having the space to safely run around and play."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A perfect, peaceful, pet-friendly place to stay on a road trip with easy access to the 40. The home was very clean and just lovely. My friend is a big quilter and was amazed at the gorgeous quilt on the bed! The hosts are super conscientious. Wish we didn't need to get back on the road and could have stayed longer! We hope to stay again when we are in the area."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We’ve stayed here before and enjoy the peace and quiet of the property but it’s not far from town. Great amenities and very comfortable.

Perfect getaway for those seeking tranquility and a touch of rural charm. A delightful experience!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here to visit family for Christmas, we felt right at home! It was clean, comfortable, quiet, and very much a country atmosphere which is what we wanted. The bed was amazingly comfortable, bathrooms clean, plenty of clean linens, extra blankets, pillows, etc. Also very easy to get in and out of. The hosts were very responsive, came right over when we needed something. Will definitely be staying here again."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice place. Not too far from OKC or Shawnee with the benefits of a quiet area. House and bed were comfortable. Liked it so much I booked it for work again the following week. Highly recommend.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My wife and I stayed here for about 3 weeks over the holiday. We couldn't have enjoyed it more. The home is comfortable and good for working from home.

2023-11-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"We are a senior couple traveling with two granddaughters and two small dogs. I’m not sure what we expected in a “barndominium”, but we were a bit disappointed. The living area is quite small. It definitely looks like a barn from the outside. The interior decor is rustic and pretty, with country charm. A coffee pot and K-pods were provided, but there were no snacks or bottled water. Everything is new, and they actually hadn’t finished construction of the inside. The king size bed was comfortable, but the pull down bed was firm. The entire yard is covered in sticker burrs, which we had to pick out of the dogs’ paws every time they went outside. The nearby pond is nice, but we didn’t have time to explore that. We were only there overnight. This place would be best suited as a couple’s retreat to the country."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second stay with Austin and it was also great. We have an event we come to every year this time of year and this will be our go to place for the foreseeable future. Good job, Austin. One of the reasons we love it because it has A quality charger for our EV. That's always nice."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We were quite comfortable at the barn. Highly recommend.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great cozy place to stay ! If you want something private and comfortable this is the place to be

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We got there way after midnight. Finding it was easy. So was getting in. We also had a family friend join our road trip unexpectedly, so the Murphy bed was just what we needed. What a cool place!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We spent three nights at Austin’s place. We loved the beautiful property and our dogs enjoyed running around and swimming in the lake. The barn had everything we needed. We had a very peaceful stay.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is our second year to stay here for our sons birthday. Him and his friends love to come and fish! We will be back again next year!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a great place to stay. The porch overlooked a pond that was stocked with fish and fish food was available to feed them. It is a very relaxing place. We enjoyed just sitting on the porch and watching the fireflies. The place was clean and well furnished. The bed was very comfortable and everything was nice and clean. I would recommend staying here.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My bride and I booked this property specifically because it was a short drive from Meeker, where we were getting married. It was also my birthday that day and the hosts graciously allowed myself an early check in so that I could prepare for our special day. On top of that, they had “happy birthday” and “congratulations” ballon’s at our welcome as well as cookie treats and a bottle of champagne. So awesome! They went well above and beyond! Not only all of that but the place was spacious, clean and peaceful and relaxing just what my wife and I wanted for the holiday weekend. We got to meet Austin and his wife as they invited us to feed the catfish at the pond and plant a new feeder with them. We’re in awe of them as hosts and will be back again soon!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely perfect. Nice and relaxing. Wish we would have stayed longer than one night.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved staying at the red barn. We were there for a dog show in OKC and the dogs LOVED the large open space for running around.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Stayed here just one night because we didn’t have power at our place but it was a beautiful place to be. We took our dog and he loved running around freely! This place was just what we needed! Thank you!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,I loved it! Beautiful land with a relaxing porch. We had obligations in OKC and chose this barn/cabin over a hotel. Great layout in this home. I may one day contact Austin for this floor plan so I can build it myself :)

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful place to stay! Very peaceful and quiet. Close enough to town, but far enough away for peace and quiet. Will definitely stay there again! Hosts were very responsive and helpful!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"was very pleased with location. clean, cozy, private. excellent stay. praise God!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a particularly challenging search for a location. I'm a touring musician, and had been asked to do a live stream show as a promotion for a later concert on this tour. I needed a place sufficiently private that I would disturb nobody, but with a modem that was both directly accessible so I could connect a hard line Cat 5/6 cable, and that also had sufficient bandwidth for the live stream. Austin's listing mentioned high-speed connectivity @ 100 mpbs, so I contacted her to see if the modem were directly accessible. She indicated that it was, and that the location was private so noise would bother nobody. All was exactly as she had said - the main room was perfect for setting up the stream, I connected to the modem with the Cat 6 cable, set up my lights and cameras and mics, and the live stream worked without a problem. For being on the road, this was an EXCELLENT find. Thank you so much!! (Plus the bathroom was WAY cool, and the bed very comfy indeed!!)"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"if you are looking for a place away from town, that is quiet and not too far out, this is a really good one. host are super nice and responsive. we enjoyed the stars at night and just time spent with family. we enjoyed the time away from the hustle and bustle of town. those wanting to see what a barndaminium is all about, can start with theirs."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend staying here. The bardominium was very clean and beautiful. We will definitely be back if we are ever in the area again!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,nice little tucked in spot with some good wilderness.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was so awesome! Even though I was staying for business, the host let my family and two dogs visit for a night and they loved it. Will definitely be looking to stay here again if my job brings me back to this area."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place second time. When I’m in the area will be do it again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were in the area for a softball tournament and this place was the perfect location to keep us close to the fields for late nights and early mornings. The listing matched up perfectly as described. Place was immaculate, beds were comfortable! Such a neat place to stay! Relaxing and quiet area with beautiful scenery! Host was very helpful and responsive! Will most definitely return if back in the area! Thank you again for such an enjoyable stay!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay. The space was gorgeous inside and downright serene outside. Our daughter was thrilled with the murphy bed. The hosts were very helpful, communicative and friendly. We would absolutely stay again."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Austin is a great host. Quick to respond and enjoyed the location.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Unbelievable spot to stay at!
The only thing I’m upset about is that I booked this while traveling and could ONLY stay 1 night! I wish I could have stayed for a week!
This place is a sparkling gem.
And OMG the most comfortable firm mattress I’ve ever laid on. I slept SO great.
Couches we’re comfortable too.
The kitchen was fully stoked w what I needed. Full size fridge. This place is absolutely hands down 1 of the best places I’ve stayed at, and that’s not even including the great value.
Hosts were communicative and kind.
Outside was great - had my morning coffee while walking barefoot outside around the pond. Such a peaceful setting. Very private yet very convenient to the interstate.
10/10 would recommended hands down!
Enjoy your stay!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This spot was great for a quiet weekend getaway, it was private and peaceful, with a great view of the pond! It was close enough to other places (lake thunderbird, hiking trails, stores etc.) that it wasn’t an inconvenience to get to them, but also far enough away that you felt secluded."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I really enjoyed my stay here with my husband and dogs. My dogs really liked the big yard and the spacious living area. We will probably come back within a few weeks or months.
Hosts allowed us a late check out ,
They are good at communicating.
I really liked their laundry area.
There were no cleaning instructions before leaving which was nice, but I cleaned up anyways."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I loved it here! Austin’s place was clean, beautiful, and was in an awesome spot even had room for our 24ft stock trailer. He is a super responsive host, helped me with a WiFi issue and even kept us up to date when a bad line of storms rolled through! We will be staying here again."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super responsive host. Awesome pad to crash at.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful location, clean and comfortable! Highly recommend if you are traveling and need a quiet peaceful place to rest."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a real find in my opinion! If you are looking for peace and quiet and a fishing pond also this is the place. Shawnee is only about a 15 minute drive and has all you need if you don’t want to go to OKC. Austin was VERY helpful and responsive. I plan to return when the pond isn’t froze over !
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thanks again for the wonderful memories. Merry Christmas and the Happiest New Years
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Clean, cute house!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I fell in love in Oklahoma - with the barndominium! This place was the best. I wish I could have stayed longer. The property is so peaceful and beautiful. The barndominium is the coolest! Comfy bed and couches, super clean, and doggo friendly! My pups enjoyed their stay as well. Next drive cross country, I would definitely stay here again. Highly recommend!"
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,This place was so beautiful and in great spot. The girls and I enjoyed our stay and I will definitely recommend it to my friends and family!! ❤️
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This adorable home was just perfect for our stay, had everything we needed and the host was super quick to respond when we had questions. We can't wait for our next chance to stay!!"
2022-11-01,3,Stayed one night,Pretty place & close enough to town but secluded at the same time. Couple problems that could be improved. We bought some stuff to grill but there was no propane left in the tank. The fan in the bedroom couldn’t be turned on unless the light was on. So the room got really hot when the lights were off when time to go to bed. Did catch some good size catfish though which was fun. Not bad for a nights stay.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was a very cozy home! Very clean, cute, up to date and we loved our stay! We will be back if we’re ever in the area again!!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Austin was an amazing host - communicating frequently, and going above and beyond to help during our stay. This is a little slice of paradise - tucked away on a peaceful property. Loved the extra touches - a grill, extra blankets, even a kayak and life jackets. The beds were comfortable. Honestly, I thought it might feel more ""rustic"" but it was a VERY nice stay, one of my favorite airbnb's I've stayed in. From the beds, to the kitchen, everything was amazing!"
2022-11-01,3,Stayed one night,"Quiet, peaceful location and lots of room to spread out. Large kitchen and the extra half-bath is a plus. Overall, however, we were disappointed. I don't know how anyone could call this place immaculate. It needs a good deep-cleaning and some small repairs. Would not stay again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The barn condo is very nice! super comfortable and decorated nice! we enjoyed the peace and beautiful views.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place. Very cozy and well stocked . Appreciated the big tvs and the nice porch. The water was low at the pond but still had fun and success fishing.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Super cute and comfy spot! Easy access, very clean, beautiful maintained 5 acre lot, has all accommodations you could want! 10/10 would recommend!"
2022-10-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"We like the fact that we were able to try our first Barndominium. The place is could be great but they need to work on a few things. The shower needs to be repaired, the electrical needs to be labeled to figured out where all the light switches go. If you can look pass those thing this is a great place . The host was great. We needed a ironing board they brought one over. The host lives next door so you feel secure leaving your stuff their."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,My husband and I loved the peaceful environment of Austin’s place! Austin was extremely accommodating and made our stay perfect! We will most likely be back just to stay here and plan our vacations around this bnb!! 5 stars!!

2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is an exceptional place to stay, not far from OKC and other really cool small towns. We really got a taste of some country living, from the ponds to the cows cruising by on the next property. Our dog and boys absolutely loved this place. We'll be back..."
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"The Barndominium was amazing, fully stocked with everything we needed and plenty of space for the 5 of us. Check-in was a breeze.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Austin’s place is a gem of a find!!! The privacy, the peaceful nights sleep, the open space to walk around the grounds outside was all so wonderful!
The mornings were beautiful outside as we sat out there and drank coffee which was included with their amenities. Pet friendly is a definite plus!
They were super sweet and went out of their way to provide us with all that we needed to get the grill going. My honey loves to grill and cook so we were very appreciative that we were able to cook our own meals.
We highly recommend Austin’s place, you will be very comfortable!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was great! We arrived around sunset after a long day on the road and it was the perfect place for some peaceful rest. It was a beautiful, quiet spot with lots of space for our 8 month old German Shepherd to run around. Good star gazing at night and good birding in the morning.
The house was comfortable and clean, the bed was great. Nice water pressure in the hot shower!
Austin was prompt and kind with their communication.
I wish we could’ve stayed longer!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place came up in our listings barn part was the first thing that caught our interest, arriving there was this place fully embedded with barn charm! The pond was right next to the place filled with so many Catfishes! The house looks uniquely like a barn from the outside! And from the inside everything was updated beautifully with still being able to keep the integrity of a farm feel, clean , high ceilings, spacious TV has everything you need, card games at the table, open fresh spaces outside of nature right in your back yard! Oh and host were responsive almost immediately to accommodate, very attentive. Totally recommend this place hopefully we have the opportunity to stay again soon. Thank you!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a great place! The home was very clean, comfy and smelled amazing! The hosts were nice and very helpful with all our questions. We would definitely recommend this awesome barndominum to anyone looking for a place to stay."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Second time here and we brought all of our kiddos this time and they lived their best lives. Their phones didnt even matter!
If you are looking for an exceptionally clean home , the best hosts and love to fish or just enjoy the beautiful outdoor scenery this is your place! It has everything you need and you will not be disappointed . Dollar store a few miles away in case you forget anything."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful place to stay! From communication before we got there, to ease of check-in, to walking in the front door (it smelled so clean and fresh!) to talking to Austin and the ease of check out, everything was perfect. This is truly a hidden gem. Great layout, decor and furnishings. Beds were so comfortable, lots of towels and blankets and pretty much everything else you would need for your stay. We’ll definitely be back next time we’re in town!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything about this place was perfect for what we were seeking! Lots of open land and a lovely pond. The barnhouse was fantastic! Immaculately clean and quiet...amazing spot away from the city lights and noise. We would not hesitate to book again!

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a must for anyone who enjoys fishing, quiet sunsets and the beauty of nature. The hosts are so friendly and inviting, we had such a lovely time hanging out with them. The barndominium was so cosy and inviting. We honestly cannot wait to take our next vacation here."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay! This place is quiet, peaceful and we felt safe. I didn't lock my doors, and it's been a long time since I could say that.
The pond is fun, it is filled with catfish and a few bass and others, but hooking up with a catfish or two was pretty simple. Great time for the kids! Austin even offered that I can take a few and filet them! I passed, too much work for me, but I appreciate the offer.
The place is decorated very nicely and comfortably. The bed is comfy and the pillows are hotel quality. My wife loved this place so much and what else can you say? It's adorable!
Only 30 minutes from Oklahoma City, we found this to be a gem on our AirBnB road trip across the country. We stayed in numerous places, and this stay has the distinction of being our favorite stay on the entire trip! Thanks Austin, and thank your wife as well. We appreciate your hospitality! Happy Trails!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Gorgeous house, amazing hosts, beautiful property!! I stayed the night during a cross country trip. I would have scheduled my return trip solely around the opportunity to stay here for a week had I planned better. Austin was great, super responsive, and very accommodating with my two large pups who loved the open space and fresh air!!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place and a wonderful getaway! we will definitely book again!!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Hands down the best air bnb yet we have stayed at. Had everything we needed. Great location and Austin and Jessica were the best host. We had everything we needed plus we enjoyed getting to know them. Austin helped the kiddos fishing bc this momma didn't know anything lol and they let the kids have the time of their life in their pond. We will definitely be back to enjoy the property more bad make more amazing memories!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Super nice place to stay! Austin was amazing to deal with. Definitely the best place I’ve stayed around that price point!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very awesome place. Even better HOSTS! They went above and beyond while we stayed there. Would 100% recommend to anyone! Check them out!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Big Red Barn, as dubbed by our 2 year old, was the perfect place for us. The peaceful environment was exactly what we were hoping for. It was a very convenient location as well with easy access to the highway to get wherever we needed to go. Nothing was more than 20 minutes away. If ever back in the area we won't hesitate to book another stay at The Big Red Barn!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location!! Clean, plenty of room inside and out. Close to all your needs but tucked away so you feel like you’re alone. Can’t say enough good things about this location! Absolutely would stay here again anytime we’re in the area. Thanks for being great hosts!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"AAA+ host. Beautiful custom built home that has a very detailed interior. The property is located off a main road but as soon as you drive in it feels like you’re the only one for miles. The entire outdoor area is mind-blowing and is very quiet and private. There is a beautiful pond, and open land as far as the eye can see… yet we saw no snakes or varmints. A great place to stay for a weekend getaway or an escape to nature, and a great host. The house was very clean and was stocked with everything we needed and much more. Thanks for having me!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,had a great few days at the oak spring retreat. would recommend for anyone wanting a quiet place to disconnect for a few days.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to be! Private and quiet. Very spacious home with lots of light. My family enjoyed having a adventure on the trails.
Kayaks and life jackets. Lots of amenities. We didn’t get to try the grill but next time we will fire it up! Will book again 5 ⭐️"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,I absolutely recommend this beautiful home. We will definitely be coming back. Matt was an amazing host and went above and beyond! Thank you so much for sharing your home with us!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great property and host!
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"We had an amazing time. Fishing, ping pong, basketball, walking trails, and casinos very close by if you want to leave the beautiful property. We were able to relax,unwind, spend quality time, and enjoy nature. We will definitely be back!"
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"The place was great, clean, lots of room, we enjoyed our stay. Matt was very helpful throughout our stay, we will be back!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Oak Spring Retreat is a truly incredible find! We stayed with our kids (6 and 9) and my parents (both 61) and everyone loved it. Fantastic sleeping arrangements, roomy living quarters, and great kitchen inside. Phenomenal land with so much to do outside. We will be back!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This property is gorgeous, even in the middle of the winter! Big, spring fed pond (not your typical Oklahoma orange clay) with lots of fish and great trails for walking or biking. Matt was friendly and very flexible with arrival and departure times. The house had everything we needed for meal prep, and it was open, spacious and spotless. Every window in the living area has a beautiful view of the pond. If you need a quiet, country getaway with everything you need for recreation right outside the door, this is the place for you."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying here and we loved it just as much as our first time. The house is super clean, the property is amazing, and Matt is a GREAT host!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Matt was incredibly helpful and flexible for our last minute reservation. The house was beautiful and far exceeded our expectations.
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"We thoroughly enjoyed our 4-night-stay with our family people at Matt’s house! The property is beautiful and was very clean. It looked just like the pictures and was such a restful place for our family during a busy conference we attended in Shawnee. Matt was super helpful and responsive whenever we had questions or couldn’t find something in the house. The garage and game area was a favorite for all of us, especially our kids. We have already booked a return trip for next year and can’t wait to return!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"If you're looking for a peaceful retreat in the country, yet close by to town, this is your place! This home is spacious, room for everyone to sit and visit, large kitchen to enjoy. And that's just the inside! A beautiful deck wraps around two sides for enjoying the pond and wildlife. A very well maintained trail winds around the pond, easy enough for kids, and there's another longer trail as well. We saw turtles, a heron, and heard an owl hooting.
Matt has worked hard to anticipate the needs of his guests, and gave us great instructions for arrival.
There's a reason why he has such a high rating--it is well deserved!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Oak Spring Retreat was an amazing and magical place set in what felt like a beautiful nature preserve. We loved our time there and hope to return in the future. Matt was a very responsive and helpful host. Ten out of ten would recommend.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our second time staying at the Oak Spring Retreat - family of 4 with babes aged 5 & 2 - and we hope to return again! The proximity to OKC is unbeatable - less than an hour drive, and yet the location feels as though you have traveled to a much more secluded area. The woods surrounding the property envelope the house (with plenty of walking/biking trails), and the pond is just serene for gazing/fishing/paddling. The house is minimalistic in the best way - very comfortable and clean with lots of natural light, and stocked with what is needed to enjoy the stay. We really like it here, and appreciate having an outdoorsy place that’s quick and easy to travel to!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Matt’s place was amazing and was just what our family needed. We were in town for a wedding and the family had time to relax and enjoy the property. Matt was awesome an awesome host. Easily our favorite property yet!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful location, lots of trees and walking paths and great pond for fishing. Two kayaks and john boat to use. Saw deer every evening and morning. Very peaceful and relaxing. Lots to do with basketball, ping pong and yard games. Matt is a terrific host, very communicative and helpful. Would definitely stay again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We selected this cabin for a family gathering preceding our son's wedding. It is the perfect setting for multi-generational needs with all the essential ingredients for any age to enjoy nature, play, and each other."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful inside and out! Plenty of things to do or just rest and relax! We caught and released several fish. Great place and we will be back!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed at other places in Shawnee. This was, by far, the best! Place was immaculate. Kitchen was well supplied. Many places we've rented seem to be stocked by garage sales or Goodwill. Not this one. Everything is new. Definitely, our go to for future stays!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Matt’s place is awesome! An oasis with a great pond view from the back deck. I would love to see it in the fall. Fishing was great, we caught mostly bass. The boat was a huge plus. We definitely took advantage of the hiking trails too. The house was perfect for our group with a huge open kitchen/living room area. Beds were comfortable.
I would highly recommend Matt’s place to anyone, especially those who enjoy outdoor activities."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best Airbnb I have stayed at! Host was great and always responded quickly and was very helpful. Felt right at home and the place was extremely clean. Could not have asked for a better experience.
We were in town to check out our wedding venue and wanted a place to relax and kick back with our friends for a few days. The fishing was perfect, it was very peaceful and the property is very nice! The place had everything we needed and then some. Loved having the blackstone available for everything we wanted to cook. This will always be my go to place to book anytime I am in the area!
Could not have asked for a better weekend. Thank you!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was seriously a small slice of heaven! Beautiful Beautiful Beautiful inside and out AND our Super Host Matt is great. He was very friendly and offered information about other things to do in the area to make sure we enjoyed our stay. My family can't wait for the next visit. Thank you Matt from all of us! Be Blessed
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We are so glad we chose to stay here, even at last minute. Unlike some lake resorts in Oklahoma, this location is close to everything you need in the city of Shawnee, and less than an hour from Oklahoma City. Initially we chose the proximity to family and friends joining us over what we thought was more ideal and more affordable, but upon leaving we mostly talked about how soon we could come back! The element of seclusion made us feel cozy, and with young kids, happier to let them run wild. The pond is serene and beautiful, from the cabin and the trails. We loved pulling little perch and 3 lb bass from the water, before smooching and returning them. The amenities allowed us to have an elaborate birthday dinner and cook everything with ease! The back deck flat top grill and air fryer are so awesome! Breakfast on the back deck with coffee, enough yard for adult and kids games, and escape from the heat for movies and naps…. We had just an incredible R&R vacation here!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay at Oak Spring Retreat. The house was as described, and my family of 6: parents plus 4 kids ages 16, 13, 10, and 9 was perfectly comfortable in the space. With excessive heat warnings, we spent the afternoons in the house. In the mornings and evenings we especially enjoyed the kayak and paddle boat, the paths around the pond, and the croquet set. The kitchen had everything we needed for meal preparation. Check in and out were easy and flexible."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Seriously a little piece of heaven! I’ve stayed in a lot of airbnbs, and this one was by far the best. The hosts are super kind & go above and beyond for you to have nice, relaxing stay. Perfect for a quick getaway family or friends, the house is literally stocked with everything you could need! All sorts of seasonings, condiments, pots, pans, utensils, plastic and glass plates & cups, games, bug sprays, ect. (I really could keep going, but you get the point) it’s pretty clear these people take great care of this property, do yourself a favor and come stay here. I will be back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful and relaxing! Loved the pond, caught a few fish with very little effort. Played ping pong and basketball, paddled around on the pond, had a cookout. It was fantastic! Matt was very responsive and the kitchen had a lot already in it so we didn't have to go run get salad dressing or something like that. We are planning on returning someday!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful clean home! We really enjoyed our stay.. and the owners were very nice and helpful!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great for fishing, peach and quiet. Matt was friendly and responsive. Take the kids to fish. They’ll love it."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"The property was beautiful and gave me and my friends a perfect place to stay for the week. The pond had fish and the boats were a nice touch to get a little closer to those hard to fish spots. The house was clean and provided everything we needed for our stay: cleaning supplies, dishes, silverware, even lighter fluid for the fire. 10/10 recommend for a fun trip with friends!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I had the BEST time at this beautiful home! There was nothing that we needed during our stay that wasn’t provided, and the scenery is amazing. We highly recommend and plan to stay here again soon!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place was as advertised - clean and with a wonderful view! Last minute booking was easy and convenient. Wish I had brought my fishing pole.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Matt and his place are amazing! I would highly recommend his place- it's beautiful, plenty to do, clean, and they have thought of everything!"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Nice place! Well taken care of! Would stay again!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My daughter had a softball tournament with games in Seminole and Shawnee over a weekend. We booked Matt’s place based on location to the fields and the pictures. My wife, daughter, one of her teammates, and I LOVED the place! I’ve stayed in a handful of short term rentals and this was the best! The place was VERY clean, the kitchen was spotless, and the furniture was comfortable. Bedtime was without issue and no complaints about water pressure or temperature. Game day breakfast was easy with almost everything we needed to cook (I didn’t find measuring cups but I could eyeball it). Matt was kind enough to let us have our team hang out after the games. The girls fished with worms we got from Walmart and they had a blast catching sunfish and crappie (bring your own gear). They explored the trails a bit but spent more time fishing and playing ping pong. We’re already planning a trip back! Also, ask Matt about his baseball bat making parties!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thx so much Matt. Your place is a gem. We will be back.
The Fredericksons and The Johnson’s"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,House was perfect for us! Pond was so fun to get the boats on. Ping pong was a blast as well. The raccoon did make an appearance for us as well!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"What a magical place! Matt & Katie's place is pure relaxation. From the views of the lake and forest, to the beautiful well-equipped house, my husband and I enjoyed every minute. We fished, kayaked, hiked, played ping pong to our little hearts content. The blackstone was wonderful, we cooked every meal on it. The kitchen was stunning and had everything we needed! We saw so many interesting bugs, snakes, turtles and were definitely visited by the local raccoon. The ticks were kind of bad around the back of the lake and in the forested area so beware of that. Matt was extremely friendly, attentive and helpful with recommendations. Absolutely wonderful experience!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is awesome! It is tucked back away from the road and is so peaceful. We loved throwing a line in the water and just sitting back. We didn’t hike, but there was definitely some trails to do that. We just had a wonderful time. If you’re looking to get out of the city and have some downtime, I would highly recommend."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"2nd week in a row with this place! Would be back for the third week but it’s already booked! Which I’m not surprised, awesome place and great communication with the host"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our home as well as my parents home (we live next door to one another) we're affected by a tornado . We had already been dealing with no electric for days so I looked for a rental in shawnee and Matt and Katie's place popped up..It's really hard to get into a property same day..but Matt immediately responded back ..eager to help us out ..to our surprise their property was directly across the road..it was perfect ..I never even knew this place existed ..it's hidden secluded , private and beautiful..we enjoyed fishing ..sitting out by the fire ..the house was so comfortable and set up perfectly ..beds were amazing..easy instructions ..check in and check out we're a breeze..I would definitely recommend this property to anyone looking for a place to get away and relax!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely great place for us! Out of town working and this place was perfect for us. We ended up booking the week after as well!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay at the cabin on the pond. There is so much to do and everything on the property is in good shape - we kayaked, fished (and caught a fair amount), hiked around the pond and beautiful property, played ping pong, basketball, and more during our annual trip. The cabin was super clean, well stocked for cooking, and close to Shawnee for groceries and restaurants. 10/10 would stay here again"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,If I could give this place more than 5 stars I would. What a beautiful location. The house was clean and fully stocked with everything you need. There was plenty to keep the kids busy. It was private and cozy. Matt was responsive and easy to communicate with. We will definitely stay here again next time we come to town. We had an absolutely perfect time!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,I can’t say enough about how amazing this place was. And the hospitality from the host was second to none. We will definitely be back!! It was much needed and everything was exactly what we hoped it would be!!!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Awesome spot right on the water.
Don’t hesitate to be ok here you won’t be disappointed"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Excellent place to get away! Very, very, clean and spacious! So quiet, and out of the way, but so close to run and get groceries or a bite to eat!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Matt and Katie's place is phenomenal. it is spacious, clean, the grounds are beautiful and quiet, while still being about 5 minutes from town. There is an outbuilding with a basketball hoop and ping pong table, hiking and biking trails right out of the door, and an enormous deck with lots of seating. Matt and Katie have thought of everything. We have stayed at many airbnbs, and I honestly think this is the best one ever. What stood out most to us was feeling immediately like we were more than guests. This felt like staying at our best friends house. They made everything you could possibly need available. It really was just like staying at a beautiful and clean version of our own home. I can't recommend this stay enough, and applaud what Matt and Katie have done to make this a remarkable place to stay. THANK YOU!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was amazing!! My husband, daughter and myself had so much fun fishing and using the boat provided. We left so relaxed and will definitely stay again! Thank you!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved Matt’s place! Great kitchen with a spectacular view of the lake. Wish we could have stayed longer!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was in town for work and was tired of hotels. what a great find, Matt's place. was perfect change. close to town yet very private and secluded, beautiful surroundings with hiking trails and large pond. great porch with plenty of room, a wonderful place inside and out. a big shot out to Matt for keeping us updated on weather conditions in the area as storms were predicted while we were there. excellent host!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I went to Shawnee to visit our grand children and our great grandchildren. My son also came and it was the best weekend that I can remember in a long time. It was so peaceful so beautiful so calming so relaxing everything was perfect! Plenty of supplies we needed nothing except our own food. We finished and actually caught six! We walked around the 20 acres on the hiking trails which was so beautiful. Next time I come back I will definitely be here. Plenty of room for everyone when they came to visit us and there was the game shop the kids had a ball in! Thank you so much we had a blast!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,Amazing place to stay for a quick retreat or business off site. Highly recommended!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is immaculately clean, smells great and feels very private. Waking up every morning was so refreshing and beautiful views from every window in the house. The pond is well stocked and hiking trails are very well maintained. We never had a boring day the entire 5 days we were there. Matt was so responsive and friendly. I can't thank him enough for providing such a wonderful place that I seriously already miss and can't wait to book this place again. Oak Spring retreat is most definitely a relaxing retreat to unwind and just form some amazing memories!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay and will definitely be back! The views from the house are stunning, great fishing and walking/biking trails, tons of stars at night, lots of wild life, basketball and ping pong in the shop was a blast, and the internet was fast so I was able to do a little work and didn't feel rushed to leave. This is a great option for a weekend getaway and still be only 45+ min from the OKC metro. Very clean and cozy home. Thank you for a great weekend!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was so quite and peaceful I kept falling asleep outside. My family had a wonderful time, thank you Matt this is a beautiful place that I would recommend and we plan to return."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was the perfect get away and we got to see snow and it looked beautiful. The place looks even better in person.
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"We didn’t want to leave! It was such a fun weekend. The home was so clean and comfortable. We enjoyed the fishing, the fire pit, the ping pong table, and just the peace and quiet away from the city! We will definitely be back."
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"We loved our stay here and felt completely isolated from the rest of the world. The house is clean, cozy, and comfortable with everything we needed for a great stay.
Our host kept us up to date on everything and replied immediately to any question that we had.
When visiting family in Shawnee we will definitely stay here again."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a treasure to find this place! Matt was excellent to work with and the property far exceeded the advertisement. This place can be as restful, romantic, or active as you want it to. Only thing missing are the memories you haven't made yet! Our memories will last a lifetime!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location with plenty of things to do. Would recommend anyone with kids to stay here. Love it.
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"Place was awesome, definitely relaxing and a great place to slow down. The house was clean and the trails were so good for those morning walks. Pond was such a cool feature. Would definitely come back."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is a gem. The property is situated in a way that truly does cause one to feel way more secluded than you actually are - surrounded by mature oak trees, and wrapped with a densely wooded area that has well-cut trails for walking, running, or biking. The crowning jewel of the property is the spring-fed pond. In the calm waters of both the morning and evening, the reflection of the tree line on the water is something majestic. I realize my words may sound a bit over-dramatized, BUT this place was exactly what I’d hoped it would be based on the description/photos. We wanted an easy getaway where we could unplug and connect with nature and with each other. My husband and 4 year old son fished their hearts out from both the shoreline and row boat, while baby sis and I relaxed in the ample shade provided by the tall trees. We took several family hikes through the woods. I would give this place a 5-star review for the exterior alone, but it’s worth mentioning that the inside of the house was very clean, comfortable, and equipped with everything needed for an enjoyable stay. And you can still enjoy great views of the pond from most every room inside! We hope to be able to return semi-regularly, since it is only an hour drive from OKC. What a great spot to “retreat” for a long weekend! Loved it!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a lovely time. Just absolutely lovely. Wonderful place and people. So many options for all ages. So many amenities for such a great price!
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful place to relax. Decor in the house was perfect. No fussy stuff. Matt was the perfect host. Answered all our questions in a short amount of time. We will be going back.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, peaceful, secluded."
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"Absolutely beautiful place! It is secluded and quiet but also close to nice amenities. I've already told several people about it. If you're looking for a place to stay in Shawnee this is definitely one of my top picks. You couldn't ask for a better host, the communication was great."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This vacation retreat was exactly what our family needed after lots of busy and sleepless nights. The six of us plus baby fit comfortably in the space and really enjoyed the house inside and out! The kitchen was well stocked for our meal prep and we were able to just stay and enjoy for several days without going anywhere. My 1 year old loved exploring nature and the guys spent lots of time fishing on the pond. Very comfortable, clean and peaceful!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great home and property.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, quiet retreat with quick access to all you need! Well-stocked (kitchen has everything you could need to make and enjoy all your meals), including board games, lawn games, books, condiments, and hygiene products. Super clean, incredibly cozy, and well styled. Our kids loved the boat and kayaks (thank you for having life-jackets), we fished until we couldn't fish anymore, and got to see so much wildlife. We were so grateful for the options available rain or shine. It was the perfect retreat!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay. Plenty of space for 6 people & more than enough things to do. Super clean, well stocked home. Matt was really nice. Would definitely go back."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family stayed here over Father's Day weekend and had a blast. It was the perfect place to unwind from our chaotic lives raising 4 small kiddos. We enjoyed the trails, fishing, kayaking, and playing basketball and ping-pong in the shop. The only time we left the property was on our first night just to buy groceries.
The kitchen was large and well-stocked with all of the cookware/utensils you need, and the nice large Blackstone griddle on the deck was awesome to make our meals on.
The bedrooms were spacious, had huge closets, and great beds.
A bonus with the time of year we stayed (mid-June): the *hundreds* of ripe blackberries waiting to be picked behind the shop! Our kids had a lot of fun picking them, and my wife made an awesome blackberry cobbler.
We also loved that it wasn't far from home (OKC metro), but felt very private/secluded. Definitely recommend staying!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,great place to stay with great accommodations!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family had a wonderful time! This place is exactly as described and so much more! We were in town for a softball tournament and it was only 7 minutes from the field which was very convenient for us. There was so much to do there and the fishing was great! Matt was a fantastic host.
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful property, with lots of ways to enjoy time with the family."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was great get away for us. My granddaughter enjoyed the pond, kayak and especially picking wild blackberries. Very spacious rooms, closets are huge, open kitchen dining-liv made it so nice to sit and talk and share meals. Pond is a big plus. It is kind of lake stay with out sharing your space with anyone. Hope to go back again."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to stay if you are looking for a relaxing get away! Bring your fishing poles along and enjoy the fully stocked pond. There are also trails around the property if you would like to go for a nice walk. For the more cloudy days or after the sun goes down there are games in the house or you can enjoy ping pong or basketball in the shop also there is a fire pit to enjoy some roasted marshmallows! The host were very nice and we’re there to help with any questions. I highly recommend this property, we really enjoyed our stay."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We booked this place because we were playing a softball tournament down the road at Firelake Ball Fields. This place is only like 5 minutes from there. The house is very clean and spacious. We loved that it had a washer and dryer so we could keep the uniforms washed. I even had a little time to fish on the beautiful lake and caught some nice bass. Coffee in the morning over looking the lake is great too!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place to stay, very quiet and the home was clean and well stocked. The pond and view were very relaxing all in all one of my favorite places I’ve stayed"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,We came in for a ball tournament. We were looking for somewhere for the kids to play and be outside. It was fantastic. It was the perfect spot for the ball fields and we went to the college World Series and it was very easy to get to. Bev was super helpful and friendly. I would highly highly recommend the place.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Bev was an AMAZING HOST! We were there 6 weeks and she was so prompt with anything and everything we needed.
I am coming back next week for another 4 weeks while my house is being repaired after a flood!
I would highly recommend Bev and her property to ANYONE coming to Pottawatomie County!!!"

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"My college friends & I booked this space for our “20 years of friendship” OBU reunion & it was perfect! The space exceeded our expectations. Shawnee can be hit or miss, but the lake area is wonderful! The view is beautiful & location is peaceful. The host was communicative from the get-go. We made a bonfire which was super fun, enjoyed the large patio in the morning & had enough space for all of us to sleep, hang out & get ready comfortably. One thing I noticed that I often find missing at other airbnbs - they had all the amenities & plenty extra if needed like toilet paper, towels, dishes. I highly recommend booking this lakehouse if you’re visiting the Shawnee area!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,We loved our time here. From kayaking to fishing off the dock. We used the fire pit all the time and enjoyed how quiet and peaceful it was.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We arrived at this AirBnb, looking for a place to relax that offered enough to entertain 4 kids (8,7,6,6) and two families. This place did both. The kids had a wonderful time playing in the lake, jumping off the dock, and running around the grounds. The adults relaxed by the shoreline, kayaked, fished, read books, and enjoyed the sunrise and beautiful weather on the porch facing the lake. The house is perfect for 2 families with enough amenities and space inside but the real treasure is the back porch and lake. Everything was wonderful!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thank you so much for sharing your place with us. We all had a wonderful time.
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"We had such a great time and really enjoyed the experience at Bev’s place.

Very thankful we found this place. 😊"

2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"This house and location was amazing! The house was super clean and the lake was even better. The access to the lake is right outside the back door, a large yard to play in, the dock for fishing, and the large patio. We loved the extra things to play with in the back yard- kayaks, paddle boat, corn hole, volleyball, floaties… it was a great family vacation. We would LOVE to come back!"

Expectations were far exceeded—immaculate room and home, honest and timely communication, thoughtful complimentary extras, and off the charts consideration and kindness. Tyrone and Wanda are compassionate pros! As a complete stranger, I came in with hopeful uncertainly…and left with two new life-long friends.

2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"First off, Wanda and Tyrone were very welcoming, and a wonderful couple and hosts! Their house is very spacious, so Wanda met me upon arrival and gave me the tour, and showed me the room where we'd be staying. The house itself has a lot of charm, and is kept very clean. The room was clean and as described in the photos with a comfortable bed, cool A/C, and Wanda even had a carafe of water waiting in the room for us. There was another guest staying in the house at the same time we were, but only ran into him twice. Each time, he was very cordial. The location of house is very central, and we found it very easy to get around town. I would highly recommend this Airbnb to travelers coming through Shawnee. Lovely home, and lovely hosts. Would stay here again. Thanks!"

2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What can I say about this stay that hasn't been previously said by other guests? Wanda and Tyrone we're fantastic hosts. They were warm and inviting. They gave us tips for around the area and we're friendly every time we saw/spoke with them.
The room was comfortable and clean, as well as the rest of the house. The house was large enough to host many guests without really even bumping into one another. Everything was wonderful and when/if we come back to Shawnee we will definitely try to get a room with then again."

2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It's no wonder Wanda & Tyrone are Superhosts, they epitomize the definition. The home itself if just perfect. It's spotless and perfectly furnished. The kitchen has everything you need plus a lovely corner with a daily food surprises. There was homemade banana bread on one day, another day some delicious fresh fruit. The location is perfect and the rooms are so comfy. This was my first time renting a room instead of entire home. I was concerned about privacy and feeling uncomfortable around others. This fear subsided within minutes of entering the home. The door code is customized to each guest, so you come and go as needed. If you are up to small chat or no chat, Wanda and Tyrone no there place as a Superhost. They are two of the warmest people I've met. I can't speak highly enough about this home."

My room was beautiful and exactly as described, the bathroom was beautiful and clean, I had access to the laundry room, fully-equipped kitchen, and on-site parking. If you are looking for a B&B in the Oklahoma City or Shawnee area, I highly recommend Wanda & Tyrone's place!"
2018-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"As a raging insomniac, it's not often that I get 9+ hours of sleep, but something about the bed in this place must be magic. I got a great night's rest and Tyrone (I didn't get to meet Wanda) was a very friendly and accommodating host. Very quiet and comfortable."
2018-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The room I stayed in was great at Wanda and Tyrone's. They have a charming spiral staircase that leads up to the rooms on the upper level and the room itself was very large with plenty of space. The bed was also very comfortable. I didn't get to stay for long, but they were super great hosts, Tyrone meeting me upon arrival, and Wanda meeting me upon my departure in the morning. They also had coffee and breakfast items that guests could help themselves to. Highly recommended place to stay if you're in the area."
