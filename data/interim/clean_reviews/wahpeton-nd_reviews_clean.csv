2024-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"We had an unfortunate missed cleaning event that happened for our stay. Despite trying to make it better, we found more issues after it was recleaned. Karina was responsive to our concerns, but we felt like the whole place had a stale odor and could use a deep cleaning. The house itself is beautiful and in a great neighborhood, with a nice layout inside."

The house was cute with some older charm to it. We only stayed one night so we didn’t spend a ton of time utilizing the space, but what we did use was nice."

Everything was clean and spotless and matched the description. We were hoping to get in earlier but that is not an option. We felt like this was a great place to rest after being 1,500 miles into a cross country bicycle ride. It would have been great to have access to laundry services but we were able to handwash. Very close to parks, restaurants, and convenience store."

We arrived late at night, so it was a bit hard to read the address from the street, but we found it without too much trouble. There were lots of extra pillows and blankets and plenty of towels, all of which were appreciated. The faucet in the kitchen sink kept changing water pressure, but otherwise everything worked well. A good stay for our cross-country road trip."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a great place to stay. The neighborhood was very peaceful with many people outside walking, riding bikes, and working out in their yards throughout our stay. The street was nice and quiet; we had no worries about the on-street parking. Really appreciated the simplicity of checking out; no need to clean the whole house top to bottom, getting the laundry going, or even taking out the trash! We appreciated that there was a window air conditioner in both bedrooms and vents in the floor of the bedrooms that allowed that cool to reach the lower level even when those bedrooms were shut for the night. Very nice setup when you have young kids that go to bed early and you are spending time on the main level."

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. Cozy, clean, nice kitchen stocked with basic staples, making it easy to cook small meals. Good wireless connection, and good television streaming options. We were there during extreme winter weather. Furnace kept us toasty warm, and the sidewalks were shoveled and salted in a timely manner. I do agree with others who say it’s not a handicapped accessible option. Not just because of the stairs. We were able to trek up the sidewalk in the snow, but it’s a good distance from the street to the house for anyone with mobility issues. For any without those concerns, I would highly recommend the venue."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Quaint house!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From what my wife wrote in the guest book:
We had a beautiful time staying at Minnesota Nice. We had a lovely brunch at Toast, dinner from Union Pizza and coffee from Higher Grounds (easy 5 min walk).
The neighbors could not have been kinder, reminding us of snow emergency parking and shoveling our walkway. Arlo cleared a path to our car in record time! Also, Melissa and her husband were so attentive! We appreciated all the care they took and the shoveling during a record snow storm.
The home was so cozy and warm. It reminded us our own home in Tacoma which was also built in the early 1900's. This lovely sanctuary was well stocked with tea, coffee, pots & pans and baking goods. We loved the butler's pantry.
Overall we had an amazing time and hope to return when we visit our family. We have fallen in love with Fergus Falls! Thank you!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful experience over Christmas. Had a small, unpreventable, problem with the house but it was quickly resolved. Really impressed by the communication and willingness to go the extra mile. Highly recommend staying here!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,we loved our stay! it was cold and snowy outside but warm and inviting inside! the house had everything we needed and had enough space my kids weren't right one top of each other. would rent again!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I stayed intermittently for 5 weeks in the fall while I worked at the local cancer center. The house is a wonderful place to relax. It's located in a quiet safe neighborhood. I really appreciated the kitchen with a full size refrigerator and stove. It has a Keurig and a regular coffee pot. It has a great furnace which kept the place very comfortable when it was below zero. I'm hoping to stay again in the spring. It's definitely my go to in Fergus Falls and so much better than a hotel particularly during the pandemic. Karina is a wonderful host and has family and friends as backups should you ever need them.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had the best week ever at Michelle's ""Tamarac Lake Hideaway"" and can't wait to book it again for next summer. The ""water & woods"" part of it was awesome! We brought our fishing boat and went out onto the water. Caught a few fish and then headed over to Lake Franklin just a few miles down the road where we caught even more. The short 2 min walk to the lake was what we needed to stretch our legs, enjoy our morning joe, and enjoy the outdoors while listening to the birds sing. My husband and I took the double kayak out and saw a momma loon carrying a baby on her back, so neat! The property is on a dead-end gravel road and is so peaceful, especially at night when we watched the fireflies, listened to the frog's croak, and roasted smores over the campfire. One night we drove to Zorbaz on Pelican Lake hoping to get a glimpse of Josh Dumel - Ugh, no luck this time. We highly recommend ""Tamarac Lake Hideaway"" for your next retreat as we had a very memorable family vacation"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Without a doubt the most affordable and secluded getaway from Fargo daily life. Deep in the heart of lake country for those looking to getaway for a weekend fishing trip (BYO Boat), or they have a double kayak on site for you to use with just a brief walk to Tamarac lake. The seclusion and relaxation of glamping made this an easy choice for me, being able to enjoy some much needed nature and settle in for the night with a camp fire or some bbq on the large deck. Being close to Detroit lakes made it great for those like me who tend to forget to pack the necessities, we swung by the coveted zorbaz after a trip to town to replace the toiletries and groceries I forgot to pack. Excellent value stay in such a great part of Minnesota!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location for our needs. Quiet and peaceful neighborhood.
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place to stay. Nice accommodations for the Breckenridge area.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing host, very respectful and nice."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I loved this private and very homey stay. Perfect amenities if you’d like to cook from home and more. The surrounding area is private and felt safe there.

2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Heather's Air BNB. We felt at home. We were able to enjoy time with family and prepare meals for our son who is a student at NDSCS. The hot tub was a nice plus, as well as a workout area. The only down side was how close it felt inside. There is little air movement. Moisture was noted on the windows in the morning. The air freshener was a bit strong for our liking, so we just turned it off. Otherwise, it was a pleasant experience. We cherished our time together. Heather was prompt and responsive. We greatly appreciated it!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Heather may have the greatest hot tub we have ever been in. Between the hot tub & outdoor seating for meals, we were quite comfortable staying outside most of our time.
Railroad buffs will love this location. With beautiful sunsets & sunrises, you can catch some great backdrop lighting for photography. We only heard 2 train whistles, one in the early evening & the other about 7:30 in the morning.
Heather has thought through the comfort of your pets & separating the detail-oriented lawn from the pet-safe zone.
Loved the shower tilework. The spice rack was clever. Mini gym is a great idea for travelers!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and I had been needing a private getaway and this place was absolutely perfect! With a quiet and friendly neighborhood it gave us just what we needed to unwind and reconnect. Not to mention the location was not far from a few different restaurants and only an hour away from bustling Fargo where we spent a whole day out and about. I highly recommend this place for anyone who’s looking to just relax and get away from their everyday life!

The outdoor space is nice for lounging in the hot tub or by the outdoor fire place. Definitely a great spot to stay if you're in the area!"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Cute house with nice furnishings. Would be a great place to stay if you have a dog as there is an entire outdoor dog pen. Train noise was very frequent and occurred all times of day and night, which I wasn't aware of when I booked. The host was very friendly and gave clear instructions with easy check in and out."

The space was so cozy, cheerful, and welcoming, and they had pretty much everything we needed for traveling with a baby and toddler! Our two-year-old was THRILLED by all of the Little Golden Books and the chalkboard doors. We loved how dark the blinds made the boys’ rooms—very helpful for nighttime and naps in the Minnesota summer! It was a perfect location for visiting parks, coffee shops, breweries, the Otter Cove Museum, and, of course, Otto the Otter! Check in/out and finding the location was super easy. It could not have been a smoother trip!

Overall, it was more than we expected.
Cudos to the owners."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a great little place to stay when we’re in the Fergus area. The place was clean, beds were comfy, and it’s centrally located in town. The extra room with the kitchenette was a bonus - it was just right for a simple cereal-and-milk meal in the morning. The only downside is the 3/4 bath - there’s no tub for our littles, but for a short stint where we can skip baths for one night, it was absolutely perfect. We will most likely be repeat guests here, and I highly recommend!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,I use to live in this neighborhood so this place made me feel at home. Karen was great and all the details were taken care of.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Our stay was work-vacay- long stay- my husband was away during the week but despite short weekends to enjoy, we both were extra impressed, & happy with the cozy, & peaceful, accommodations Karen provided!
For us privacy was extremely important, & this was the perfect lodging for our needs!! Yet whenever we had any questios both Karen & her husband were more then accomodating, while always providing us the space we needed. Their 2 sons were also very friendly & respectful to us-overall, a super cool family!
Neighborhood was really nice & I felt very safe on long walks by myself in the evenings.
Also easy to walk to great coffee shops, eateries, unique shops, & our fav healthstore- ""Dutchmann"".
Also lots small lakes, parks, & fun little towns within 1/2 hour drive which was great.
As cliche as it might sound, this is truth: coming back to our lodging from an outing, felt like we were always ""coming home""- rare & special experience these days!
Huge kudos to Karen, Rich, & family!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I keep coming back here for personal retreats because the place is so cozy and quiet. I get really good rest every time I visit. The sitting area and breakfast nook are very comfortable and inviting. It feels amazing to have so much space for myself. Thank you, Karen and Rich!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a beautiful home! Little extra details made comforts of a home away from home! Very pleased and would recommend to All!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place. Upstairs unit. Quiet. Lots of space. Great host.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Karen was an exceptional host and responsive to any inquiries we had regarding our booking. When she had a cancellation for one of the nights we requested she immediately let us know it was available for us to book.
The upstairs apartment met our needs for myself and daughter when we were attending an event in the area. Loved the small sitting area where we enjoyed our relaxing morning coffee. Made us feel at home with comfortable beds, amenities as listed, and lovey antique decor.
Would highly recommend and would stay again when in the area.
Thank you!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This character home was very comfortable, filled with fun, vintage decor. The rooms were well appointed and the bed was comfortable. The muffins were a welcome breakfast treat. We would be very likely to stay again for future visits to the Fergus Falls area."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Friendly and responsive host. In a great location and definitely worth more than what I paid for it.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Karen was really responsive and understanding that we are traveling! Everything was cozy and peaceful :)
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay in this charming place!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,It was a short visit but a very comfortable stay. Our second time staying there. I’m sure it won’t be our last. Thank you.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was an amazing place to stay. Super quiet and felt like my own place. Easy to find even at night. I would definitely recommend.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved our stay, very cozy!!!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I continue to stay at Pilgrim's Inn when I'm traveling to Fergus Falls, and Karen/Rich always exceed my expectations for my stay. I made a mistake for the nights I needed, and basically last minute asked if I could book same day and check out the morning after (Night Shift worker, so I needed to sleep all day) which they immediately responded to in the affirmative. It's a pretty good feeling to know I'm in great hands.
Quiet location, able to sleep well, and very private with an area to eat/heat up food/put items in the fridge. I also appreciate the addition of utensils in case I forget to bring my own. Very clear instructions provided on what I should expect and what is expected of me."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute place to stay to lay our heads down for a few hours. Loved the decor! Felt right at home.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I've stayed at Karen and Rich's home before, and as before I was very thrilled with the process and stay.
I had the whole upstairs to myself, it was quiet and had dark shades on the windows, very easy to get in with my own code, and clear instructions on what was expected of me while I was staying there.
I'm a travel nurse and I work night shifts so it's sometimes difficult to find what I need for a reasonable price. Pilgrims Inn provides me everything I need including an area to eat with a fridge, microwave and even some utensils so I don't need to bring all that with me.
I appreciate as well the small touches that make it more personable, such as the treat of chocolates, muffins, and small oranges when I first arrive. There's also a Keurig available for those who drink coffee.
I plan to stay again in the future!!! Thanks Karen and Rich!"
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The rental was great for my short stay. Karen's place was welcoming and very clean. The beds were comfortable, and the linens were soft and clean.
The temperature is controlled by the owner, so it was a little warm (from heater) for my personal liking when I came in, but there was a fan I could use to cool my room down a bit. Other than that, my stay was great. Thank you Karen for sharing your space."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,What a easy and comfortable experience. I wish everything in life went as well as staying at this site.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a GEM.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,lovely home in great area. everything was exactly as expected. thank you!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I appreciated the little touches that made the place so cozy. The neighborhood is quiet and lovely and a short walk to stores and restaurants. There was plenty of space for me to spread out in the comfortable bedroom with an office nook for my computer work and walk-in closet. The bedroom across the hall was designed with a small kitchen area with toaster, microwave, small refrigerator and counter big enough for preparing a small meal. It had a table and couch and rocker for a lovely ""sitting area"" away from the bedroom area. It's a treasure. I was alone on this trip so left the other two bedrooms across the hall untouched, but in a few weeks I will return with my family and it will be perfect for our stay. The bathroom had a walk-in shower which was perfect for me."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Many thanks for hosting me again. I always feel safe, comfortable and cozy here in this house and in the neighborhood. Will be coming again soon. The environment is very beautiful and quiet, so relaxing. A perfect place to rest and recharge my batteries."

2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Awesome place very nice
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Awesome place to stay. We did enjoyed much. The only missing piece was there was no dishwasher otherwise everything was at place. Thank you so much for hosting us.
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"We stayed here for a retreat for our college student ministry. It was a wonderful location away from our campus. House was well stocked with everything we needed, and the rooms were perfect. Although it is normally used as a hunting lodge, it worked well for a retreat! Exactly what we were looking for."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Excellent in every aspect super comfortable and cozy we enjoy every moment of our stay at the property
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Kaitlyn is a great host, always communicated promptly, I just extended the reservation :)"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice, clean, small apartment located downtown Fergus Falls. Quiet, safe location. Restaurants and bars within walking distance. No issues using the keypad to get into the building or apartment. Parking is located in a lot about half a block away (just a heads up). Would stay here again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kaitlyn’s AirBnB is just as pictured! Getting to/in the location was extremely easy and the street was very private with low traffic. Perfect for a couples retreat/anniversary in the area! I was very impressed with the Kaitlyn’s responsiveness, willingness to make the stay as good as possible, and flexibility. This unit had a great inner city “loft” style feel, all while being located in Fergus Falls. Cancel that staycation to the Twin Cities, because you will get more for you money here!"
2023-10-01,2,Stayed about a week,Great place very clean
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful apartment and great location! Plan to stay in again in the future.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,"A very nice, clean,quiet apartment that is conveniently placed. Was a great stay."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Kaitlyn’s place was great for the 1 night we spent in Fergus Falls. It might be a bit small for more than 1-2 people.
Note: If anyone plans to stay on the pullout couch there is beautiful, bright sunlight in the morning!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautifully decorated!
2023-08-01,3,Stayed one night,"It was a very well decorated apartment. The bed was very comfortable and the sheets were very soft.
It was not easy to get in as the lock box was cumbersome when holding luggage and the lock was tricky. Once inside there were 2 lights going up the stairs in the hallway that were not on. Probably not something the host can control.
I did not like that I needed to do all of the pre-cleaning such as taking sheets of the bed.
I went to get dishes out of the cupboard and they were not well washed.
My biggest complaint was the smell. It was overwhelming with perfume smell from the glade plug ins. I did unplug them but that smell takes time to go away and my allergies were going insane.
Overall if not for the smell I would stay again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect cozy spot for a couples getaway! We stayed here for an anniversary trip- Perfect Minnesota staycation. The time and effort that went into making this apartment beautiful, cozy, and trendy did not go unnoticed! In walking distance to many great places and easily drivable to other nearby destinations (state parks, breweries, wineries, movie theatre). Only “complaint” was that the front door lock took a bit of getting used to and was finicky to open up but we weren’t in and out of the building too many times for it to really effect our overall stay or impression of the place. Would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kaitlyn’s place is fantastic! Very nicely appointed and impeccably clean. The neighborhood is quaint with nice shops and restaurants all within walking distance. The apartment is in an older building and you must walk up several stairs which I only mention if stairs aren’t your thing. Also, the lockbox that allows you to enter the building can be a little ornery. Once you master that and get to the apartment you will be rewarded with a beautiful place to unwind and enjoy your Fergus Falls stay. Kaitlyn could not have been more responsive and down right delightful! Thank you for the enjoyable stay."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The space was exactly as pictured and described. Spotless, with everything we needed for our stay. Super-convenient location, within walking distance to restaurants, great ice cream shop and local brewing company with nice outdoor seating along the river. And our host was very responsive. Would definitely stay here again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cute place! The pictures make it look bigger than what it is. It worked for our short 1 night stay. Very clean!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very cute, clean, and conveniently located downtown Fergus. We would definitely stay again!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This is a lovely vacation rental, but it is very important for guests wanting to use the sofa bed to note there are absolutely no window coverings in the main living area."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed Kaitlyn's apartment. Very clean and decorated so cute. Really homey and comfortable. Great communication and such clear instructions for entry. Definitely will book again when we are back visiting family.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kaitlyn's place was super clean and aesthetic! The bed was comfortable and the place had everything you would need including coffee and creamer, which was a nice touch. Would definitely recommend to stay here if you're looking for a place in Fergus Falls! The only thing I would say (and this is out of Kaitlyn's control) is that if you're a solo female traveler, I would come during the day--for parking you will have to park in a public lot and walk a block or so to get to the place."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,really sweet cozy apartment at a great price. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little apartment that was perfect for a week stay in Fergus for work! Thanks for being a great host Kaitlyn!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We would for sure stay again! Super cute place and very responsive host. Thank you!!
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We’ll described and great location in lake country. Would have liked curtains in the living room/kitchen area to keep out the morning sun for those using the hidabed. Lots of stairs to get to the floor where the room is, but worth the rental fee."
2023-07-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Cute as a button and location was fabulous. Nice touches, hair dryer and quality shampoo and conditioner, etc. There are a few things that could have made it a 5 star. Number 1, would be easier entry. We would have preferred a key but a lock box is at entry and the key is required to stay in the box. We were in and out and many times carrying things. It was cumbersome coming and going. The other is to note that there is not air conditioning in the one bedroom. We had a hot sleepless night the first night. It would have been nice to know. The next day we found a fan in the closest which helped. The other is the long check out list of cleaning. I always keep my stays very tidy but to pay a good cleaning fee and have a long list at check out was tedious. On of the many items on the list was , The trash had to be taken out a few flights of stairs and down the alleyway outside. There are definitely positives to this rental, fun location and great building."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"doesn't look like much from the outside, but it's a really nice place! I appreciated that the AC was on when I arrived."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very adorable small apartment in the downtown area of Fergus Falls. I enjoyed all of the little touches in the apartment (it had a quirky lovely sayings on the walls, cute mugs, etc). The space is smaller than the pictures make it seem, but since it was just me that was no big deal at all!
The key to get in is a bit tricky, but manageable. The one thing I wish I had realized was the amount of steps to get up to the place.
Overall was a really cute and fun place to stay!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Kaitlyn was flexible about a last minute extension, since it was available for an extra day. Super responsive to messages and friendly! Thank you!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable, cozy, and well-appointed apartment that was just perfect for our needs.

If you have time, check out the walking path alongside the river…beautiful, and only a 5 minute walk from Bill’s place!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We instantly felt at home during our stay. Bill and Leanne were so helpful. The location is perfect, walking distance to everything. We enjoyed grabbing ice cream at Uncle Eddie's and walking the trail along the river. Nice, ample parking in the rear. The apartment is SO clean and spacious. They literally thought of everything and we will be back. This will become our home-away-from-home during visits to Fergus Falls to see family."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you’re going to be visiting Fergus Falls for any amount of time, whether it’s a day or a week, this is the place to book your stay.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a great stay if you are traveling for work. Amenities include full kitchen and in unit laundry. Walkable to many restaurants. however most of the businesses asking this main road close at 6pm.
Clean, comfortable, and quiet stay. I would highly recommend this location."

Highly recommend!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We traveled from Nebraska for a dance competition, and have never stayed at an Air B&B before. From the beginning, Bill was very helpful. The place was easy to find- and so neat and cozy. We absolutely enjoyed our stay, felt like home away from home! I highly recommend this place to anyone! We didn’t have time to explore the area, but it is on our bucket list to return!"
2024-03-01,2,Stayed over a week,"Honestly the apartment was very nice, but with staying for work overnights, it was extremely noisy with traffic and then construction right next door also!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second time staying here so that tells you we liked it enough to come back. Everything was perfect for us. Great host. Great stay.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This was the most pleasant stay I have yet had in an AirB&B! Bill was always there for me, in anticipation of my housing needs throughout my stay, as a landlord and as a friend. The apartment is well laid out to make it very easy to use whether I was cooking, sleeping, taking a shower, or just relaxing. There were all the amenities to make it very comfortable and functional. All the appliances were well kept , and all the linens and towels were soft and spotless clean. There is plenty of every kind of lighting. The thermostat control was very effective. There was plenty of space to walk around stuff, and plenty of storage spaces. The apartment was also well stocked. In the living room, the wall hangings are historical framed photos telling the story of the apartment and the immediate vicinity and how it developed after the great cyclone of 1919. On the end table there are booklets on this history. Nothing is lacking from the apartment and its landlord!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My husband and I stayed with our 10 month old over Thanksgiving weekend while visiting family nearby. The apartment was exactly as pictured, if not better! Bill’s communication was great & we were able to check in on a holiday with ease. The space was perfect for what we needed, with the bonus of having a highchair & a few toys for our little one! The location is perfect, surrounded by lots of cute shops and local restaurants, but also surprisingly quiet. We plan to stay here again next time we visit the area and would definitely recommend!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bill is a super thoughtful, extremely accommodating host who demonstrated to me that he genuinely cares about his guests’ needs! His apartment was spotless, well stocked, and intuitively organized to make my stay easy and comfortable!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As advertised. Squeaky clean. Contemporary decor. Personal touches with a mix of spa-like old-towne theme. Central location: Great downtown walkability - grocery & restaurants less than a block away. One restaurant is right next door. Hosts really go to great lengths to care for the property. If you're not onboard with that then this may not be for you to maintain the standards of doing your own dishes, taking out your own garbage, responsibly cleaning up your own spills right away, etc. Persons with chemical sensitivities ought to be aware that there are plug-in room deodorizers in this unit. Fans and vents (run ongoingly). However there are shut offs for these. It's all in their directions which are extensive and detail oriented. It's simple (not cluttered) in a minimising way. It seems to be a family/kid -friendly site. There are neighbors but I never heard them. Stairs are 'steep-ish' and the stairwell is wide. No elevator, for those that need to be aware of that (in description)."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nothing bad to say at all. Top notch place. They go above and beyond. We will definitely be staying there again. Highly recommend this place. Will not be disappointed.

Thank you for having us!"

I especially loved eating at The Viking and Toast and having delicious ice cream at Uncle Eddie’s after shopping at The Market and Lincoln Avenue Antiques. Despite being downtown, the apartment is very quiet and peaceful. I loved every minute of my memorable stay here!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cozy and clean!!!! Everything in the space is modern and efficient. Once on site the spaced seemed much bigger than the pictures portrayed so no complaints here ;)
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved our stay here! It was our first time booking an Airbnb, and it far exceeded our expectations. The owner is very kind, helpful, and responsive, and we don’t have a single complaint about his place. If you are considering booking, do it!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came to Fergus for our niece's graduation and ""Bill's place"" was perfect! .....close by and easy to get to.
The place was clean and inviting, and the bed was very comfortable.
We had the pleasure of meeting the owners at their flower shop downstairs. Friendly and welcoming!
Thank you for the yummy chocolates!
:)

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bill’s place was perfect. We really enjoyed the emplacement of the apartment as it was close to everything we needed. The instruction Bill gave us for the apartment were very clear and we even had a binder with more information in the apartment.
I was impressed how clean it was and in terms of furniture/cooking appliances it had everything we needed. I would recommend it to everyone who wants a peaceful getaway in a really nice town."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The apartment above the flower shop is even more delightful than the photos show! We enjoyed our stay in the lovely and comfortable apartment looking over the fun little shopping and dining spots on the street below. The hosts provided excellent communication and responded to questions quickly.
Thank you!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved the history of this building and the decor, I stayed here as it was centrally located walking distance to a lot of amenities and was there for location to my running race. Bill was super proactive with communication and making sure my stay went well. Highly recommended!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was a lovely apartment in the middle of downtown. The amenities, location, and overall atmosphere were more than I could have asked for."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay! Hosts have thought of every detail one might need in a home away from home. Great decor, comfy bed, and learning about the history of the building was fantastic. Hosts were super communicative."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Bill's place is squeaky clean, comfortable and quiet. The apartment has everything you need and then some. You can walk to many retaurants and shops. We stay in Fergus Falls fairly often and this was our first stay at Bill's apartment. We will definitely be back!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, super clean and Bill made himself available ( even though we didn’t have questions since his description and communication was so clear)."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"A great, new place to call home as I travel to and from the Twin Cities. Very convenient to restaurants and shops, with new furnishings in a well-decorated modern apartment with a historic flare that brings together the new and the ambiance of the historic downtown area. I was traveling solo, but was scouting a bit and will definitely be returning for a girl cousins weekend later this year. A full kitchen, laundry, and sleeping space for a fun family or friends get-away is in store for anyone driving through Fergus Falls or in the area for an event. I stay at Airbnbs an hotels often, and this one is a gem. Thank you Bill, for your quick response time and your level of helpfulness. It was greatly appreciated."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome layout - very functional. Loved the variety of spaces to settle in with a good book. Great shower, kitchen was stocked well. Very nice linens, cozy blankets - just loved everything about it!! We will definitely be back. A great break from the stresses of life!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"One of the best locations I’ve ever stayed. The moment you walk in you’re immediately impressed. Spacious, modern, and beautiful.
Bill was very friendly and responsive. I hope this location is available every time I visit."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great place to stay in Fergus Falls. Location is easily accessible to all the restaurants and stores. Apartment was very clean and comfortable.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful apartment! My teenage girls loved the “vibe” and said the main couch was comfortable to sleep on. Really nice furnishings and comfortable. Would stay again with kids. May not be comfortable for more than two adults (only one real bed) but worked for us!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location in town, immaculate, everything we could possibly need, spacious, comfortable, attentive host. We really loved it. Thank you."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great large space and very reasonably priced place to stay for us so we could explore the area. Bill could not have been nicer and more welcoming when we ran into him in the stairwell when we were checking in. Unit is exactly as pictured, clean, modern, every detail you could need addressed and very warm and cozy on a bone chilling cold windy weekend. We had such a fantastic time exploring the area and would definitely stay here again."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was an amazing stay!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place in Fergus Falls for a nice getaway.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had such an incredible stay at Bill and Leanne's apartment! We needed a place for about a month as we were in between houses after moving for my husband's job. We were one of their first bookings, which is always risky... but right away it was clear how important it was to them that we were taken care of and had everything we needed. They went above and beyond to accommodate us and make us feel right at home. They provided their own grandkids' high chair and toys, and even got a dresser out of storage to put in the master bedroom so we could feel more settled (a month is a long time to live out of a suitcase)! They were so kind and communicative, and the apartment is spacious, clean, and VERY conveniently located. It's technically a one bedroom apartment, but had tons of space and a den/study with a door that we used as a second bedroom for the kids' pack n plays. I even bought a few plants from their flower shop downstairs during our stay :) Would absolutely recommend to anyone!!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Okay let’s describe the apartment in three categories: quality, location, and value ( consumer surplus). Firstly, this place is so worth it: beautiful wood floor, easy access, everything you need is there ( huge kitchen with modern accessories, bathroom and living room are well decorated). The apartment is impeccable: it encompasses a historical but yet modern feel. It is so spacious and well maintained. Secondly, I was shocked literally the apartment is near everything (top restaurants, Viking cafe, breweries, movie theater, wine stores): it it’s the ultimate location, you can literally walk to everywhere. If you are traveling this what you want: to be close to everything. Thirdly , quite frankly the value that I got is more than the price I paid for: this apartment is so well priced and to be honest should be priced higher, because it provides so much value. To summarize: I highly recommend this apartment."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was awesome!! Loved the view.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As always this apartment exceeds our expectations. Super clean, well stocked and great location. We ill be back and recommend this property to any staying in or around Fergus Falls. Great stay!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful apartment on the second floor of quaint downtown building. Clean and comfortable, this was just right for myself and two teenage girls in town for a dance competition. Bedrooms do not have doors, just curtains so be prepared for minimal privacy but wasn’t an issue for us. Small bathroom is located in one bedroom. Space was comfortable, location convenient and Kim was a great host!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,We thoroughlyenjoyed our time in Fergus Falls in our first air Bnb. The apartment was great. Centrally located within walling distance of stores and restaurants. We had everything we needed to feel right at home. We met Kim our host who does a great job. We mentioned an issue with the AC in passing and she had someone there within the hour to fix it. .
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! One of our best AirBnb experiences by far. Clean, quiet and great location.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. Kim was super responsive and helpful!!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My grandson and I stayed for a week. During the day we worked clearing out a house. It was a real pleasure to return to Kim’s apartment that was clean, comfortable, and restful. I highly recommend it for those staying in Fergus Falls. It has an excellent location and provides first class accommodations similar to those of one’s own home. The Keurig coffee maker,complete with pods, was an unexpected bonus. I’ll return to the apartment on my next stay."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,clear instructions how to find the place and secure building. felt like a 2nd home.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim's lodging is situated in the heart of downtown Fergus Falls. A grocery, theater, restaurants, and other independent stores are within walking distance. The street is also an artery to larger, chain businesses a few miles away. Töast, a Scandinavian restaurant a block over, is highly recommended for its focused menu and cozy ambience.
In terms of the flat, it is on the second floor of a two-story building, and the unit sits above a furniture store. If you are up to walking up a stairwell, you'll find Kim's place to be pleasantly welcoming. It contains the high ceilings and wooden floors of older, well-kept Main Street buildings from the period (early 20th century), a full kitchen, large living area, and two bedrooms. The decor is comfortably shabby-chic, though not overdone in a way that distracts. The street itself is busy, but quiet and well-insulated from external noise. Communication with Kim is immediate and instructive.
I would be happy to stay there again!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderfully clean & adorably decorated. Fergus Falls is a super cute town, & in a great location. Kim was wonderful before & during our stay. Communication was great & there were clear expectations & instructions. Will definitely stay again when in the area!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kim was a great host and communicated well with me about my stay. It was in a great location! It did feel a little big for one person but should be fine for a couple or a family. It was well decorated and very clean!

2022-09-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Very convenient location.

2022-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Very centrally located in downtown Fergus Falls. The window faces the back side of the building, overlooking a rooftop. The rooftop has a fire escape staircase, and on the first night at around 12:30am a group of guys climbed the stairs in the rooftop, which was pretty startling. The hosts were very responsive even at a late hour and called an officer to check. Turned out they were just neighborhood kids trying to find a place to hang out.
They immediately installed signs and mentioned they will installed cameras for peace of mind which is great.
The apartment itself is nice and cozy. The bathroom is attached to one of the rooms. The wooden floor does creak a bit and could be annoying for some. Location wise it’s practically on Main St."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great furnishings and slept well there. Close to restaurants and downtown activities. Walk from the location around Lake Alice was very refreshing.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very pleasant stay in Kim’s adorable apartment on the Main Street - Lincoln’s Ave in Fergus Falls. We were walking distance from cute shops and restaurants.

It was perfect for our needs and with its location we got to explore some cute little shops nearby. I will book this apartment again."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice roomy place! Kim and Keith were awesome hosts and we had no issues with our stay. Accurate and easy check in. Located right in middle of town. Restaurants, shops, Riverfront, and Lake Alice all within walking distance. Would definitely recommend. Only con is steps up to second floor. Wasn’t an issue for us."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I was pleased to find this second floor apartment in downtown Fergus Falls to be so convenient to restaurants, shops, groceries and walking trails.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place right downtown and great host! Highly recommend!
2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very unique building with apartments above it and a furniture store on ground level. Designated parking for you when you arrive, but you do park in back and then have to walk around to the front to enter. Go up a flight of stairs and there’s the cutest apartment for you to stay in. Very well decorated with everything that you need including coffee in the morning and two nice bedrooms. The place is extremely cozy but if you’re looking for a place to be loud or if you have a noisy group it’s not ideal for you. Very quiet especially at night. Located right amongst the coolest little shops to go visit. I had a great stay and really appreciated this apartment!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice accommodations, great location!"

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This rental was great! Very easy to get to, as well as easy self check-in. There are stairs to climb to get up to the unit door. Plenty of space in the living areas and queen bedroom. The shower took a little to warm up but the showerhead was great. The queen bed was very comfy and the available streaming services were a nice-to-have! Walking distance to plenty of food options, as well as coffee shops, and Outstate Brewery was a blast! We would definitely stay here again next time we are in Fergus Falls!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing home away from home to relax in the quiet country.
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,We enjoyed our stay and spent most of our time in the added on pool table/hot tub area. The house is bigger than the pictures make it look. Nice sized basement and living room. Minimal checkout instructions. They don’t have salt and pepper (that we found) and the water does not taste great. The wood floors in the house were a bit sticky and the fridge wasn’t quite wiped down. But other than that the house and beds were very clean! Host was very responsive and lives in a house on the same property. Thanks for the stay!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Randy was such an amazing host. Super nice and helpful. He gave me a call right when I booked the place to make sure I actually booked it since it was so late at night. He went over everything and was as polite as can be. The place was amazing and reminded me of the home I grew up in. The farm is gorgeous and super unique as there aren’t too many buffalo ranches where I’m from. We loved our stay and will gladly return if ever in the area. Thank you so much to Randy and his family!
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"We loved our stay here! Everything is exactly as described. From arriving to homemade cookies waiting for us to waving the bison goodbye, our experience was wonderful. It had a cozy, home-like feeling and was very peaceful. The hot tub was also a very nice perk! Thank you so much to the hosts for the awesome experience and hospitality! Would definitely recommend to other guests: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,Enjoyed our stay. Was very quick to respond. Provided the little extras to make it a wonderful place to stay
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Overall a very welcoming and cozy stay! We would stay again if given the chance! :)
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Was nice to see the Buffalo in the morning while having coffee. And there is a fun game room with pool table and hot tub. Very relaxing stay. Still close enough to Fargo if you want to shop or eat out. Highly recommend.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our family met for a Christmas celebration. We all felt very at home and appreciated the peace and quiet. We had everything we needed and slept great!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing place to stay! Randy was so welcoming and even gave us a tour of the ranch. House was clean and spacious.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"My friends and I booked our stay with Randy for a girls trip. He made the process so easy. His ranch is gorgeous and he made us feel right at home! The home had everything we needed, and items we didn’t realize we needed! We all agreed that we would definitely stay here again in a heart beat!"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Randy was always checking in to see if we needed anything or had issues. He was friendly and approachable. The one issue to keep in mind is that parts of the house were difficult to get around in if you have mobility issues. I would not hesitate to stay there again.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed the relaxing stay and the thoughtfulness of the hosts!
Meeting Fury was an extra special experience as well!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,After a long road trip it was so lovely to crash at this bison haven and have delicious homemade brownies as soon as we walked in! Not to mention the hot tub was 10/10 and just a lovely escape overall. Very quick communication and cute animals to see (and not chase) everywhere!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a lovely getaway with a few friends and this was a much needed respite from Fargo. Relaxing, seeing the Bison was so cool! Lots of awesome touches, from bathroom amenities provided ( in case you forgot yours) to the little chocolates ( a favorite amongst us women in the group) Beds were cozy and comfy. I would recommend this place anytime and I would love to stay again!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house has a fantastic layout. The decor makes things feel like home. Watching the bison and seeing the sunrise was amazing. Bedding and blankets were so ft and snuggly. The host was very responsive. This was a wonderful place to stay.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful place for a quiet get away. Enjoyed watching the Buffalo right outside the living room window!
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,y'all need to stay here. it is gorgeous and the bison out back. just add to it. a lot of cool amenities are added and Randy and his wife go the extra mile which makes it. one cuz that's like my favorite thing to do. there is like 10 bucks. I think that's all cuz she's like okay. you have to pick up some bison steak from them.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an absolute BLAST at Randy's. It was so nice to be outside of the hustle and bustle of Fargo but close enough to make multiple trips during the day. Waking up and being able to see the bison hanging out was just amazing.
The hot tub was in working order and towels were provided nearby which was so nice. Our hosts were also kind enough to leave a couple of packages of bison sticks which were DELICIOUS!
I'm trying to find another reason to visit Fargo just so I can stay at Randy's again. It was just so wonderful."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at Randy's in September with another family and four toddlers (4/2 yo). They didn't want to leave (and honestly neither did we). Randy and his wife were excellent hosts, and even though the hot tub wasn't working, we stayed very busy hanging out with the animals. This place was super clean, very comfy and had everything we needed and more! Def will be recommending this spot to other families."
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,beautiful property!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,5 STARS! Great spot south of Fargo/Moorhead. Full on Bison Ranch. Chickens. Kittens! Clean. Comfortable. Friendly and responsive hosts. Must stay Airbnb if you’re in the area for any reason. Great spot to stay if your going to Bluestem. We will be back next year no doubt…Thanks again Randy and All!!!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Close to the college . Very clean and beautiful. Easy access . I would rent it again
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Felt like I was at home!! Spacious and clean!!! I was here for a short period of time but it was exactly what we needed a good, clean, spacious, and peaceful place to rest!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I am from Wahpeton and rented this airbnb for my grandma and two of her friends! I did end up staying with them over night. It was beautiful. Super spacious and made you feel right at home. I would highly suggest this to anyone who is planning their next trip to Wahpeton, ND!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great location! Great office area!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I came to Wahpeton to help with family medical appointments. LOVE this location—close to everything. Ben was very friendly, helpful, and flexible to extend my stay when needed. I will stay here again when I’m in the area."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,Really enjoyed my stay
2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This location is SUPER convenient and very easy to access. I also love the dedicated workspace and the VERY NICE laundry facilities. The only downside is I could hear every footstep upstairs, but otherwise the place is very comfy and definitely worth the money. I absolutely will come back again!"
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,exactly as described. super clean.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,great place to stay! very comfortable. hosts very responsive.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,quick response. great spot. great place for family.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot for the weekend. Was visiting for a wedding
2023-11-01,4,Stayed over a week,"Wonderfully accommodating couple! They were prompt in getting the lock issue resolved. Shower is really nice and has ample hot water. Bed was super comfortable. Everything was clean and welcoming and there were many amenities for recreational use (movies, video games, books).
I did not look as closely as I should have at the listing; there isn't a kitchen, only a microwave, coffee maker, and small refrigerator. They do have laundry facilities available and WiFi.
Overall, very adorable place and close to the location I was working."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful home, felt at home as soon as we got there. Ben and his wife were very friendly and nice. They respect your personal privacy and make it easy if you need to ask them anything and let you know at a decent time if you need to park in driveway at night. House was clean and cozy. Definitely would recommend, plus your within walking distance of just about everything, including fast food, restaurants, and general store."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,It's an extremely welcoming place. Benjamin and wife were fantastic. Thank you for everything!
2023-10-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Nice place. Not a completely private entrance as you can either go upstairs or downstairs, but had a door to upstairs that separated the spaces. You are in a basement, so you hear talking, vacuuming, TV, walking from upstairs, etc, but was minimal. Much better than a hotel!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and clean place to stay!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great, clean place to stay! The private entrance was easy to find and use. The hosts were very responsive to any questions that we had, and I felt safe in their space. I would recommend this Airbnb to a friend!"
2023-09-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"I stayed here as a stopover on a long road trip with my dog - the place was very clean and had all the listed amenities. The bed was quite comfortable (I stayed in the smaller bedroom on the queen). There is a big comfortable lazy boy couch. The coffee station was set up with ""to go"" cups and there's a great little coffee shop down the street. The host was very responsive.
A few heads ups about staying here:
- You may hear the hosts walking upstairs. It is not too loud, but it was noticeable - my dog got alarmed and barked, so I asked if the host would meet the dog so she would know it was okay. He kindly complied!
- The bathroom is small and a little awkward (the door opens inward and hits the toilet).
- There are no table or chairs, glasses, utensils, plates or other items like that, so plan ahead if you want to bring food in.
- Plan to get water from the bathroom sink or bring in your own.
- There is a small flight of stairs down from the entrance to the living space."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Benjamin’s place was clean, quiet and comfortable. Stayed her for a week while waiting to move into an apartment. Definitely would recommend!!"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Benjamin,
We enjoyed our stay. Everything was very clean and loved that we had access to the washing machine and dryer. The only thing that could've been better would be to have a mini fridge for drinks and control of the air conditioning. We were very thirsty and the cold water in the bathroom sink didn't work. We only had hot water. We made sure to have water bottles with us but there was no where to keep them cold. We were freezing down stairs and would've loved to be able to change the thermostat. Just a couple suggestions but over all it was a good stay. We slept well and again everything was very clean."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean, cozy and comfy beds. Nice location easy to find. Ben and Amanda are very nice and accommodating. We stayed there one night while dropping off our son at NDSCS. They were very nice and helpful. Will definitely stay here again."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Benjamin's place was beautiful and charming. The space and set up was wonderful. The beds are comfortable and the family space was fun. Absolutely loved it!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Benjamin was a great host. The place was nice supplied with a lot of entertainment (TV, Gaming, DVD’s, Books). Beds were super comfortable.
Ben gave us some great local information to help get us settled for a permanent move to the area.
Only down side to the stay was smelling the delicious aromas from Bens cooking.
We would recommend anyone going the the area to stay here"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We were very comfortable at the Cherry Ave. house. We felt chilly after a few hours arriving there and a simple text to the owner resulted in a prompt response and he took care of the situation. (He controlled the heat/air from his cell phone). The beds were comfortable as was the bedding. The entire house was nice and clean. We enjoyed a couple hours sitting in the back yard between events we were attending. What a treat. Nice and quiet and relaxing. I would stay here again. Very comfortable stay.

Large coffee pot that was workable for all of us as coffee drinkers.
Quiet neighborhood and lovely location! We all said we’d stay at Steve’s place again if we were to plan a stay in Fergus. I don’t think you would be disappointed if you stayed here next time you’re in Fergus either!"

There is a bar very close by and the pizza is delicious.

We would like to return at a next opportunity to stay longer."

If we come back to hunt this area, I’ll definitely pick Tim’s place if he’ll have us."

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot recommend this property enough!! A friend and I used it as a base for a weekend golf trip, and it was exactly what we needed. A super clean property with a nice little kitchen and a great shower. So much better than a hotel room. Tim was a terrific communicator, and everything was as described (actually better). Our only regret is that we didn’t get a chance to go to the bar that’s just down the street. It looks super cool. A great option if you’re in the area!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is such a gem, in a really beautiful isolated town. We enjoyed the sounds of dawn and dusk in the country, and the lodge itself is well equipped and stylish. It would make sense to ask Timothy well in advance directions to the lodge since the place doesn’t show up on google maps - we weren’t very clear about which direction we were driving from so we had some trouble finding the place, but People in town were super kind and pointed it out for us. An awesome stay and would strongly recommend."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place the owner is very helpful as well I would love to stay again!
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"Took 4 generations of family to North Dakota in early July and we spent 3 nights in Tim's cabin. Was arguably the best part of the trip. Cabin was clean, organized, and easy to locate even in the dark when we finally arrived. Tim gave great directions and was super accommodating when the trip was being planned and we weren't sure how many people would be staying. Would absolutely stay again and highly recommend it to anyone passing through."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved this place. Exactly what I needed for an overnight stay for me and my dog.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, clean, quiet cabin in rural southeast North Dakota. Close to Sheyenne National Grasslands, North Country Trail, and about an hour from Fort Ransom State Park."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Just what my pup and I needed for an overnight stay on our road trip. The cabin is a giant room, with multiple twin-size bunk beds (no normal beds) across from the kitchen. Cute little shower in the bathroom along with washer and dryer. Cabin is on acreage, which was great for my dog to run around on.
Be aware of some neighborhood noise related to a bar down the block, which mainly were loud trucks. The cabin also had a light but noticeable rubbery/gasoline/gunpowder smell. I couldn’t figure out what it was, and I was noseblind to it by nighttime."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect place to stay. Left nothing to be desired. Highly recommend staying here. We enjoyed the quiet relaxing time we spent here, and would return in a heartbeat."

2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent set-up. Very clean, well thought out, good value. Is pet friendly, yet the place doesn’t have the “pet smell” dog owners think everyone else’s dog has. Additionally, we had a dog that needed to stay in the breezeway & any hesitation we had was addressed as the breezeway was well heated and perfect for our needs. Additionally, I twice updated my reservation (arrived a day early & stayed a day later) & Timothy communicated very quickly. Will absolutely be back."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little cabin just an hour from Fargo. Relaxing get away spot if you need a quiet weekend out of town. All the cooking amenities you could need and even a bit more! Beautifully designed, spacious, bright."

2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a nice little cabin in a small Country town. It’s clean and new and we Really enjoyed it. A little to much posted land for hunting but you can still get permission and there are some good open areas. All in all I will definitely be back to stay. Next time we will be pheasant hunting.

2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great North Dakota cabin!!! Wonderful for a weekend away. Cozy and clean.
Each bunk had its own plug with usb chargers :) great touch for the modern world! But the surrounding grasslands also make you want to unplug. Conveniently located between two hiking spots I wanted to check out at Hankinson & Jorgens Hollow.
I would recommend this spot."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,Scott and Kathy were great! It’s out in the country. Peaceful surroundings! Great place. Had a new grill. We all even went to a Willie Nelson concert together.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathy's place is in the middle of cornfields. You could not ask for a more peaceful or private location. The home is cozy and very nicely appointed. If we had not spent all of our time in town with our daughter, this home would have done nicely as a quiet retreat. We met Kathy as we were checking out and found her to be very nice and accommodating. We’ll definitely return on our next visit."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathy was an amazing, proactive host - she thought of things we might need prior to our arrival! I'll never forget these special touches. Kathy's place is a private, serene space, outside the hustle and bustle of a more urban space. we enjoyed every minute!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kathy's place is super clean and homey. The kitchen is stocked with all the cooking utensils and such you will need and more.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, clean, and great space to stay! We were visiting family in the area and let me tell you, it’s so much better than a hotel! The bedroom has a surprising amount of space with an extra large closet and desk for any quiet computer work. We loved the porched and played lots of cards out there in the evening. The kitchen is stocked with lots of essentials plus much more. Luckily we were familiar with the area so we didn’t have any trouble finding it. It’s on a lovely quiet farm where you see all the stars at night. Kathy was very welcoming and super friendly!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Private and very cozy. Thank you Kathy!!

2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"We have stayed here twice, and both times were wonderful. There is plenty to do whether the weather cooperates or not. The multiple living rooms, including the garage area, make it nice to spread out."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,A absolute beautiful place. Nice and big for a big group of family and friends. Private and peaceful gatherings places. Best place we have ever stay at. I definitely recommend for anyone of my friends and family or anyone that has a big group that just want to have a great gathering to enjoy and relax with family time.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful house that was able to accommodate my large family retreat. My family hasn’t had a family retreat in years, and this place was nice and helped us make many great memories! Tanya was always nice and responsive.
Beautiful surroundings but I just wish the lake we had access to was good for swimming. But of course, that was listed in description and we knew that ahead of time. But the hot tub does not disappoint!"

The hot tub and fire pit were probably our favorite parts! I would very much recommend this to anyone looking to have some fun on the lake as well!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Awesome place. Great host. Extremely well stocked kitchen. Cupboards and closets well labeled. Very clean. Lots to do. Kids didn't even miss tv (which tons of dvds are provided), but with all the arts and crafts, toys and games for all ages provided screen time wasn't missed. Still had lots of snow and the sledding was a big hit (sleds provided) there's also an ice rink and nets on the lake available. Between the ping pong, Foosball, pool and air hockey everyone had so much fun. The hot tub was an added bonus. Lots of memories were made. Tanya, the host, was very helpful through the entire process and answered all questions. She was great to work with. The pictures don't do it justice and would definitely recommend this place for a family and friends get together without hesitation."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved it! It was an amazing place to stay for a winter family vacation. The kids loved sledding and the hot tube. The kitchen was fully stocked, even had 2 sinks in the kitchen. Will for sure come again!"

2023-02-01,5,Group trip,The Gathering Lodge was a perfect place to reconnect with some of my close friends and family. They had all the amenities we could've need. The kitchen was fully stocked of the things we needed to cook family meals. I would love to revisit but in the summer months!

2022-08-01,5,Group trip,Our group had a great time and there was plenty of options when deciding how to spend our time! Everyone had a wonderful time and we would book this place again in a heartbeat. Hosts were helpful and constantly communicating with us leading up to our stay.

2021-12-01,5,Group trip,"The ""Gathering Place"" is amazing! We have a large family and everyone had a warm cozy bed to sleep in. Every area of the home was warm and inviting. The kitchen is big and has every thing needed to make and serve our meals.
The game room was a hit with everyone! We were blessed with a huge snowfall the evening we arrived, so the sledding hill right out the back was great. Those of us who were not up to venturing out in the cold could enjoy the the fun with a great view from the windows. We also loved the area in the garage for all the wet snow gear! Our grandchildren were entertained, on the last morning of our stay, by an otter family on the pond. Tanya is a wonderful host! We appreciate her attention to detail and her prompt responses to all our questions. My granddaughter said as we were packing up to leave, ""We didn't stay long enough, Grandma! Next time we need to stay a week"" ❤"
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,It will be beyond your exceptions. Get ready for an awesome experience.
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,"Hands down the best Airbnb stay I have had. Tanya has gone out of her way to make the home feel like one. If you are a hunting group, this is the house for you. We had an absolute blast here and only regret is that we were not staying longer."

You’ll find everything you need as there are labels and extra supplies provided throughout the home. Plenty of beds and separate living areas for a little extra privacy. Our favorite part was the entertainment area. We spent the majority of our time indoors, and there was never a dull moment because this home has so much to offer! The host was very responsive and had excellent communication. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place and will definitely visit again!"
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,"Amazing place. Well stocked, well labeled and excellent layout. House is large with many sleeping options including the awesome lookout loft. Owners were excellent at communication and the listing is everything one could want. Our group is excited to return if given the opportunity."
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"Wow, this place was absolutely amazing! Hands down best ever Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at. The best memories of my life were made here and I will cherish them forever. Tanyas communication was great, the lodge has EVERYTHING you need, the beds were so comfortable, and there is so much to do there! This place was so warm and welcoming and fun. Not only that but the Lakes Area Paddle company that you can rent a pontoon from are so nice and great communicators as well. 10/10 highly recommend the Gathering Lodge! Thank you , Tanya!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The home is huge and there are so many beds. The mattresses were very comfortable and the blankets were super soft. The kitchen is the best stocked kitchen I have seen in a rental. We even received a welcome basket from the host. We took full advantage of the kayaks, canoe and paddle boat. It was a nice perk. The only downside was we got notified the day before that they were temporarily using their shop on the property to run their business out of so they have clients coming and going each of the days of our stay."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I'm not sure where to start my review about The Gathering Place. I've stayed in quite a few rentals in my travels, both reserved on my own or by other friends/family. I'll start by saying it is certainly one of the nicest, most well-stocked places I have ever stayed. It's even more spacious than it looks in photos-there's plenty of indoor and outdoor spaces for a large group. The kitchen is one of the most well stocked kitchens I have every used in my airbnb travels-you'll find just about everything you need to cook for a large group there, and then some. It's definitely set up to cook for a large group. There's plenty of sleeping spaces and nooks and crannies for quiet reading time or playing games or taking naps. There's enough bathroom space for everyone in the group-which is frequently lacking in other rentals. There's more than enough towels, hot tub towels, and beach towels for everyone-and every drawer/closet is labeled for easy access to supplies. The game room is fabulous, the hot tub is fabulous, the sandbox and playhouse/swingset was great for the kids. We so appreciated having the paddleboat, kayaks and canoe-we kayaked all over Swan Lake. And, although the water levels are low near the cabin, we were able to rent a pontoon from Lake Area Paddle Sports (another highly recommended company!) and navigate it back and forth between the cabin access point and the main lake. We had a BLAST on the pontoon. Finally-the hosts. They have been nothing but wonderful from the time of booking to the day we departed. They responded promptly to any questions we had and kept us informed of directions, access, and anything else we needed to know during our stay. The welcome basket with snacks and coffee from a local roaster was a really nice touch. Our only regret was that we weren't staying longer. It went by so fast! I would highly recommend this place for large groups-you will create wonderful ""forever"" memories here."
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"We stayed with a group of 18 for a joint bachelorette party. Everyone was absolutely blown away with this space and wished we could stay longer. The host has excellent communication. The space itself provided endless entertainment with all of its amenities. We especially loved that every room was wired with a built in sound system. The lake was pretty mucky as we haven’t had much rain but we had a blast taking the canoe/kayaks/paddle boat out! Every cabinet and drawer is labeled so things are easy to find. The kitchen was fully stocked so cooking for our big group was a breeze. The hosts had a fun welcome basket and provided any small extras we had forgotten (shampoo, toothbrush, etc.). The cabin is HUGE (bigger than it looks in pictures) and everything was very clean. These hosts have thought about every last detail. We can’t say enough about this space! We will definitely be back again."
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,Great location with tons of space!!!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Property was well maintained and the beds were incredibly comfortable. This property was well equipped with all the necessary and essential supplies. The hosts were very accommodating to our requests. Great functioning internet and a fabulous game room. The ping pong table in the garage was a really big hit. Property is well designed so people can be all together for meal times and is also spaced out for having some alone time. Hot tub was a plus also.
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful place to stay with room for a big group!
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,Fantastic place with a wonderful host. You will not be disappointed with this place and host. This place is gorgeous with many things to do for both young n old. 5*****.

2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Huge space, perfect for our family to get away during the pandemic just to have a change of scenery. The kids LOVED the bunk beds and the outdoor equipment. Lots of games, books and puzzles to keep them occupied on rainy days. The house was very clean and everything is well labeled and easy to find. We loved the game room and hot tub as well. Thanks for creating such a lovely space for a quick getaway!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is really beautiful, including the nature trail by the lake. The beds and furniture were very comfortable and everything was well kept. They had a stocked craft room for the kids. I would recommend it for any group including families."
2021-03-01,5,Group trip,"We loved our stay at the Gathering Lodge! The place was sparkling clean and everything was helpfully labeled for our stay.

Tanya responded to all messages very promptly and could not have been more welcoming. Thank you for having us!"
2021-02-01,5,Group trip,"It was roomy and clean. Great hot tub, game room & sledding hill. Be advised owner has some decorations & all reading material of christian theme."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The gathering lodge is equipped with all the amenities you can ask for. We were a group of 16 people and there was plenty of space for us to spread out or all be together. This is the perfect place for a winter get away. our weekend was jammed packed with sledding, snowmobiling, fishing, soaking in the hot tub, playing games and enjoying each other company."
2021-02-01,5,Group trip,Has to be one of the best places I’ve ever stayed! Very spacious and I love how everything is labeled so it’s easy to find things in such a big house. My group had a blast(:
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The cabin is beautiful and extremely comfortable. The design and floor plan give all members of the group their own space, and then some. We appreciated the attention to detail: very clean, clear signage for how things worked, plentiful towels, high quality furniture and bedding, and plenty of options for things to do. Tanya and Bill are local owners and were extremely responsive if we needed anything and even shoveled out the sidewalks and driveway almost immediately. The property is great for any group size and is very kid-friendly as well! We would definitely stay here again."
2020-12-01,5,Group trip,I highly recommend Tanya’s house. They were a nice family. The house is an amazing value and did not feel crowded at all even with a big group. It’s a great winter location with sledding and ice fishing opportunities and would be a dream location for the summer.
