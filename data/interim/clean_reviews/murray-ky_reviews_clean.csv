This is a place I‚Äôd drive a few hours for just to stay again."

If you aren‚Äôt aware of the area, there was a terrible catastrophe in the area a week before our scheduled trip. Jill was wonderful the whole time with communication and keeping us informed. She even made sure we knew the cancellation procedures if there was any amenities that would not be available at the home due to the tornado that destroyed the area. Everything was up and running by our trip, she even reached out during to let us know the town had lifted the boil water notice. The house was everything we wanted and the location allowed us to easily travel all over the Western Kentucky area. Thank you so much for your hospitality and we can‚Äôt wait until our next trip!"

2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"The cabin makes you feel like you are out in the middle of the woods, well, because you are, and coming from a metropolis, it‚Äôs just what the doctor ordered.

Would definitely stay again and seeing as I have family in Murray, I probably will."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,The scenery was gorgeous and peaceful. The cabin was very cozy and the beds very comfortable. The location of the cabin was close to town and Brian was an amazing host. We arrived early and he allowed us access anyway. He is polite and kind host.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved staying at Brian‚Äôs! It was clean, super quiet and stocked with more than we needed!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,A nice quiet get away.
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a really remote cabin...then this one is for you. But, if you are afraid of critters & spiders then perhaps keep searching. Brian was super responsive & easy to communicate with, cabin was clean. Kitchen and living room was great - just like the pictures. But the upstairs could use some work. We were not able to use the upstairs bathroom at all. The toilet was on a homemade landing and it's difficult to maneuver. Right at bedtime, there was a HUGE spider in the upstairs bathroom and it freaked me out so much - that I had hard time sleeping. I have never seen anything like it before. The upstairs bathroom seems to have been part of the attic and it's not constructed well therefore allowing unwanted quests :) to get into the bathroom and house. So, overall, we had a wonderful stay and weekend, but a few hiccups along the way. If you rent this cabin, you will definitely enjoy some quiet time and beautiful scenery, just be prepared for the outdoors."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,A great cabin tucked away in the woods of Kentucky. Also a a uick drive to Murray. We really enjoyed our stay.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wife and adult kids traveled to Kentucky Lake to visit family‚Ä¶. The place was very private and peaceful. Had a minor hiccup at the place but Brian was open to addressing the issue. If you like an almost off the grid feel and need a private getaway this is a good choice.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Nicely appointed , loved the layout and kitchen area. Great windows to view the outdoors which was so peaceful ! Very responsive! Loved having the grill there! Very comfortable. Highly recommend!! Super value !!!!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you love the woods and peace and quiet, I highly recommend this place. Very clean and the beds are comfortable. My guests said it was the best rest they had in a long time. I wish we could have been able to enjoy the surroundings and back deck more, but we were just traveling through. The only thing was, when we pulled into the lane, there is another place at the top of the hill and we were a little concerned that was the cabin. Finally saw the cabin we rented. Much to our surprise, it is a beautiful cabin. Thank you Brian. I will be telling people about this, if they ever get in the area."

Perfect for cooking breakfast and watching the sun rise! The home had every single thing you could need and then some! It had snacks, cooking utensils, pots and pans, dishes and two coffee pots! (Regular and Keurig)! After a long day of swimming at Kentucky Lake it was so nice to come in, cool off and relax! Laundry detergent and dryer sheets were provided so we were able to wash our swim clothes right away too! The two bedrooms upstairs were very cozy and bedding was so soft. This trip was just my husband and I, but we could have fit our family of six comfortably and not be on top of each other. I think this is the longest review I‚Äôve ever given but it was seriously that good!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,LOVED IT! We will definitely be back.

I have an extreme fear of dogs so Gloria and Stu devised a signal to let me know when the dog (mandy)was outand if i had plans to go somewhere during that time all i had to do was tect them. I never felt restrained from going about my business. After a day of visiting friends in town (right down the road) it was very refreshing to come back to these comfy quarters. I took advantage of their available snacks and the fridge to keep my drinks cold
I hope my stay was too hard on them. Im sure mandy is looking for company to play with her. I would definitely stay here again and refer friends family memners."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Gloria, Stu, and Mandy made my family including the kids feel like family and right at home! My 4 year old loved the fact that Mandy (the wonderful doggy) was waiting for her every morning at the front door! The kids loved the playground and I loved it just as much being that the yard was fenced in and they could play without my every second of attention needed! Found out Mandy loves baby bottles just as much as my now 2 year old and the kids and myself found it amusing seeing my 2 year old put her bottle down and Mandy quickly picked it up and tilted her head up to drink her milk and then walked along right next to my daughter holding it in her mouth all the way up to the front door where my daughter came to tattle on her lol at which time Mandy set it down right in front of me. It was as if Mandy was saying hey she left this on the ground have your human pick up after herself ;-)! It was adorable. We all enjoyed our stay very much and would definitely stay again."

The house is in a quiet area on the outskirts of Murray; just far enough to be out of the college traffic and noise, but close enough to enjoy all of Murray with a quick drive. The apartment was VERY clean and was equipped with everything we could ever need and so much more. They truly are nature host. We recommend this place to anyone wanting a quiet getaway or just passing through Murray."

2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Gloria and Stu's Airbnb is top notch. I am also an Airbnb host, so I know the hard work that goes into making a place stand out. Also, I am quite picky. Gloria and Stu's home is the nicest Airbnb I have stayed in. The space was spotless, the beds are so comfortable that my boys actually wanted to sleep in, and the yard is stunning and serene. Communication prior to and during our stay was fantastic. The home is located in a relaxing area of Murray. It is a great place to stay when visiting the Lakes, or when bringing your student to MSU, or just if you decide to come to Murray to get away from it all. My family knows where we will be staying when we return to Murray. Thank you Gloria and Stu!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Gloria is a wonderful hostess. She and her husband Stu made us feel right at home. My kids had a blast playing in the backyard. MSU holds a special place in my heart!

2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Would definitely recommend

2019-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Charm, hospitality and warm and cozy hosts!! Fun!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Gloria is a wonderful host! We really enjoyed our stay & all her thoughtfulness! Absolutely a great experience!
2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Went to Murray, KY for a personal matter and fortunately I was able to stay at harmony house. It was not difficult finding the home and the entry to the driveway is wide enough for parking. I was greeting by both Mrs. Gloria and Mr. Stuart and was given a tour of their home/apt. It was more than I could ask for; the rooms were clean, spacious and the bathroom was spacious as well. They are variety of amenities and plenty of food, snacks and drinks to choose from. The only regret I have was not staying longer to enjoy the patio and sleep in longer. The bed was very comfortable and the pillows are AMAZING! I definitely loved this place and would come back in a heartbeat."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable, great personal touch with informative insights to the area"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice! Very friendly and a great place

2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and nice people. Always a pleasure to stay at Harmony House.
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"2nd time staying was just as lovely as the first but even with more goodies in the cubbies and inside the fridge! It was a pleasant surprise to see it well stocked with fruits, condiments, oatmeal, and more coffee, and such. 10/10 again, well worth the price especially split with friends."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"10/10 Would Recommend!
Gloria and Stu went above and beyond to take care of our little family! They helped our stay go smoothly by providing healthy food in our fridge even before we got there! They gave us our privacy and were so welcoming.
The space is an apartment that is completely separate from the main part of their house. We had our own space and shared a wall, just like an apartment. Gloria and Stu are very quiet and I couldn‚Äôt hear them in their home at all. The apartment is constructed very solidly and I didn‚Äôt notice any creaking from the floor or anything that would wake our kids. We did let Gloria and Stu know that we are used to the air being set a little cooler than most other homes and they were able to accommodate our request quickly.
My husband met up with friends one night and called a local cab company from the house to Murray and back. It was only $10 each way.
I would recommend Harmony House to everyone!"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay in this lovely home. Gloria and Stu are gracious hosts and there were nice personal touches in the space. Hope to return in the future!
2019-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Gloria and her husband were absolutely amazing. we were running into issues with our hotel booking and they were super accommodating and let us book the same day. They were so welcoming and friendly that it felt like a second home. Gloria was kind enough to offer us her homegrown tomatoes as well as bring us fresh baked bread the next morning. If we ever need a place to stay in the area we plan on looking to see if we can stay at her place first before looking anywhere else. I highly suggest it, everything was clean and nice!"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"She‚Äôs so sweet and thoughtful! I highly suggest this place and if you get a chance, have a conversation with her! You will be surprised how good the conversation is!"

2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very quiet, calm rustic-feeling place. A great homey environment with plenty of great patio space and even better amenities, with a variety of teas, coffee, and small snacks. The grill really fancy and is a really nice plus although I didn't stay long enough to make use of it unfortunately."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gloria was a great host. We arrived very late at the first time but she stayed up to make sure we get into our place. She always responds right away if we ask any questions . The place is super clean and comfy. The patio was really nice too. And Gloria always offered us snacks And friits during the stay. Seriously, this is the best Airbnb experience we‚Äôve Ever had. 10 stars ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåü"

2019-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Gloria and Stu are very friendly. The place is attached to their house, but in a way that really separates the space, so it feels private. The bathroom was nice and clean, the beds were very comfortable and the living area was nice and well stocked."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Harmony House was everything publicized. It is a wonderful, clean place to stay. Gloria, the hostess, is extremely attentive and quick to respond. The little snacks and extras are unexpected little bonuses."

2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is a perfect get away, if you‚Äôre familiar with the area, you‚Äôre really close to the historic hazel, Murray (home of the racers) and even the lake! You can grill here and they have almost anything you need! Gloria is an excellent host definitely give this place a try!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Helpful, gracious, and friendly."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gloria and Stu have created an absolutely wonderful space, perfect for 1-2 people, with just about everything a guest could need. The 2-room+private bath combination gives ample space. And the kitchenette ‚Äúcloset‚Äù was fitted with microwave, fridge, hot drink tools/supplies and dishes/utensils. All the extra touches - snacks and water in fridge, spare toiletries, comfy throws, even a battery light in case of power outage ‚Äî just added to the experience. The patio with table outside the private rear entrance looks out over lovely yard and fields. This is a peace-filled, lovely spot with wonderful caring hosts, and not far at all from Murray. You won‚Äôt regret staying here!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was exactly as we expected! This home was so incredibly welcoming for our little anniversary getaway! There was nothing we needed that wasn‚Äôt thought of by our lovely hosts. Truly, every detail was considered! The trolleys made it super convenient to get the kayaks to the lake and it was an easy trek there. We enjoyed the hot tub several times - made even better by the plush towels & robes. We really loved the atmosphere created in that space! The front porch is the perfect place to read a book with a glass of wine and the tiny lights on. I can‚Äôt say enough about the mattress and bedding!!! It was like falling into heaven at the end of a full day!
Our only regret is that we didn‚Äôt have more time. We will be back often! We‚Äôve already told all of our friends and family about this place, so I expect they‚Äôll book up soon."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved staying with Lily and Paul! Home was adorable, clean, and well provisioned. The hosts clearly take pride in providing an exceptional experience"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The house was perfect for our weekend stay in Murray. We were in town for a wedding, and the house was close to town but also the venue. Great for traveling with pets. I also liked that the Netflix was complimentary."

2024-04-01,4,Group trip,Such a very nice place to stay. So close to Murray State University which was perfect for us as we were visiting our son for Easter. The house is very close to a very busy intersection which would make getting in and out of the driveway a bit tricky if you had more than one car. The house was very clean with a nice big frontroom and as well as a large eating area. The kitchen had everything we needed but a toaster which we managed fine by using the oven. We had wonderful weather and would have liked an outdoor space to enjoy while we were there. A patio with a grill would have been awesome. Our teenage boys would have liked a TV in the second bedroom for additional viewing options. We would definitely stay here again! Thank you!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lily was a fantastic host. I would recommend her to anyone. Kind and responsive.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location (close to Murray State, nice house, very clean. Thank you for being a great host!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed the house and the very professional attitude of Paul and Lily. They were very friendly yet also highly professional. The house was inviting and clean, and we woke up happy every day. Our son studies at Murray State University, and together with him we visited his favorite places and saw a lot of the surrounding area. The house was a great base for this. We hope to be able to visit him and the house again in the future! Jack & Coletta, The Netherlands"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time here! The house was very toddler-friendly; our daughter was able to happily crawl around the place without us worrying too much about exposed outlets or tipping furniture (we kept an eye on her at all times but we didn‚Äôt have to do a ton of work to keep her safe, if that makes sense)."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time we stay at their place and like last time, we enjoyed, thank you so much for your everything"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay at one of Lily's properties. This house was the perfect size for my son and I while he attended an event at Murray State University. It is on a noisy/busy intersection but the proximity to MSU and everything else in town was worth it this trip.

2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The house is lovely and was perfect for our needs--a girls' weekend of antiquing and hanging out. The only suggestions we had were that having more toilet paper on hand for 4-5 guests for a two-night stay would have been helpful. Additionally, a larger coffee maker for that number of guests would be great as well. The beds were comfortable and the kitchen had the things we needed. There was a little trouble with the coded door, but the owners were very responsive, and it was quickly rectified. I love the addition of the sectional sofa, which was not in the photos. It provided better seating for the family room than the pictured couch."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great stay. House was very clean and our host Lily was great with responding to messages. Highly recommend.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great home, would stay again!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"So thankful to Lily and Paul for allowing my family to stay at their home. The space is cozy with items well appointed and not cluttered about, the kitchen is well equipped, the separate and spacious laundry area is convenient and roomy (also great for extra storage for suitcase and whatnot), and the couch is dangerously comfortable. I felt ‚Äúat home‚Äù here. I travel for work and settled easily into the space. I enjoyed the dining nook and the generous amount of natural light. The space felt bright and fresh. For any travel nurse heading to Murray, you will be fortunate to book this space for the minutes commute to Murray Calloway County Hospital, and the hosts thought of everything to make your stay easy and comfy. Restaurants are good and some great! The dog park and arboretum are a very short drive from the house, and your doggie and kiddos will appreciate both locations. I moved to another home hosted by Lily and Paul, and this one is fantastic, too! 5 stars for both!"

The house had everything we needed, and was much more comfortable than cramming the family in a hotel room. I would definitely recommend this place if your travels bring you to Murray!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved our stay at Lily and Paul's! It's in a great location close to Murray State. The house has everything you might need. It was so nice to be able to bring our dog. We'll be back in the very near future.

The home was amazing. Simple open air layout. Cook dinner and watch the tv while your brain goes into shutdown mode. Very convenient, minutes from town but you don‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre minutes from town. Peaceful neighborhood. Noisiest thing in the morning was the rattle of my diesel engine pulling out of the driveway. The decor was excellent, simple without being over the top. Just felt comfortable.
Wish I could‚Äôve booked it again for the rest of our time working here but just didn‚Äôt work out. If I‚Äôm ever back up this way I will definitely look into staying here again."

2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed at Jonathan's studio for one night while travelling. Let me tell you, the word studio does not give the place justice. This was so roomy and so cozy it is perfect for a romantic getaway. We got in late but was able to get in with the code, no problem! The house has everything that you need, cooking utensils, pots and pans, coffee maker and they provide some single serve kcups. The bed was comfortable and so was the couch. This place is close to the Land Between the Lakes recreation area and would be a perfect place to stay to hunt, fish, or head to Patti's 1880s Settlement."

The studio setup is spacious, with a lovely bathroom and huge shower, plus washer and dryer and well-equipped kitchen. I could see this as a perfect spot for a longer-term stay, and it was great for our five night stay, too. We‚Äôll be back if we‚Äôre ever back in Murray!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Me and my son and sphynx kitty drove up from Ga to visit family for fall break and stayed the week here. This is ‚Äúhome‚Äù for us.

The area around the house and the neighborhood is beautiful and very quiet, and they have provided comfortable seating outside to enjoy the outdoors. The inside is cute but modern and is well stocked with a full kitchen and large bathroom. The bed and couch are very comfortable as well. They even sent me their website with suggestions of things to do around town. I went on one of the walking trails they suggested and it was very nice. Such a nice place with great hosts. I will stay here again if I am ever in the area."

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. The house has a comfy king size bed, a really nice shower, and plenty of space. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook some simple meals. We visited in the heat of summer and were pleasantly surprised by very high quality AC. The house also has very fast internet, which we heard from some locals is not common in the area. Check in and check out was easy and communication was great."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This house is amazing! Super clean, wonderfully decorated, comfortable furniture, amazing bathroom... everything! Quiet and relaxing for a weekend getaway for sure.
Murray is close by for all conveniences, and Land Between the Lakes is a great spot for hiking, exploring and swimming.
Johnathan is a great host and I would not hesitate to come back!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great week in Hutchinson. My toddlers loved playing on the path and with the rocks. Hubby enjoyed the back patio for grilling. The older boys appreciated the spacious living room and the TV. I liked the layout of the house and the two patios that gave us a space for the twins to play safely while my husband cooked on the other one. The location is ideal for going to the dam or into town or to the Lake.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. There was places to eat close by. Super quiet and clean! Would stay again if we were in the area! Highly recommend!

2021-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Jonathan & Megan were the kindest, most responsive AirBNB owners we‚Äôve ever dealt with. We stayed at their house for an entire month while we were house-hunting and absolutely loved it! Super clean, spacious, comfortable, quiet and private - everything we could hope for during a stay of that length of time. The bed was super comfortable, the kitchen was well stocked with all the supplies we needed for cooking our meals each day, the shower had nice hot water, the AC units worked fantastically and were super quiet, the laundry room eliminated the need for us to go to a laundromat during our stay. And the patio out front was perfect for sitting in the shade and relaxing every afternoon. We would sit and listen to all the birds and watch the woodchucks come out of the wooded area to nibble on clover. It was so peaceful and relaxing. Even our dog didn‚Äôt want to leave at the end of our stay! If you like peace & quiet, if you are a clean freak like me, and if you love to cook, this is definitely the place to stay. Out in the country but real close to the 641 to get to wherever you need to go. You won‚Äôt be disappointed!üëçüèª"

2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A wonderfully quiet retreat with lots of windows and double doors. On cool nights it was wonderful to fall asleep to the sound of the crickets and wake up with the chirping birds! Open the windows and enjoy God‚Äòs beauty üå∑

This was our second stay, and it won‚Äôt be our last üòÄ"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was just what I needed for spring break! We were able to take some great day trips, and also spent a day exploring Murray. The spot was secluded enough to be really peaceful, but was close enough to get out and do things as well. I really enjoyed the brewery in town, Hop Hound! Jonathan was a great host, and very responsive to messages. I cannot recommend highly enough, and am thinking of planning another stay to do the things I missed this time."

It's fully equipped with anything you might need while you're there. You're a few miles from the grocery store and there is a convenience store (Dollar General) not far. There's a nearby church. You're not far at all from the Bison and Buffalo Preserve and other Kentucky Lake sights. I would highly recommend staying here. We had a wonderful 10 days there.

2020-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The Burkeen‚Äôs space (as many other reviewers have said) is so much larger and cuter than expected - it was perfect for two because of the studio setup, but certainly had the space, amenities, and supplies for plenty! It was so nice having the quiet back and side yard areas which were perfect for the dogs, and we kept the windows open at night to enjoy the nature sounds. We were there two weeks and they saw to whatever was needed for a long stay. Thanks!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Quiet and private! Spacious and comfy for one couple. King size bed is comfortable. Pet friendly is a great perk!

2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jonathan and Megan's house is absolutely gorgeous and was perfect for our socially distant family vacation. Spacious, clean, well decorated home with outstanding appliances and amenities. The washer and dryer, king-sized bed, Keurig and huge TV made it feel like we were in a fancy hotel. The quiet, peaceful time spent on the porch was priceless. We spent the days at Kentucky Dam Beach and the nights either cooking in the big kitchen or trying the local food. My husband, son, pup and I could not be more grateful."

2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was wonderful! Loved everything about this place! The shower was awesome. Enjoyed lots of porch time and although there are houses around they are plenty far enough away. House is set next to a wooded area so it feels like you're out in the country but you are still very close to town. We recommend taking the side roads into town as the drive is beautiful! Everything you need to cook, which we did."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Peaceful location with a nice covered patio.
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely adored the house and our stay! House was spotless which is super important to me. It felt very comfortable and like home away from home. Would absolutely recommend staying here & will do so myself next time I visit the area.

His place is as incredible as all of the great reviews! It is clean and beautiful and spacious! I would definitely stay here again!!! One of the best!"
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you to the Burkeens! This studio has a stylish interior with plenty of room to spread out and relax. The wifi router has ports for wired connections if you require it, and the directly overhead shower is almost worth booking the studio on its own."
2020-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"I cannot say enough about this home. I know the reviews are great, but even reading them (and this) will leave you amazed at how great the space is, how accommodating the owners are, how serene the environment is, and how much you‚Äôll enjoy staying there. It was my favorite Air B&B ever and I‚Äôve stayed in some on vistas overlooking oceans. While there‚Äôs nothing that can compare to a seaside environment in Murray, KY, being in this Air B&B was so refreshing, calm, and comfortable that it did not feel at all as though I were away from home. There definitely cannot be a better place to stay in the area!"
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed our stay very much. It was quiet, spacious-feeling, well-supplied, good shower and bed...and it didn't hurt that there were muffins! Communication was excellent. The space heaters were a little off-putting at first and had a bit of a learning curve to their operation, but they were very effective and the gas fireplace gave an extra special ambiance to the place!
Claire"
2019-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Two thumbs up! Extremely clean and comfortable.
2019-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jonathan and his home are simply the best. Everything was present at the home needed for a great stay- and then some. It's located close to every spot you could possibly want to go to in Murray and is very peaceful. The house is cozy and adequately heated. Furthermore if help was needed, Jonathan answered us extremely quickly. He is very forward about what he expects from his guests as well, although this is really nothing. Simply be a clean and respectful person and you'll be set. Can't say thank you enough for this wonderful home."
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great spot at an amazing price. Our stay was peaceful and very pleasant. The studio is very well decorated and outfitted; we lacked for nothing. The hosts are very easy to communicate with and went out of their way to accommodate us. We recommend it most highly and would be very happy to return.
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect little place close to Murray but you get to enjoy wide open fields and a creek nearby. Super stylish and spacious, comfortable bed and couch, great bathroom. Would definitely stay here again!"

2024-03-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"The place was clean and nice and in a great location. However, the listing did not make it clear how much of a shared space it was and that there was someone living in the attached residence. There was even a door to the other residence from our bedroom which was unsettling (we put a chair under the doorknob for comfort). We didn't have any problems and the other residence was quiet, but we weren't looking for a shared space and probably would have stayed elsewhere had we known."
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place, comfortable beds."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We are so very very grateful to Scott for providing a place for us to stay! He has been very accommodating, quick to reply to questions, and we will always recommend this place to friends and family when they come visit."

We love the outdoor table for enjoying dinner outside in the fall! The TV is also equipped with plenty of apps to watch with fast internet for streaming.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Scott has been fantastic! We needed a place for an extended stay after our house received some damage, and he has been gracious to provide the fully furnished house! I am so very thankful! He even let me know we could go ahead and check in early which was huge for us. He was so kind and prompt to reply when we had questions.
We love the space, I'm especially in love with the outdoor table so we can eat dinner outside more often and enjoy the perfect fall weather! The bathroom is very nicely designed, and the deep farm house sinks throughout the house are now on my rebuild shopping list!
We will be staying here again throughout our rebuild, and after that we will encourage family to stay here and skip the hotels forevermore!
Thank you thank you thank you!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you need a place to stay in Murray, this is the place to stay! My daughter was getting married in Murray so we opted for this rental versus a hotel. Beautiful and close to anything you might need. Kitchen was great, beds were very comfortable, and the outside living areas were an added bonus."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great location and very comfortable stay. The main bedroom is very well done and comfortable. Mattress is a bit firm. Living space is great to hangout with access to the TV. Bathroom well stocked and even had a towel warmer! The only thing I didn't love was the shared laundry area between the two units wouldn't lock on our side. I would recommend allowing your guests to lock that door. Also, be careful when backing out of the shared driveway, the neighbor sometimes parks near the middle of the driveway and it's hard to see. Overall a great experience!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice location for Murray: convenient to the university and the town square.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay while visiting our son during his GSP program at Murray University. Scott's place is quiet, comfortable, and very clean.

ONE of the THREE TVs were not connected to the wifi so you weren‚Äôt able to use it. I did find some hair throughout the house that was not my own. Bundles of very curly hair. Additionally, If you like HIGH pressured showers. This is the place for you. I found it to be too much pressure but it is better than low pressure, that is for sure! The hosts are very responsive.

2023-03-01,3,Group trip,"I rented the place for five people yet there were towels for four, and no extra linens for the fifth person. Luckily, my roommates were still home and I could tell them to bring their own pillow, sheets, blanket and towel. The cold water faucet handle was broken in the kitchen sink, so no cold water there. The coffee pot was dirty and had an old moldy filter still in it. The back of the stove had not been cleaned. The microwave was also dirty. There was a raisin stuck in the rug. Other than the lack of cleanliness. The beds are comfortable and it‚Äôs nicely decorated. I would not stay there again. This is not the type of place I am used to.

Good location for us while in Murray. Waaaay better than a hotel room for the same money! Quiet street and the police station around the corner. Seems like a safe area.

2020-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Matt's place is newly remodeled and has great curb appeal. Easy access with doorcode and a nice open concept in kitchen/ livingroom. Simple yet tasteful decor throughout. Comfortable bedding/ pillows, would have been nice to have an extra blanket to cover with. Plenty of fluffy soft absorbent towels provided but no shampoo/ conditioner. Luckily I brought some along. Washer/ dryer was nice to have on site. Would definitely stay here again and recommend to others!"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely the best place to stay in town. Wonderful location and a ton of bang for your buck. Matt is an amazing host and the property is beautiful with easy check in, great parking, and tons of space to relax. So clean and well decorated. Couldn't have been happier.

2020-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I lived in Matt‚Äôs house for one month, It was amazing. Nice house with the most amenities u need. Matt‚Äôs place near to Downtown which is wonderful location he has. But there is a one note: the blanket It‚Äôs not comfortable. I wish Matt will deal with that later."
2019-12-01,5,Group trip,Both places were very clean and so adorable! Our wedding guests were so pleased! Location is very convenient and safe. I would highly recommend these apartments over a hotel!! 5 stars!!
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have enjoyed staying with Matt. Look forward to future stays.
2019-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed in one of Matt's units in this building back in the summer (unit ""B""). At the time they were still finishing out the unit we stayed at this time (unit ""A""). Much like unit ""B"", the place was a great value for the price given the size, privacy of separate bedrooms and convenience of the kitchen and having a washer and dryer. This particular unit did have a couple things still left to finish out (hallway/linen closet wasn't fully finished, light fixture cover in one of the bedrooms wasn't installed and there weren't very many dishes - mainly missed having coffee mugs), but none of these really impacted our stay and I'm sure these things will be finished up in no time. Any of these three units are a wonderful alternative to a hotel room and for the price offer so much more space, convenience and privacy. These will probably continue to be our ""go to"" places to stay whenever we come to Murray."
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is stylish, and we always love staying at Matt‚Äôs places. He is a great host and the furnishings are wonderful."

2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was very comfortable and the host was very responsive to any concerns. Nice appliances and a washing machine+dryer makes a difference when you're away from home. The locking front door with a key code was very comforting too. No keys to worry about.

2018-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"If you plan on coming to stay here and party late or if you want a place you can trash, look elsewhere. This apartment is nice inside, and before I checked in, I was told that there have been issues with guests leaving the apartment very dirty. We were also told to keep it down at 10:30PM on a Friday night by the gentleman who lives in the next unit and we weren‚Äôt even playing music or talking that loudly.
It‚Äôs a nice place but the owner(s) are quite particular so if you just need a place to stay, and you don‚Äôt plan on having conversation just above a normal volume late at night, you‚Äôll enjoy this apartment.
The interior is very well done and modern. Had everything we needed. Would stay again."

2023-01-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"We spoke with Danielle about the Wi-Fi wouldn‚Äôt let us login and she told us she wasn‚Äôt coming over to fix it because of the last review we left, which was about a problem we was having when trying to login on tv. Stove didn‚Äôt work but maintenance came out to fix quickly. Freezer didn‚Äôt get cold enough to freeze ice nor did the refrigerator keep our beverages cold..
Occupants upstairs walked hard all day and night which was really a problem but we were already booked so we dealt with it..
We used our phones for entertainment because we couldn‚Äôt login in to the Hosts Wi-Fi and we lost food.
Not a pleasant experience & Hosts showed no compassion.
We came 9 hours to watch our daughter play basketball for Murray State University and we were treated poorly..
Will not book again or refer"

I called and someone was out within the hour to fix! It was a great find for our 1st AirBNB stay! We will definitely be back when visiting family in Murray again! Thank you for your hospitality!
2023-05-01,3,Group trip,"The place is cute and very close to campus but that was the extent of the good. First impression when we walked in-- the house has an unpleasant older home smell. Then, there were a lot of tiny ants on the kitchen counter, which did not make it appealing to use. Also, the A/C did not seem to be working -even after turning it down to 62, the temperature was still reading 75, which made for an uncomfortable night's sleep. The beds were super firm/hard, which also added to the discomfort/lack of sleep. And a few significant details had been overlooked such as there being almost no toilet paper left when we got there so that ran out early (no spare roll anywhere). And no coffee filters to go with the coffee pot. Finally, there wasn't even one additional mirror outside of the bathroom. It's very difficult for a family of 4 or 5 to get ready with one tiny mirror in the bathroom. I tried messaging Danielle about some of these concerns and she never responded."

Always appreciate of Airbnb owners that are dog friendly so thank you for that! Sidewalks make walking great. There is also park nearby Arboretum which was great! Thanks Danielle.
