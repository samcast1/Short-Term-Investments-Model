2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at Hailee’s was awesome. I was here for business, when I have to return will definitely be trying to stay here again. It’s right in the middle of downtown with in walking distance of a lot of great places."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely apartment with all the comforts possible in a convenient location.
Easy check-in and communication with the owner very fast and accurate.
It was a pleasure staying with you"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"had a wonderful stay, would come again! hailee is awesome!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Hailee took very seriously our arrival at her place. She communicated clearly all the instructions and checked through messages on us all along our stay. The place is perfectly furnished and has a very nice wooden floor. I definitely recommend it.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very convenient location to everything. Nice downtown setting. Close to great restaurants. Will stay there again.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at Hailee's place while in Columbus for a conference. The place was nice, clean, comfortable and within walking distance of the conference center and German Village. The only issue I had during my stay was Saturday evening when some sort of outdoor concert seemed to be going on in the neighborhood and continued until after midnight. Otherwise it was a quiet, nice stay."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, comfortable, well-located. Hailee’s instructions were complete, concise, and made everything easy. Thank you Hailee."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Hailee's place was very convenient to all the downtown action. I felt very safe and secure with all the different codes and fob to get into the building. All the rooms were very clean and modern. I believe the bathroom was somewhat under some updates as the towel holder was not present and none of the outlets worked in there...but all the others in the home worked so it wasn't a big deal. Would definitely stay here again.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"nice place, location can be difficult to find but the host puts in more than enough work to help you find it."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I just want to start off with a HUGE thank you to Haliee and Shan! I had originally rented another Airbnb with a different host and it was a complete nightmare and I almost gave up on my Anniversary trip but Hailee and Shan accommodated my boyfriend and I the same night I got to Columbus and it turned my entire trip back around! The space smelled and looked clean and the bed was so so comfortable! They gifted us with their hospitality and I couldn’t be more thankful. Thank you Hailee and Shan for a 5 Star Stay❤️.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hailee was super accommodating and even let us check in a little early since our flight landed early in the morning! The apartment was great and in a perfect location in downtown Columbus, would definitely stay here again!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hailee’s place was nice and clean (full kitchen and bath, washer and dryer). She’s responsive and a kind host!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Lots of local bars within walking distance. Quick tip about the washer, always put on quick wash and then when it’s finished washing put it on spin mode only to get all of the water out of your clothes. Lastly, for the dryer put it on bulk bedding so that it completely dries your clothes in one setting. Overall a great stay for the price and location. I would highly recommend without any reservations. Hailee was a great host and thanks for having me."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great value close to downtown. I attended a conference at the convention center and hotels were really expensive due to I’m sure an OSU home game that weekend so this AirBnB, while it required a short drive to the convention center, was still a great value. I appreciated the clear instructions for where to park and how to access the key fob to get into the building. It also includes free parking in a lot across the street which is a bonus in a city."
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hailee is super responsive and helpful. I provided some feedback regarding my stay (a couple of minor things that needed to be fixed in the bathroom) and as she was throughout the booking process etc., she responded in less than 30 minutes. A number of my friends were staying at AirBnB's in the area, but none had the great host like Hailee!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The location of this place is awesome, As you make transition from the different areas of the downtown area and the Columbus area walking is a fantastic option . will stay again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I would definitely stay here again! The host was extremely helpful and responsive. The check in instructions were excellent and gave all the information necessary to check in with no issues. The space was clean and cozy.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful stay! Clear instructions, super homey, great vibe, and cool building. Really great location- so close to everything. Would 100% stay here again & recommend it to those visiting Columbus :)"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and comfortable bed! Very clean. Would stay there again.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect spot for us! Instructions on parking and finding the apartment were very helpful. Parking was in a very convenient location. The building is very nice, clean, and quiet. Our stay was very peaceful, one morning we found ourselves asleep until almost noon, completely out of character for us 😂 I would 100% stay here again if we plan another trip in the area."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Loved this place. Very nice to sit and relax. Beautiful Music and food right around the corner.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Overall, I had a lovely stay - the hosts were flexible with my arrival time and very responsive throughout my time in the space. I stayed for over two weeks on a business trip, so access to laundry and a kitchen was a huge benefit. The building is also very secure and safe, and the area well situated among some great restaurants and bars."

2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,It was very easy to get to and park. They are easy and quick to get a hold of. We did have a problem throughout the night but that was out of their control and more of the building’s problem. We enjoyed our stay!!

Also all directions are clear and there is also video tutorials which helped tremendously. They exceeded my expectations with a water pitcher in the fridge as well as ice (it’s the little things that made this such a fantastic stay) I have no complaints!!!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was just as described. The pictures are exactly how the place looks, down to the direction the blanket is laid on the bed. It was a great stay, It was cheaper than a hotel for the weekend and super private. We really enjoyed that the Axe Throwing place was just downstairs. The apartment was quiet and clean. It felt like home. It was within a mile of nationwide area where we attended a concert and there are many places you can eat within walking distances. Thank you for being a great host and checking in on us!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hailee was a great host, communicating everything very clearly before check in. The apartment is in a great location, and it was very helpful to have a parking spot included. Everything was clean and comfortable--a great stay!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place with an amazing host!! 10/10 recommend and will be coming back!!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I enjoyed staying at this Airbnb, everything was very clean and accessible, with a surprising amount of space (enough to workout). Great location, right around the corner from Little Palace! Columbus-wise, this is a very central location— short drive/cheap uber to anything you need to go to.
Small snacks, coffee/tea, and Brita filter are much appreciated! Plus a very soft makeup removal washcloth. There’s a good amount of closet space to store your personal items out of the way.
There are two key-fob entrances to go through before getting to the unit, which provides additional safety. The lock on the door to the apartment is 4-digit code. There is no deadbolt or additional lock, so I brought a travel lock with me since I was traveling alone. My generic travel lock worked just fine!
Thank you Hailee, I loved your unit! It made me feel right at home. Xx"

The Columbus suburbs were quaint with lots to do. We will definitely be booking this place again in the future. Thank you Simon!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved the garden villa! The bed was one of the most comfortable beds I’ve ever slept on and we also enjoyed the one person tub outside and the garden with the outdoor dining area. Whole Foods is close by so it was easy to bring back food and eat outside . For restaurants we recommend The Refectory. When we are in the area again we would love to return.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely and quiet location for our short get away. Upscale everything.

We highly recommend the Garden Villa!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Villa was very clean & nice. We enjoyed our stay!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Garden Villa was even better than expected! We were able to totally relax in the area we were in and The Villa seemed to just be a little haven away from the hustle of nearby activities. We had a ton of snow dump on us overnight our 2nd night there which transformed the look to a beautiful winter wonderland. Simon warned us the snow was coming and advised us to park at the top of the hill leading down to The Garden Villa. We heeded his advice and were very grateful for the information. He was extremely proactive and prevented what could have been a difficult situation for us the next day as we were attending a conference in the morning. We are trying to come up with a good reason to visit in warmer weather simply because our stay was so enjoyable! There were so many windows yet we were able to enjoy total privacy once the blinds were closed. I cannot recommend this highly enough. Thank you for making this a great, long weekend Simon. Stay here, you won’t be disappointed!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay at the Garden Villa! Very clean, and was exactly as the pictures looked and how it was described in the listing. Great place for a staycation if you already live in the Columbus area and are looking for somewhere comfortable and private to relax at."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Na
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If your looking for a relaxing stay I highly recommend staying at this guesthouse. It’s close to the amenities of Dublin and Worthington, and an easy drive from 270, but still provides a private oasis. The gardens are beautiful, even in the winter, and they provide a peaceful setting.
Simon was great to work with and the suite is luxurious. His listing notes the King bed with a 12 in thick mattress and ThermaRest pillows … I have to say this was one of the most comfortable beds I’ve slept on. The sheets are super soft too. I also loved the hand soap, a small detail, but it made me feel pampered. This AirB&B is a hidden gem, and I will definitely stay here again."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a great time staying at Simons place! He was very proactive in sharing updates/reminders and offering support and the space was just as beautiful as the pictures even in the winter.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The perfect stay for our incredible trip to the area.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect spot for couples! It’s private, clean, near a lot of wonderful restaurants, and central for visiting the attractions of Columbus. The host was proactive in making sure we were taken care of and safe, even providing us a different spot to park so we wouldn’t be impacted by an upcoming snowstorm. I highly recommend this spot to anyone looking for a Romantic getaway!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was tucked away from a busy road with a beautiful glen of trees. It was quiet and private even with huge windows. It was easy to find and a perfect place for two people looking to get away for a while!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Definitely would recommend & will rebook in the future
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, clean and elegant! Perfect for our introverted holiday getaway. Would love to stay again in the summer!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was great. So close to so many places to go out and enjoy yourself at. Very comfortable bed too.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was beautiful and peaceful. Just what me and my wife needed. The villa was clean and cozy and met all of our needs. I'd recommend this place for anyone looking to get away.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful & comfortable spot with simple & practical style. So much appreciation for having this option while traveling for end-of-year festivities. Book with assurance!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A solid 5 start rating is well-deserved in this case. The Villa is exactly as described, super clean and had everything we needed. Simon was the most responsive of all hosts we have ever had. Keep in mind that it is 550 square feet of space - so don't expect something bigger. But, that said it was perfect for us. Everything is high end and well thought out: bed, furniture, decor, linens and towels, tv and all kitchenette accessories. Everything we needed was available. Very quiet and peaceful spot and the right location for what we planned on doing and we will be back for sure. Thanks Simon for providing a memorable experience."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic time! This was our last babymoon trip and we were extremely happy and satisfied with Simon's listing. It was beautiful this time of year but we could only imagine how gorgeous and pretty it is during the blooming months to see all the plants outside and also enjoy the outside amenities. We even saw some wildlife, deer, close by in the side yard. Definitely picturesque! The inside was crisp, clean, and cozy giving off a warm, homey vibe. All the amenities were great, easy to use and high quality.
Location wise, it was easy to get to and very close a big area with restaurants, shopping, malls, etc while also being ~15 minutes away from the downtown. This made it easy to find some delicious food, explore the Zoo's Wildlights and visit COSI.
Simon's communication before, during and faster was fantastic. They made everything so easy and responded quickly.
One of our favorite airbnb's thus far! High recommend!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful space. Simon was extremely helpful and communicative. Would definitely stay here again.
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a wonderful stay! My boyfriend and I had a great time and we didn’t want to go home. The place was clean and felt very homey. The WiFi was a bit difficult at times but it didn’t take away from the lovely time we had there. We will definitely come back and stay longer!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What an amazing place! Completely beat my expectations and we will be back for another special visit in the future !
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"From the time I booked my trip, until I checked out, everything about this place was so perfect. Simon was super friendly, helpful, and extremely organized. I really appreciate how much thought he put into every single detail. The bed and pillows were so comfortable, the place was spotless, everything looked brand new, and it was really peaceful. Can't say enough good things about my entire experience here and I look forward to visiting again"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Simon was an excellent host in all of the categories. The Villa on his property at which I stayed, is wonderful. It's in a great little green space and was a perfect fit for my to get away for some time to myself.
Thank you Simon, I will recommend your place to my friends and family."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved this space! Pretty scenery, and such a comfortable space. The guesthouse itself is pretty small and intimate. One thing I noticed was that privacy is limited. The bathroom has a door but, the ceiling doesn’t touch so the bathroom feels a little open concept."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Simon's place was really nice. Very clean and close to the city. Excited to come back during the summer when everything is in bloom!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A gorgeous and intimate stay for two! My fiancé and I enjoyed a long weekend at The Garden Villa to celebrate our recent engagement. The property is tucked away on the edge of a gorgeous country club surrounded by trees and wildlife. We enjoyed the sounds of birds and other creatures rustling around the leaves during our stay. The inside of the property was absolutely immaculate, by far the cleanest property I have had the pleasure to stay at. The bed was comfortable, the linens were clean, and amenities were easily accessible. The gem of the stay is for sure the outdoor clawfoot tub! What a dream it was relaxing in a private bath outdoor in nature. The host Simon was extremely responsive and offered great local recommendations. The property is equipped with Ring door sensors but it did not feel invasive and did not impact our stay in any way. We would definitely return to this property when in need of a quiet weekend away. Thank you again to the host Simon!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had an extremely comfortable stay. The space was spotless, extremely well appointed, and the garden is pure magic. We would love to stay again when we are in town. Highly recommend."

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was nice and beautiful, not as big as I thought. Place was right next to a big house, felt like I was being watched. A kid came and blew leaving all around the place while we were there."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a beautiful and peaceful place to stay. I’m from Columbus and wanted to get away from the kids without going too far. Simon’s villa perfectly fit our needs. Near great restaurants and entertainment. Very clean. Wonderful updated villa. Perfect space for a couple looking to enjoy peace and time away!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our time at the garden villa! The property is absolutely stunning. The interior space is so cozy and thoughtfully designed. A hidden escape that felt like a living painting.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Simon is the best host we have ever had. This may sound weird, but we grew to love him because of his kindness, attentiveness, patience, good vibes & energy, and how professional he was. He is so inspiring for so many reasons. We had a small wedding ceremony at his villa 10/10, and it was everything we could have dreamed of, plus more. We are still on a high from it all. Simon now has a special place in our hearts forever. He made us feel so special & comfortable the entire time. His photography skills are top-notch. He knows what he is doing.
The Garden Villa is hands down the best airbnb/place we have ever stayed at, and we travel a lot. It's so private & peaceful. Everything was so plush and immaculate. The design of the villa from the inside to the scenery outside is like something out of a magazine SOOO BEAUTIFUL. We loved everything about it!!! We are currently out of town celebrating my wife's birthday & can't stop talking about our experience at The Villa. THANK YOU SIMON ♥️"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Simon was very friendly and helpful, plus the place was beautiful"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely gorgeous property! Easy and clean stay!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the first time I have used Airbnb, my husband and I wanted to take a couple days away for our 1 year anniversary. I honestly thought the pictures were too good to be true but The Garden Villa was a dream. I loved walking out every morning to the fountains and the atmosphere. The location is inside the property of a golf course which was odd when we first pulled in, but past that you never think about it. That being said, you will need to drive to go places but we never drove more than 15 minutes. The bridge district and zoo were both close, plus countless restaurants and shops. We are thinking about booking again next year because it was so perfect.
The hosts are very responsive, we had a small issue with the tv remote battery being dead and they came down and fixed it within minutes.
The villa was very clean and the only thing it lacked was a lightning cable on the charger dock provided."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a lovely, peaceful, and romantic time in a gorgeous and private setting. The private patio and outdoor tub were beautiful as were the fountains, garden, and pond. Owner was incredibly responsive and flexible and provided detailed and helpful instructions. The guest house is pristine and beautifully constructed and an absolute treat to stay in. We were grateful for a restful get-a-way in the midst of a work trip."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our second stay at the villa! Very peaceful and quiet. Perfect for a romantic weekend away.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The grounds and the villa itself were beautiful. The villa was incredibly clean and comfortable. Amenities like the Bluetooth speaker and multi-port USB charger were a very nice touch. We used this Villa as a comfortable and relaxing break in between a Clipper's baseball game, visiting the Zoo and Botanical Gardens, and exploring Worthington and the Dublin Bridge district. The villa was in a great location for everything that we wanted to do. Thank you for a very nice stay!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a beautiful gem, it felt like we had left the city completely. Very peaceful and lots of privacy. Pristine interior with a beautiful layout.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was absolutely magical for my 1st anniversary with my boyfriend. The gardens were gorgeous and the house was private and peaceful. Since it’s close to the Dublin Bridge, there was lots to do in town! Simon was also very responsive during our entire stay."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay with easy access to everything the Dublin area has to offer. Simon was a great host and the place was very clean and just of the beaten path but in a private setting.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This Villa is even more beautiful in person! The gardens are lovely, and the aromas from the botanicals are pleasantly fragrant.

He communicated clearly. I couldn’t be more pleased with our stay!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This villa is beautiful. Modern, cozy, and so clean. We loved having a quite, private garden space but being so close to so many restaurants and shopping venues.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a must stay. My bf and I came in for the weekend to get away from home. The area is perfect. It is in a perfect location to go to downtown or enjoy the surrounding area. The villa is well maintained and is private. The bed was absolutely amazing and we slept great. After being in the hustle and bustle of the city life, it was nice to come the villa that sets back in a wooded area and just relax. Simon gave great instructions and checked in with us to make sure we made it ok. Very great host. Will definitely book again"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and serene place! The garden could use some tending to (currently some dead branches and bushes) and a lot of rules to follow including a hefty cleaning protocol. Wi-Fi and TV streaming did not work well. Overall, would recommend for a short stay."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I enjoyed a very peaceful & restful time here. Lots to see and do nearby as well. Simon is very responsive and does a great job of communication. We really enjoyed our stay!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Garden Villa is a beautiful and tranquil hideaway. The property looked exactly like the photographs. The garden was picturesque and the villa itself is immaculately clean and welcoming.
As a host, Simone is one of the best! He left information for food, entertainment, shopping, and recreation. He is also very proactive and attentive from the time you make the reservation until you leave the villa. Lastly, Simon is timely with responding to questions and/or concerns. I would definitely love revisit this beautiful sanctuary in the future."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What an amazing place to stay. The villa was so fun to stay at. A great place to just stay in and relax or go outside and sit and enjoy the peace. Plenty to do within a 10-20 min drive. Will definitely be staying here again

It had all the amenities we needed, including an ironing board and bathroom scale!
Simon is a very responsive host and we enjoyed the quiet serenity of the property.
I highly recommend this hidden gem that was also conveniently near so many places for walking, shopping and dining.
Simon had a list of places to go and to see, which was thoughtful and helpful.
We look forward to returning again!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"very clean and overall satisfied with our stay. a few caveats I didn't know until arriving. parking is tight, location is on a golf course so you can't walk around or explore. outside lights are on a timer and turn off after 10:30 pm so you're forced to either leave or go inside. there was a grill in the picture but there wasn't one when we got there. lastly it showed an outside tub however there are special instructions that you have to contact the host prior to using which isn't a big deal but a minor inconvenience."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My husband and I stayed here for our anniversary and the place was Incredibly clean and beautiful! Simon was very responsive and friendly! Would stay here again!♥️

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great space and great hosts would 1000% recommend!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Villa was just what we needed, a quiet getaway spot. It was easy to check in, and cozy for what we needed.
The internet is there, maybe not the best, but also not the main point of being in such a beautiful spot. And this place is slightly harder than some to get delivery to, but the host has specific recommendations ahead of time for that which worked excellently when we tried it.
Everything was very clean, very comfortable. The bed was super comfortable! They did a good job making such a compact space feel bigger with the high ceilings and lots of natural light (but also the ability to cover most windows, so the best of both worlds). Location is a very short drive to lots of things.
The property is of course very pretty. I’d love to be there a couple of months later when things are fully blooming and also in the snow too. I bet it’s even better.
We would definitely recommend this place to one or two people traveling in the Columbus area! It’s a find!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great visit and host is very friendly with strong communication. We are hoping to return in the warmer months when the garden and landscaping is more vibrant and full. Overall a nice place and can’t wait to return in the future. Thanks again!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Simon's place was absolutely beautiful inside and out! Everything was clean and organized. The check in and checkout were both very easy.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay here! Simon was so incredibly proactive with his communication and the place was immaculate! So incredibly beautiful. Would recommend!!

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a fantastic place to stay. I highly recommend it for it's unique surroundings and for being being very clean, comfortable and modern."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We adored our stay at the Garden Villa - feeling transported away from our day to day lives in Simon’s gorgeous space. It was exactly as he described it, and the process of checking in and checking out was so simple. We couldn’t have picked a better place to rest and enjoy our getaway weekend. The well-kept gardens and cozy house were clean, orderly, and hospitable."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This little place is excellent, would stay here again for sure. They have put a lot of heart and soul into selecting the best of appliances, bed, kitchen, bathroom, very nice!!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed at Simon’s Villa to celebrate a birthday, as we travelled a couple of hours to the Columbus area for a quick getaway. I only needed one night, but paid for the 2 night minimum, as the Villa looked peaceful and gorgeous. I would regularly plan a stay at the Villa, if there was flexibility for a 1 night stay (dang kids)! I did give 4/5 stars for value, only due to how little we were actually at the Villa - if we had stayed at the Villa for the entirety of our time in Columbus, it would have been 5/5, but that logic could be applied to any Airbnb. We hope to return in a few months, just to enjoy more time at the Villa, as the Villa alone would be worth the trip. I was extremely happy with our stay, and Simon was a fantastic host. We had everything we needed, the communication was proactive and very clear, Simon was extremely attentive, and even recommended a great place to stop for lunch in the area. I thank Simon for everything he did to make our stay what I had hoped for & more!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was absolutely fantastic. My partner and I had a wonderful time not only at the space, but the surrounding area. I would definitely recommend this to a couple who is looking for a nice get-away. 5/5."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was amazing, and Simon was a great host. Check-in instructions were extremely clear, and overall, my stay was fantastic. Would 100% recommend checking this place out. The villa is unlike any other place I have ever stayed at."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a great stay! Simon was very easy to communicate with and the villa was the perfect place to celebrate our anniversary. Would recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay in the Columbus area.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay at this lovely home! Very clean, comfortable, and relaxing, don’t hesitate to book!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,An absolutely amazing experience and its all thanks to Simons attention to the details it takes to craft a perfect stay for guests. I've stayed in many Airbnbs but this one is clearly a top choice. We will be back anytime we're in town and I highly recommend you consider this place during you visits too.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,You will not be disappointed with this gem outside of Columbus. A unique and peaceful place to unwind and relax. The wooded setting was beautiful and we will be back during warmer weather so we can enjoy the outdoor amenities. Thank you Simon for such love and care that you pour into this little home.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a beautiful space. Soo quit and peaceful. Definitely recommend this beautiful place.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Will definitely come back!! Thank you so much. It was a lovely place to celebrate our 25th anniversary!!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Simon was easy to communicate with from the very beginning, answering all of our (many) questions. He made finding the address and checking in super easy.
The villa is finished in an exquisite and beautiful way. I’m European and felt as if I was in an Italian garden. We felt right at home. Interior was spotless and just as beautiful, decorated with flair, in a warm and welcoming way. We had snacks and coffee available after our long drive and everything was as described - or possibly even lovelier than the photos.
The area is full of fun restaurants and activities and Simon provided some helpful tips. Check-out was simple and easy.
All in all, we are extremely happy. This was a special treat and we are looking forward to coming back."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay. The bed was very comfortable, everything was very clean and the location was charming."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Simon was an incredible host and his place is even prettier in person! I will absolutely be back to stay here the next time I'm in Columbus.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Garden Villa was exactly what we had hoped for; secluded, tranquil and welcoming. Check in was a breeze and the Villa was very clean. We enjoyed the peaceful and beautiful surroundings at the Villa and also enjoyed restaurants and shopping that are surprisingly nearby. Simon was incredibly helpful and friendly. We typically don’t stay with an AirBnb more than once but this is an exception. We will be back!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Outstanding experience all around . Beautiful , quiet place with rapid access to Cbus.
Very cozy decor , take time to check out the photography throughout the villa , some hidden artistic gems , we really enjoyed . Simon had great meal recs and was incredibly responsive to any and all questions/needs."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The stay at this spot was amazing. The space itself was extremely clean and very comfortable. Despite coming in December, the outdoor area was still beautiful and peaceful. The host himself was incredibly kind and offered lots of good local recommendations. The property is really close to Dublin, which is beautiful and has a lot of local, fun spots. We felt very welcomed and would love to stay here again in the future!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great experience! Simon was an excellent host.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We recently visited for a Andrea Bocelli concert Simons villa was absolutely stunning, inside was very cozy, pristinely clean and felt just like home. There’s so much to do in Columbus and Simon is there to give recommendations throughout your stay! You won’t regret your stay in Columbus staying at the villa."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great hidden get away in Dublin! Host is very help and responsive.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The host, Simon, was very friendly and easy to communicate with. He always answered in a timely and concise way. The space was meticulously clean and generous amenities were provided; my only reccomendation would to have more towels available in the space when guests check-in. We chose to stay in late-November so some amenities (outdoor tub and grill) were not available due to being winterized. Neverless it was a great stay. Would reccomend Los Guachos tacos 3 miles down the road for a local bite - best tacos I've ever had!"
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Cozy stay but wished we had come in the spring so we could have used the outdoor amenities. Very clean and beautiful space. My only complaint is there were no extra towels. We only had one towel a piece for the two nights we stayed. As a woman it would have been nice to have a towel to wrap my hair up in after getting out of the shower. Other than that it was a very nice place and I would definitely recommend it be a great spring time get away.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a perfect place for a couple looking for a quiet getaway! Very classy with a great host.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Simon was a great host! I felt very safe in his villa. Very clean Amd private. Simon is very communicative and responsive. 10 stars! I will be back :)

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for a couple! Great space and not too far from the downtown area! The place was very clean and Simon communicated great. Would recommend!!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The villa was very clean & surprisingly spacious. The only downside was we had thought it would be a bit more secluded.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely villa!! It’s tucked away from the hustle and bustle of Dublin, but still minutes from any and all the fun things you want to do while there. This place has all the amenities you could want! Even a power charging station; a first for us when staying at an Airbnb. The bed and bedding was so comfortable, and the kitchen and bathroom had every amenity you can think of. We had to reach out to our host at one point around 8:30 in the evening because I locked the doorknob which caused the keypad to be ineffective at unlocking our door. He was very gracious and understanding and had us back inside within minutes. The only tip I can offer is the driveway to the villa is a tad narrow, so if you have a large vehicle it might take a moment to leave. But we will definitely consider staying here again when planning another visit to Dublin!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The villa is gorgeous, the bed is exceptionally cozy, the atmosphere is clean and peaceful and the location is incredibly convenient!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was an absolutely perfect stay for my wife and I. We were celebrating our anniversary and Simon went out of his way to make it special for us.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Love love love! Attention to detail was with Sergio at this Airbnb. Everything was super clean, organized and many amenities. Felt very luxurious! Perfect location too! Lots of place near by with a quick Uber. The ace Ty is soooooo BEAUTIFUL! Perfect photo op! Only thing I could think of that could be better is the water temperature for the outside bath.. Luke warm is the hottest it got and that way too cold for a outside bath. But besides that, amazing stay!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is incredible! You drive down to a totally private little slice of heaven. Gates lead you through manicured gardens with statues, working fountains and a private outside dining space. The interior is right out of Architectural Digest. Open ceilings with tons of natural light. You won't want to leave...but if you do, be sure and check out the town of Dublin. The Pearl restaurant was excellent. Great job Simon."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Location was fabulous! Beautiful and secluded! The setup for the house were well thought out and very convenient. Simon was very communicative and helpful. One of my favorite experiences using Airbnb! Would stay here again. Can not recommend enough!

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The villa was very clean and we thoroughly enjoyed this private getaway that was still close to many things to do in the area.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My wife and I stayed at the villa for a day after our wedding and it was an amazing little get away. It provided us solitude with amazing scenery around us.

His attention to detail in both the space he's created and the care he provides guest is excellent. Highly recommend!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, elegant, relaxing"
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at the Garden. The grounds were beautiful, and the room was clean and upgraded. Simon was a wonderful host and provided information about the area and places to visit. He also answered our questions quickly when we reached out about the claw foot tub.
The only reasons we gave our stay 4 stars instead of 5 was because the room did have a smaller bathroom. Both my wife and I had had difficulties moving around in the space even when we were in there individually. We also think the water was on well water because there was a distinct smell from the water. This isn’t something that they would be able to change though, but I just wanted to provide that information in case anyone else is sensitive to smells like my wife! The other thing that we weren’t a huge fan of was the AC because it was more of a wall mount type. It seemed to take longer to get the space to cool off. There also seemed to be some wifi issues because the television apps ran off wifi and would freeze or skip at points.
Overall, the space truly was beautiful. While we didn’t particularly enjoy Columbus in general for completely unrelated reasons, the one thing we did enjoy was getting to spend quality time together in the Garden."
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This is a beautiful little home perfect for an overnight stay. It is very quiet and peaceful, especially since it is nestled in the woods."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is beautiful and spotless! It is in a nice area, close to plenty of restaurants, bars, shopping areas, etc. while still feeling secluded. The host communicates well and is very informative about the area.
I do want to mention that there were small planes flying over for a good amount of the evening that we spent there. More of an annoyance than anything. The property also wasn't as well groomed on the outside as it was in the photos, and the parking area is very small. You have to do some maneuvering in order to get out unless you're good at backing up hills.
Overall, a little on the expensive side, but still a great place to stay."

It's spacious, beautifully decorated, and has everything you need for a longer stay. I really enjoyed the location. Close to shops and restaurants, convenient access to the university by public transport. The only small drawback is sometimes the downstairs neighbors if they party too long at night. But it was sporadic situations. Overall, I highly recommend it, especially for longer stays."

2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed staying at Chantal-Marie's place. The room was truly ""lovely."" I greatly appreciated the peace and quiet, and the mature post oak tree in the backyard. I appreciated that I had a choice whether to have A/C or open windows, and there were no heavy perfumed sheets or anything like that. I very much like how there was a glass water jar set up in the bedroom and coffee/tea maker for individual use. I found the place to have everything I need with very simple and easy check in/out. I'd definitely stay there again if I was looking for a quiet place and some solitude near Columbus."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you guys for your hospitality
2019-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Chantal-Marie's place is a great value when needing a place to put your head. The room was good and the bed comfortable. There is the possibility that there will be other Airbnb'ers there also, so it is possible that there will be 3 guest rooms that share one bathroom. This never posed an issue during my two night stay.
The value is very good, though. Chantal-Marie met me in person when I arrived and showed me to my room. The room was comfortable with a coffee maker and a common microwave in the hall right outside the door. They also have a refrigerator in the kitchen where guests can store stuff. The front door has a keypad so access is pretty seamless. All in all, a good stay."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing hospitality! Great location in Columbus. I really enjoyed staying here while in town for work. Hope to stay again soon!
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay with Chantal was great, my presence in Columbus was due to the Sonic Temple Festival and she was super thoughtful with me since my arrival: I was able to leave my luggage at her house before check-in, served breakfast and even let me take a shower, as I had traveled all night by bus). Regarding the location, it was a little far from the place where the festival took place, but my friends were in a nearby hotel and everything worked out perfectly because I was picking them up by Uber and we stayed at the nearest bus stop and from there it was only $2 for the stadium. Everything was very good in general, the room, the bathroom impeccable. If I go back to the festival from the other year, I would definitely stay again at Chantal."

The dedicated entrance made the space feel very private, even though it is in the lower level of a home.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Enjoyed my brief one-night stay here. Very comfortable basement unit. Never heard any noise from above. Spacious and clean. Located on a quiet country road yet only about 20 minutes to downtown Columbus. Would return.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was exactly what we needed. A quiet place close to our son and his wife makes this a place we will be remembering for future visits. The added bonus is that it is near enough to Columbus to make downtown easily accessible. Unfortunately, we did not have much time to spend in the spacious accommodations, but really enjoyed the pastries and homemade cookies we found upon returning late in the evening. For us, it was perfect and felt very much like home."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dorothy and David are wonderful hosts! And my stay at Birdsong Meadows was perfect for my need for a rest on a longer road trip. The weather was chilly and they had a fire started in the wood stove for me upon arrival. It was delightful! And made me feel immediately welcome. The space is exceptionally clean and the kitchen is well equipped for a longer stay. I felt right at home, and Dorothy was easy to communicate with. I would definitely stay there again."

Dorothy was a great communicator and truly made us feel at home. We will definitely stay here again when we are in the area
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"David and Dorothy have curated a lovely and comfortable space in this Airbnb. It was much more space than expected. It is cozy and clean. One of the beds is truly the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. My daughter was very pleased with the other one. The area and neighborhood is so nice. It is mid west country living at it finest but is so close to several towns/cities and has very easy access to I-70 between Columbus and Springfield. If safety is a priority in your search or if you are traveling alone, this space, neighborhood, extended area is as safe as one could get, in my opinion. They have thought of everything one could need and more.
Dorothy and David are so warm and personable. The space was private yet we so enjoyed our brief interactions with them. Check in was simple with a key pad and very clear instructions about parking and entry. I hope it is available the next time we are traveling to this area."

Incredible peanutbutter cupcakes, so friendly, made sure we were okay, had a gorgeous property on a farm with beautiful views of the sunset, and had everything we could possibly need! They let our 3 kids play out back too on their swing set and were just really kind people overall!

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a great place to stay. It is very close to I-70, but just far enough removed to make it feel remote! A beautiful house and beautiful grounds. The hosts are most gracious, and the space is incredible, one of the largest nicest we have experienced."

Close proximity to I70 makes it easy to get where you need to go, while staying in a quiet setting. We have used Airbnb exclusively four years and over 20 bookings. Dorothy and David stand out as one of the best hosts we have encountered."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is great. it was clean and comfortable. The kitchen was well supplied. They had a nice coffee maker instead of one of those silly Keurig thingies. I did not need my French Press. The outside area was nice to walk around in. We were there for only two nights, but a longer term stay would work well. This is a great value."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great hosts! Everything was laid out, plenty of room, and e erything one would need for a stay. Amazing location!

What really makes Birdsong Meadow “sing”, though, are the gracious, friendly and helpful hosts, Dorothy and David."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Home was beautiful, and the perfect size and amenities for our trip to Columbus. Hosts were highly responsive and accommodating. We will absolutely be back, and will share with friends and family, too!"
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"The urban is a nice hotel in a great location. It was very close to short north, northern market and the Ohio state campus. The apartment has a lot of amenities such as a 24 hour gym, a fire pit, and a hot tub. Our least favorite part of our stay was locating the Urban. There is a lot of construction going on around the building so there were detours; We’re not locals and the instructions they gave us were not very helpful. We eventually ended up finding the place and the garage. The room was small, but very nice and includes things such as a tv, a microwave and a refrigerator. The walls were thin, and we could hear people in the rooms near us. All in all, the urban was a nice place to stay in our less than 2 day trip to Columbus."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Rooms were very small but an excellent use of space and perfect for 1-2 people looking to get a night of sleep. Out door deck was beautiful
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a good option for alumni to stay at when visiting! The location is super close to north campus and the building itself is newer than other places. The size of the room was perfect for me (1 person) and it had everything I needed. Everything felt super clean. Parking was very convenient. The only cons about this place is the 1 elevator. Other than that, I would recommend this place to others!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful look!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was AMAZING! Definitely small but that’s in the description lol. My only concern was the shower. Water gets on the floor and there’s nothing to hold on to.
BUT that takes NOTHING away from my review. Outstanding"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice location and neat apt, yet a bit noisy night."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Clean and nicely decorated. Perfect for a weekend trip in Columbus.
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The Urban was a great spot to stay for a few nights for a weekend ing Columbus! The people at the front desk were always kind and helpful - even offered us jeni’s ice cream! Garage parking was very nice to have especially since it rained during our visit. The only downside is that I think there are also students living here and the walls are quite thin so there was some noise from people talking/laughing around 2-3am each night. Not a big deal if you’re a heavy sleeper but it did wake me up at night.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Small but cute space for a night or two. What I needed for a very short stay in columbus. Can get noisy, but kind of expected."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Room was clean and tidy, and the check in/out process was convenient!"
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"people partying and being really loud and obnoxious late at night/ in the early morning hours in the common area of the floor we were on. loud enough to wake us up and keep us awake. when I messaged the staff about this, they ignored my message. other than that, it was really pretty nice. clean, simple. everything worked."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a perfect place for one! No cutlery or anything in the rooms at all. Good thing I brought a spoon lmfao.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great space with your own parking spot. Walkable to OSU campus and sites as well as some restaurants, coffee and Buckeye Donuts! Good price for the location for sure. Easy drive into Columbus as well or the North Market or German Village area."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Was cute and great location to campus and high st. Construction was a bummer and some of the area around was trashy but overall good stay
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,A little rough at night in some areas nearby but overall great!
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, it was good for a short stay working in hospitals near campus. I was staying on the 6th floor and lacked readily accessible clean kitchen supplies for meals. Dirty utensils, no bowls/spoons/forks, dirty pots/pans, and communal dishwasher made it difficult to cook and prep meals for yourself. Very easy to hear loud guests in adjacent rooms. Room was sufficient otherwise."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Looks just like the pictures! The Urban was in a very convenient location to campus, extremely clean, and the parking garage was an extremely helpful and safe! Definitely would stay here again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I had real good experience staying there one night, clean, quiet and next to OSU campus. I do understand was summer when the building was mostly empty."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"had a great experience - clean, simple, efficient. Would highly recommend if you just need a place to stay for a night or two."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Easy, accessible check-in. Great location. Perfect price/value ratio. Would/will return again."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great tiny studio to stay in. Was clean & comfortable. Only issue we ran into is that they left us 1 roll of TP and 2 towels for 2 people to stay for 5 nights. I contacted them through AirB&B to see if they could get us some more towels TP but they didn't respond for over a day. We ended up finding a house-service cart and just taking what we needed off of it. Other than that it was good.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved this location a lot, close to everywhere I needed to go. I would definitely return anytime I back in Ohio."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was my 5th it 6th stay at the Urban! It’s always clean, has everything you need and the secure garage is a huge bonus!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"nice place with parking and easy to find. reserved room 2 months in advance but they couldn't check me in the first night because they have a ""first come first serve"" rule that isn't made aware and booked the last room to a group without a reservation; had to stay at red roof"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Place was just as pictured very clean super close to everything and staff was extremely accommodating and friendly would definitely recommend
2024-06-01,2.0,Stayed one night,It’s was ok

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice little place to stay for a night or two! Check in was very easy and the instructions were very clear. The on site parking was nice. It’s a tiny place but perfect for one or two people
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our TV didn’t work the first night and they didn’t have any extra TV's that we could use. We had to move to another room the second day. It would be beneficial to extra TV's or any appliances in case something doesn't work. Otherwise it is a great place. We wasn't offered a discount for not having a TV the first night.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super nice, location is awesome if you’re trying to walk around north high. Super friendly staff"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!

2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,After we were able to locate the place (they had construction in front of the building) we were able to check in a bit early which was nice. Our only complaints were the hot tub had so much chlorine that we smelled like it for a day after even after showering and also there is only one elevator for the whole building which made the wait for it longer than one would expect.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great experience. super affordable and very clean and cozy. water pressure could be better but I'll return every time I need a place in Columbus.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Urban was perfect for our one night stay in Columbus. We received very detailed communication on check in procedures and what to expect during our stay. The room/apartment was very clean. We would stay again if in town for a night or weekend.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay at The Urban. The host was very friendly as was the receptionist in the lobby. The room itself was very clean and looked just like the photos. With the semester being over at Ohio State University, it was also a peaceful location with not much foot traffic. I recommend this spot to anyone looking for something downtown in Columbus"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"great place, very clean!!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"For just the quick night in it was very pleasant, a little difficult to navigate around the building for parking and high street access and the area surrounding is a little empty feeling, but the actual room and amenities were very nice. A nice place to stay overall."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great experience, convenient area and good value"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We needed a quick one night stay after a concert at the Schottenstin Center, and this worked out perfectly! Conveniently next to restaurants and was only a 15 minute walk to the Venue. Room was incredibly clean, check in was easy. Loved that we had a spot in the parking garage. Walls were a little thin and you could hear people talking, but nothing white noise couldn't block out. We'd definitely come back!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Middle of Columbus and affordable. Would stay again.
2024-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Loved our stay. Perfect for our concert night at the Schott! Clean, quiet and perfect."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the funniest place to stay. Visiting my daughter I felt like I was living in a very cool upscale dorm ! Was perfect location and really just had every amenity to enjoy the down time as well as virtual work day
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed about a week,"I spent 7 days there I like the place, you can walk to the restaurant etc. my only problem I spent 7 days no one came to clean the room to change the sheets and towels, my last night there was no water in the shower and the next day I left without taking my shower I sent a message to say there is no water, no response"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing, stay."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place, close to OSU. Had no issues. Would stay here again."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The staff was very friendly and helpful both on check in and check out. the location is great for being cloae to campus and the 'shoe - can't be beat. Add that parking is included as a huge benefit. Also there is a panera literally steps away - as well as a smoothie place and a few other places to grab a meal/snack. The only challenge i had was that since the rooms are small - the noise from other units at night (after 10 pm) was more than i expected. If you are a sound sleeper it would not be a problem.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,All the employees were so amazingly friendly!! I would definitely go back
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Third time staying at The Urban, never disappoints!!! Walk to everything at OSU, super friendly and helpful staff. Delicious cinnamon buns this morning were an added delicious bonus"

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The listing states there is a hot tub, but it was not available for use when we stayed in April. I messaged about getting some money back because we were very excited for the hot tub, and they agreed. However, I had to remind them four times, using three different interfaces, before they finally gave me some money back. Potential guests should be aware that this building is mainly student apartments, but we did not have any issues with that. (Other than a faint smell of marijuana in our room upon arrival.) It is a fun building and very close to OSU."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, easy check-in, nice clean room with convenient parking."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,loved staying here! i wish i could’ve stayed longer. the room had a big fridge and LOTS and i mean a lot of storage in the kitchen and by the bed and an empty bookshelf type area. the bed was a murphy bed which allowed for more walking space if you needed it (we didn’t). it was a small room but the bathroom definitely wasn’t small. parking was so easy and accessible. there was a hot tub/small pool and a hammock that was in a courtyard so it was pretty secluded from the road. the rooftop deck was cool. we didn’t have time to check out the game room but based off of everything else it was probably really nice. receptionists were super sweet and friendly. definitely would stay again and recommend!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Urban is a great place to stay if you are doing anything at OSU or nearby. We had all the amenities we needed for this stay. It's in a very walkable and safe area of the city.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Went to Columbus for the OSU Spring Game and Four Miler and this place was great for a pit stop. Easy walk to the Shoe and all the local bars and night life on High Street. The room was clean and just enough space for two staying a day or two. Will definitely be back to stay for a fall game.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean and nice bed. Very good that it is so close to the Ohio State stadium.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Urban was the perfect spot for visiting OSU's campus. It is close walking distance to restaurants and the rest of the campus. The room is small but efficient.

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The space was clean and did what we needed for one night, but definitely TINY if you’re planning to stay more than one or 2 nights. Good location and worth it for the one night we stayed."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect location to attend an event on Campus. Walkable to everything on north campus and establishments on High St. near north campus. Small, but clean, and certainly met our needs for an overnight stay. Hosts allowed us to check in an hour early to get ready for the event we were attending. Will definitely stay here again!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We were in town for admitted students day at OSU for my daughter and we were extremely close. The place was very clean which I’m very critical of. Parking was secure and in a garage. Perfect place for two people to stay the night for ANY OSU function. Will return. :)
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed here for OSU acceptance day. Very clean and convenient location to OSU. Very nice, very small space.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great stay. everything we needed for a 1 night stay in Columbus. enjoyed the extras like lotion and body wash. kitchen located right down the hallway for cooking if needed. the hot tub and patio were closed so was unable to review those. parking was easy. checking easy and quick. great neighborhood with anything we needed close by. will stay again when visiting Columbus area. thanks.

I will definitely be back! Was hoping there were other locations in the country but they have not launched yet.
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Quiet, good location, super clean and cute decor. Only downside was that when we traveled, there was a lot of rain so the outdoor hot tub was drained and unusable which was a huge bummer, but everything else was great. Would highly recommend."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Urban was super clean and comfortable. Staff was very friendly and gave thorough instructions. Parking was a little challenging as I’m just not used to the area or parking below the building, but anywhere new you stay has that challenge. I followed their instructions exactly how they were given to me and figured it out quickly. Again, the room was very clean and I slept very well as it was nice and quiet. The hot tub was super nice, and it was great to have things so close and extra little amenities. Would definitely stay again."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a comfortable stay at the Urban. It is perfect for an overnight stay for two people. Host was extremely flexible and let us check in ahead of time. They also held our baggage for us after check out as we were still in Columbus walking around the city. That was very kind of them. They were also very responsive with any questions we had before we arrived. Location was perfect and within walking distance to the university and restaurants. Would definitely recommend The Urban.

I very much appreciated their willingness to allow me to check in a couple of hours early and allowing me to leave my car in the garage a few hours past check in, so I wouldn't have to pay for parking on campus. The room was cute and the building is very clean. It was a perfect fit for an overnight stay."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice and private place.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great stay for those looking to be close to the university. Construction across the street but that will be resolved soon enough. Enjoyed my stay.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Friendly. Would def stay again
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Felt so comfortable and clean. The bed was very comfortable. The space is actually bigger than I expected with tons of storage spaces. Safety is very important and as a solo traveler I can honestly say I felt safe! I love the private parking garage and easy check in process. Will definitely be booking again soon!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,good place
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A must stay for one or two people!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice and convenient location!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I had the beast time!! All the staff was so amazing!!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a great place to stay for a trip downtown Columbus. Very walkable and safe. Although it’s smaller we had everything we needed and were very comfortable. Definitely would stay here again!
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"I will start by saying, we came at a time where there was a lot of construction going on. It was hard to locate the building because it was sandwiched between several other places and kind of hidden. Between it not being an obvious stand out and there being barricades for construction, it was hard to find. Moving to the actual location: The amenities and the floor where our room was, had lots of seating and a very cute aesthetic. Moving to the actual room itself, very very small. This is not the place to stay if you’re coming with more than 2 people and plan to stay for a long period, comfortably. The space consist of a bed, sink, and small bathroom. Not much room for anything extra. We only stayed overnight so it was good for that purpose. Construction woke us up at 6am, which would’ve been nice to know prior to booking. There were HUGE TOENAILS in the AC unit. And it was very hot in the room. Disgusting. But otherwise clean. I’d do it again for one night, nothing longer."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This spot was perfect for a one night stay or weekend stay.￼ restaurants are nearby and walkable! Attended a concert at the schottenstein center. It was a 15 minute walk! Also they give you ice cream when you check in! Love the little touches.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,wonderful place and felt safe.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My friend and I stayed here for 1 night and it was incredibly worth the price. I will definitely stay here again if I’m ever back in Columbus!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location! Very clean & nice.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our 2nd time staying at the Urban. It's the perfect small size for 2 people for a night. If you are going to an event at the Schottenstein Center, it is a 10 minute walk. It's perfect. The parking was secure. Clean, good value. Highly recommend and would stay again!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great time and spot!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Will be staying here again for sure!!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Front desk was helpful and friendly at check-in. Room was as described, clean and private. Would book again. Thanks!"
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Love this place, just bring earplugs for the construction across the street and call ahead for check in details like where to park for check-in if you’ve never been there. Clean, comfy, and staff is great!!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,So good
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Good stay, clean."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great spot! Room is small but clean, great location, no complaints!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Overall a great experience
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My husband and I were in Columbus for the evening. Booked this location based on reviews. Something different than our usually downtown stays. Reviews were accurate. Current construction in front of the property made entry a little difficult. Nothing major though. Check-in was a breeze and staff was very friendly and welcoming. You even get a free mini Jeni's ice cream upon arrival :) Nice! Property as described. The rooms are small but clean and comfortable. Everything you need for an overnight stay. The common/kitchenarea on the 6th floor is pretty cool! Found out that part of the building is tenant apartments and part is hotel rentals. Great idea. The only issue we had was parking my husband's truck. AT4 that barely clears the 7 foot entry. Garage clearance got lower each level 6'9/6'10. Talked to the front desk and they were happy to accommodate our vehicle in the first level parking. Overall we had a GREAT stay and would return again. Perfect for our stay and excellent price.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was very clean and in a great location to walk to everywhere we needed to go!
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,not a bad spot at all. the price was fair and really easy to check in. the bed was somewhat lumpy due to being a Murphy bed and the walls are super thin. we were able to hear conversation-volume talking most of the evening and morning. I think for a budget traveler this is a fine option but if you want privacy at all consider spending a few extra dollars and get a hotel. overall I would recommend it again to the right guest.
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was clean, beautiful place there was a lot of construction going around it and there was a line of people to check in when we got there"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was very comfortable and enjoyed my stay. Hosts were fantastic, staff inside were fantastic. No one mentioned the major construction in the entire front of the building blocking the road. But it didn’t cause any delays or problems for us. Confused us when we arrived is all. Also, the building is 100% like a college dorm but at the same time it was only my husband and I and we had everything we needed and were very comfortable. It was peaceful and quiet for a “college dorm” style. The courtyard with a heated pool is amazing! I would stay again if it was just me and my husband."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Overall a great stay, the room was small, but it didn’t feel cramped. There were no issues except for the construction out front, which was a little confusing for how to get inside."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great place
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,staying at the urban was great! the staff was accommodating and they were very responsive and helpful. would come back if in the area!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Can't wait to come back! Everything was perfect - loved the hot tub, comfy bed, lots of fun stuff to walk to, responsive host."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,My fiance and I had a wonderful stay in German village! The home was perfect for what we needed! The bed was very comfy and the whole house was very clean. We had no problems and didn't need to reach out to the host for anything but I'm sure he would've responded in a kind and timely manner. There were many amenities provided. There were soaps and shampoos and extra linens. All the necessary appliances were included in the kitchen and I appreciated that ground coffee was available to use. It was a short walking distance to all the desirable destinations in German village. There was construction going on during the days but that didn't bother us. Overall we really enjoyed the home and would definitely visit again in the future!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first time in German Village & we enjoyed it so much! This Ab&b was within walking distance of everything, spacious, clean and the hot tub area is very private. We especially enjoyed drinking our coffee in the morning while sitting on the upper level deck outside the bedroom watching the ducks in the neighbor's pond :) The host was so helpful and very responsive when I had questions. There is some construction next door but Oleksandr was transparent about that from the beginning but we were too busy shopping, sight seeing etc. to really notice it. We will absolutely be visiting again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely place to stay, clean, inviting, great hot tub, construction across the road, but wasn’t bad during our stay!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent locations. Excellent amenities. Above and beyond.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay in German Village. Walking distance to a nice restaurant, The Barcelona, where we celebrated our son’s graduation. Everything was spotless and comfortable. Very responsive to questions. Enough space for 2 cars. Convenient location to get to The Book Loft and our daughter in Grandview. We would definitely stay again. Thank you!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for our wedding weekend and it was perfection. Adorable, close to a lot of great places, and loved the hot tub."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Returning guest, always a great stay, awesome hosts, already looking forward to the next time!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great stay.. very comfortable and clean. Conveniently located by lots of restaurants/bars and minutes away from downtown. Oleksandr was welcoming and gave clear instructions for the home. Would highly recommend.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice stay. Good communication!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Oleksandr was a great host! Loved the space. It was perfect for the two of us! He was upfront about the construction next door, but it didnt even bother us. We had an awesome stay. Will be back!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our 4th stay in German Village but the first time at this home. We loved it! The space is perfect for two people. Some extras you won’t see at other rentals in German Village -hot tub (large!), so close to Schmidts you can put in your name on the waiting list and stay at the house until they call for your table, nice coffee pot vs those tiny pod machines, and private outdoor space!
House is only a 8 minute Uber ride to Nationwide Arena for events.
The construction was expected and it did not detract from our stay."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The hot tub was great ! A very relaxing and comfortable home.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and will definitely come back if we ever find ourselves in Columbus again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved this place!! Host was great. The place was super clean and gorgeous and only like a 10 minute drive to everything and downtown. We had a great stay and the construction next door was not bad at all!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. Very clean. Host responded quickly to all questions.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This spot was beautiful and is in a great area! Would definitely stay again.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at Schumacher’s Gem! Oleksandr set everything up just right for us to enjoy a peaceful time away. Well-done!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was immaculate and exactly as described, a very comfortable space I could have stayed in for a long time, and one of the cleanest b&b I’ve ever been to. The one downside was the construction! I knew about it going in and Oleksandr communicated very clearly about it, but the construction right outside started at 6:20am, and sometimes the street was blocked off by construction vehicles and impassable. Once the construction is finished, I’m sure the spot will be entirely perfect. The decoration was very nice and the kitchen was well-equipped, too."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little getaway! Hot tub hidden by the privacy fence was perfect!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay overall! Private hot tub was a great way to end the day! Bed was comfortable and the additional touches of the decoration on the toilet paper and paper towels added that little extra touch. Construction is in process to build a wonderful restaurant and market place just in front of the building. Once it is finished it will make this airbnb that much better. Construction noises were not too loud and the host was very up front about it ahead of time. Definitely a great place to stay!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great Stay!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cozy and private! Located in the heart of the German village - such a unique neighborhood and really fun to walk around and explore

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great spot! the german village was very cute. the bars and restaurants were nice and the food was great. the air bnb is just a few minutes from the city. great place to stay
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The first thing that I noticed was the place is much bigger than I realized. But it is still a cozy, well maintained, upgraded apartment that is very clean and quiet! It was a perfect retreat for our stay in Columbus as we were there for the hectic Arnold Sports Festival. It is also in the heat of German Village, which is almost like entering a time machine and going back 150 years with its brick streets and old school architecture. Great German restaurants and coffee shops within a couple minutes walk. I would highly recommend!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place!!

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super clean and private
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was a perfect spot for a quick weekend in Columbus. Everything we wanted to do was either walkable in German village, or within a 10 minute drive. We visited during some very cold weather and heavy snowfall so the private hot tub was extra helpful! Really a lovely space in a great location and would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Columbus."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was an amazing Valentine’s Day stay. I shared the space with my fiancé and we had such an amazing time. Don’t let the construction deter you, it’s really not that loud and I honestly kind of found it relaxing to watch the crane operate from the hot tub. Will definitely stay again at some point!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great stay. There is some construction going on but they were very honest about that from the get go. It made it a little hard to find the driveway but I wrote them because I was confused and they got back to me immediately. It is a good location and is close to everything. The hot tub was definitely a nice touch.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was amazing the perfect place to stay

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"loved the location! Easy walking distance from everything. Very private, a great place for an overnight stay. The construction does start at 8 am, even on a Saturday, but that didn't bother us because we were ready to be awake by then. Perfect overnight stay at Christmas time with the town all light up with Christmas lights. We look forward to staying in the future. Wonderful Anniversary getaway ❤️"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Parking was easy. Lots to do nearby and a very nice office space. Construction was nearby but did not affect my stay at all everything went smoothly and look forward to staying again.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Despite construction in the area, we heard no after hours activities.

We will be back."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a short stay & enjoyed every moment. With the convenient designated parking, we walked through the gate and it way more private than we thought it was going to be, especially being in German Village! Walked-in and the place immediately smelled fresh, clean, and very inviting. Everything was organized, labeled, and easy to use, including the well-kept hot tub. The neighborhood is super walkable & we enjoyed a couple meals nearby.
Most definitely would book again!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It looked just like the pictures! The outdoor hot tub space was our favorite. The balcony on the back was also a great place to drink coffee in the morning. The place was very neat and clean. We really enjoyed our stay and would come again! Parking was easy to find and very helpful in downtown German village.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Just perfect for a little romantic get away. the host was very responsive and helpful. I would bring extra towels next time. But other than that it was wonderful.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Centrally located and clean Airbnb in German village. Was easy to find and Oleksandr was very responsive. Highly recommend!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The stay was wonderful. The space was cozy and warm. The construction across the alley made it a bit hard to use the alley some days but that is no fault of the host. We were made aware of the construction ahead of time and id defintely stay here again.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very beautiful place. definitely recommend
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Listing was perfect for us! Walking distance to the entire German Village. Parking included and right next to the listing. Lovely porch upstairs off the bedroom. Great air conditioner! Really enjoyed our stay! Only thing one might consider is the stairs are very steep so if you have any problems with steps, probably not the place for you. We are 64 and 70 and had no issue but we have friends that would have had problems.
We highly recommend this listing!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean, easy, relatively quiet and private despite the construction site. Oleksandr makes sure the site is not a surprise. I look forward to staying here again. This was my second time and it was even cleaner than the first."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was exactly as described, looked exactly as photos. Construction in alley where desinated parking can cause problems, but is manageable. Very peaceful when Construction stops. Very much enjoyed our stay. Would definitely stay again."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This AirBNB was just what we wanted! It is quaint, in German Village (which has so much character and history). The space is just the right size for a couple. it has a sleek kitchen, nice updated bathroom, quiet study, and balcony off the bedroom that is so nice to enjoy in the morning. The hosts were very responsive and attentive. The only concern is that there is some construction nearby, which the hosts did a wonderful job warning us about, that resulted in some road closures. Overall, one of my best AirBNB experiences!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house was beautiful, and mondern. It was very clean and neat upon our arrival. The hot tub was especially great. It was clean and relaxing. The location of it in German village was convenient as it was within walking distance of most of the villages popular sites. The only down side was the construction right next to the house which made it inconvenient to get in and out of the house location, along with the noise during the day if you were trying to relax. Over all it was a great experience and would highly recommend once the construction is over."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was very clean and beautiful, would rent again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a nice cozy little place to stay to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary. It was clean, nice, had all amenities that we needed, and was right within walking distance to a bunch of fun stuff to do. Definitely recommended!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had a last minute impromptu honeymoon stay here and it was perfect! Very good walking distance to most restaurants and not a bad drive to everything else. The hot tub was amazing and it was so nice to just spend time together playing games and listening to records. There was a heavy amount of noise on the Monday morning when we checked out due to the construction next door, but we know is out of there control and they made it clear in the listing as well, so it didn’t bother us but it might some. Overall a great stay, everything was clean, and personal touches around the house made it feel more home-y 🤍 will definitely stay again if we want to explore German village in the future!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place for a weekend getaway. Loved the hot tub and many super delicious restaurants within walking distance.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here to celebrate our first year wedding anniversary- 2 nights. Very cute spot, house is roomy and holds a lot of charm! Lots of area to kick back and relax, hot tub was therapeutic so was the deck off the bedroom. The lights were very complimentary to the overall vibe of the home . No complaints I highly recommend staying here!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place,"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay for fiancé and I. loved the hot tub and quick access to cool neighborhoods in cbus. definitely recommend!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,An amazing location very cozy and it makes you feel right at home any events or family you are seeing in Columbus I would 100% recommend to spend some time here
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location, awesome spot to hang out and relax"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and well furnished space. Hot water tub is a welcome surprise. Construction nearby is not too loud. Overall good stay.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is tucked away on a private street in a really cute neighborhood that has lots of bars, restaurants, and coffee shops. The hot tub is very nice, has privacy, and operates well. The apartment is well decorated, the climate control works great, and the bed is comfortable, but accessibility-wise, the bathroom is incredibly small (and definitely needs some hooks and towel racks added,) and the staircase up to the bedroom/bathroom has narrow steps and no bannister for the top steps.
Construction is happening across the alley way that is very close to the house, so you can expect noise at 7am on a Saturday from 12 feet away, which we could live with, but weren't thrilled about and would have brought earplugs to deal with. We booked this spot very far in advance, so we were not warned about this until the day of our arrival. The host apologized for any inconvenience, but I likely would not have paid what I paid for this spot knowing it would include a lot of noise."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"great host, tons of communication, super flexible, super cute space for a quick getaway. thanks!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Outstanding cleanly home with a beautiful setup. Very responsive and well worth the price tag. It was so nice I tried to book another night it was too late!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Was extremely clean and the hot tub is an added bonus. We felt right at home and lots of good restaurants close by
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I definitely enjoyed my stay here! It was very clean and I felt right at home. Pics shown are definitely what you get, and it’s a perfect getaway if you want some privacy. Will definitely stay here again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A nice place near a lot of local restaurants and shops. Very clean and hot tub was great!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location, close to shopping and restaurants, easy to find and get in. The host was prompt and shared local favorites. Very clean and tidy. We would stay here again without hesitation."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was exactly what we were looking for. Nice and private, comfortable and the jacuzzi was amazing. We would definitely come back next time we decide to have a Columbus trip ❤️"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spot for a nice little getaway!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place, the hot tub was really nice and private, the bed was super comfortable and the host was so hospitable! would definitely stay again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great experience at the Oleksandr’s and would definitely stay again if we were in the area. They hosts were very responsive and offered great suggestions for restaurants. The home was very clean and exactly as described.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a really nice stay. The place was super clean and tidy. The bed was the comfiest I’ve experienced at an airbnb!
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space was neat and clean. The bed was comfortable and the bedroom had a super cute deck. We also thoroughly enjoyed the hot tub. I didn’t need to reach out about anything because the host sent messages proactively. There was construction going on on the street of the apartment and the host reached out about an alternate way to get there, which was very helpful. Check in and check out was super
easy. In-house instructions were very helpful such as where to find certain light switches, how remotes functioned, etc. Super close to restaurants and shops in German Village. We walked everywhere. All basic immunities were included and adequate but there really weren’t any special touches. It’s not absolutely necessary to go that extra mile, but we have stayed at places that do. I would suggest at bare minimum an addition of a towel rack for the hand towel in the bathroom and ice trays for the freezer."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is great, and the most impressive thing that stood out was the informative construction update prior to booking. We have had several experiences in the past where we arrived to find very noisy construction, and we were quite frustrated! In this situation we were informed fully prior to booking, and we decided hot tub won over construction so went anyway. The hot tub is awesome and the construction was surprisingly not very loud, as the house is well insulated. The hosts were very helpful with a few questions in a timely manner. The only thing that could have been improved upon was the kitchen supply, as there are no staples at all such as spices. However, with plenty of tasty places to eat nearby to walk to, we never cooked! Stay here, you will be happy you did!"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,The house was great! Very clean and a great location. Walking distance to the Schiller Park and restaurants. Hot tub was great also. The only issue is the construction next to the rental. They start work around 7:00am. I would definitely rent again.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Within walking distance of many little shops, coffee places and restaurants. There is construction going on just across the alley right now, (which we were told about) but it really wasn't a bother. I would definitely consider this place again!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"House was great, would stay again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,good location for walking around German Village great small bars and shops nearby.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful home, great location. The hot tub is absolutely glorious! Would definitely stay here again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"very Nice stay, memorable, nice private and interesting touches, we enjoyed the record player and the layout of the house. it's a quick walk to all the fun key parts of German village.
the ongoing neighborhood construction was something to consider if you were hoping to sleep in.
enjoying coffee on the veranda was 'icing on the cake' in the morning before checking out."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location!! Host was very helpful and responsive. Thanks for the hospitality!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’m so glad I found this hidden treasure of a place. It truly is a get away from the rest of the world. Finding it however was kinda tricky but once we did it became second nature. The hot tub was so amazing, well kept, and relaxing. The living room had so much charm and character. It made evenings watching movies on the couch feel so cozy and intimate. The kitchen was spacious , modern, and beautiful. The bed in the bedroom was incredibly comfortable… I wanna know where to pillows came from lol. The walk out balcony was such a bonus and great place to have morning coffee. Bathroom was spotless, clean, and modern. The study was my favorite room. However the ceiling fan light was not connected and the only light available in that room is natural light and a table lamp, which happened to be enough light for me. Again the study had so much charm and character. Thanks for an amazing stay, and allowing us to explore Columbus and what is had to offer!!!!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice stay, hot tub was very relaxing! Host was a great communicator would recommend."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Bed was comfy, place was clean and location was in point. Would definitely book this place again!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time staying at Oleksandr's place! It was extremely clean and was perfect for our weekend away. We loved the location as we had plenty of great places to visit within walking distance (dining, shops, park). Communication and instructions regarding his place were very clear for check-in, check-out, house rules, house instructions, etc. When we weren't out enjoying the local restaurants and shops, it was nice to sit back and relax here, enjoy the hot-tub and lights outside, or stay in and read some books. If we stay in the area again we would highly consider coming back to Oledsandr's place. Thanks for a great stay!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice home. Clean and comfortable.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Other than the construction going on it was a beautiful private stay. I came to take my state boards exam.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute cozy little nook in a big city! Perfect place to come back to unwind after a busy day and evening!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"beautiful place. cozy with a cottage feel. the hot tub was very nice, and German Village is such a beautiful neighborhood.
one warning: they are building a grocery store DIRECTLY in front of Oleksandr's place. it does affect the entrance, and it's quite noisy during the day. Obviously that's not his fault, but you will wake up to the sounds of construction by 7:30 in the morning for the foreseeable future."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place recommended to who ever decides to visit Columbus👍🏾

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and I chose this place to stay because it was close to the state board of cosmetology as I was taking my licensing exam and we loved our stay. There was plenty of room to study and it was very quiet other than the construction site across the street but it didn’t bother us! Check in was super easy and the host responds quickly and is very helpful if you have any questions!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at this location!!! The area and the place was awesome. It was so clean and smelled nice and was perfect for two people!

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Chic & relaxing! We very much enjoyed our stay here. The hosts were lovely - they were friendly, responsive, and provided us with easy instructions for check in/check out as well as great recommendations for our stay. There are a variety of tasty restaurants nearby for any meal of the day - we chose to drive 5 minutes rather than walk due to the weather but many are definitely at walkable distances. The house is well kept with comfortable furniture. The hot tub was our favorite part of the stay! The fencing allowed for privacy during our soak and we loved the string lights that were hung outside! This was a great little getaway for us, we will definitely consider a return visit if we’re in the area again!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful home, super cute neighborhood!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Only downside was the construction but that's not the hosts fault.
Also the hot tub got a little too foamy, usually that means it needs some cleaning or the chemicals aren't balanced properly. still very satisfied with our stay!"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place is in a bit of a weird spot (off an alley) but it is very private. It is in the center of the German village so good location for walking. the team was responsive and informative but not overbearing in any way. one of my favorite air bnbs I've ever had.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a perfect couples retreat. The house is furnished with everything you need to get you by for a couple days.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little house in German Village! There is some serious construction taking place across the street (October 2022), but Oleksandr was very clear about the potential noise and I did not find it to be an issue. The house had very nice amenities and was perfect for my needs. As long as you're alright with a little noise during the day (and/or once the construction is completed) I would highly recommend this house!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying here and even extended our trip another day because we didn’t want to leave. The location is perfect - we barely used our car because everything was walking distance from us. We’d definitely come again!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a great place to stay while traveling to Columbus or for a little ‘staycation’. It offered everything we needed, and felt very private. I would definitely rent again while back in Columbus."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely time staying here in Columbus! It was right near the German Village area, which has a lot of historic charm and many great stops! We highly recommend Katalina’s for breakfast, Plank’s on Parsons for bar pizza, The Brown Bag Delicatessen deli, Pistacia Vera bakery, The Book Loft to admire 32 rooms of books, and Schiller Park for a scenic stroll.
The Airbnb itself is lovely. It was well stocked with what we needed, very specious and clean, and the hot tub was a huge bonus. We would come back in a heartbeat!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Omg, this was the best airbnb I have ever stayed in and I have stayed in a lot for work. Ashley helped with my bags. When I walked in, I put my stuff down and instantly added more nights. Super clean and aesthetically pleasing. Loved the windows and the entire place is decorated to a T! Lived my best life in that loft, I will look for it every time that I am in COL."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My wife and I stayed here for our Anniversary. Ashley was very helpful with local recommendations and making sure we had the information we needed for the stay. She also included a handwritten note welcoming us with a map of local eateries and things to do on the back which was a nice touch. The Loft was very clean, well put together and stocked for what we needed! highly recommend!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ashley was wonderful. she went above and beyond with our stay. So easy to communicate with and we hope to stay again in the future. We go to Columbus often for events and this was such a great place to wind down after a busy day.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing place to stay. Ashley greeted us at the door upon arrival and was so sweet. Great location if you’re planning to spend some time in Easton. We felt like we were right at home and safe. Would love to stay again!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As soon as we stepped into the loft, we were impressed! The space was clean and bright, as well as exactly as described.
The primary bedroom closet was also a dream and such a treat to hang up our wedding party outfits and get ready there! Lots of natural light and our third even used the loft as a workspace.
We loved all of the thoughtful touches and this place has the best coffee bar I’ve ever seen!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is better than the pictures. We stayed 3 nights. It’s a perfect location in the German Village with restaurants steps away it’s a such a beautiful area to run in the morning with parks situated all around. Close to the Short North and OSU too. The apartment is beautiful and has all the conveniences of your own home. Ashley and Dru were available immediately for our questions and graciously left us a welcome gift. Can’t wait to stay at this beautiful home again!!!! Thanks for everything!!!! Lori
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! I can’t say how much we loved this apartment. It is better than the pictures and the host was very responsive and helpful. The location is amazing, right in the middle of Germantown. Everything in the apartment is top quality and we can’t wait to go back!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We booked this AirBnB for my bridesmaids and I to get ready in before the wedding, and my new husband and I had to come back to after. It was the absolute perfect location, and me, my husband, my bridesmaids, and our wedding photographer were obsessed. Ashley was so quick to respond and easy to communicate with. Easily one of my favorite AirBnB stays ever."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were visiting family and friends in Columbus and needed a clean, comfortable place to stay. Since I grew up in this city but have not spent much time in the downtown area recently, we decided to try out German Village. Ashley and Dru have such a terrific place that is very centrally located. The loft is very spacious, modern and comfortable. In fact, this place is one of the nicest places we have found anywhere with airbnb. When we were coming into town, our hosts allowed us enter the apartment early to get ready for all the festivities that we were celebrating. There is even a washer and dryer that was most beneficial to our needs at the time. For those who need to work from home, there is a separate loft with a desk. The kitchen is huge and very well stocked if you need to cook meals while there. A dedicated coffee bar with more kinds of coffee than you could even imagine are included with your stay. This location is so central and perfect for getting all over town!!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space was clean, had lots of light, and was overall a relaxing space. Ashley, our host, was friendly, super responsive, and upfront in offering help if we needed anything during our stay. We had no issues checking in or out following the provided instructions, the unit we were staying in was wash to find with directions."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The loft was amazing on every level. The pictures don’t do it enough justice. The loft was beautiful, clean, spacious, and peaceful. Amenities that you don’t even think you need are there. I most definitely will book with them again. The host was wonderful and attentive as well!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a spate of car trouble as we were trying to leave home in Virginia, so we were exhausted on arrival. But the first thing that made us smile after all that was opening the door to the loft and seeing that it looked as beautiful as advertised!
The place was immaculate. The decor was not overdone — simple but absolutely lovely. There were nice touches everywhere. The handwritten welcome note, cute coasters, and the most concise and easy-to-read house rules book ever. But I particularly loved the embossing on the start of the paper towel and toilet paper rolls-something we have never seen before!
Before you leave town, check out Schmidt’s for dinner (Ashley’s recommendation). Wunderbar!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I cannot express how much I love this place! Absolutely exquisite! Every detail is just superb, comfortable, luxurious…. Ohmygosh we can’t wait to come back"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a fantastic place to stay! It was beautiful, clean, and there were so many nice small touches to make it feel comfortable and welcoming.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had this airbnb for our bridal party to get ready before our wedding, and also stayed here following our wedding. It was the perfect place for both. Ashley was the most accommodating airbnb host of all time. The location is obviously perfect with it being wedged between the northern tip of German Village and downtown. The space is spacious, clean, decorated nicely, and overall just lovely. All this and it wasn’t even expensive relative to other options for the bridal party getting ready….Truly amazing and was a huge part of our special day and night❤️"

This place is pristine! We enjoyed the local coffee which was provided and loved that the hand soap, shampoo, etc was all from a local shop nearby. Plenty of luxurious linens provided. There's even a washer and dryer with detergent and softener provided. The bedroom suite was comfortable and cozy with a gas fireplace to boot. We made breakfast each morning and had all we needed to prepare everything.
Ashley communicated effortlessly with me and answered many questions as well as giving us many recommendations of places to visit. We didn't need to contact her during our stay but we new she was available at any time.
The loft is in a great location and walkable to many restaurants. German Village is quaint and welcoming. We loved it.
Go ahead and book this one. Perfection! You won't be disappointed!"

My friend had come to visit me from out of town and l chose this place because of the beautiful decor as a treat for my friend and l and because the location is great for being close to Columbus attractions like German Village, downtown, Short North Arts District and more! Both my friend and l were thinking we would live there if we could. lol
Beyond the lovely decor and location, we felt very secure in the location and the place was sparkling clean! Ashley was a fabulous host and welcomed me and my friend with a cute note and was always immediately available if we contacted her. l will be sending all my out of town guests to Ashley's place in the future!

I stayed the night by myself the night before my wedding and was able to relax and ease my mind a bit before the big day. The loft was a perfect, peaceful spot to finish writing my vows :) I also felt very safe and secure there. The next day, we used it as a bridal suite to get ready in. All of our guests were amazed at how gorgeous it was. That night, my husband and I came back to spend the night and celebrate being newly weds! Clearly, this is a very versatile place to stay. Ashley was so helpful, accommodating, and responsive to any questions or concerns along the way, even offering her personal number to direct any vendors that had questions about getting there, parking, etc. I highly recommend to anyone looking for a getaway!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Do yourself a favor and pick this place. Ashley thought of everything in this property. We didn’t need anything she was gracious enough to have everything we needed to feel right at home. It’s decorated very tastefully free of a bunch of excess clutter.

Don’t want to give away too much because her listing is described very well, but we were still very pleasantly surprised by her spacious and well appointed place. Nice touches throughout the loft.

The loft itself is a stunning location."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Words can not express how much I enjoyed Ashley’s place! The space is more beautiful than the photos! It’s so stylish and peaceful.

I had to work from the loft for a few days of my stay. The Wifi was perfectly capable to keep up with my busy day and the layout was accommodating for my wife to watch TV/ cook and come and go without any distraction.
Besides for the well equipped loft the two off street parking spots was very nice to have in German Village. Plenty of excellent eats, coffee and drinks that are walking distance to the loft."

Everything you need is right at your fingertips, and the decor is just perfect for a relaxing stay. Everything you need is available in the kitchen and bath. I liked that there were non stick frying pans so I could make my breakfast eggs just the way I like them. The botanical soaps were very nice and smell great. It is super convenient to downtown, and fun to look out at the skyline too. Thanks Ashley for a great stay, can't wait to come back sometime soon."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ashley’s place is absolutely one of the best AirBnBs we’ve stayed (and we’ve stayed in a lot). The loft is beautifully designed with nothing neglected. A small lofty workspace above the living area is a perfect retreat, the half bath is beautifully designed and so handy, master bed is comfy, kitchen perfect with everything u could want (and oh the coffee choices!), and a perfect master bath with rain shower. Love, love, love this space. And then there is the cobblestoned walkable neighborhood with an eclectic mix of fabulous restaurants right nearby. We’ll definitely be back!"

I'll be back the next time I'm in CBUS!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was the best experience with aBNB that I’ve had yet. We weren’t arriving until around 2 am, I let our host know and they set up the pull out couch for us beforehand so it would be ready🥹. I had my 6 month old along and didn’t have to worry about a thing. The apartment was so clean and open, not to mention a beautiful space. Historic village is gorgeous with cobblestone roads and the prettiest buildings, I can’t recommend this experience more!"

Big room, very quiet, very clean, super lush towels, great water pressure w/ dual shower heads, Netflix, access to whole house (though I didn’t use the house) and on a street lined with beautiful houses which made for a lovely evening stroll.

The sweet poochie that resides there was super nice and friendly too. The bed was super comfy and the shower had nice pressure too.We would stay again when back in the area for sure.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Josh is amazing - he’s a very communicative and attentive host, and his house truly feels like a home away from home. We felt so safe here, and the morning snuggles from Juneau were icing on the cake. If you’re coming to Columbus, I can’t recommend this place enough!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great Stay! Nice Place
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our second stay at Josh’s place was just as great as the first one! The weather was on our side, so this time we could also use the beautiful outside area of the property. :)
Josh again was the perfect host and made us feel very welcome. We will definitely come back. :)"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Josh is indeed a superhost. My room was comfortable and supplied with everything I needed.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We really loved staying at Josh’s place! The house is gorgeous and it’s very noticeable that Josh put a lot of love and time into it. It’s located in a very nice neighborhood. The house is very well equipped and the room is pretty and spacious.
Josh was a perfect host, always trying to make sure we had everything we needed and Juneau is the friendliest dog ever.
Unfortunately we only got to stay one night on our way through, that’s why we’re really looking forward to staying with him again on our way back."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"stayed only 1 night , great spot, and super cool dog. comfy and mildly quiet. the house is old and creaks can be heard throughout, wich it didn't bother me, but if you're a light sleeper..."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nobody in Columbus takes more pride and care of their rooms. This is absolutely **the deal** of the city. (Ask to meet Juno, his husky. She is SOOOO cute and friendly)"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Josh is an absolutely incredible host, with a Gorgeously Decorated Home! He has incredible taste in Home Decor and Feng Shui. He sources incredible items with which he has filled his home. The bed is incredibly comfortable, as are the pillows. 10/10 would 100% recommend. Normally, there’s room for improvement, with every business. I assure you that Josh’s AirBnB can’t get (much) better, at all!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Josh’s house is so beautiful & in an amazing neighborhood. Great location, so close to everything. The room itself has everything you need & a very cozy bed. The door does lock & I definitely felt very safe. Josh is very kind & a great host!"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Look no further, this is where you want to stay. From a gracious welcome, to the best nights sleep I’ve ever had while traveling, Josh was the perfect host. I will stay again when I return to Columbus. Thanks Josh!!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Josh’s “map room” was an absolute dream! Check in easy even though I arrived super late around 2 AM. Everything is clean , organized and easy to navigate.
It’s important to clarify that there is *absolutely* a lock on this bedroom door! I believe a previous guest commented there was no lock - but she just missed it because it is an old fashion skeleton’s key lock.
As a single female traveler I felt absolutely safe the entire time.
Can’t wait to return!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"beautiful home, excellent before and great host"

Top notch accomodations!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, very modern and comfortable"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was not quite as nice as it seemed from the ad, smaller than it looks. The couch itself was extremely uncomfortable, and very cheap.
The bed however was excellent.
Also the hot water is that way too high, scalding hot.
They could've done a better job cleaning, and I think this place would really benefit if the owner stayed here themselves for a weekend or something.
Many little amenities that you would normally expect were not present.
Adding a tall floor lamp in the living room, and a couple extra wastebaskets would go a long way.
There is a Goodwill nearby, the owner could spend about $200 there and completely set this place up. They had several couches that were much better than what was in the unit.
Lots of places to eat in walking distance, a drugstore, gas station, Goodwill, and other things within a block or so.
The air conditioning situation is mixed, with three quality room air conditioners that will totally keep this place cool, but they are a bit"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay at Justyn's place for an event at Crew Stadium. The place is extremely walkable to High St, which has lots of good restaurants plus grocery and pharmacy stores. The place was just as pictured. Justyn included a small booklet of local recommendations which was greatly appreciated!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really clean newly renovated apartment with minimal clutter and no fussiness.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Despite encountering a few initial issues, Justyn promptly addressed them, even amidst a storm warning the night before and other commitments. The cozy home offered a comfortable bed and a well-equipped workspace, which was perfect for remote work. The white noise machine and night light were thoughtful additions that eased my transition into sleeping in a new place. Additionally, the availability of a washer, dryer, and dishwasher made my stay much more convenient. Overall, despite the minor hiccups, I would happily stay here again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was here for four nights and I loved it - cute, clean, and comfortable. The neighborhood is centrally located and quiet. I would definitely stay again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely stunning. Living space was so Inviting and the bedroom was cozy. I absolutely loved it.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"These hosts have it figured out! I mean who leaves lavender calming mist on the nightstand. Space was meticulously clean and very comfortable. Towels, comforter, bed, blankets (fuzzy btw!), couch were all so comfortable. Not your typical Airbnb ""house showing"" set up. It was like staying at your best girlfriend's house and you end up borrowing her hair dryer, straightener and even her hairspray! I was very appreciative that they thought of all the amenities! They have a guest book with local eats and we used that for every place we ate out. The sushi two blocks down was amazing. It was actually very quiet and private for being so close to a main street. Uber was always only a couple of minutes away too. Like other reviewers have said, the stairs are really steep. Watch your phone on the way down! Oh, I almost forgot the shower head! I mean really, what a nice touch! If ever in Columbus again, I know where we're going back. Thanks Justyn and Grace!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I've stayed in a lot of bnbs, but this one might top as my favorite. All separate spaces, like a little apartment. Great shower and super comfortable bed and pillows. Will definitely stay again on a return trip. Very convenient to my location needs as well as the airport. Thank you for hosting me."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall the stay was fine for the length we were in town. The location is great for all things OSU and surrounding attractions. If you are looking for something quiet, then this is not the spot. If you want the convenience of location then this is definitely perfect. I will say the hosts were great! They give a lot of great information and suggestions about the surrounding area. That is always a plus in my book!"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I wish there was a dining table, but otherwise the location was perfect and the bed was super comfortable. Communication and check in was easy. Would totally stay here again."

2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The good: Very clean, comfy bed
The ‘’bad’’ stairs are a little bit difficult, wouldn’t recommend if you struggle with stairs (not necessarily a fault of the host) Everything else was great. If I have more upcoming events near campus would definitely consider coming back"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"""From the moment we stepped into this Columbus Airbnb, we knew our stay would be a great one. The host's space was cozy and comfortable I felt right at home.
Justyn and Grace were very attentive and were readily responsive to any questions we had. The location couldn't have been better, A local CVS Pharmacy right down the street and two groceries store within walking distance. The area was quiet and I really enjoy walking to Glen Echo park. I would definitely book again. Overall, our experience surpassed all expectations, thanks to our gracious host. If you're planning a visit to Columbus, Ohio look no further!"

The owners went to the lengths to supply a binder with useful information and even had a sign welcoming me to the city. It said, “Welcome to Columbus Erika!” It was a very nice touch and showed me the extra length the owners will take for their guests. The bed was very comfortable!! It was mostly quite and peaceful during my stay. I think the complimentary items such as shower washes, coffee, creamer, feminine hygiene products, and etc. I truly appreciated the cleanliness of the home and the communication through the owners was excellent. I can’t say one negative thing about my stay. I strongly recommend to anyone who is looking for a place to stay. Thank you, again Justin for welcoming me into your home."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Host was proactive and sent check in instructions that were clear and easy to follow. Flexible check in. They are strict about the after hours quiet policy as the tenant in the room next door came out to complain when I was moving my stuff in at check in (Saturday around 11PM) even though not much noise was made. Would have been a ding on the review but the tenants were very quiet the entire length of my stay so there are mutual respect and everyone followed quiet hours.

Even better, Michael went above and beyond for me in the check in and check out process.
Definitely would recommend and I’ll be back if I’m ever in the area :)"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good stay and great price!
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This is a large home, and it is used possibly exclusively as an AirBnB revenue generator. There are at least 5 bedrooms inside. We were assigned a room. Each has a number and combination lock. The furniture was fun, and it felt very welcoming. We took advantage of the big screen to watch a program we AirPlayed from an iPad, and reclined in the amazing sectional. The kitchen made me wish we'd planned to use it as well. Because there are other guests in the rooms, we mostly all kept to ourselves, so it felt a little ""dorm-like"" hearing other doors open, people wander about, and return to their rooms. We were friendly with those we encountered, but none of them seemed overly friendly. The bathroom was a community affair, which I guess I missed in the mix. It wasn't a problem, but I was left with concerns about conflicts of time usage, since going in and locking the door was the only mechanism for us. Great house, location, and neighborhood overall."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Michael's place was a sweet little spot to stay in a quiet neighborhood. He was communicative and accommodating since my flight got in in the middle of the night. Everything was just as described and very comfortable.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I was extremely happy with my stay. The price is what attracted me since I needed a place to stay for 2 weeks. The check in process was really easy and instructions were very clear. I appreciated that I had the privacy and quiet I needed since there were other rooms being rented. I also liked that there was a dedicated kitchenette with a fridge/freezer, microwave, and Keurig for my extended stay. Everything was very clean and well taken care of. I also really appreciated that using the laundry area was an extra amenity. I honestly couldn’t have asked for a better stay when I desperately needed a place for 2 weeks."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable stay. Michael was quick to respond to any questions. Thanks so much!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is very clean with a lot of friendly people as well it’s feels like a hotel but better!

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Stayed with Michael to attend an OSU game. Location great for this purpose.. only about 7 min uber ride to the stadium. First time staying in a shared residence like this. Did not cross paths with the other guests during our stay. Hospitable host! Soft, comfortable beds. Great morning coffee selection. Would recommend."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Michael was easy to contact, and the beds were so comfortable! Everything was clean and we had just what we needed. My friend and I were two women traveling alone, so I was nervous staying in a house with multiple people I didn't know, but I didn't even see the other guests. Also, our door locked for extra safety. We had a great stay! Thank you, Michael!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I very much enjoyed staying here. Michael has thought of providing everything a guest needs, including very clear information. He's incredibly prompt with communications through the app, and I had the pleasure of meeting him briefly on site. My twin bed (in a room with two twins) was comfortable. I enjoyed some evening chilling out on the big TV in the lounge. Not only is there a kitchenette and full fridge on the upstairs level where the bedrooms are, but there is a huge, gorgeous kitchen downstairs that one can use. Just minutes from Riverside Hospital in a quiet, safe, residential neighborhood. I would stay here again."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I’ve stayed here a few times now and it’s always been great. I really appreciate how clean the bathroom and common areas are kept.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,A solid choice to stay in if you're visiting Columbus. Michael was very responsive and was always a quick message away whenever I had to ask any questions. The room was very comfortable and the kitchen was one of the most complete kitchens I've seen amongst Airbnb's.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the cleanest, accommodating places I have stayed through AirB&B. It looked like the bathroom has been recently updated. I appreciated the Keurig coffeemaker and the refrigerator upstairs convenient to the room. The backyard was shady and a great place to sit and read a book. Will definitely look to stay there again when in or near Columbus."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I had a great long-term stay in this Airbnb. The house as a whole is very nice and felt very roomy. The neighborhood is a wonderfully green, quiet, residential area that is nevertheless not too far from restaurants, shops, some major roads. The university campus is close by as well and public transit is easy to access. The beds are very comfortable and I appreciated having ample storage space in the closet. I also absolutely loved having access to a washer and dryer in the house, and the appliances are new and work very well. The other guests were quiet and respectful and the house was kept extremely clean which I really appreciated. The common areas and backyard are set up really nicely, and the kitchen is well-equipped for cooking. The room gets some natural light and there are skylights and lots of windows in the house. Check in and check out were both easy and the host was accessible and very easy to communicate with. All in all this airbnb was great for my needs."

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a well-managed place close to OSU tucked into a quiet and pretty neighborhood. It’s a great value and is stocked with everything you need.
Michael is an excellent communicator. Follow his advice and get the August app for unlocking the front door. He is careful about security: each room has a key pad entrance. The decor is minimalist and refreshing.
Hosts like Michael keep us always choosing Superhosts.
We will be back!"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I have lived here for over two months. It's very clean. And in the same price or even more expensive house, Michael's three rooms are the best choice. Michael's reply is usually very timely, if you have any questions, don't worry about not being able to contact him. I highly recommend people choose to stay here. If the green river is booked, you can go and see if the other two rooms are available."

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My mom and aunt loved it. they loved how comfortable and clean everything was. Michael came to say hello and they really appreciated that. The only problem they encountered was their 2nd and 3rd night. They didn't feel the heater turn on until late at night. Maybe it was just too cold outside that day that it caused that particular problem but we will just blame it on the cold weather. nevertheless, if they ever come back to visit or anyone else I know comes to Columbus and needs a place to stay, I will recommend this lovely house. thank you so much 😄"

,,,The place was very loud and party all night long. Just decided to leave at 4A.
,,,I was very confused when Airbnb allowed me to book this place because when I walked into the lobby to check in they told me they were completely full and I would have to cancel the reservation. We had to argue back and forth over whether they would refund me even they I was the one that had to put the cancellation which I think makes it look as if I backed out at the last minute when it was really their bad. I felt bad for the person at the desk I don't think it was their fault but still idk. Not a good situation.
,,,"Either the host double booked my room or he never changed the keypad code for my room. 4 days after staying there someone else used a key code to enter my room while I was sleeping. Then the host said it wasn’t a big deal. I told him I’m contacting Airbnb, he got upset and put me out in the dead of the night. I had to be at work by 630a the next morning. It is not safe there and the host is beyond rude and inconsiderate.
A side from that incident. He has bed beds that have springs and very uncomfortable. A pillow top or memory foam would work best. And lastly there’s so many rules including no shoes, tiptoe through the house, quietly shut your door. Like you’re in boot camp.
Worst Airbnb host ever. Buyer beware."
,,,"Ask what room you are getting first. If it is room 3 or 4 possibly 5. I would cancell immediately. The sound travels hard in that place so when other guests may be going in and out of their rooms and they are not mindful of how they close their door, you will hear this in your sleep. It will wake you.
I say cancel immediately because the host will try and work with you before handing any of your money back even when services have not been rendered. He will keep sending automated messages to you even when you've told him youre no longer staying at his airbnb.
Had to leave the airbnb for other noisy guests not following the house rules (Quiet time and no door slamming). Host wanted me to work with him to kick them out but I am not getting paid for that. So I had to leave in order to not make the situation more unbearable and was a hassle getting partially refunded (even with documentation). I would recommend staying here if you want to trade in peace and quiet for a cheap bargain."
