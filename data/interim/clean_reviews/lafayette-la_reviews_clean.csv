If you are heading to Lafayette for work or play, I can't recommend a better place to stay. I travel for work and am there for about 2 weeks a month. The apt is situated in what I find to be the best area in Lafayette with shopping, restaurants and coffee within a 5-10 minute walk.
The place is immaculate, furnished tastefully, with serene colors and lovely accents. The kitchen is highly functional and a coffeemaker on hand is a plus! Jay is accessible, responds quickly to any questions and offers loads of helpful suggestions on food, drink, and local attractions. Of the various types and levels of accommodation I have tried in Lafayette, this is my hands down favorite!"

Beds and furniture throughout the house was very comfortable and the house was pristine. Wi-Fi was great and he even had Roku so we could watch streaming shows. We spent a lot of time on the back porch. It’s covered and soooo nice. We started every day there and determined our agenda for the day. Then in the evenings, we would sit out there and chat and chill out. I had to check work emails and the Wi-Fi allowed me to log into my virtual desktop. Believe it or not, that’s not always the case!! Would absolutely come back!!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We absolutely loved this place!! Louis is the best host out there hands down. We felt very comfortable and everyone finally got a good nights sleep. My little dogs also really liked the yard.

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Louis’ home is a nice place to stave for a couple of weeks to a couple of days. It has 3 sleeping rooms, however only 2 of them have curtains. The home itself is older, but inside the house there are refurbishments made. I’d loved the master bedroom, the mattress was very comfortable. The television has all the online channels you need. The pool was heated, that was a nice touch. We do think the pool needs some attention. The kitchen has everything you need: enough utensils, basic condiments. Contact with Louis was quick and easy."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Louis was absolutely awesome!! We were probably a little high maintenance at the beginning but Louis was consistent and super helpful at every turn and everything was great! Thank you Louis!!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place! The house was super clean and well provided. We did have an issue with the pool not being very clean but very quickly realized that was not due to lack of maintenance but more the number of trees in the area (we had lots of leaves dropping on us as we swam). The shading the trees provided was amazing in the afternoon so well worth the extra effort in cleaning them out of the pool in the summer!
Absolutely would book again!
Perfect for a family with kids and dogs. Our dogs are a bit bigger than usually allowed many but Louis was very kind to let us stay and we had almost zero issues. There are many squirrels in the area (only small issue we had with our dogs) so if you have extremely prey driven dogs maybe not the best choice but our two 60-70 lb dogs had a great time!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Had a small get-together with some friends and this place was great! Pool was big enough and the house was clean.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"this is an adorable family house in a nice neighborhood. Close to a lot of restaurants. The house appears to be very kid friendly inside. Just be aware that although the backyard is fenced, there is no fence directly around the pool. Backyard would be great for dogs! The heater was not working on the hot tub, but I'm sure the host will see to it. Just ask if it's fixed if it means that much to you. it's summer in Louisiana...the water was warm. Lol."

I would highly recommend this property to people with kids or animals he was very accepting of us bringing our dogs but we decided to not bring them last minute. kids loved the property mostly due to the pool, again Louis contacted me but this time with a call to walk me through the process of turning on the hot tub another great feature.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The pool and hot tub were amazing. I could not believe how warm the pool was.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"beautiful spot, heated pool is awesome. worth the stay"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great location and backyard area. Spacious, just what we needed for 4 adults and 2 kids (and 2 dogs 😊)"
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"I booked the place solely for the pool I never used 😂. It looked just like the pictures. It also appeared to have steam coming from it. Being a cooler night, I’m assuming it was heated though I never checked. (It was a long travel day). The house smelled like dog but it wasn’t unbearable. It was prominent though, if you’re sensitive to that. It was a quick trip just to rest my eyes so I didn’t get to test the beds as I fell asleep on the couch. It was very comfortable. The house was very roomy, bigger than I expected. The house isn’t hard to find but it doesn’t have any numbers to identify it. I reached out and Louis responded almost instantly. I was very pleased with the response time, shocked almost at how fast! The location was very quiet too. I slept well here which is always an important outcome. Overall, the stay served it’s purpose."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice stay. We spent all our time in our private pool and on the terrace in the garden without any overlook. Even beach towels was provided.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Really nice place in a good neighborhood. Very clean and comfortable!
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Louis had a very clean house and was quick to respond. There were a few issues that were a problem with our stay. There was no toilet paper in the entire house. Louis said he would send some over, which he did, but we weren't sure how long we could wait, being 5 people that just came off a 16 hour drive, so we went out to buy our own. We only had a few hours to swim before bedtime and leaving the next morning. Unfortunately, going out for the toilet paper took half our swim time. We also couldn't get the hot tub to turn on. We didn't have instructions. We think we understood it, but we kept getting an error message, that when looked up online, meant the filter system needed cleaning or another possible maintenance issue. We didn't message Louis because at this time it was 11PM, so we called it a night. There were also some very small ants in the master bathroom around the toilet seat area. There were no towel racks in the master bathroom, but mounts where they were supposed to be. These were minor things to me since we wanted to swim and only had a few hours there for the one night we stayed. I would probably stay there again since the backyard and porch were nice and relaxing and we needed the yard for the dog. Also, beds were extremely comfortable and check in was super easy. Hopefully, toilet paper will not be an issues again and the hot tub will get cleaned/fixed."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Excellent place, clean, affordable and the owner was responsive to all of our questions. I highly recommend this home to anyone !"
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is an Amazing place! It would easily sleep six people! Comfortable beds and lots of room to unpack. Spacious, full-size kitchen, separate dining room and living room (which has super cozy couches)! Bedrooms and living room are far apart so the tv won’t disrupt those that are sleeping. Gorgeous cocktail spool (spa/pool)! Perfect for those hot Louisiana evenings! Quiet neighborhood. Ample parking. House is close to everything you need: convenience stores, supermarkets, restaurants, drive through daiquiri barn….. Louis was an awesome host; easy to contact, very responsive, checked in to see if everything was going well. We will definitely be back next year!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Erika has created the perfect space to decompress. I came in late on a chilly, rainy night. The walkway and entrance were warmly lit. The room was cozy with a decorative fireplace heater and treats. The gated entrance is private and quiet, so you feel as if you are home. It was so clean, I felt like I was the 1st person to stay, and if you forgot some small toiletries, she probably has one for you. I will definitely be looking for availability with Erika every time I head to Lafayette.

2023-10-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were disappointed with the housing. It's very beautiful, clean and in a quiet area. But it's not convenient, or really comfortable. There were no plates or bowls for meals and breakfasts. No support to put your belongings in the bedroom and bathrooms (decor everywhere). The mattress was very hard (yet we like firm mattresses) and the pillows really very big and hard. The absence of curtains woke us up early but if you're used to it wouldn't be a problem."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I were passing through the area and needed a last minute stay. Erika responded to my request to book in a timely manner and was very responsive to questions. After a lovely dinner in downtown Lafayette, we found her place easily and were charmed by the Halloween themed decor. This place is separate from the main house, so is very private and quiet. My husband sat on the cute deck outside In the morning. If we have another chance to visit Lafayette, Erika’s space will be our first choice!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place for my small family of 3 to rest our head for the night while passing through. It was beautifully decorated and peaceful. My only suggestion would be to add a fan. The AC unit is higher upper on the wall and so there were spots that were hotter than others like the bathroom and the far side of the bed that was under the AC. But that is a minor thing.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great cozy place, plenty of privacy and super comfortable"

The double bed is comfortable and faces a TV with Netflix and many other viewing options. Erika was very friendly and showed me around the building and it's features. Overall, I give her an A+ for a job well done and keeping the place in good shape. I highly recommend it!"

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Diana's place exceeded my expections, by a long shot! Located very conveniently to the airport, the two story space was impeccably clean and quite modern. There was more than enough space for 4 or more guests, and the neighborhood was quiet. The king size bed upstairs was VERY comfortable, and there were extra blankets, etc. available if needed. The kitchen cabinets were fully stocked with anything appliances/utensils you might need to prepare your own meals. There was also a garage available to park your car securely. I was in town to attend a funeral, so I didn't spend much time at the condo, but Diana easily accommodated my last-minute booking.
Suffice it to say, I'd recommend Diana's place to anyone visiting the Lafayette area who'd like to relax in a modern, upscale environment. ;)"

2020-08-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice place, not nice host!
We have evacuated from a HUGE hurricane that destroyed our city. We accidentally left my sons favorite jersey in the dryer and she text us letting us know her house cleaner would be throwing it out. Upon arrival there was dog hair all on the upstairs floor. My pants were covered in it when unpacking my clothes. They did not have a remote and advised “the precious guest must have stolen it” and said we could buy a new one... then we we left they accused US of stealing their Alexa! So clearly it is a trend to blame their guests on stealing items—may need to check with the house cleaner on that. We went through A LOT with our city being destroyed and this was the least empathetic person I came in contact with. Also, if you like a gift basket upon arrival (aren’t they so fun and special?) you will not get that here. I have stayed at TONS of air bnb and have NEVER had an issue. Hosts are always SO KIND like you’re literally their guest! You won’t get that here.
So again, super nice and cute place, but hostess was far from hospitable!"

2020-08-01,5.0,Group trip,We stayed here for our sons wedding. Our stay was for 4 nights. The condo was amazing. Everything was clean and well stocked with anything we needed. The fenced in back yard was perfect for our dogs. We will definitely stay here again and highly recommend.

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’ll start by saying I’m 57 and have a bad spine and have about decided Airbnb is a young person’s game we’ll be trading for a boring hotel room with much more reliable mattress. However, if you’re healthy, this is a dream spot for Festival International in April! (We stayed Thurs through Sunday. I’ll say the queen mattress in the guest room was not too bad so fortunately I slept there) The place was huge, with great acoustics for streaming music on our wireless speaker, but mostly we enjoyed sitting bar stools up in the bay window for fantastic people watching/impromptu parades that went by. It was so nice to be able to break up the day on Saturday with lunch and respite from the sun in the room, as well as indoor plumbing. The furniture is vintage, which adds to the charm of the place, but isn’t particularly comfortable-probably would be fine for most though. NOTE: There is a refrigerator but NO FREEZER. Coffee is a drip with cone shaped filter. (We were told pod)"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was an amazing spot right in the heart of it all in downtown. Private parking and entrance to the suite made the stay even more convenient. We were lucky to find this gem on short notice and Chris and Meghan graciously ensured our stay was perfect . Anything you might need is readily available :)! We really enjoyed our stay and plan to return!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location in the heart of downtown. Love the vibe of the space.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spot in Laffy! Could use a hairdryer but other than that a great stay!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great!! Loved the open floor plan and all the natural light. My bridal party got ready there for my wedding and there was more than enough space, even with just two bedrooms. Christopher was incredibly helpful. We didn’t get to check in until after 10 pm and realized that we were not sent the instructions from Airbnb. I messaged him and he promptly called me with instructions on how to get in."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,5 star
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always the best staying there
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Best bnb I Ever been to
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a huge, loft-style condo, right in the center of downtown, and right in the middle of everything. The front room is huge - combo living room / open kitchen. The master bedroom is huge with large bathroom with both jacuzzi tub and tiled shower, and double sink. The second bedroom is small but adequate. And the second bath is off the hallway and small but adequate with a tub/shower.
This is a one story walk up (a 2 story building), so be aware of that. The condo is over a bar/restaurant (not operating at the time of my visit), so you don't need to worry about disturbing anyone downstairs. You are in the heart off downtown, and it can be noisy at night when people are out partying, so not good for early to bed types.
There were a few maintenance issues, but I'm sure the owner is taking care of those. The place is very clean, freshly painted, beautiful old wood floors, lovely brick walls. Huge windows. Lots of light. I would rent it again!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Jefferson apartment is absolutely beautiful and definitely worth a stay when you’re in Lafayette!

The location is fantastic—just a short walk from the ULL campus, which made it incredibly convenient for all the orientation activities. The neighborhood is lovely and peaceful, adding to the overall pleasant atmosphere of our visit.

2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Tyler made special accommodations for my daughter and her bridal party to rent this special house to get ready for her wedding. The house was built by her great grandfather and housed many generations of our family before being sold. It truly was a special day.

This house was incredible for all of our aesthetic needs. The kitchen has so much character- it was a dream to create food content in. We had some talent come in and out of the house and all remarked on how adorable it is.

I’ve never experienced Louisiana like I’ve experience Louisiana in that little blue house. There’s something magical and special about that house. It’s like living in the sky, the Cajun sky.
You can hear the train in the morning blowing it’s whistle. That’s a signature of Cajun country. The bayou well it’s just down the street. And that music. My god that music it reminds me of Cajun country.
Tyler Albrecht has created the heart of Louisiana. And it is blue.
I can’t imagine staying anywhere else.

I chose it for his proximity to the Amtrak station and now it will be my go to in the future. I requested to book at the last minute for a Sunday night stay and Teresa was very accommodating; messaging right away and answering any questions that I had. I think what I most loved about the place is the urban decor and that every detail is well thought of. You'll get a variety of cookware, a full kitchen, snacks, towels, bath supplies, coffee, earplugs... you name it, it has it.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Good choice
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lovely place, as shown. Not really in the vibe of town, decor a little cold and not very themed in Lafayette. Nice location. The host communicates well but it's a bit of a copy and paste. It feels like there's a big machine behind. It's not someone who rents their living space. This is the public Airbnb. The building was built to collect live in series and you can feel it. All apartments are rented to tourists. I wouldn't be surprised if it was built especially for that. So less authentic experience that takes advantage of a platform that helps avoid the regulations of the hospitality industry. But we have what's shown for the price."

We didn't end up bringing our dogs but the space was dog friendly without it being obvious that dogs stay there (clean yard and interior space). Everything was comfortable and clean and Teresa was extremely responsive and helpful when we made an error on our booking. We would definitely stay here again!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful loft! Very clean and close to everything!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was our 2nd time staying at Cypress Flats and we will definitely stay with Theresa again ! Great place and host ! Thanks
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great time at this place. Clean, very well equipped and comfortable. It is also very well located for visiting the city center on foot, while staying on a quiet street. The only small inconvenience would be the surprising noisy internet box and the vibrations of the air conditioning of neighbors who reason in the bedroom. But thankfully everything calms down in the evening and that doesn't stop you from relaxing."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was very comfortable and clean. The host made sure to respond as soon as I texted. The overall stay was very peaceful and quiet I loved it.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,we had a great stay. Wished we would have booked more days.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Teresa is an absolute gem! She was proactive with communication and always available for any questions.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You can tell a lot of care and thought has been put in to setting up this location. This was a unit in a single story building where all other units were airbnbs. Parking was in a carpark that was private but open - however felt safe at all times.
We had everything we needed and more including a full kitchen.
Great location in Downtown - we walked almost everywhere and had plenty of choices for cafes/restaurants/bars even on a quiet Sunday.
Teresa was easy to communicate with and gave clear instructions for check in and check out.
Would recommend!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Teresa’s property! Check-in instructions were easy to understand. When we arrived there is a parking lot right next to the gate to get into the building, with a nice sitting area and a fire pit. The build is secure, just make sure you have your keys on you at all times, the doors lock behind you (I liked this a lot, being that the property is downtown). It can get a little noisey during the day inside the building because there are 4-5 other units, but at night it was perfectly quiet and we had no problems. I would absolutely stay here again. Teresa is an awesome host and is very responsive. Everything was very clean and she provided additional things like water bottles, granola bars, etc. 10/10 would recommend!"

We couldn’t have asked for a better experience, and we can’t wait to return for another relaxing getaway."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful place right in the heart of Lafayette! So easy to find and get to and from our other destinations.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The entire experience was everything I expected and more. I originally tried to book the other home Phil owned but missed the booking due to the dates being taken. He was supportive and provided me with this hope and it was incredible. Spacious clean and had everything I needed inside.

2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,New build and as described but major issues with heat. The downstairs would be normal temperature but the heat was so hot upstairs we had to crack the windows. We only had it set at 65. The upstairs rooms are extremely bare. They need to put a dresser or chest of drawers in there. No place to set your bags. I wouldn’t stay here again bc of the thermostat issues and lack of furniture upstairs.

The spaciousness of the unit exceeded our expectations. With three bedrooms, we had plenty of room to relax and unwind after long days of house hunting. The well-designed common areas, including the amazing deck, allowed us to spend quality time together as a family.
The tasteful decor was a standout feature. The interior design added elegance and warmth to the space, creating a welcoming atmosphere. We especially enjoyed the back porch with its beautiful tree, providing a peaceful spot to savor our morning coffee or unwind in the evening.

The beds were comfortable and the AC worked great. We enjoyed the back porch and the views when walking in the nearby neighborhood. The location is central to many things in town. I would highly recommend staying here if needing a place to call home for a few days in Lafayette!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is absolutely perfect! It is well laid out, had anything you would need and included snacks and water! I mean the best rental location if you have an event at the Cajundome. It was clean, had a washer/dryer, stove, fridge-literally anything! We didn’t cook but if we had they had everything there. It is very safe has security cameras so, really safe neighborhood! I plan to visit again and stay here if it’s available. The rental looks exactly like the pictures. I lost the door code 🤦‍♀️and they were absolutely wonderful and quick to help us! My husband and I so enjoyed this place! This will be our choice anytime we go to Lafayette and it’s available!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As soon as I got the the house it was easy check in and easy instructions. The places was so lovely, clean and quiet. Has a sitting place outside and a back porch. The battery to the keyless entry died and when I rang the door bell, she was on top of it to getting it fixed and quick as well! Such great communication and easy check out. Super quiet and I felt at home. Thank you again so much for letting me stay here. It was definitely a lovely quiet home and I can’t wait to come back!!!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were in Lafayette for the funeral of a family member. We had responsibilities that required us to be in town for a full week. Stella's Studio was very comfortable and welcoming and perfect for the two of us during our extended stay. The owners did a great job of creating a safe and comfortable place to stay. It was far above any hotel in Lafayette, and the studio arrangment gave us flexibility for relaxed meals in rather than eating out at restaurants for every meal. Comfortable furniture helped us relax in the evening without having to sit on a bed on an office chair such as we might expect in a hotel. The washer/dryer was a blessing as it relieved us of having to worry about running out of clean clothes as we went about our duties of closing out the home of the deceased loved one. Although this was a trip involving duties, we still have relatives in Lafayette, and we will certainly look to Stella's for accommodations on our more leisurely trips in the future."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"StellaRising was a lovely stopping place on my vacation. It was just right for my sister and I to have the perfect blend of togetherness and privacy in the same stay, but it would also work for a family with several children.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I came to Louisiana for a 2 week work project and stayed at Stella's studio home. There is a pin pad for locking/unlocking the door which I love because I never had to worry about losing a key or wondering where I put it.
The studio is bigger than you think but not too big for 1 person. When I arrived there was a welcome gift bag full of goodies and she knew I was coming from AZ and had Louisiana chips and Arizona Tea waiting for me. (also a bottle of wine!)
I had everything I needed for my stay: plenty of towels, a fully stocked kitchen, washer/dryer & cleaning supplies. I brought my Firestick but I didn't need it because there is a Roku Tv where I could download my own apps and they automatically delete upon checkout. (what a great idea!)
I was working 12 hour days and coming back to Stella's Studio felt like coming home. It was quiet and comfortable. Much better than a hotel room. If I ever find myself in LA again I will be staying here!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed at places around the world and Dana’s place was magnificent! It was better than advertised, very comfortable with exceptional attention to detail and functional. Really spacious. While we did not use the back patio or large backyard, these could be big pluses. The house is on a very charming block, but the surrounding neighborhood is a little rough; though we had no problems. This was a fantastic base for our return to Cajun County and Mardi Gras season."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I what a wonderful place! I could go on and on about how great it is. It is located in a historic neighborhood that is close to the UL campus and all the restaurants that we wanted to try. Sparkling clean with every conceivable amenity. The outdoor space is wonderful and we were even able to use it during some heavy rain storms. Take my advice—stay here. You won’t regret it!

Had all the basics we needed, and the rooms were ample in size. Just what we needed while visiting family in Lafayette. The house was very clean for a dog-friendly home. Lots of room outside for them to run around."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The pictures actually don’t do it justice. The house is stunning and feels more like an incredibly well-appointed residence than a rental. The street is charming and the outdoor spaces are spacious and immaculate. Above all, it is sooo comfortable and cozy. I wish we’d had more time to just enjoy the house!"

Also includes outdoor seating with covered patio. The most gorgeous oak trees surround this historical home. Great neighborhood however I wouldn’t jog or walk too far from this block. We loved our stay and hope to stay here again.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,AMAZING! Even better than the pictures. Historical home with modern updates - charming + clean + really felt luxurious. Outdoor area and yard were excellent as well! Wish we could have stayed longer!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"...during football season we stay at an AirBnB almost every game. But when I say this place is the absolute best AirBnB in Lafayette, it is; HANDS DOWN! No details inside or outside the home were left undone. I almost didn't want to leave a review because the selfish part of me wants to keep it for myself. It was an amazing stay and we will be booking again in the very near future."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This home is amazing. We were in Lafayette for a week and felt so comfortable here. Beautiful yard with live oak trees. Amazing kitchen, very comfortable beds. I definitely recommend this home."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fabulous! There is an event venue next door- and they were having a wedding. The music was perfect for sitting outside with a friend to chat all evening. Everything was clean, and since it was a last minute trip (I’m allergic to most detergents and lavender) Dana offered to bring over sheets washed in unscented detergent - but when I got there it was already unscented, so it was perfect! We walked the backyard and looked at the plants and Dana was kind enough to answer our questions about them. There is one firmer bed, and one softer bed- I chose the softer one and it was so comfortable!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was more than I could have hoped for. The house was lovely with such character and charm. The inside as well as the outside has so much loving detail. Highly recommend this place.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was great! It was so grand and cozy all at the same time. We loved being set back from the peaceful street as we lounged on the front porch, appreciated the fully fenced yard (could be a blast with dogs!), and our toddler LOVED the swing hanging from one of the oak trees out front. The location was quiet but not far from the action. The beds were so comfy and the rooms were all spacious and welcoming. We enjoyed our stay and will keep this at the top of our list for any future travels to Lafayette."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This cottage was better than the pictures: a very large, well decorated, comfortable space completely free of clutter. You can't get any better than a historic home that has been beautifully renovated within walking distance of downtown with a gated driveway. Perfect! My son loved the backyard firepit!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place! Beautiful house. We really enjoyed our stay! Highly recommended.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t say enough wonderful things about our experience! The house was SO CLEAN, which is a big deal to me. As soon as I walked in the door, I was met with the smell of fresh and clean! It’s an older house that has been updated and the updates are perfect. I felt right at home. The neighborhood was so quiet and I never felt unsafe. It was perfect for us and we 100% would stay here again! The only thing I would say is maybe some extra shampoo because I forgot mine and we shared between both bathrooms. That’s it, that’s the only complaint I have and I wouldn’t even call it a complaint lol :)"

2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,The house had enough space for my needs. Felix resolved an issue quickly. I felt the need to wash all items before use because they were sticky or dusty to the touch. Home was comfortable and quiet.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home is located in a fairly well maintained ethnically diverse neighborhood. As a solo female traveler, I found the house to look exactly like the pictures – was very clean, peaceful and quiet. I slept like a baby. The backyard and patio area were divine. I spent the majority of my time out there. All it needed was a hammock to complete the tranquil vibe. Felix was quick with his responses and I would rent again if in the area."
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay. The house was very clean and we did get to check in early. The yard is real nice. We enjoyed the covered patio a lot. The only problem I had was the refrigerator. It never got cold the whole weekend. Hopefully a new fridge is in the future.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I can't say enough about how great our stay was. We were in town working for a few months. Felix response was faster than anyone I have EVER spoke with EVERYTIME I messaged him. Worked with our schedule and allowed me to modify my reservation however we needed. Home was comfortable and had everything we needed. Extremely comfortable, peaceful neighborhood. He kept the grass cut and the trash picked up. If every place I ever have to rent was this great, life would be so much easier. Definitely can't say enough good things! Wonderful people to rent from! Thanks again!!"

,,,"House is old dirty and roach infested with pet scents. We had a dirty pool and broken locks upon arrival and the back door doesn’t close and left us at risk all night with my kids inside. We killed one roach at night in the kitchen and we woke up to 6 all over the house mainly in the kitchen leaving my kids screaming in horror. Light bulbs burned out all over, floor was dirty closets full of garbage and clutter and pantry fridge and freezer had half eaten items inside. Furniture was broken in bedrooms and bathroom door doesn’t close. Gnats in the bathtub we didn’t use. Booked 12 days and left first morning and the owner was in the garage asking how long we will take to leave making it awkward. Super nasty experience do not stay here."
,,,Lack of communication and booking.
