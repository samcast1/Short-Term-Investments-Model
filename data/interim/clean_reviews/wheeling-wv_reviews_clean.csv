2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Charming cabin, responsive host, super clean!
My girlfriends and I just spent a PERFECT 2 days at the Bower for our girls weekend.
Upon walking in using the electric keypad we were greeted by the most charming cabin and the delicious, but not overpowering, smell of apple spice. The hosts had left fresh eggs and bottled water in the refrigerator and small snack bags on the counter - such a thoughtful touch.
The bedrooms have easily accessible outlets, comfortable mattresses, attractive quilts, fuzzy blankets, & the softest sheets I‚Äôve ever slept on (I‚Äôve already ordered a set!).
The gas fireplace was easy to operate and didn‚Äôt overheat the room.
Communication with the host was 10/10. After discovering no dishwasher soap below the sink, I messaged Lloyd and within 5 minutes he was at the door with a replacement.
The cabin was the perfect size and every room was incredibly clean. The hosts have thought of everything. Thanks for sharing your charming cabin! I hope to be back again!"
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Family and I had a great time. The place was exactly as described and the hosts were wonderful.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was an absolutely wonderful experience and a delight to spend a family Christmas in the Bower Cabin! We were blown away by all of the details, the thoughtfulness of the hosts and the beauty of the surroundings! A playground for our kiddos and a farm with chickens, goats and pigs right around the corner were a surprise treat! We will certainly be back to enjoy this pristine cabin again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The perfect place for my family to celebrate the holidays together. Kitchen was fully functional, bedrooms were super cozy and comfortable, and the whole space was super clean. They decorated for Christmas for us, tree and all. That was a very nice touch.

2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"This log cabin is a true gem, offering breathtaking views in a serene atmosphere. Beautifully decorated for the Christmas season, it seamlessly blends, rustic charm with modern comforts. The cozy living area, well-equipped kitchen, and plush bedrooms, exceeded our expectations. The outdoor space, including a charming deck and fire pit provided a perfect escape into nature. The host was easy to contact during our stay, and gave us fresh eggs for breakfast from his farm. Definitely worth a return visit‚Ä¶"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Bower is a beautifully renovated and comfortable cabin. We especially appreciated the well-stocked kitchen so we had the tools necessary to cook meals, as well as the USB ports in the nightstands for charging phones. The care and attention to detail that goes into preparing it for guests is very evident. If we‚Äôre ever back in the area looking for lodging, we won‚Äôt hesitate to stay here again!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place really brought us comfort during a hard time in our lives. Beautiful space. Peaceful. Gorgeous views and sunsets. But still close to shopping and restaurants. We utilized the Swift for a few days and were able to accommodate our entire family and friends to celebrate a loved one‚Äôs life. We then moved into the Bower which is more intimate and cozy and was perfect for when everyone left and it was just 4 of us. Definitely will recommend and will definitely be back.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay!
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Just beautiful. We used this for the bridal party to get ready and it was absolutely picture perfect. The best part was it‚Äôs close proximity to the reception venue!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful clean quiet home. Couldn‚Äôt have asked for anything better.

Kitchen was well-stocked. Closest stores/ restaurants only 10 minutes away. Highly recommend.
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"We were greeted by our hosts with warm smiles, and hospitality. We later asked if they had a grill for us to use. They politely said no not at this time. About a half hour later, Lloyd shows up and he and his wife Amy are carrying a fire pit/grill for us to use. It was awesome. He later brought us some firewood, which was a real classy move as he stacked it, and made a little bit of a starter fire in the fire pit. The house is very clean, well appointed and comfortable. We would absolutely recommend this house and the host. We had a fantastic family vacation."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very Charming cabin. It was very clean, decorated tastefully, and only about 3 miles from shopping and several restaurant choices.

Beds were comfortable.
If we make it back to WV area we would book it again."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were in town for a birthday party at Oglebay but having stayed at the cabins at Oglebay before, I can say that both the value and quality of the Bower cabin was far exceeding the space we would have had on property. The cabin was decorated beautifully and the ambience in the fall was spot on. We are happy to have a space we can rent again when we are in town to visit family and friends. Lloyd was quick to respond and easy to work with. We will definitely stay again."

The porch is awesome, and we spent much of the evening and morning out there. The property is situated atop a hill where you can watch weather roll along to the sound of wind chimes. It's not far from the highway, which was easy for navigating, though it also can be heard from the house. Hosts were easy to communicate with and timely on their responses. Overall, we would stay here again in a heartbeat, and we would recommend it for your consideration."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"I enjoyed my stay at Kristy's place. Convenient access from the highway, and an easy walk to the Heritage Trail."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a charming small apartment, tastefully furnished. I felt at home during my stay in Wheeling. I really appreciated being right downtown and in the middle of some very beautifully restored Victorian era brownstones. It is right across the street from the East Atlanta Clayworks, which has beautiful ceramic goods for sale."
2022-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,Nice apartment! Wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of the location but it was clean and comfy for a night.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Neat little place to stay! We went to see the xmas lights at olgeby Park which was a very short drive away. 10 min. Also went to a little soul food place which was nice. 5 min walk. Wish there would have been a tv in bedroom but not a big deal, we had an alternative activity to keep us busy! Haha. We would stay again!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed the stay very much.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Love the stay will book again if in the area.
2022-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We liked the apartment more than staying in a Hotel. The apartment had a lot of space to move about and it felt private. It was an older building and it had charming antique fireplaces (non-functioning) it would have been great if they had a gas log insert. We would stay again. We were in the upstairs apartment the stairs were kind of steep for us old people so next time we would want the first floor unit, there are 5 units altogether I think. The one thing I would recommend is to bring towels and wash cloths we only had one set for a 3 night set."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place for a nights rest while working out of town. I loved the availability of the restaurants, coffee shops, and downtown, all within walking distance. Very cozy and clean."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great little place to stay while hanging out in Wheeling for a couple nights. Walkable to cute places to eat and drink, the river path, and most of downtown. It was comfortable, had a nice kitchen and living room, and even a little back porch which I would have used had the weather been nicer. Would stay here again."
2022-11-01,4,Stayed one night,"Very comfortable lodgings, especially the bed! Lots of high-pressure hot water in the shower. Central location to most everything in town."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Very spacious in a quiet area! I was only there one night so I didn‚Äôt get to explore the area but the bed was very comfortable and the heat worked well! Definitely would recommend!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kristy is a friendly and helpful host and the home is lovely. I enjoyed lounging in the comfortable chair in the living room and cozying up under the velvety throw blanket. The bed is also very comfortable and the place was stocked with everything I needed including coffee! This was a fantastic value for the price and I would definitely stay here again. :)
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic place, fantastic stay!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is great! Exactly as advertised and convenient to pretty much everything in Wheeling. Thanks so much for hosting us! We‚Äôll book again when we come back through.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I (or my family) have stayed in Kristy/Joseph‚Äôs apartments on 3 separate occasions now. Always a pleasure and their places are so cute! It‚Äôs nice to see some other revitalization projects happening on this street, too!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to stay in Wheeling!
Very clean, spacious apartment in the heart of downtown Wheeling, you can walk to restaurants and cafes, and there are plenty in the vicinity.
Just a great place and fantastic value. Way better than staying in one of the many chain hotels."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very convenient drive from Wheeling Hospital.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Yes to Kristy‚Äôs place! Her place is so cozy & spacious. Bed,pillows,linens were great & shower pressure was too. I got in late from traveling so that‚Äôs all I did lol but all that was needed. Cool historic building if ur a light sleeper it is on front street w/ older windows but I had earplugs & fan didn‚Äôt bug me 1 bit. Also up a flight of carpeted steps before in the apartment if u have trouble walking or heavy luggage again jus small heads up but 5‚≠êÔ∏èall the way was clean & safe & would stay again in area."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great communication & perfect stay in Wheeling
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kristy is a great host and very accommodating. We booked all 4 apartments in the building for a girls weekend in Wheeling and had a great time. Coffee on the back porch and an easy walk along the river were standout moments, made possible by the convenient location of this place. We were comfortable and content with our choice of accommodations, and would do it all over again!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfectly central and a huge apartment

Excellent recommendations
Great communication
Highly recommend üëç"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay near downtown and super close to the bike trail. Clean and comfortable. Our favorite place to eat was Figaretti's. Make a reservation.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place to stay. Clean and quiet.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little place. Tidy, full kitchen. There were linens (towels and such) despite the listing saying there were not, so that was a pleasant surprise. Walking distance to just about everywhere in Wheeling. We didn't really need our host for anything, but she gave us great instructions on how to get in and left us a little guide around town for places to eat and such.
My only criticism is for those, like me, going to Wheeling to work: The only place to sit and use a computer was in the kitchen, at a table or counter that wasn't at all suited to getting anything done. So, if you're on a business trip, you might bring a lap desk.
Otherwise, A+, would stay again. Thanks Kristy!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location as a base for biking rail trails and local hiking. Highly recommend Sarah‚Äôs on main croissants, wheeling coffee drinks, later alligator restaurant and rte 88 bbq. Kristy‚Äôs place- clean, convenient parking, roomy for 2 with nice closet and storage space and able to cook simple meals easily ."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cool place. Interesting older building and apartment. While you can see the old bones, the apartment has been really well maintained and strategically updated and is clean and bright - wonderfully big windows letting in lots of natural light. The bed was very comfortable. The Rails to Trails pathway along the ohio river is 2 blocks from the front door - really nice walk."

2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The apartment was just as described! Well equipped with everything necessary to feel at home. Location was ideal, as we were in town for a concert at the Capital Theater. We were able to walk the trail along the river and enjoy the view."
2022-04-01,3,Stayed one night,"This apartment was a mixed bag. It's very close to I-70 and the bed was quite comfortable & as depicted in the photos, but the rest of the apartment was run down, with old and stained furniture, etc. The front door into the building's foyer was not lockable, which made this place feel a bit unsafe for the solo traveler, and the steps leading up to the apartment smelled of mildew. On the other hand, it was one of the cheaper Airbnb places available in the Wheeling area."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was perfect and I will happily stay here again! This beautiful place is very affordable and in a great location. I had no issues and everything was stress-free!!!!

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kristy's place is an incredible value in a nice, quiet location. The massive Ohio River is directly across the street (a paved walking trail runs parallel) and you are a short walk from the Wheeling Suspension Bridge and the Fort Henry Bridge. Kristy communicated everything effectively so checking in and out was very easy. The place itself was very clean and full of character. I would not hesitate to book again."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great experience! The house was amazing and full of detail. You could tell immediately the amount of heart was put into it.

Highly recommend and will definitely check for availability when visiting again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,I cannot say enough great things about Sara‚Äôs place or her hospitality & responsiveness. Myself and my wife & kids felt right at home. So much so that we have established that Sara‚Äôs place will be our new go-to when we head back to the Ohio Valley area to visit family. The place was also so perfectly decorated and designed that we stole some inspiration to to take back and implement at our own home. The Emerald House is a must visit!!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exceeded expectations. Clean , comfortable accommodations. Had everything we needed and more. Sara was a wonderful host . Answered questions quickly with great communication. Would definitely stay again if in Wheeling again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"What an amazing place. Sara was very nice and easy to communicate. If you message her with question, she is very quick to response. Her instructions are very clear and to the point. The place is outstanding. If I go to Wheeling, I will definitely rebook to her place."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had such a wonderful time and Sara was so accommodating with everything we needed to enjoy our wedding weekend. The home is in a very easy to get to location with plenty to do close by, street parking was super easy and the house was pristine! The fenced in back yard and patio furniture was so nice to enjoy a fresh coffee in the morning.
BONUS: Sara was so prepared with all the things we could have forgotten to bring for our doggies, we loved being able to have them with us all weekend and they loved it too!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Emerald House is even more beautiful in person. As a Wheeling local, this provided a perfect get away to celebrate finishing college. It was hard to believe something so beautiful was hiding so close to home! Whether you are traveling from far away, or just wanting to host a few friends for board games‚ÄîI promise you will walk away wanting to come back. I know I do. Hope to book with you again soon, Sara!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sara‚Äôs place was by far the best Airbnb I have stayed at. Every little detail was meticulously thought through. The house had so much charm that could not be captured in pictures. Very clean, close to many Wheeling favorites and Sara was such a wonderful host. 10/10 would stay again!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was the nicest Airbnb that we have ever stayed in. Absolutely beautiful & she had everything, and I mean EVERYTHING that you needed there. I really cannot say enough about this place & how much we liked it. Every amenity possible was inside. Great job on the remodel, Sara!!! I would give this place 10 stars if that was an option."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"The Emerald House is an absolute gem! Sara has done an amazing job revitalizing this space, from the decor to all the amenities that she provides throughout the space - it is perfection. The space is cozy with comfortable furniture that makes you feel right at home. Sara is an amazing host from her communication before and during our stay to the snacks she provided for our enjoyment. We will definitely stay here again when we are back in the area. Job well done!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place looks better than the pictures! Sara was a great host, and really made sure everything was perfect for us! The house was spotless, and very tastefully furnished. My favorite thing about the entire property is the downstairs shower. It has things I didn't know a shower needed! The upstairs bed is the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on. This is my new favorite Airbnb. I highly recommend it. Absolutely perfect!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"5 stars is not enough! Sara‚Äôs home is absolute perfection. There‚Äôs no detail that hasn‚Äôt been thought of. The minute you walk in the door, you never want to leave. Sara is a thoughtful, communicative host who makes you feel so welcome. This is the first place I‚Äôve ever stayed that I can‚Äôt wait to book again!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Stay was flawless.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was perfect, I appreciated all the kindness shown to me during my stay. Great communication, extremely clean, beautifully decorated. Thank you so much!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Don‚Äôt be concerned with the downtown street redevelopment. Emerald House is a jewel amongst the historic row houses in downtown Wheeling. I felt safe and it was a very quiet home. It‚Äôs worth the stay. I look forward to revisiting Wheeling and watching all the changes as the downtown area becomes a new destination! Emerald House is the perfect place to stay and explore everything Wheeling has to offer!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved the place - spacious, super-clean, very stylish, and a million little touches that made it feel like home. My family and I have stayed in ten AirBnB's all over the US and Europe in the last 12 months, and this was easily the best-appointed and most well-thought-out property we've stayed at. We were only in town for one night -- on our way to see the eclipse in Ohio -- so we didn't get a chance to kick back on the lovely deck out back or use the kitchen beyond making tea for breakfast. (And yes - it's a real kitchen, with real kitchen wares, that you could really cook in.) And a fantastic shower! When life takes me back to Wheeling, this is where I'm staying."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Emerald House was amazing. Everything you can think an air bnb should have, it was there plus more. The set up was fantastic. The home is beautiful. It has been newly renovated with beautiful added touches yet keeping the integrity of the old home. I reccomend this home.
Sara was fast to getting back to us with full detailed answers to our questions. She had recommendations to restaurants, coffee and pastries, and grocery from mom and pop to large chains. There was a welcome gift of coffee beans from her favorite coffee shop, and it was good, thankyou. Then there were candles and room sprays that were left for our use. Such a sweet touch of such amazing fragrances.
The area is an up and coming area with lots of construction going on but nothing too bad. It is necessary to bring this town back to how it was intended.
Again, a must stay again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Sara's place was gorgeous! The whole place is well put together and you can tell she took her time with the details! She had everything we needed to feel right at home. The back yard was absolutely perfect for us to let the dogs out without having to keep them on a leash. Sara was so sweet and incredibly helpful - we came into town to take a look at a couple of Jeeps and asked her what she knew about the dealership we were working with - she didn't know much about them, but went out of her way to ask around to see what her friends and family had to say. This was a last minute booking for us since we were traveling with our dogs, but we would stay again in a heartbeat!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a truly wonderful space that is worth every penny. Really homey, nicely decorated, very spacious and clean. Just a great space with absolutely fantastic hosts."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I only stopped for the night, was very comfortable."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect accommodations for a travel nurse on contract. Everything was exactly as described in the listing.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very accommodating with our strange schedule. The property caretaker Jim is wonderful, attentive, giving, open to conversation! Everything you need is there - bathroom is technically shared with other renters, but we had the whole floor to ourselves and we didn‚Äôt have to share. Location was ideal for our events."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had a great stay on Wheeling Island. Host (Jim) gave me a warm welcome, explained everything I needed to know for a pleasant stay, and answered some questions I had about the area. Very clean and comfortable stay. Lot's of room and everything I needed. Safe neighborhood and very walkable. Loads of history is this area, as well. I'll definitely stay here again! Great value for the price."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,The host was incredibly helpful and communicative with all of our questions and was even very helpful when we thought we locked our keys in our car and graciously offered for us to use their triple A service. All in all one of the best Air BnB stays at a super low price!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place is HUGE and the gentleman who runs the place is extremely capable, efficient and helpful!"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,Stopped here for the eclipse; it was a good place to stop for the night. Thank you for the stay!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Quiet, clean, and comfortable. Excellent communication in advance - and a friendly welcome on arrival. A spacious room with an anteroom and shared bath. Walk to downtown. I regret that I only had a quick overnight; would have enjoyed lingering and exploring a bit."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Was just looking for somewhere to crash on a long drive back home. This place was very conveniently located and easy to get in and out. Will be back for future road trips
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely one of our favorite stays we‚Äôve ever had. Such a lovely area.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jacory and Anita's place is a comfy house for a comfortable stay. Apartment 2, where we stayed is spacious with a beautiful view. Huge window plan with abundant sunlight!
The unit has two connected rooms- a bedroom and a 'study' room. Both rooms were clean and comfortable- lots of drawers and storage places.
Jim the caretaker, is a charming man. He made us feel 'homely', attentive and friendly. He gave us nice suggestions of a corner Chinese restaurant- amazing place.
Strongly recommend."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"A perfect overnight stop while on a road trip. The room was spacious, yet cozy. Charming, with a pleasing touch of vintage. Friendly hosts! Great stay."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"It surprised us on how big the bedroom is, even though is exactly as the photos. Everything was clean and smelling good, it was easy to find the location and get in. Thank you also for answering our doubts so quickly."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jim, the on-site caretaker, had us call him as we got close, then directed us where to park and let us in. The room was much more spacious than I had realized. It's a beautiful space! We followed the advice to dine at Golden Chopsticks just a block away (which now has a new name). The unexpected pleasant surprise were the neighbors a few houses down who had an impressive Christmas light display and came out to take photos and give us free candy canes! For anyone coming to stay in December, be sure to check out the display on N Huron & Kentucky!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jacory and Anita and their AirBnB manager, James were really nice and super awesome with being flexible about letting us check-in early since we had a wedding to get to. AirBnB was super cute itself- charming Victorian home, spacious rooms, and quite clean!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Jim was super nice and helpful! Pretty cool old house and the room felt nice and comfy and private. Overall an enjoyable stay!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,A great deal and a charming old house with a great host. Would/will stay there again!
2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"Our accommodations were spartan but clean, and we stayed only one night since we were on an eastbound trip. Jim (onsite caretaker) was courteous and helpful, and pointed us to a nearby Chinese restaurant which was one block away and served generous portions."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"There was a mix up with my reservation and they had to put me in a different room than what I booked. They did their best to make it right, however. Jim was very friendly and helpful."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,I would most certainly stay here again if going back to the area. The places was very easy to find and Jim was awesome! VERY clean space and you will feel at home.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great Affordable Stay!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at this listing for two nights, and everything was great. Jim was very friendly and responsive, and he gave me the lay of the land once I arrived. I will likely be back when I'm in the area and looking for a place to stay."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Jim & crew are very responsive with messages. Spacious room that has what you‚Äôd need for a one to few night travel. Conveniently located right off the highway. Nice hot shower.
One thing I would‚Äôve appreciated as a solo female traveler is a heads up in the description there is a sliding door in back of the dresser to the next room?"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,It was peaceful and very cute. There is an amazing little Chinese restaurant just down the road. And very close to Oglebay. It‚Äôs well worth the price!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The house was lovely. We enjoyed the antique radio in our room and relaxing on the porch swing as a storm came in. Jim, the caretaker was attentive to any need or question. Look forward to staying here again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely enjoyed my stay. Jim was very helpful, personable, and a joy to visit with. The room was amazing and more than I had expected! I would definitely stay again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I enjoyed my stay in Wheeling! Perfect comfortable and spacious suite for a solo traveler or couple for night. Jim was extremely helpful and responsive, even with a late check-in and I appreciate them being so accommodating. Would recommend!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great price, great place! We loved unit 2. Everything was as described. Very clean and cozy. We felt safe. Jim was very kind. He sent us home with a baby plant too. We would definitely stay here again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Easily accessible to many directions you wish to go - either explore the island that is Wheeling or the rest of the city or head over to Ohio! Jim makes sure to greet you during check-in and explains the layout.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jim us very cordial. I slept well overnight. I was able to get an Uber to drive me to Market St downtown, but couldn't get an Uber or Lyft to drive me back. I'm not sure if it was because it wasn't a moneymaking drive being short, or because Market St is under construction, or due to the Island location or because it was the 3rd of July. Anyways, that has not much to do with the hospitality of the Airbnb hosts, but something to consider possibly. Responses from the hosts and Jim were fast and kindly received! Thanks!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I were happily greeted and welcomed when we arrived. The house manager, Jim, gave us some wonderful suggestions when we wanted to dine out. At the end of our mini getaway, we were sent home with a plant, which is now added to my little collection at home. We will absolutely be back!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"I came through here on a bike tour of the Midwest and I have to say, this listing exceeded my expectations. Very easy to check in and out. Jim, the live-in property manager, was a fantastic help, and just a truly kind man, checking on me prior to my arrival and, when I arrived, talking to me about the area and the history of the place. Really sweet. As far as the space, it felt like an entire apartment, beautifully furnished, and just an absolute treat after a long day on the road. Everything a traveller could need, from fridges to washing machines, etc. Wheeling was also a really cool place if you're into exploring unique and often overlooked parts of America. Lots of history. Overall a great stay, fantastic value for the money, and if I were in the area again, I'd happily stay here."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"I stayed in this location as a one night stopover on a roadtrip. The owner was very responsive and Jim, the onsite host, was gracious and offered us one of his houseplants. The unit #2 is at the top of two flights of stairs and is actually two rooms, a small room with some antiques and a microwave, and a large bedroom as seen in the photos with a bed, dresser, couch, and large window bay area, and a television with cable. I appreciated having a lock on the bedroom door but felt safe in the house regardless. The parking on the side of the house is on the street. Jim kindly noted that we needed to park in the direction of the one way street. Thanks for a lovely stay!"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean, spacious, comfort and quiet. It was perfect for me. Very nice host. I highly recommend it."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"One of the most interesting places I've stayed w Air B&B- Like stepping into yesteryear. The second floor was large and comfortable w private bath down the hall. With an attached sitting room, the bedroom suite had large windows looking out to clapboard houses; the room is kinda dark in the evening in a sultry kind of way. Although the furniture is older, the bed was quite comfortable. I especially liked the old domed topped wooden trunk in the sitting room. Communication and arrival were a snap, on street parking directly in front. Not for those seeking modern, but if you like quaint and cozy, this is for you."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a charming place! We really enjoyed the cozy room and we felt like we had the whole place to ourselves. The neighborhood is full of beautiful Victorian homes and an easy drive into the city or areas nearby. Jim was a gem and welcomed us like old friends. If we're in the Wheeling area, we would definitely be back. For the price and location, you can't beat it."

2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is a MUST STAY if you‚Äôre going to wheeling for any reason. Jim, the caretaker, is absolutely wonderful. He‚Äôs very helpful if you need anything and he‚Äôs very nice to sit on the porch and chat with. The room is adorable and very welcoming, and though the town looks a little rough around the edges my sister and I were met with nothing but wonderful people! The old homes are absolutely gorgeous and it was so nice to see them being restored slowly but surely! Will definitely be booking again!!"

2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Let me start by saying the room is larger than I expected. It's actually more like two rooms because you have a desk and microwave in one part and the bed, a couch, and a mini-fridge in another. There is enough parking near the house on the street. The neighborhood was safe and an easy walk to downtown (I had a car, but wanted to explore the area a little on foot). Jim, the on-site host, is really friendly and will do what he can to make your stay great. I'm gonna do what I can to keep my plant alive!
I would stay here again if I am ever back in the area."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We booked this in a pinch and could not have been happier. Jim was incredibly friendly and super helpful at check-in. The water pressure was amazing in the shower.

This place is conveniently located in a quiet neighborhood right off I-70 and is perfect for breaking up a long trip. Highly recommend."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed one night,The space is really wonderful and unique! It is a charming old house with multiple rooms or suites within it. Perfectly clean! And Jim (who stays on the premises to help guests) is phenomenal! So kind and flexible! He even gave us a small plant to take with us that he harvested from one of the plants in the house. Overall a great experience!
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful stay at this historic home. Jacory was always quick to respond to questions and the home's caretaker Jim was a great communicator as well, if we had any questions at all. The location is very central to many areas such as downtown Wheeling, Bridgeport, St. Clairesville, Olgeby Park, Wheeling Park and much more. Jim gave us some great recommendations for places to eat! The price was very reasonable as well. Would stay again if in the area."

2019-05-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"2nd floor room is pretty, however no laundry or kitchen. Good a/c. Sitting room could use blinds to be cooler. I felt bad for Jim huffing up the stairs, & wondered if he expected a tip. Nice guy, however he isnt a cohost and so i couldnt see his photo ahead of time, nor could he read my profile to know my needs. Little awkward... for him too I think"

2018-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always good
2018-01-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"All in all they were a nice couple over text . The land lord is not very agreeable so that made it kinda uncomfortable but he did make an effort .It was a beautiful room in a charming home . The down side being I was under the impression that I could use the kitchen so I bought food before I got there and when asking if I could use the fridge I was told that the kitchen is currently closed. Then I started having an asthma attach in to room and asked the land lord if maybe I could get a new comforter at which point he came up with the spotlight to inspect my comforter and then told me that there was no way that there was animal hair in the room , which there was on the couch and in the dresser . I did understand that they don‚Äôt allow pets and sometimes people sneak pets in so I didn‚Äôt get upset it wasn‚Äôt there fault but arguing with me about a blanket was uncomfortable again . In the end it was a cute room in a charming home and I got what I paid for , I can‚Äôt fault the owners because they were pleasant and really were trying, I wish they were at the address to help instead of the land lord ."
2018-01-01,4,Stayed one night,"Friendly helpful hosts.

2017-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great as usual
2017-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent Place!
2017-11-01,4,Stayed over a week,"The room itself is beautiful and spacious. However, to the SOLO FEMALE TRAVELERS looking into this location, please be aware that Jim, the caretaker of the house, made various inappropriate comments and actions towards me which made my stay uncomfortable during the latter half. I have already sent a private message to the airbnb owners with details, however whether or not they talk to him about it or take any action, I am unsure.
If you are staying for a short period of time or are with another person, then you will probably be fine. I stayed here for 5 weeks due to a hospital rotation (I am a PA student)."
2017-10-01,4,Stayed one night,Great location for someone passing through Wheeling. Very easy to get on and off the highway. Very quiet.
2017-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"Anita was very helpful, with last minute accommodations and just as helpful when I had to cancel due to an unforeseen situation."
2017-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"Jacory and Anita's home is conveniently located off 470. You can get on and off the road very easily from their home.
The room is clean and spacious. I liked that there was a side room with a reclining chair and plenty of floor space so I could do yoga and meditation in that room while my boyfriend was asleep in the main room.
There's a nice little Chinese restaurant a block or two from their home.
I think as others have indicated, Wheeling is pretty limited in its restaurant offerings, and even then, most are best accessed by car.
If you're looking for a quick overnight stop between destinations, this is a great choice."

2017-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"A great place to stay. Jim ""runs a tight ship"". I felt safe and comfortable there.
A great one night stay for this solo cyclist."
2017-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay here! Communication was easy and Jim was very helpful when we arrived.
2017-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful place for a graduate student passing through to stay and write a little of her thesis. My room was beautiful and peaceful!
2017-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was an awesome old home! We were unfortunately only there to sleep so did not get to explore the area. We are planning on visiting again and would definitely stay here again.
2017-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great folks to deal with -- friendly, responsive, and professional. The house was clean and neat and in a quiet neighborhood and we slept well. Would stay again if we ever pass that way again."
2017-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,I thought the room was as advertised. The bathroom could have been a little cleaner.
2017-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved my stay at this house. Jacory and Anita were excellent communicators and were easy-going and flexible when I needed to extend my stay for a few days. The house was cozy and beautiful. It was a great experience all around. Thanks, guys!"
2017-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house was just what I wanted for my time in Wheeling! The home is warm, cozy, and classic, with plenty of wood and antiques lending to its character. The space is roomy, clean, and quiet. Jacory, Anita, and Jim were all so welcoming and helpful. Thanks again!"
2017-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful house. Great communication. Thanks again!
2016-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fabulous find. We are driving cross-country and sadly only needed one night. We were in and out, but LOVED this place. We had excellent communication the whole time with Jacory & Anita. Jim was there to give us a warm welcome and show us everything! The room is so comfortable and gives you a feel of the history of the home. You also have a separate sitting area. Shared bathroom (not a problem) with the sweetest antique bathtub (and shower). It was conveniently right off hwy 70, but in a completely quiet neighborhood. Loved it!"
2016-11-01,4,Stayed one night,We enjoyed staying at this place. It was easy to access from the interstate and Jim was very cordial and we felt welcomed.
2016-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place for a night on the road! Thanks a bunch.
2016-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful, adorable suite with a sunny reading room and a cute porch. My only regret is that because I was in town on business, I didn't get time to relax in its plushness. Jim, the caretaker was friendly and flexible when an accident messed with our eta. I have business in the area approximately once a year and will likely see if it's available then."
2016-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Jim, the house manager was very accommodating and made sure we had everything we needed! Very nice and quiet place to stay and only 5 minutes from the hospital I was working at."
2016-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect place. I got a whole suite with queen bed for myself plus one nice living room area.
I love this place. Highly recommended!"
2016-10-01,5,Stayed one night,The room was amazing and Jim was really nice. They were very flexible and helped with any questions we had. I would recommend this to anyone who needs to stay in the area. It wasn't hard to find at all and it was very close to some restaurants and the city of wheeling. It was a great place.
2016-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I liked staying in this home. It's an older home yet had the amenities I needed. I felt taken care of, had ample space, great price."
2016-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cool Victorian house, centrally located, easy parking, ultra clean sheets (!) and bathroom, nice kitchen to cook in. Jim is very accomodating and nice and accessible when you need him. Slept like a baby. Reasonably priced. Will definitely come here again. Thanks, Jacory and Anita and Jim!"
2016-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"it was a secure problem free experience, and we plan to return next year for the 2017 Blues Festival. We really liked the fact that Jim the caretaker lives at the property. He was an excellent host. the stay met our expectations and is in line with our anticipation and experience of airbnb sites. our stay was seamless both for arrival and exit."
2016-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Thank you Dominique. You were wonderful. Loved your Dog as well.
2016-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My girlfriend and I had a great time and were very pleased with our stay. The home is quaint and very comfortable and Jim is an awesome host. Definitely recommend.
2016-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,It's an old house in a neighborhood that's seen better days. But the manager was friendly and let me keep my bike and bike rack in the garage. Wifi and A/C worked. Plenty of hot water. No complaints.
2016-06-01,2,Stayed one night,"I was glad that my 20 something year old daughter did not book this place for herself. The room was spacious and well air conditioned, but I did not feel very safe. Neither of my doors locked or even closed completely. Jim, the apartment house property caretaker, assured me that his room was near the front door downstairs, and all would be well. This place would be OK for a group who are rafting or hiking nearby, but it's not a neighborhood to walk in alone at night."
2016-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jacory was extremely responsive leading up to my trip and the on-site property manager, Jim, was an absolute delight. The space was exactly as described. Sweet historic house, very comfortable and close to everything we could have needed (right off the highway, close to downtown, plenty of amenities nearby). One of my best airbnb experiences overall!"
2016-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Jim the host was excellent. Very friendly and very attentive. Kept up with my needs.
2016-05-01,4,Stayed one night,"We stopped overnight here for our first night of our Midwest tour. The listing and pictures are very accurate. Jim, the caretaker, greeted us at the door. Since it was in the high 80s, there was an AC window unit that had cooled our room well. He had turned it on before we even got to the room so it was refreshing after our 5 hour drive.
The shower space felt cramped but such is in a small tub. We were thankful for the provided soap and shampoo since I forgot ours.
We didn‚Äôt use the downstairs because we checked in around 1130p and left at 9a the next day. The caretaker Jim offered us some snacks/water on our way out.
Neighborhood is a bit off the beaten path. Quiet for the most part.
Host: even though this is an ‚Äòinstant book,‚Äô I had a few questions that I asked and Jacory was very quick to respond and easy to communicate with."
2016-05-01,5,Stayed one night,The amount of sunlight was inviting. Neighborhood was quiet. Host was friendly and very accomodating.
2016-04-01,2,Stayed one night,"Less than expected. It was clean, friendly and accommodating. My first Airbnb. A $54.00 room listing was $77.00, little pricy for the accommodations. Fabulous reviews from May of 2014...however, it's only been open since ~ March 2016 ???
Owners not there, it was the tenant that greeted me and was helpful. No A/C."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"The property was fantastic. Very clean and well decorated. Cara is a wonderful host. Having bottled water in the fridge to the extra toiletries in the bathroom in case you forgot something are the little things that differentiate Cara and her beautiful house from the competition. If I'm ever in Wheeling again, this will be the first place I look to reserve. Highly, highly recommended."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,The host was the best we have ever had. We will definitely be back
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,this is a return trip for me! More to explore. Nice and peaceful. Quiet area. Lots to see! Will go again!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect stay! Plenty of space and the apartment had everything you could possibly need! The house was beautifully decorated for Christmas too! Definitely will stay again! Thank you!!!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Julie and John‚Äôs place was a great stay! Excellent hosts. Great communication and the place was very clean and spacious. 10/10. Thank you Julie and John!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We only stayed one night and since there was just 3 of us, we only used one of the two units. The units are like two separate apartments with locks on both entrances and no connecting door but the downstairs door locks so I guess you could leave the two entrance doors unlocked. One unit had a kitchen, bedroom, living room, and bathroom. The unit we stayed in had a kitchen, 3 bedrooms (one is small with a twin bed) and a bathroom. The units are older and could use some remodeling but they were clean and had comfortable beds. John was very friendly and helpful. One thing, the side walk is big rocks so a little uneven walking and stairs are steep and a little difficult to navigate with luggage."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our stay at Simmons Landing. The host was very accommodating and quick to respond when we had questions. You won't be disappointed if you book with them!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely amazing place and hosts!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,The place was awesome!! They were super friendly. Will stay again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Julie n John were very responsive, helpful n friendly. Simmons Landing has great atmosphere on Wheeling Island on bank of Ohio River watching boats n barges. The lodgings were great for our 2 couples n had everything we needed. They had coffee, necessities n treats. A definite must stay if visiting Wheeling n surrounding area! We will stay again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,We had plenty of room and enjoyed the view of the river! Will defiantly book again if in the area.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location, great hosts! Would stay here again the next time we are in town!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to stay in Wheeling West Virginia close to everything
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Great cozy little spot!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great stay at Julie and John‚Äôs place. Absolutely excellent value and a great location right by the water. The place was clean and had everything we needed. If this place is available when I come to Wheeling for my son‚Äôs football game I‚Äôll definitely book again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,John & Julie are great hosts. Their place is always clean and they are very accommodating. They also add a lot of small things that sometime are not thought of.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful neighborhood,spacious rooms and close to the casino"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, responsive and helpful hosts. Would definitely stay again."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Loved this place I couldn‚Äôt and wouldn‚Äôt complain about anything plenty of space beautiful spot. Came here on a work trip would come back if allowed.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"We had a great stay. Plenty of room, friendly hosts, and a nice location overlooking the river."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We all had an excellent time staying at Julie and John‚Äôs place! The view is beautiful from the backyard. We will definitely be returning! They were very friendly as well which was much appreciated! Overall - definitely recommend!!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"your place is awesome! I'll be back hopefully next year!
great layout and I liked the setup!
be back for sure"
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice place
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Julie had messaged me the day before to see what our ETA would be and had everything ready for us when we arrived. Explained parking since we did have 3 cars to transport our softball team to games. Of course Mother Nature wanted to have above normal temps during the day and the ac units hadn't been installed yet. Which I fully understood ours at home isn't on yet either. When I asked if we could get one installed for the Riverside of the house John was there and had it installed in a couple hours not only tht brought some extra fans. It was greatly appreciated since we did have one mom with bad allergies and asthma. I wish we would have been able to enjoy the back yard more in the evening it's a relaxing atmosphere watching the barges.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My mother, grandfather, and I came to visit and this was the perfect space! It was spacious, clean, and had all we needed. Definitely recommend!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is actually two apartments side by side, so you can have lots of privacy from other members of your party if you want. Be sure to poke around and find the balcony with views of the river (which I somehow forgot about and didn't find until checking out!!). The steps are steep, so be prepared if that's an issue for you. Excellent high speed internet. Quiet neighborhood with interesting Victorian houses around. A quick walk from the historic suspension bridge. Recommended!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for the weekend to attend the PBR rodeo - house was very convenient as it was right across the river from Wesbanco arena and easy to find! The town itself is a little run down and quite a few things are under construction so we mostly spent the day at Triadelphia which is also very convenient to this location - tons of great shopping and places to eat over there!
Julie and John were very quick to respond and accommodating - we thought it was cool to have both apartments, and it was more than enough space for two couples. We had one couple stay in each apartment so we had our own areas entirely, but shared the 1 kitchen on the side that also had a living room. Appreciated the water in the fridge & the touches of green for St Patrick‚Äôs day!
Only suggestion would be to get individual keys for each of the apartments upstairs rather than one key to the main outside door. We did like that they locked with a deadbolt from the inside for extra piece of mind at night though."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were just passing thru for a night; very convenient location, great view of the river, friendly hosts, spacious accommodations"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,we loved our stay on the gorgeous Ohio River. Downtown district was walking distance..and to restaurants and historic sites. julie and john are great hosts..responsive and accommodating. The unit offered lots of room for 4 of us. I will stay here again.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We came for the weekend to see a play at West Lib, as we have done many times before, but I wish we had found this place sooner. So so so great! It was much bigger than expected, super clean, fun, right on the river, and the hosts were fantastic. Of course I had to play Pac-Man‚Äîwhich was a nice surprise! Great location and very comfortable beds. Really, just fantastic."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The perfect place to stay for a weekend visit.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful hosts! Great communication and the perfect place to visit.
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This place had a pretty view. It‚Äôs in an older neighborhood with huge houses. I enjoyed walking the neighborhood looking at everything. Plenty of space in the Airbnb. One of the 4 bedrooms even had a gas fireplace. Everyone loved the Pac-Man game!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,good spot
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice place to stay!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic location! Lots of space for our family. Great communication every step of the way!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Really great stay. Nice space, good and convenient location, perfect for my family‚Äôs stay. Beds were all comfy and good sizes. Plenty of space and amenities in the kitchen. Would be great for a longer stay as well. Only issue is the stairs, just have be aware they can be tricky to get up. But otherwise an excellent space. Will definitely check for it when visiting Wheeling again."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Julie and John's place is very nice. It is always clean and stocked with the small items sometimes you forget when traveling. It is very convenient to the casino and Heritage Port. These folks make it a pleasure to travel to Wheeling.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place
Very nice
Great location if you are going to see the lights"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Julie and John‚Äôs place was perfect for our weekend away. Easy access to the interstate and the house was decorated nicely for Christmas. The games, especially the PAC-Man game was a hit."
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,The rooms were very neat and tidy and comfortable.We really enjoyed our stay. It meets our expectations. Will definitely recommend. Thank you Julie and John.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place right on the river. It was just me and my husband so we only stayed in one unit but it was very clean and just as described. Nice view, great value, and Julie and John were wonderful hosts."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great weekend celebrating my sister-in-law‚Äôs birthday. The apartments were so spacious. It was very beneficial having the two kitchens for cooking for 6 people. There was also plenty of sleeping arrangements to accommodate our group. The location was perfect for touring Oglebay and seeing the lights. Julie and John were great hosts. They let us have our independence but we‚Äôre available for questions as needed. We also loved the personal touches around the house. They knew we were celebrating my sister-in-law‚Äôs birthday so they out decorations around the apartment. The only negative thing I can mention is lugging all of our stuff up the narrow steps. It was definitely not their fault at all, just shows that we brought too much stuff."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a great find! Fully stocked kitchens, kind hosts, and it was a great surprise to see the Pac-Man game and mini pool table. Highly recommend as they thought of all the extras that we might have forgotten."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is everything you would want in an air bnb, great location, great value, awesome renters. Don‚Äôt pace this place up."
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"This place could not have worked out better for our stay. My husband and I, along with our two adult children and their respective guests, all were in town to attend a family member's wedding. We all traveled from different locations to stay at this home. The place was clean, well appointed and private. Check in and check out were a breeze. We would definitely stay here again if ever in the area. Thank you, Julie and John, for a worry free trip."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is an amazing property with amazing hosts. Located right on the Ohio river there was plenty of room for the four of us. Two full kitchens with plenty of cookware and access to the grill in the back yard. Comfortable furniture and beds with big screen TVs everywhere. Plenty of games for children. Close to the casino/race track if that is your thing or walk across the historic suspension bridge to Wheeling and the river walk with the Capital Theatre. Julie and John were super friendly and accommodating and were willing to visit with us and share their knowledge of the area.
2021-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nicely decorated and furnished. Good value for the space.
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,cleanÔºåspacious rooms and quiet surrounding. nice host and hostess.
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"There were five of us staying here for the weekend. This place is roomy, clean and had everything we needed to help make our stay fun and stress free. John and Julie are great hosts. The location could not have been better for us. It is right across the river from Heritage Port. I highly recommend this Airbnb when you are visiting Wheeling."

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location! We were there because my dad was having surgery at Wheeling Hospital. We had the peace of mind knowing we were so close if there was a problem.

2021-07-01,5,Group trip,Julie and John were very welcoming and their home is in an awesome location. The rooms were comfortable and homey with all needed for an gratifying stay. I would recommend this unit for anyone looking for a enjoyable time.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We were in town for a family reunion and this location was perfect. The unit is separated into two areas which worked out great for us as our kids are older. The units were very clean and comfortable, especially the beds! We did some water activities and having a washer and dryer was awesome. Julie & John are great hosts. We'll be back."
2021-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, good communication, and concerts across the water. Casino is walking distance. Only con was ac did not cool upstairs unit with living room."

2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed our stay. It was perfect for our two families since the AirBnb is two apartments side by side. The beds were so soft and comfortable. It was really nice to have a small deck to sit on in the evenings. We also enjoyed the free tv services to watch.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kristy had a very clean AIRBNB. the beds were comfy, the shower was clean with warm water. Kitchen has everything you need. Definitely recommend. It‚Äôs a quaint airbnb. Good parking spots. Excellent communication."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"Good location, clean apartment. Only problem was no air conditioning or fans on an 82 degree day in a second floor apartment. It made for a warm, sleepless night. Other than that, it was a nice apartment and well kept. Bed was comfortable."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Easy checkin & very easy to find. Parking right in front of the building and the beds were very comfortable. Great value. I will be back next year
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and quiet! Kristy was very responsive. Would most definitely recommend and would stay again. Thanks Kristy!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a great stop on our road trip. Easy to check in and clean accommodations.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful apartment. I could live there. Very charming and welcoming interior. Extremely clean and well apportioned. The owner made everything clear and easy with instructions provided. The area is very walkable and also full of charm. We walked the river trail, it‚Äôs beautiful. Wheeling had its heyday, but it‚Äôs been in decline. That said, the historic area around the apartment has amazing homes. In terms of what‚Äôs around, we stayed on a Sunday night, so the recommendations for restaurants didn‚Äôt help us because they were all closed. So be aware of that. Otherwise I‚Äôd stay again and again. Well worth the price paid"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kristy's place was just perfect for our trip to Wheeling. Easy to find, clear instructions on checking in and out, and great location all together! The apartment was clean and had everything we needed. Definitely would return!!! Thank you!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Accommodations were as described, host was friendly and quick to respond. Gave us an affordable and enjoyable weekend in Wheeling visiting the Island Bars, Restaurants, Casino and Grey Hound racing. Quick, easy and cheap to Uber across the bridge."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic - HUGE place in a residential neighborhood but right downtown. Easy to find, park, access, check in. Kristy is a great host - responsive and seems to have thought of most everything ahead of time. Little details, like paper towels and kitchen stuffs and quality toilet paper, a pleasant surprise. I'd stay again when returning to Wheeling."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great in town location, walking distance to places downtown. Felt safe, Love the old feel of the building. Would stay again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable, charming place close to the Ohio River and walking distance to downtown. You can hear traffic noise, but we expected that based on the description and other reviews. We were comfortable and felt right at home, and we were very pleased with the price and location. We would stay here again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Comfortable and clean! Charming decor! Would definitely stay again!
2023-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This 2nd story apartment is just as described. It was quaint and just what we needed for our one night stay, but I would come back and spend the weekend here. The beds were comfortable, although I wasn't a fan of the pillows, the rest of my family didn't seem to mind. There were more blankets and small plug in heaters if needed. The toilet paper was quality and the towels were adequate. The host provided a list of restaurants and most were within a 7 minute drive or a doable walk to downtown. I can see myself coming back here for a mom weekend and enjoying the table by the window for writing and the back porch for a morning brew or a night cap."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute apartment right by the river! Perfectly described in the listing. Walking through a bedroom to get to the kitchen was a bit weird but also funny, we didn‚Äôt mind! Also a nice little back porch to get some fresh air on, loved that."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another great stay! Even improved over our stay last year - had better T.P., additional washcloths, and more comfortable couch. Could use Kleenex and trash cans in bedrooms. Still need better shower nozzle, but overall a great place to stay!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a nice place to stay, with a friendly and responsive host. The location was great, though being near the Main Street and highway was a little noisy. On the plus side, that also made it very easy to get to and a nice base to explore Wheeling and the surrounding area. It was clean and had comfortable beds, and had everything we needed."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Large upstairs apartment in an old building up a hill from the Ohio River. Good location for walking (a riverside walking path miles long), interesting historical area that has been undergoing a bit of rehab and gentrification. Kristy was responsive and friendly."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the area. Lots to see walking around. Great bar/restaurant right across the street

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kristy was a great host. We enjoyed our stay.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was the second unit of Kristy‚Äôs I‚Äôve stayed in and it was better than the last! So spacious and open, comfy bed and couch, and very clean.
This unit is not air conditioned, but there are window AC units in both bedrooms. It did get a little warm sitting in the living room. The second bedroom is between the living room and kitchen (as stated), but we had no problem with it! Love love love the old time feel of this building. Can‚Äôt wait to return!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kristy was a great hostess. She was very proactive in informing us of the road construction issue and water main break. She provided us with bottled water for cooking and drinking so that we did not have to boil water.
The apartment was everything she said it would be and worth every penny of the rental fee.
I highly recommend Kristy and will happily book a stay at her place again in the future."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great visit for a 2 day stay. I will stay there again.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Christy was a great hostess, the place was absolutely adorable, full of charm and the beds were super comfy the sheets were awesome! and it was very large. it was also a great location"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed in the 2BR apartment on the upper floor. The entire unit was very clean - spotless in fact. Both bedrooms had window A/C units in good working condition. The first bedroom at the top of the stairs does not have a door - just something to be aware of. The other bedroom was sandwiched between the living room and the kitchen, meaning other people will have to walk through it to get to the kitchen. Again, not a big deal to us at all, but it could be to some travelers, and just something to be aware of. This area of Wheeling is full of Victorian architecture and interesting shops and restaurants, all walkable. Parking was plentiful and the location right off the interstate was very convenient to everything. Much better than a hotel!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kristy‚Äôs place was exactly what we needed for a weekend in Wheeling. The historic building is gorgeous and well taken care of. We had everything we needed. Very close to a lot of restaurants and shops. We can‚Äôt wait to stay here again sometime!

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,.
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"It was a short stay for us but could have easily lended itself to a much longer one.
It is ideal for 4 people. Due to the number of steps and steepness of the inside set, would probably be better for a younger family."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,We very much enjoyed our stay. It was perfect for what we needed. Little odd there isn't an actual bedroom door but a hall door to the main bedroom. We had everything we needed and it was clean minus someone forgetting to clean the coffee grounds out in the coffee pot. We would stay again. Kristy was super friendly and responsive. I appreciate her getting back to me right away.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kristy was a great host. Her apartment was very comfortable and clean.

We will definitely return again and next time will will plan our itinerary better."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,We were very happy here for 9 days. We originally signed up for 7 days but then added 2 additional days. The walking trail along the river was great as were several of the downtown restaurants within walking distance of the house.

2022-07-01,4,Stayed over a week,The place is clean and convenient. I was very happy to have the air conditioning and clean shower during the stay. A wonderful reprieve each day.
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Good place to stay in a central location in Wheeling. Very clean, with a quick and responsive host. A few things to know: Staircase up to the apartment is dark, shallow and steep steps, and somewhat smelly. So if you‚Äôre elderly and/or have trouble with stairs, this may not be the place for you. Living room couch is not comfortable, not much cushion. Bathroom T.P. is low quality (public restrooms) so we went and bought the good stuff. Shower faucet knob is hard to figure out. Might want to bring extra washcloths (only one per person provided for the week). No central air /heat, so we left all the interior doors open so window units could try and cool the whole apartment. Kitchen gets pretty warm anyway. But overall good!üòä"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Excellent location. Apartment was large and well-appointed. Definitely try the food recommendations. So good! Loved that the Heritage Trail was so close.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The unit is an older building so it lacks a lot of modern amenities however the host did a great job in making it comfortable. The beds were great, the unit was very clean, it was very close to the river for a morning walk. Overall a very good value proposition."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect accommodations, beautiful apartment. Clean and a great value as well. Would book again."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great value stay right in Wheeling. The apartment is clean and functional, though somewhat quirky (no door on one bedroom and must pass through the other bedroom to get to the kitchen), but it suited our needs well. The balcony out back was nice for enjoying a few pleasant spring evenings outside. Be sure to check out East Wheeling Clayworks right up the block, and enjoy easy access to the trail/path along the river."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful old apartment! Quiet, charming with all the comforts of home. Loved sitting outside on the balcony watching the Chimney Swifts flying around in the evening! Close to everything downtown. Felt like home away from home!"

2022-04-01,4,Stayed over a week,"Darling place in Victorian Old Town with a view of the river from the bay window! Beds were really comfortable and we were able to walk all over town - library, restaurants, etc. I love old buildings and their eccentricities, and the high ceilings, mantles, and woodwork were charming. Hosts were super responsive and offered ideas for the historical info we were looking for. Great place and great deal!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,Kristy was over the top helpful and responsive. The location was great for being outside and walkable to at least a few bars and coffee shops. The neighborhood felt entirely safe throughout the long stay. This is an older building with a ton of charm. Kristy was an attentive host who was easy to communicate with.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location. So close to the walkway along the river. Comfy and cozy with everything you could nee!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super clean cute house. Soft comfy linens, plenty of towels. Loved having a washer and dryer. Good amount of cookware and utensils, plates and glasses. Just what we needed for the weekend as a home base.
All the neighbors were very friendly. The neighborhood has steep, winding streets that my son and I walked at night and the lights from the houses in the hills were so pretty.
House is 15 minutes from Highlands Sport Center which is where we spent the weekend. Plenty of restaurants and entertainment."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Donald was very friendly and responsive and understanding of situations that arose during our stay
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute place to stay! We felt right at home and will definitely stay again when we are in town. The neighborhood is quiet and so close to shopping and great restaurants! The house was just as described! You won‚Äôt regret a stay at Donald‚Äôs!!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Place was neat and clean. it has beautiful surroundings with amazing views. Everything was readily available in the cabin.
David is an amazing host, we needed some creamer for our tea and David gave us a whole gallon of milk. also, provided us some extra utensils that we needed.
I really loved the 2 dogs (puppy and Diana) on the property they were very friendly.
whenever, I'll plan my next trip to WV, I'll definitely stay at this place."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"A very comfortable house, such pretty scenery and the sweetest dog meeting us by the door. Diana was an absolute delight"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,If you‚Äôre looking for a private peaceful trip away from the rest of the world. This little farm house is perfect.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Clean and spacious place with all required eminities. Deck area is perfect to enjoy a beautiful valley view. We had a comfortable stay. Dog lovers will also have some good time with Dianna, very sweet and friendly dog."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,My partner and I stayed here overnight to break up a long drive and it was perfect. Very peaceful and scenic and extremely good value. The dogs were also very friendly and fun to be around. I would definitely stay here again!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"we enjoyed our stay here. it was peaceful and relaxing. we saw deer, heard turkeys, and lots of birds. my dogs loved the owners dogs. we were close enough yet away enough from the places we wanted to visit during the day."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Quiet secluded getaway. A great place to disconnect and spend time with family. Beautiful surroundings. No cell or wifi but games and dvds to keep you distracted. Not far from any of the local stores or activities. Loved it. Definitely out there. And if it wasn‚Äôt raining so much would have had great star views and nature walks.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved staying here!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay at David‚Äôs beautiful place. Once again we absolutely loved it! We will be back soon for our third visit. Thank you David once again for sharing your place with us. That view off the back porch is stunning!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,it was exactly what we needed for our road trio. it was very private and quiet
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Our favorite things about this house were the very comfortable beds and couches. The size of the house was nice as well. There was enough space for our family of five to spread out and not constantly be on each other‚Äôs nerves. Our kids enjoyed the very friendly dogs. Wheeling and the whole northern panhandle have many things worth visiting and exploring. However, the lack of a handrail and steepness of the stairs maybe a challenge for older folks or small children."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Me and my wife needed a few day getaway and chose David‚Äôs house. We LOVED it! The house was extremely clean and is beyond a bargain for the price he‚Äôs asking. The views are beyond incredible. We went out to the porch and when we saw them we knew we made the right choice! They have the sweetest dog also that greeted us on our way in, and my wife fell in love with her. David is quick to answer any questions you have and is a terrific host. By the way when you turn into the road the home is on the views there are also stunning. We will be back in May! Thanks David for having us."
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"Peaceful, safe, and cozy. The pictures and description don‚Äôt do this place justice. It is rustic and remote‚Ä¶rejuvenating for the soul! We will definitely stay there again!"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"House was very clean, nice and aromatic. Outside view was very beautiful. Spacious bedrooms and kitchen. Children were very happy to play with dayana(very friendly cute dog). Host was very friendly and promptly responded for all our queries. Our stay was very pleasant and really enjoyed. Definitely we will be coming back to this place."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I will most definitely ask to rent this beautiful place in the future. The board/card games are an added bonus I had a lot of fun with my daughter's playing. The puppies are the best part of the stay! I definitely enjoyed this visit.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I've stayed at David's place several times and will do so again. It's a terrific getaway in the beautiful rolling W Va hills. It feels remote and quiet and peaceful. Ideal for getting off the grid. And David is a very responsive host.
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"This was a great find! The house was exactly we were looking for. The huge ""ante room"" before going in was perfect for me to leave my hockey gear to air out. My kid really enjoyed looking at cows on the farm!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a lovely, short stay at David‚Äôs place! The house is big‚Äîthere were just two of us staying, but the place could easily fit a bigger family. The view was gorgeous, and we were greeted by beautiful dogs. David was accommodating and generous in ways few hosts are. Next time we come through the area, we‚Äôre staying here again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,What a cozy home of the beaten path! The house had everything I needed to make meals. The beds were comfortable and the house temperature was as well.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very responsive, very clean, nice peaceful place."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,amazing spot! clean and beautiful and the Doggo friend was a much needed plus!!!!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"David's place is very peace and quiet. Table games were provided, all cooking wares that you could think of in the kitchen. David is so generous on towels, you would always feel comfortably dry. No internet is an excellent environment for electronic devices fasting. I visited David's place during a heart breaking period in my life. Very lucky to be able to find his place to give me a break and heal. Both me and my cat enjoyed the woods view from both inside the house and outside of the house. You would be greeted by their lovely dogs. One of the golden retrieve loves belly rub and is so well trained, who always makes me smile interacting with her."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,As always I had a great stay at David‚Äôs property. The house was very clean and David was very responsive to any questions I had. I will definitely be returning. Thanks again!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a gem! We were visiting family and it was the perfect spot to host our thanksgiving dinner! Everything was clean, plenty of space and amazing sunrises over the hills. Loved Diana the dog!! My kids fell in love with her! There was no cable or WiFi which was a tiny bit inconvenient but we were out visiting family most of the time anyway! All in all, awesome find and a good price! Hope to come back again!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Although we only stayed one night at David‚Äôs place, we wish we could have stayed longer to see more of the property and beautiful surroundings, well worth it. Thank you again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a great spot! We enjoyed the deck to see the changing leaves and enjoy the quiet!
It‚Äôs roomy and spacious and everything we needed for our family!
We will be back!
David is a great host and answered our calls IMMEDIATELY! Thank you so much for sharing this home!!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved staying here. It was absolutely amazing and fairly priced. The fall time was perfect to see the leaves turn here!!! David was an excellent host. When I originally asked if he had a plug to charge my car by any chance, he originally said no but then installed one!! It was much appreciated. The home itself was cozy and clean. We don‚Äôt have any problems with our stay at all. Even the 2 big mountain dogs were friendly and played nice with my 13 yr old of golden retriever :) we would definitely come back to stay here"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"We stayed at David‚Äôs Airbnb over the weekend just for a night although we had originally planned to stay for more than one night. He was very flexible when we needed to change our reservation to include more people and also shorten the length of our stay. It was a perfect location. It was private the house was clean and we were even greeted by their livestock guardian dogs and we are big dog people so it was a nice surprise to wake up and find them waiting outside for us in the morning! I would recommend David‚Äôs Airbnb to absolutely anyone who is staying in the Wheeling West Virginia area, and I can‚Äôt wait to visit again if we ever find ourselves there in the future!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful quiet location.David was really helpful in getting the tv set up to watch a movie and helped me find my lost wallet going above and beyond to get it back to me. Thanks again for helping me out.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful land, beautiful farm, and beautiful farm dogs!!! The big sweet great pyrenees lady ushered us in safely and escorted us to and from the car each trip, which was the highlight of the journey! A++ good dog!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Quaint little house tucked away from everything. Beautiful drive in and loved seeing the animals across the hills and the changing leaves. It is close to various restaurants and not far from wheeling/oglebay. Would have loved to walk the property more!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the break we needed. So nice to have a forced disconnect. Had enough cell service to get calls but not enough to work. The porch views and sounds were fabulous! The friendly furry neighbors made it really feel like home.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"David was extremely helpful meeting us when we arrived much later than expected. Helping us load our stuff into the house.
offered to help us load out in am and sure enough appeared next morning when asked to lend a hand.
we loved their location. wish we could stayed longer."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"David's place is so peaceful; we loved being there. The house was clean, roomy & had everything we needed. Loved meeting the 2 beautiful dogs on our way out the next morning--they are special!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were looking for some place quiet, beautiful, and off the beaten path for just a night. This place delivered and at a great price as well. We enjoyed being greeted by the dogs and the misty morning coffee on the porch."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,David was helpful and communicated with us very well.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My Best friend and I checked in on the 9th of September and out on the 11th. My first and last impression was wow this is a beautiful place. The host was very responsive and gave good directions. It is a little way off a paved road, but keep going. The BNB had everything we needed and then some. There was adult as well as children's cutlery and plates. I had never seen anyone do that before, such a great idea. Everything was clean and smelled fresh. The beds were comfy and clean as well. The only thing I didn't like about staying here was having to leave and go back home. The dogs were cute and made us feel safe. One of them always seemed to be waiting by our car, just keeping an eye on us. I have Verizon and I had cell service outside and by the window in the living room. I didn't come here to stay on the internet and watch TV. I came here to enjoy the experience. I loved it! I hope to come back soon!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,It's such an awesome place for a getaway! We loved it! It has peaceful farmland scenery & was very cozy.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Me and my family had a wonderful stay. David would receive calls anytime which made it so easier for us. The house is beautiful and clean. I would visit this place again and would like to book David's place again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place to unwind and get away from it all.
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,The four legged host Dianna was amazing very responsive and greeted us from arrival to departure. I don‚Äôt think I can tell you anything about this stay except you need to be there. David (the human) was also exceptional. I know I will be back very soon. Thank you for the very peaceful and most relaxed stay EVER
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, honey birds are flying around the house. David is still building to make the house even a better place to stay, but we enjoyed our time in the middle of nowhere. Nice porch at the back at the house to read books, enjoy time with family."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,David was super friendly and the house felt like home. If I'm ever back in the area I will definitely book with him again!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"two big dogs came out to greet me and my dog when we pulled in. my dog was scared of them although they were gentle and friendly.
the house is clean, quiet and cool, although the decor is somewhat charmless.
the location can't be beat if you like peace and quiet - on a high ridge, at the end of a long gravel road, overlooking fields, farms and woods.
I sat on the deck drinking tea in the cool morning air, it was perfect.
I appreciated David's easy instructions and felt immediately at ease and able to relax."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very excellent stay for a very affordable price
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"If there was an award for the greatest AirBNB host who went above and beyond their responsibilities, it belongs to David.
He was very responsive to all questions, the property was gorgeous and peaceful at a reasonable price. But that has nothing to do with why he was so great.
My trip saw 4 guys in their 20‚Äôs on a road trip from Canada, encounter their first ever blown tire well outside of Wheeling. I informed David of our situation and said we‚Äôd keep him updated. 20 minutes pass by as we attempt to change it guided by internet tutorials. Next thing we know, a car pulls up behind us and out walks who else but David. Like Superman, he takes one look at our stuck tire, punches it and off it comes. He helps put on the spare and escorts us into town, where we make our 8pm show just on time.
It‚Äôs not normal (at least where I‚Äôm from) to drive 45 minutes out of your way and help stranded strangers on the highway. But for David, it seemed like just another Saturday.
Thank you David. 10/10"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a great little gem of a place. It you want a off the beaten path, cottage in the hills this is the place. It had everything one wants from a farm house cottage. Charming, comfy, and relaxing."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"We came up for a Boozefighter MC event in the area and it turned out to be the perfect location and a great value compared to 3 couples staying in separate hotel rooms. Very clean and exactly what we needed to basically have a place to sleep as we spent most of our time at the event.
Thank you for your hospitality!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great house to merge with nature. We loved it.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful! We hope to come back for longer in the future!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice place
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Amazing price for such a great place!!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay for someone who is seeking some solitude off of the beaten path, plenty of room, great kitchen and a porch where you can listen to birdsong and enjoy a good book. David was very quick to respond and super kind. Absolutely plan on coming back in the future."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Quiet and peaceful spot that has been well maintained. We spent most of our time on the back deck which overlooks a small valley. It served as a 'birding balcony ' as many different types of birds were around. Definitely check this place out if you're looking to unwind a bit.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"This is a good place in a lovely setting. Super quiet and peaceful. It was very hot but they have an a/c unit in each of the upstairs bedrooms and one downstairs so it was quite livable.
There is no cable or satellite or wifi (yet?), but you can get 2 bars of 5G inside, and 2 bars of LTE in front of the house, on AT&T. If you‚Äôre here, you are probably on vacation and need to log the F off anyway, so embrace that.
Your welcoming committee is two super sweet and quite gigantic wooly white dogs. If you bring your dog(s), be ready for that - they are gentle giants but our 3 canine nut-jobs decided to push it, so we asked the host to bring them back from the house - which happened immediately.
Make no mistake, you are out there, away from almost everything, but close enough to run out for food and have it still be warm when you bring it back. As described, the house is a work in progress, but we fervently hope the lone original element, the beautiful fireplace surround, is retained."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was a splendid experience having stay here. We would love to be here again. All the things were nice and prefectural. Warm welcoming. The Host was very active & quick responsive. The place is beautiful, calm & quiet. we love this place and recommend to others.
Thanks"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Off the grid, but not too off the grid. very quiet and peaceful place. house is one scenic location. really enjoyed a peaceful time off"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place made you feel like you were away from the ""city"" for sure. Beautiful scenery."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"perfect perfect perfect! Clean, easy to get into. very responsive host. couldn't have asked for a better, more relaxing stay. the property was beautiful!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"David‚Äôs place was exactly as described and the check-in instructions were concise and clear. The 1/2 mile gravel road is no joke, drive slow and watch out for animals if you get there after dark. We only stayed there for one night but thoroughly enjoyed it, and we‚Äôll definitely go back."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My second time staying at his place. Beautiful place for a quiet retreat.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything went smoothly on my end. I most definitely enjoyed my time. I was able to relaxe and self reflect as I wanted.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing view for a competitive price!
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,We came back there for our grandmothers memorial.....she was 104 years old. It was a perfect place to stay with all of my siblings. Great experience Thanks!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a gem of a place to stay; it is at the very end of a gravel road along a ridge that ends in spectacular privacy with great views all along the way! They have clearly done a lot to update the home, it looked like very new floors and touches throughout! The back deck was as relaxing a place as a human can be - the lightening bugs were extraordinary! It is a private, sort of off the grid (our phones worked in the kitchen, out in the front yard, and a little upstairs, but not really in the living room, which was actually preferred for us, but FYI, we have Verizon). The house was very, very clean! It was a great spot for our family."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,it was a great secluded place! really enjoyed my stay
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely little home in rural WV.
2023-06-01,4,Stayed one night,David's place was a great spot to stay for the night!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This rental is beautiful and well maintained. Highly recommend a stay here.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The farmhouse was great for our short stay with our dog. One of David‚Äôs dogs came down to meet us and was very friendly to us and our dog. It‚Äôs a very secluded space with a beautiful view of the woods. Easy entry. The beds we‚Äôre comfortable and the kitchen was clean. The long gravel road is no joke, drive slowly. There were no issues therefore no need to communicate with the host during our stay."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful place, beautiful dog, nice host, great views. We would definitely stay there again if we were in the area!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"A beautiful house with a beautiful view! It was very spacious and great to have a house to ourselves. Diana, the dog, was very nice and greeted us when we arrived!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great private spot suitable for a family passing through!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,A beautiful & peaceful setting! The house was spacious & had all the necessary things! We enjoyed the quiet & wonderful back deck looking out! We look forward to a return trip!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Excellently sized place. Enough free space for the dogs to run free. Not in the hustle and bustle of the city. Lots of comfy pillows and places to relax. Back porch overlooking the hills was nice too.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,David was great! He made the whole experience so easy and pleasant for my staff.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"It is a nice place to stay! Beautiful little clean place in the middle of nature!
No Wifi is only drawback but that‚Äôs understandable."
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Appreciated warning about unlevel grassy slope and cabin stairway, so we could be prepared. Beautiful countryside, quiet, and comfortable. Close to Wheeling for our day trips, would stay again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was great! David was very responsive to issues, even late at night. Beautiful location, great place to get away from life for a while.
The dogs on the property are all friendly, and very cute.
10/10 would stay here again!!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"One of the most private peaceful places I have ever stayed at. Beautiful horse farm next door. Beautiful scenery everywhere. House was immaculate. and very interesting. large deck on the back to listen to the birds.. good for the body, good for the soul!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,David is a great host. He responded to my messages real quick. This place is great and worth the price
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,David's place was great. It had everything we needed for our road trip. Thank you for letting us stay there.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful with nice view. Perfect for relaxing after a day spent golfing
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I needed a personal retreat to unplug from the grid and get away . David's place was perfect! Absolutely beautiful setting in rolling W Va farmland, and the friendliest dog you could ever meet. Thanks so much for a wonderful stay!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,a great place for peaceful relaxation and beautiful surroundings
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful view in a very private and peaceful location. The farm dogs were super friendly!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our 2nd visit to David‚Äôs place. Very satisfied
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect place to stay
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,As always David was a great host and has a beautiful property. I look forward to going back again!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and private
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family had a great time at David's place. The location is beautiful and private, the home itself is clean and spacious, and the dogs outside on the property are friendly and were a delight for my children. Will definitely consider David's again for future visits."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you are in need of a peaceful night sleep, this is your place. The house is away from any noise, while the decor and amenities makes you feel right at home."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place was as described. Beautiful views, lots of animals, and very very quiet. Loved the dog that would greet us every morning at night to protect us. Will definitely stay again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"David is a great host, and the home and view are gorgeous. we will definitely book our next stay with David"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,.
2023-03-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"David's place would be perfect for a group or family looking for a place to spend a few days in a remote location. It is large and has a great deck on the back with amazing views of the valley. My visit was a mismatch, as I ended up arriving late and leaving early, so I could not properly enjoy it. There is a distance from the parking spot to the house, so a little carrying is involved. There are guard dogs who bark pretty consistently when one is outside. David was flexible when I needed to change my booking and was helpful with communications and instructions."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is a hidden gem. I will be re-booking in the summer to see the beautiful landscape. I will say at first your thrown off with the dogs but they are friendly and don't bother you or anything. The farm house is perfect and I will be coming back to unplug from the city this summer
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"Everything at this location was as described by David. He was very responsive to messages and had the place ready for us when we arrived. The outside light was on and the inside was warm, clean, cozy and ready for us. Check in-and-out were a breeze."
2022-12-01,4,Stayed one night,This was such an easy stay for us as we stopped through the area!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed staying here. I just wish we had been able to stay when we could actually have been there to enjoy the place. Instead, we had things to do that kept us very busy and away from the house. Everything was very clean and comfortable. We did have trouble finding the road (it looks more like a driveway), but David was great and stayed on the phone with us while we drove on back to the house. We would definitely stay there again. Btw, the dogs were friendly. I was very interested in seeing how 'noisy' they were at night since they are lifestock guardian dogs. Not a problem. You will not pick up internet. He has some movies there and we watched one each night before going to bed. If you are ready to rest and relax, this is the place for you."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful stay at David‚Äôs. The place was perfect for our small family, and the property was beautiful and quiet. David was a communicative host and I got the impression he would have been quick to help if we needed anything. Great experience!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was our second time staying and once again David‚Äôs communication was great. The property is beautiful and we will definitely be back. I highly recommend it.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"David‚Äôs place was amazing! Very peaceful and quiet with a beautiful view from the back patio area. The house was warm considering it‚Äôs November! The place had everything we needed. David told us to let him know if we needed anything during our stay - I let him know that I was bringing my reactive dog and he accommodated us by making sure all his animals and dogs were away from the property during our stay. We enjoyed how much space there was in the house and how cozy everything was. We arrived at 8 pm and he turned on the outdoor lights for us and gave us clear directions on how to find the location. If anything, I recommend driving an SUV as there is a steep incline getting to the house, but we had no issue going down and up the hill in a jeep compass. We also enjoyed watching the deer run down into the valley from the patio that is also covered, so we were able to sit outside while it was raining in the morning. Overall we had a fantastic stay and we are excited to come back again!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place to stay. We enjoyed our time there.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My friends and I stay here 2-3 times a years and every time we return David has updated something in the house.
We enjoy being out in the country and sitting on the back deck taking in the peace and quiet. David has been a Great host each and every time."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,David was very kind and accommodating. We especially enjoyed seeing the animals and breathing the fresh country air.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cute, clean and cozy stay. Affordable, too."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"All was great, thanks to the host and place!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The house was wonderful, very clean and well kept! We loved all the animals around the house and enjoyed the views. Will definitely be back!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,House was clean and everything that the picture showed the view in surroundings were amazing was such a great weekend getaway
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful location and a fantastic place to stay!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful get-away. David had great suggestions on places to check out in the area. Very peaceful.
I definitely suggest going to the mountaineer bar and Wakims bar."
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"We absolutely loved it! We meet David upon arrival (which we love) with a little and big dog, a horse and 2 goats. The big dog a Great Pyrenees Diana was so sweet our youngest gave her a big hug right away. The horse was also approachable and friendly and the others kept their distance. The view and sunrise were amazing and very relaxing! For a 200 yr old house it was fixed up very nice, it was clean and comfortable. David was a great host and very responsive. If you love the country and everything about it this is an amazing place to stay. We highly recommend it!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely amazing private farm location with a stunning view, simple check in and lots of space. With friendly horses, rams and pups roaming the fields. Loved it and wish we could have stayed longer."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,our kids absolutely enjoyed the home away from our home.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Such an awesome farm house with beautiful views! A great place to relax after a day on the road.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Quiet and Private!
We had a good night's sleep in this charming place. The house is spacious and warm on a cold rainy day. great kitchen size and easy to check-in."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was great, exactly what we needed on our trip. Quiet, nice, clean."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,So wonderful and peaceful I never wanted to leave!!!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Excellent visit. Great communication and wonderful accommodations. The animals were friendly and definitely added to a wonderful experience. We will book again if in the area in the future
2022-09-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Just what we needed for a stop during our road trip with our dogs.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Farmhouse on beautiful land. Rustic. Wonderful horse on the property. We had a great time. Would definitely come back. David was a great host
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place once you find it..a tad tricky to locate & entering into it but seriously worth it. The house is quite close to the sites you want to do in Wheeling but it's nice to settle back in a secluded country setting.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very clean tidy rooms, David was promot in his communication. My stay was very pleasant"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,It‚Äôs exactly as it‚Äôs portrayed and is in a great location.
2022-08-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"The house and scenery are lovely, and David and his family are very gracious hosts! The access road is indeed gravel and the location is rustic‚Äîperfect if you‚Äôre prepared for it. Wish we‚Äôd had more time to see all that it had to offer!"
2022-08-01,4,Stayed one night,Good place!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,David is a very accommodating host who made the trip that much easier and peaceful. Would love to be back in WV someday and book a night at David‚Äôs again.
2022-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Few issues with check-in. The electric was out due to a storm that passed through but we made the best of it. The electric was back on by the time we were done at Ogelbay. There was a great set of animals (dog, horse, sheep) greeted us upon our return.
For anyone coming out of town the drive in can be overwhelming, but it‚Äôs not as bad."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a wonderful experience! Definitely recommend
2022-07-01,4,Group trip,it was clean and enjoy the stay. Had issue about bugs.
2022-07-01,3,Stayed one night,"David's space is located on very pretty land. He responds quickly to messages about his home and is courteous. We had a very late arrival because of traveling all day, so David left the lights on for us inside the home and turned the A/C units in the bedrooms on, which was nice!
We did have some difficulty checking into the home when we arrived. Again, it was very late (around 2 AM or so, so we did not want to be rude, call and wake up David). The difficulty was due to some of David's free-range animals (a horse, two large goats, and a large Great Pyraneese livestock guardian dog) who would not move away from the front door of the AirBnB. We saw the mention of his dogs that roam the property but did not know about the other livestock or expect the animals to be directly between us and the home refusing to move out of the way. They were between us and the front door, blocking the entrance. We are big animal lovers, but we also know that animals can be dangerous, especially because we had our own pre-approved dogs with us and did not know how David's animals would interact with our dogs or us. Overall, it was quite stressful to get into the home with our belongings and our dogs after a very long day of traveling late at night because David's animals kept moving swiftly towards us and we would have to backpedal to our vehicle up the hill. They would then return to their position in front of the house. It took over an hour to finally get into the home after trying different methods of getting the animals to move out from between us and the door. Our dogs refused to go to the bathroom outside because of the proximity of David's animals to the door. They were still there in the morning as well, but we discovered clackers inside the house that would chase the animals off for a short period so we could at least get to our vehicle from the house in the morning. Please keep this in mind as you are considering where to stay. Due to the stressful nature of check in, we cancelled our second night (our return trip) with David because it would also be a late arrival and we didn't want to deal with managing his animals again.
The house itself could use a more thorough cleaning after guests leave as well. In particular, the shower was not thoroughly cleaned after the last guest stayed before us.
We were really hoping for a relaxing stay after a long day of travel. It just wasn't that for us."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,David was a great host! Great communication! Spacious house!!!
2022-07-01,4,Group trip,nice calm place
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,The place is beautiful and quiet! David was an incredible host and I definitely plan on going back. A must stay!
2022-07-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Great spot for some space from the hustle and bustle.
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"We thoroughly enjoyed the location, scenery and animals on the property! This place has much character!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We've stayed here several times and will continue to come back when visiting family in the Wheeling area. It's a great place to sit on the back deck and relax.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful view. I could have stayed forever.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you're looking for a genuine country stay, this is a lovely spot. We were greeted by a calm and handsome horse when we arrived. After a long drive, we were all grateful to dive into 3 clean and cozy beds. Beautiful view of the ridge, great privacy at the end of a lane."
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,"We go to Oglebay every year to see the Christmas lights, but we didn‚Äôt want to stay at the resort this year. The house was just the right size for our family of 6. The drive to Oglebay was easy. When we were in the house everyone had a comfortable place to sleep, watch Christmas movies in the living room on the DVD player and tv, and a seat at the dining room table for cards. We didn‚Äôt cook but the kitchen was large and well stocked. Loved the back deck and did do some birdwatching with the binoculars we found on the kitchen shelf. Our teenagers loved that when we got to the house, a horse and goats were grazing in the yard. They didn‚Äôt come close to us but it was still an unexpected treat to see them.
We had a great weekend getaway!"
2021-12-01,3,Stayed with kids,no walkway which rain mud luggage and 2 infants made fun
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,Very nice stay. Great roomy kitchen and comfy living room. Comfortable beds. Beautiful scenery.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We've stayed here several times and would recommend it everyone. It's in the country and very peaceful. We come here 2-3 times a year.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great stay
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"They say almost heaven West Virginia, well this place is your own slice of that heaven. Nestled back in the woods, you can‚Äôt beat David‚Äôs place. I highly recommend this for your stay!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay. Out in the country yet not a far drive from Oglebay. It was exactly as described. The hosts were very nice and the home was super clean.
2021-10-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Lovely place. The horse and goats grazing outside our door were a delight. As were the ladybugs nesting on the back deck.
Be aware the walk from the road (where you must park) to the front door is a steep grade, covered in mud and manure (see comment about horse and goats). My husband fell twice in that muck during our stay. Luckily, he wasn't holding the baby when it happened. Also note that the home smells of cigarettes, especially the room with the largest bed. The carpet upstairs is also filthy and in need of replacing. The chairs on the back deck are falling apart; bring your own camp chairs if you plan to spend time out there. Not recommended with small children, as the railings on the deck allow ample space for little ones to plummet into the brambles 2 stories down."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,nice out of the way country flair. quiet.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Davids home is a great stay especially on a budget and with great views. There are also friendly animals on the property who do get close. But a must I would say is to arrive at daylight. For the gravel road. David is also very kind I called him late and he assured us of our issue.
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The place was clean spacious and comfortable. The owner very Accommodating!!! Thank you very much for all your help
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nicely renovated farmhouse with plenty of peace and quiet. Main access driveway is gravel and fairly lengthy. We brought a BMW convertible that sits about 4 inches off the ground. Car made it OK but it was a bit rough. Great view from back porch area. Well worth it.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful property in the woods. Clean, large, and pet-friendly space. Would stay again."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"David was a great host, place was as exactly as described. Peaceful and quiet location, great stay."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as described. A quiet and cozy house in the county with no frills comfort and an attentive host. The view from all sides was beautiful, beds were comfortable, the couches were plush, the dining room was homely and great for dinners and playing games and we had a pleasant stay and wanted for nothing."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Gorgeous view from the house, even the drive up was amazing. it is a long drive way, up and down some hills but so worth the peace and quiet."
2021-08-01,4,Group trip,Nice place to get away
2021-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"David's place is a nice break from the hustle and bustle of the city. the house is as described. Communication was good and check-in was easy as pie. The parking is up a hill from the house so if you are coming with kids or the elderly, keep that in mind. There are animals about as noted in the description and the horse and dog do come close to the house."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house is just as described - away from it all, with a great back porch. We were delighted to see the goats wandering around and the horse by our front door when we returned one afternoon. We had a relaxing weekend away from wifi and were able to visit other places of interest in the area."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Felt like a little slice of home. The place is very clean, fixtures are modern, but it still feels very homey. The view in the morning from the back porch is an absolute delight.
My only suggestion: get there in the daylight. Coming at night in the fog and making a wrong turn into a church graveyard was a bit spooky (though it was our fault!)."
2021-08-01,4,Group trip,Rustic and quiet. Colocated on a working farm. Perfect little spot for the family to spend some time together. Out of the way but not too far from Tridelphia shopping area or downtown Wheeling. We were able to take in the Grecian Festival and Oglebay Park with little effort.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Quiet time
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The home is beautiful and cozy, great value for the price. And the view of the mountains with the back porch is AMAZING. We are hoping to come back again soon"
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,Lovely spot! Very clean and beautiful.
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,Great stay!
2021-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"To get to the house, its out on a bumpy dirt road with beautiful views. Once you arrive, the views from the back deck are worth the stay in itself. If your looking for a weekend free of wifi to spend with your family this place is perfect. Go on a walk up the road and look at the farm animal's. Its close enough to the city so you can go anytime you would like. If we had questions our host answered in a timely fashion. Will hopefully get to stay here again next time we are coming this way."

2021-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Quiet seclusion but not all THAT far from Wheeling WV - a fun, quirky place with a beautiful view from the deck. Be aware that you‚Äôre staying in a very old remodeled farmhouse on a working farm - no central HVAC, just heaters or fans - that also allows pets (a ‚Äúmust have‚Äù for us this trip due to our daughter‚Äôs family dog who travels with them) so if you‚Äôre expecting some kind of glamorous ‚ÄúHGTV-like‚Äù experience rethink your expectations then come here for peace and quiet - you won‚Äôt be disappointed."

2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were very happy and comfortable at this lovely mountain retreat. The views on the driveway up were incredible, and the house itself has beautiful mountain views off its back deck. When we arrived, David greeted us and allowed the kids to pet Skye the horse, who was very friendly. Our dog enjoyed the wide open space to run as well. Inside everything was clean and comfortable. David even stocked the fridge with a full case of bottled water and packages of cookies for the kids. Upstairs, the 3 bedrooms worked great between ourselves and the 4 kids. There was no central AC, but rooms were equipped with window units and we slept comfortably. In the morning, we enjoyed sipping our coffee on the beautiful back deck taking in the mountains. We had a lovely stay and only wish we'd had longer than an overnight. We'll be back next time we're through that way!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time. We didnt spend much time at the location, but we had very hot weather and we were impressed with how cool the house was despite not having AC. we loved the animals around the property and got quite a laugh out of their antics as we went up and down the gravel road. The directions we were given were perfect and it was an all around good time. If I planned to stay in the area again, I would definitely rebook"

The high chair was super helpful with our 10 month old.
I do wish there were some drawers in the closet or a dresser‚Ä¶ we stayed for 9 days so we had a lot of clothes and the closet just didn‚Äôt work out the best for 2 adults and a baby.

The house is in a great central area to the places we were going to for the weekend. The house was just as it was in the photos.
We would definitely stay in this place again when we come back!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely wonderful house....it does feel like home. This house has everything you could ask for and more. The hosts have done a terrific job with this house and are very responsive to any questions/suggestions, etc. Close to restaurants, Ogelbay Resort, Palace of Gold and Cabela's. We had a terrific stay and would recommend this home and Deb to anyone who is traveling in the area."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,this home was very lovely. newly renovated and everything provided was top of the line. the host was quick with all communications. the location was convenient to the interstate as well
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This redesigned home is right out of HGTV in style and function. It was a lovely place for us to spend a night with our dog, on our way through the area. Our GPS dropped us off at the bottom of the hill, so know you have to go up the hill, past the elementary school, to find it on the right side of the road. Wheeling is very spread out east to west, so this place is a ways from the historic district, but very close to Wheeling Park. Wheeling Park has so much to offer from a fenced in dog area, golf, swimming pool, play ground, paddle boat rentals, mini golf, etc. so there is lots to do in the neighborhood."
2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice house. Well taken care of.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"House was immaculate! A dog-friendly dreamland. It was easy to find, easy to get back on main road and highway, but tucked back enough that we felt like we had privacy from the neighbors. Back to the pet-friendliness, we were left a dog paw towel for the rainy WV days, and all Hardwood floors. It was easy to shut the doors and keep them out of the bedroom. A back door lead to a large grassy area and made potty breaks a breeze for our big dogs. The kitchen was stocked and had lots of extras including a large selection of k-cups, waters in fridge and a couple snacks. The last thing I want to touch on was the comfort, new everything and super clean everything! It was hands down the best kept and thought out air bnb we have ever rented! It was so close to the parks and lodges, that we would rather stay there than In the park"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house was beautiful, clean, just what we were looking for! Had everything we needed to enjoy our stay. Deb was a very gracious hostess and answered any questions we had in a very timely manner!! Would definitely recommend it to anyone!!"

We hope this home is available the next time we come into town!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay! It is a great location and close to many restaurants and every thing you need. Very comfortable. Really was so much better than staying in a cramped hotel room. Deb is so very sweet and we hope to stay again the next time we travel to Wheeling. Thanks again!

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is sparkling clean! It was spotless and we really valued that! Everything was just as described and as pictured in the photos. The beds were comfortable and we appreciated all the amenities and items available for our use. We were glad to have ceiling fans in the bedrooms since there is no central air (window units in the main part of the house made it comfortable). Communication with the host was great, and checking in was simple. The location is very good, with easy access to town and getting on/off the interstate. The neighborhood is tidy and pleasant. We would have enjoyed the yard/fire pit more if it had not rained during our stay. We would definitely consider staying here again in the future."

The home was absolutely beautiful to boot, if I ever come through Wheeling again you‚Äôll find me here!"

Highly recommended üëç"

2024-04-01,3,Stayed with a pet,Nice one bedroom apartment. Clean and close to market street. We had a dog and assumed there‚Äôd be grassy areas for potty.

We will back many more times to come as we visit Wheeling regularly.

There were many perks that were included that we greatly appreciated, like food and snacks, coffee and tea, toiletries, extra towels, etc. Thank you for your hospitality Joyce!"

The apartment is beautifully decorated and Joyce stocks it with food and toiletries, books, and dvds, a dog bed and bowls. Joyce even gave my dogs 2 new toys üòÄ Fantastic stay. I highly recommend!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Joyce's apartment in Wheeling was exactly what we needed. Joyce kept it stocked with all of the things we would need for our stay. We had a wonderful stay.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice place!

We were very pleased with our time in this beautiful space."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Joyce was an excellent host for my stay at her quaint apartment in the historic district of Wheeling. she has done a great job decorating the space and making you feel comfortable. she has many free amenities she offers her guests, such as K-Cup coffee pods, snacks and health and beauty items in the bathroom.
The space is well appointed and comfortable for one or two adults. There are a number of shops and restaurants within just a few blocks from this location, making it easy to go out for a bite to eat or just see some of the old architecture in the area.
although the space is part of a shared building, I found it to be reasonably quiet. if you plan on bringing a pet and they are nervous around ambient noise however, they might be a little uneasy with some of the activity, either within the building or the street outside.
this space is a great value for what you get and I would recommend people checking this place out!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Excellent stay. The apartment was very comfortable, in a gorgeous house. Extremely well stocked in terms of kitchen equipmen and bathroom amenities, and an amazing array of food and drinks available. We could have made ourselves breakfast there every day for a week and a half and not run out of food! We only needed a one-night stay but would have been very comfortable there for a longer time, easily. Highly recommend!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"I always love staying here when I visit Wheeling. Joyce is an amazing host, and the apartment is both quiet and very walkable to dining and shopping."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had such a lovely time staying at this Airbnb. The surrounding area is a bit run down, but that is not reflected on the outside or inside of this apartment at all. Everything was very clean and very well organized. She even had food, drink, and snacks to enjoy which was great because I forgot to bring snacks! Checking in with the padlock was easy to use, and Joyce made it very clear that I could message her anytime. She proactively sent a lot of info about checking in, the area, wifi passwords, etc. I felt very taken care of and comfy at this Airbnb!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Joyce's place. This is the second time I stayed there but the first time for my husband. He was very impressed. Everything you could possible need is provided. The location is also convenient.
We went to the Central market and WesBanco center. We also went to the Strand Theater and it was so easy to get to from this location.
We hope to be able to stay again in the future."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a beautiful historical stay within walking distance of the Wheeling Center Market. The apartment was very clean and well stocked with everything you could need. This will be my go-to when visiting the area again. I highly recommend it!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joyce‚Äôs place was full of wonderful extras. Close to the market and easy to get around. Parking on the street was not overcrowded and easy to access. The only issue was privacy. You can hear the conversations of hosts if they are on the main level. Therefore, they must be able to hear us. Our dog is a puppy and barked which understandably annoyed our hosts for their holiday. Our dog usually calms down; however, was always hearing them and confused."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lots of thoughtful touches, snacks, fresh food, sundries, treats for pets. We were just passing through so couldn't take full advantage.
Place was nice and quiet. Well, except that the bed creaks a bit when you get in or out. On street parking was fine.
There's cat food sitting out near the front door so if your dog is quick, the food is tempting."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a gem, if you are considering a stay, you will not be disappointed. It was so comfortable, nicely decorated with really beautiful antiques and we were pleasantly surprised by the snacks, beverages and complimentary toiletries in case one had forgotten something. We absolutely loved this place and wished we had stayed longer. It was walking distance from the Capital Theater so if that is what brings you to town, this is a no brainer. It‚Äôs also around the corner from some great antique shops."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"One of the best airbnb's I've ever stayed in! Super cute and comfy spot, walkable to a great part of the city. Joyce's thoughtfulness and generosity is designing the place and amenities was unparalleled. We will be back!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was amazing. There were toys, beds and food for my dog. There were snacks for us. Anything you could possibly need was here. Ty for letting us stau"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,I can't say about good things about this lovely apartment. My only regret is not being able to stay longer and enjoy the home and the historic neighborhood.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved this place. It was one of the best as far as the care they put into making it beautiful and cozy. They put a lot of thought into making it comfortable. Also the hospitality--so many amenities! Some food in the refrigerator, all kinds of lotions, shampoos etc. in the bathroom. Just what we needed after a long drive across Pennsylvania. If we go this way again, we'll be back!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,So beautiful will definitely be renting again!!!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"absolutely loved staying here! everything fit the descriptions, and we LOVED not having to buy groceries for the weekend and appreciated absolutely all of the extras included. would have absolutely paid more for what we did. fianc√© and i had a blast."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I love this house! it's full of personality and history. We felt instantly comfortable. We even decided to cook dinner and got a bunch of great food at Jebbia's Produce (who offers much more than produce), a 5-minute walk away. Joyce left lots of snacks - and more - for us and we ate way too many treats.  How many slices of cinnamon raisin toast can one person eat? Joyce let us store our bicycles overnight in her garage - a big plus for us.  Many thanks to Joyce for a great stay!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We truly enjoyed our stay! As a host she stocked the place so well. We didn‚Äôt need to even grab a single grocery which had never happened on a trip for us so we loved that. The bathroom was well stocked as well with whatever you may need. We were very impressed with that part. I loved the charm and character of the space as well. It felt immediately cozy. I‚Äôd highly recommend booking here as it was a completely easy and fun stay for us. Also I loved that she was super responsive to messages and went above and beyond for us as we forgot an iron and she immediately brought one down for us to use.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Joyce was great. Kept in touch with me 100%.
I had trouble with lock, strictly ‚Äúoperator error ‚Äú on my part, and she noticed on her smart lock app that I was not getting in. They live in the building and she came out to the door to assist me.
The, lock worked perfectly each time I used it after that.
The apartment is delightful. She even has it stocked with non-perishable food that you are free to use.
The same for toiletries!
The apartment is a short walk to the restaurant district of their area of Wheeling. A wonderful choice of good restaurants.
A wonderful experience.
I will stay there again as I pass through."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joyce& Eric‚Äôs place was perfect for our weekend in Wheeling to attend the Heritage Blues Festival! Only .8 mile walk to riverfront venue & a block away from access to the bike trail along the river. Hosts made sure everything needed for a comfortable stay was provided, such as coffee, milk, breakfast items & snacks galore (thx much)! Highly recommend!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Probably the most well stocked airbnb I have ever stayed at, everything you could need to be comfortable. Joyce is incredibly accomodating, friendly, and responsive. Zero complaints, would give 10 stars if I could!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Lovely space in a historic house downtown. Everything we could have possibly used/needed was supplied. Very clean! Parking was right in front- wish we could have stayed longer!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Joyce was an excellent hostess. The place was great and she communicated during my stay. Letting me know what was going on in town and how to get to the event.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I can‚Äôt say enough nice things about Joyce and her home. We have driven all over the country in RV‚Äôs and cars staying at many Airbnbs along the way. I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say Joyce‚Äôs place had the best amenities out of any we have stayed at. Anything and everything we needed was available from extra toothbrushes to toothpaste as well as coffees, teas and hot chocolate. The refrigerator was stocked with cheeses and eggs along with multiple drink choices. We felt at home and taken care of. Everything worked perfectly! Thanks Joyce for a wonderful experience. The next time we pass through Wheeling we will be sure to stay with you again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Felt right at home. Host provided anything we might need during our stay even snacks!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Joyce had terrific recommendations for the city and gifted my dog a free toy, which he loves. The apartment was beautiful and centrally located. I will definitely stay there again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joyce and Eric's place was extremely charming and comfortable. There were many extra amenities available. The coffee bar was beyond what I would have expected. There was fresh half and half, milk and creamer in the fridge and even an assortment of flavored syrups in case I wanted to fancy up my coffee. It was a short walk to a nice handful of cute shops and restaurants. If I find myself in Wheeling again I will definitely try to stay here again. I did get a kick out of their cat who was doing zoomies throughout the day! It made me feel like I wasn't far from home! My dog, who traveled with me also seemed very comfortable and at ease there."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"Joyce was a great host. Everything was great, but there were 2 minor drawbacks.
First, the front yard could be maintained better. There were lots of dead weeds along the walkway. This gave an uninviting feel, but the inside was great. Secondly, the mattress seemed to be queen size, but the bed frame was smaller than the mattress. The mattress hung over the frame. On one side, the mattress was wedged down in the frame. My husband and I kept migrating to that side of the bed. The mattress itself was very comfortable, though.
OVERALL, great stay and great host. Lots of extras, fresh fruit and breakfast items, and lots of suggestions on restaurants and activities. We really enjoyed our one day/night stay."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Charming historical place that had all the modern conveniences while keeping its historical charm. Lovely decor. Perfectly stocked small kitchen with all necessary dishes and utensils. Generously stocked with snacks and breakfast food, bottled water and juice. Fantastic modern bathroom. Bathroom amenties were above average amount of soaps, shampoos, including items like qtips, tylenol, lens wipes, toothbrushes (new in package). A perfect home away from home!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Simple check in, good price and host responds quickly"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The apartment was just as described. It had a comfortable at home feel. They went above and beyond with the amenities. What stood out the most was all the little things that they provided with the room. They not only accommodated for a couple to stay, the apartment was furnished with high chairs, snacks, drinks, movies, and all the toiletries you could imagine if you had forgotten anything. They even provided for pets. All and all the stay and accommodations were outstanding"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Honestly this is the best Air bnb experience that I have ever had. Joyce makes you feel right at home. The garden area is such a lovely getaway with a stunning view. The apartment has every amenity that you need, like you never even left your home. The location is prime. From walking down historic Chapline Street, right around the corner is the Market Square where you can find everything that you need. From local art venders in the market, to candles, wine, and an apothecary and coffee shop. It‚Äôs only a very short walk to several great local eats. From there you can walk the river trail to heritage point to enjoy the water front with more art and local novelties. The easy access to the whole city is ideal. We would recommend her to anyone who is traveling to Wheeling."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Joyce‚Äôs AirBnB was wonderful. Located in a historic building in a quiet area, it was a short walk to Centre Market and downtown Wheeling.
The kitchen was very well stocked with food and snacks, which was greatly appreciated, and the bathroom had any toiletries you might need.
Area seemed very safe and quiet, with easy street parking just steps from the front door.
Joyce was also extremely responsive and pleasant."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joyce thought of everything to make our stay comfortable and relaxing. From coffee to the half and half in the fridge Joyce thought of every small detail. Beautiful, clean and peaceful, we will be staying here again!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was adorable, clean, and smelled amazing! There were also a lot of amenities and tons of snacks!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful apartment in a very charming and walkable part of town. Lots of useful amenities like toiletries and snacks. Joyce set up a high chair and pack-and-play for us‚Äîthe pack-n-play fit right into a bedroom closet with shuttered doors, which worked well for keeping the baby nearby but in his own quiet space. The door between the bedroom and kitchen/living area is glass, so there is some light leak into the bedroom if one person goes to bed earlier‚Äînot the kind of thing that matters unless you (or your toddler) is used to super dark sleeping conditions. Overall a great place, we would definitely go back!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very comfortable! Snacks, groceries, toiletries, towels‚Ä¶it was all there! The bed was a little squeaky, lol! Nice stay!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Joyce is a great host! The apartment has everything you need. The snacks are an especially nice. Convenient to everything in Wheeling.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We did no manage to meet Joyce as we stayed just for the night but we communicated via emails prior our stay and Joyce always responded very quickly and with all answers. The place is really fabulous and I am sorry we couldn't stay longer. There is literally everything in the flat that you may need on your stay. Thanks again for lovely experience. Beti
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wow! We LOVED Joyce's Historic District apartment! And when I mean ""we,"" I mean the two humans as well as the two dogs appreciated every bit of it. She has a chaise lounge for the humans as well as the dogs! : ) And she provided bowls, dog treats, and even some take-home stuffies for my pups. We also enjoyed the dog artwork on the walls which made us feel even more at home.
Built in 1888, the house takes you back in time for sure. It truly is a lovely space. Joyce pays attention to every detail providing everything one might need for a restful stay. The decor throughout the apartment is very inviting and homey. The kitchen is stocked with food options perfect for a traveler arriving and needing a quick meal or for waking up and making a yummy breakfast before hitting the road. The neighborhood felt very safe. I was easily able to park a large truck right out front of the apartment which I appreciated. And we enjoyed walking the dogs throughout the neighborhood day and night."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Adorable space with everything we needed and more!! Items to make a full breakfast, pampering items in the bathroom and late night snacks."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Overnight stay for our anniversary. Joyce was welcoming and accomodated our schedule for visiting the WV Penitentiary and for our dog. The front gardens were blooming, very lovely, and the outside architecture of her home and surrounding houses is astounding. Everything you'd need provided in kitchen and bath, comfortable bedroom and living room. Next block are restaurants and shops. Enjoyable stay."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The apartment was a step back in time. Very nicely furnished in a historical house in downtown Wheeling. The treats for humans and dogs were substantial and greatly appreciated. Most of restaurants in historic district are closed on Sunday, next time I would be sure to stay another day."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful stay here! The apartment is lovely and was very clean. The host was very hospitable, friendly and proactive.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent stay! Extremely well equipped and lots of character to the home. I highly recommend!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is just the kind of stay you‚Äôre looking for. Why in the world would you spend money at some mega corporation hotel, when you can stay in a gorgeous Victorian apartment with high ceilings and complete accommodations- and pay less??"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a gem of an Airbnb, perfect for a couple or family with young kids and/or a dog. Great spot to walk around and see Wheeling and easy to get there from the highway. Check in was super smooth and the place had everything we needed and more."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very nice place to stay for a night, I would heavily recommend."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place and host are both great! I‚Äôve never seen a bnb so well stocked! Thank you!!

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I‚Äôd highly recommend and stay again!!
So cozy and comfortable, she thought of everything!
It was freezing outside and the place was always so nice and warm.
One of the nicest places I have ever stayed.
Walk to Centre Market, many churches and stores and shops within 3 blocks. Ez on and off the main roads. I felt very safe here. Parking was right infront.
Perfect spot!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is really nice and has everything you could need. Parked right out front, coming and going over 2 days, no problem at all. I am so glad I found this place, usually I filter out all but Superhost, but I think Joyce's place is too new for this status. So glad I found it! The neighborhood is very historic and safe. Walkable to Center Market District just 1.5 blocks away with shops, restaurants. In case you didn't know, Wheeling is a very friendly city!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful little place to stay! From the wonderful aroma when you enter to the super clean residence to the generously stocked kitchen it was perfect! The bedding even smelled good! Joyce was very pleasant to interact with & very responsive to messages. Highly recommend staying here!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very quaint. Stocked with basic cooking needs, which I appreciated, as well as snacks and toiletry items. Very easy to find."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,We absolutely LOVED Joyce‚Äôs place!!! It was the homiest Airbnb we have ever stayed at. Nice location and snacks galore for us to enjoy. Fantastic place‚Äîwould 100000% recommend.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay at Joyce's Airbnb. It was perfectly furnished and had more amenities than you could imagine. Just show up with your clothes and a few personal items and your all set. You feel right at home when you walk in. I can't wait to stay there again. I will certainly pack less stuff.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Really great place. Kitchen is super well stocked. The bedroom is especially cute! Highly recommended!!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really a hidden gem! Passing by on I-70 and lack of reasonably priced hotels in the area, and end up finding gold at the end of the rainbow. The host was impeccable with making sure the airb&b unit is fully stocked with every possible item, including some fresh fruits and food. They really went out of their way and it shows their pride and details in making sure the guest enjoys their stay. The place is lovely, reminds me of old British houses in the old days where I lived for over 10 years recently. I didn't hear much either during my stay, it was very relaxing and you get a lot of bang and value for your money here. You won't regret it :)"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joyce has a wonderful spot in downtown Wheeling. The historic charm is exactly what my fiancee and I seek out when getting an airb&b and her placed delivered! Knowing our love for historic architecture, Joyce gave us a tour of her main home as well. It was such a treat and the apartment we stayed in was gorgeous and private. You can really come and go as you please and don‚Äôt have to worry about waking up the owners as there is a great private entry. I would definitely stay again."
2023-01-01,4,Stayed one night,Experience historic Wheeling in the location and styling of the apartment. Everything one might need is provided. Walking distance to Later Alligator restaurant. We arrived on a holiday so Joyce kindly called to check if it was open. Had a brochure for us forThe Festival of Trees in Oglebay Park. Thank you.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Absolutely Charming‚Ä¶like something out of a story book! As soon as I arrived, I knew I would love it. You could see a pretty lit Christmas tree through the front window. Upon opening the door, I was greeted with the sweet scent of warmers and dimly lit lamps throughout. The living room was so cozy and there was even a doggie bed set out for my puppy. The kitchen was filled with snacks & necessities and a fabulous tea & coffee cart! The bedroom had fresh linens and plenty of closet space. The bathroom was stocked with every toiletry item you could need. You could just pack a bag of clothes and be very comfortable. Not only that, the host Joyce is so sweet and accommodating! I was welcomed into the main house for a tour while using the washer & dryer. Even more, I stayed over the holidays and thought it would be difficult, but I was immediately treated like family. Joyce sent over Christmas cookies & breads and checked up regularly. I honestly can‚Äôt say enough. I will definitely be back!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joyce has a charming, comfortable place! I felt like I was at home. All was spotlessly clean and the kitchen is fabulous with lots of supplies and extra touches. My favorite things were the artwork in each room and the substantial charcuterie board prepared for my arrival. You cannot go wrong if you choose to stay with Joyce!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joyce was a great host! Place had extra amenities that were helpful! There was coffee syrup, breakfast foods, and snacks. Place is walkable to the main downtown area."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, great location. Joyce was so helpful and accommodating. She honored our request to check in early as well as have a late check out. Great little town with shops and bars/restaurants that are a 2 minute walk away. The place was very clean and well stocked with everything we need (snacks, coffee, toiletries, etc). Highly recommend."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautifully appointed with lots of kitchen and bath extras. Lovely Victorian atmosphere with the right modernizations. Very close to the market and the history of Wheeling.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here on a road trip. It was easy to access off the highway and straightforward to find/check in. The apartment is lovely and in a quiet area. Plenty of room for two people, a baby, and a dog. There were many thoughtful touches and amenities. The floor was nice and clean and we didn‚Äôt worry about our little one crawling around at all. The host did awesome and we‚Äôd definitely stay here again!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I had an AMAZING time at this place!!! Joyce went above & beyond my expectations as a host. After setting up my visit online, she sent me a list of attractions/restaurants in & around the city. She was kind & very helpful with any questions I had. When I got there, a scented wax warmer was on, there were food/drinks, & because I stayed for more than a week, she made me a charcuterie board for my first day! Some other things available were books, movies, streaming services, self-care products, playing cards, extra pillows/blankets, bath products, towels, etc. She was so thoughtful that she even put new toothbrushes in the bathroom in case visitors forgot theirs.
I had a friend stop by, which turned into a couple nights of them staying over. Joyce had no issues with the change of plans.
The city was amazing too! Two blocks away from the house is a WHOLE BUNCH of shops, restaurants, & small businesses. I highly recommend this AirBnB!"
