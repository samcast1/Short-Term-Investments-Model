Within one of the two bedrooms, is another room which is either an extra large closet or a small room (with a door) that includes a queen size bed/cot.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Shannon & Kaves's house was perfect for a weekend in State College with our young family. The space was clean and well equipped and the hosts were communicative and friendly.
Every square inch of the space is well used. Even though there were only three of us, I felt like we could have comfortable fit another family or had the grandparents tag along.
The setup of the community is really clever in that even though the houses are all super close, it still feels really private because the neighbors widows don't look into either the listing's windows or backyard.
I would have appreciated the great patio, fire pit, and fenced in backyard a lot more if it hadn't been raining in Happy Valley the ENTIRE time we were there, but I'm quite certain the hosts had no control over the weather ;-)"
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,My 1st Airbnb in my home town ( out of over a 100) for visiting family. They enjoyed this very clean 2 bed/ 1 1/2 bath place. Lots of little extras…firewood/ coffee/ extra cot/ games etc in very quiet area 4 minutes from yummy Wegmans supermarket. Great place

This home is spacious plenty of room if the kids want to play a game in the kitchen on the big dining room table and the adults wanna watch a movie there a space for everybody.

2021-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This home is just what we were looking for for our weekend away in Happy Valley. The photos do not do it justice! We comfortably had 4 people staying here. The layout is nice with the main living area and kitchen on first floor and the bedrooms on the second. The yard space is a huge added bonus!! Location wise, this house is amazing. It is just a 10 min drive to PSU and Beaver Canyon, so it is close enough for activities but far enough away to be quiet and not rowdy. The residential area itself has long sidewalks which we liked for walks or jogging. The price is more than fair. We loved all the touches of PSU in the home decor.
We had a little trouble with the check-in process but it was remedied by owners. Their communication was quick and friendly."

It has a notebook with instructions and suggestions and someone to call for any questions!! They have really thought of everything!! It was my husband’s first Airbnb experience and he said “You really hit it out of the park with this one!”
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Shannons and Kaves place was fantastic. Just right size for our family of 4 for Penn State graduation weekend.

The home is very clean with comfortable furniture and beds. Kitchen is well stocked with what you'll need if cooking while your visiting. Washer and drier are very new and very helpful. Parking works well with a garage available for a small-to-medium size car.
Hosts were excellent throughout the rental experience. I'm not sure I've ever had better communications with an Airbnb host. They really are interested in making sure you have a good visit. I highly recommend this rental."

2020-08-01,5,Group trip,"It’s so difficult to go to the places we would normally go due to Covid. So it’s very nice to have had somewhere to go that felt like home in an area that is nostalgic for us and to have shown our kids Penn State.

The house is beautifully decorated in a Penn State them, the kitchen had everything we needed, and the whole house was very clean. The location was great; 2 bus stops within walking distance and only minutes to campus or downtown. There's also a park a short walk away, which would probably be great for kids in warm weather.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Helen’s place was great. This was our favorite rental by far in State College. We are looking forward to planning our next stay here.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Helen's place was very spacious and modern. It looked exactly like the pictures. The beds were super comfortable and the open space kitchen/living room was a great gathering space for family and friends. The home is located in a quiet neighborhood. We didn't have a chance to explore/enjoy the outdoor space.. Just a note, there are 3 bedrooms upstairs, but only 1 bathroom. The other bathroom is on the lowest level which was a little inconvenient as the freshly showered person needs to walk thru the living room/kitchen area to get upstairs."

Thank you Helen for a beautiful experience."

Our family loved everything from the open kitchen/family room concept and well laid out bedrooms to the game room and signature cups and glasses. Kitchen is stocked with everything you need! Loved the electric heated fireplaces when coming in from the January cold weather! The only thing we missed was the fire pit due to rain. Off street parking was perfect. Helen had so many personal touches that allowed our family (ages 9-75) to focus on quality time with each other as opposed to problems. This has to be the best Airbnb in “Happy Valley”!!

Luxurious bedding, fully stocked kitchen and just an overall great space for the fam. The kids enjoyed the game room and we all had space to relax. Just wish we’d stayed longer to really enjoy the backyard and more of the neighborhood parks. Conveniently located the Penn State and lots of restaurants and shops nearby for any extras you might need. We were here for the inaugural IM70.3 Happy Valley and it was a great home base. I imagine it will also be fabulous during football season!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I stayed for two weeks at the little cottage and it was perfect for what I needed. I had work at penn state and it was less than 15 minutes to get there each morning. My partner needed to work remotely and she had a great work setup at the house and the neighborhood was quiet with no distractions. Also all the furniture feels very new and everything was so clean, so we felt very comfortable. We also had dinner and brunch at the pine grove hall right up the street which was convenient and delicious. We mostly cooked though, and the kitchen had all the appliances and cookware for nice dinners. Grocery stores are a little far though. Also, while the wifi was perfect, phone service was really weak while inside the cottage. I had to step outside to make phone calls. But overall, it was a very pleasant stay and exactly suited our needs."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was very cozy and clean with quality linens. Basic amenities were provided (i.e. coffee, well stocked kitchen, laundry detergent, etc.).

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Easily a 5 star Airbnb. We loved Katie and Liam’s house for our family’s needs. The house had some old character, but was totally updated and clean. It felt light and fresh. It was small but still worked great for our family of 5. No bathtub, but otherwise a very family friendly home. The hosts provided a highchair and pack n play, and the abundant kids’ books and puzzles were a great surprise. There are two flights of stairs but they already have a baby gate blocking one, and it’s easy to close the door leading to the other. The extra space in the loft was great to have. Thoughtful touches throughout the house. Convenient to State College and very easy to get an Uber to downtown. Great communication. We’d definitely stay here again any time we need to be in State College."

Beds were comfortable, having an outside grill was perfect, the shower was great! Stay with Katie and Liam when you're coming to the State College area!"

It is located in Pine Grove Mills which is a small village that is on the west side of State College and Penn State.

The owners literally thought of everything! Loved the 3 different types of coffee makers and a wonderful selection of premium coffee and tea, with appropriate condiments so you can immediately make yourself at home. And that is the best way to describe our stay…. We felt right at home and couldn’t wait to come back after our daily adventures visiting family. A great place to relax and enjoy the modern farmhouse decor! Added bonus was the quaint upstairs office of the bedroom with the Queen bed. We will be back next time we visit family! Thank you for being such great hosts. Your heart and care of your guests is evident in every detail 🥰👍"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great. It was like our home. We enjoyed our stay. I’ll definitely consider staying there again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Kate and Liam's place was amazing. The neighborhood was quiet. The backyard was wonderful to relax in. Everything was so easy to get to in State College. The bed was super comfortable and everything was incredibly clean and tidy. I would recommend to anyone visiting State College.
2024-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Let me preface my review in saying if this visit happened during a regularly-priced timeframe I would have rated it Great (5 stars) but it is hard to rate it as a value and 5, given the extremely expensive price related to going during commencement. Honestly, it just upped my expectations a bit because of the cost. It was clean, convenient to where we needed to be, quiet and our hosts were responsive. We had a comfortable stay. Thanks Kate and Liam."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Super comfortable and easy stay! Safe parking in the driveway was a huge plus!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you Katie and Liam! Your home was just as described. The cute little touches were amazing. The linens were so comfy, it was hard not to have a good sleep. The kitchen had all the necessities to cook a meal.
I have already recommended the home to a family friend who is heading to Penn State for her grandson's graduation in August!
If you are looking for a home close to campus, that you could cook your loved ones a nice breakfast while looking at the garden out the window while you enjoy the sun or rain, this is the place.
Close to lots of shopping and restaurants. Super close to campus and the creamery.
Book this cottage today, you won't be disappointed."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Katie and Liam’s place was indeed very cute and cozy! It’s a great spot if you’re visiting Penn State but don’t want to be around the hustle and bustle around the university.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks again! We had a great time and had everything we needed. The hosts also let us check in a few minutes early

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Katie and Liam's place was perfect for a long weekend. My husband and I enjoyed the fact that it was close enough to the PSU campus as well as just far enough away to be quiet and out of the rush that is PSU. The house was perfectly appointed and spotless. We had everything we needed.
Favorite part was drinking my morning coffee in the overstuffed chair in the living room. Sun came in perfectly while I watched out the beautiful bay window.
Highly recommend this location for a long weekend in State College."

2024-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The place was located in a very nice neighborhood. As a woman, staying here with her daughter, I felt safe the whole time I was there. My main thing when selecting this place is I wanted something clean and quiet. This place was very clean and the neighborhood was quiet. The furnace was a bit loud and you could hear it kick on and off but the street and neighbor noise was non existent. It was way better than going to a noisy unclean hotel. My only complaint was the bed I slept in was not comfortable. My daughter said her bed was so maybe it was just me and my preference but I didn’t get the best sleep :( other than that I’d highly recommend this place."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,The house was cozy and clean and the room had everything we needed!

2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This place was good to stay for a quick weekend to see our daughter! Neighbors have 3 barking dogs but other than that fairly quiet with occasional traffic
Wish there was a dishwasher, and newer, firmer mattresses, we woke up with sore backs! I would definitely stay there again in a pinch, cute simple place"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was in State College to help my child. Katie and Liam were great at extending my stay when my departure dates changed. The cottage is nice and cozy. Kitchen is great. I hit Wegmans (5 minute drive) and stocked up and cooked there the whole time.
Quiet and peaceful. WIFI was great--I teleworked the whole week with no problem. And when I ran out of clothes, the washer/dryer worked great.
Highly reccommend!"

Heat works well. Also appreciated access to washer and dryer since I had a longer stay. Hosts were responsive to my needs.
A tip, the driveway is long and narrow- so if you don’t like backing up-park closer to the street.
I’ve stayed at many places at State College- highly recommend this home. Thanks Katie and Liam for sharing your home with us- made me feel at home even though I was a guest."

I'd definitely recommend this bnb to anyone that is looking to visit Penn State but be in a homey and peaceful area, as it's in an extremely quiet spot where you don't hear the downtown noise but it's also not far from campus."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family of four (two kids, 9 and 6) had a great experience at Katie and Liam’s home. It was only 10 minutes from campus and near so many stores, coffee shops and restaurants. It definitely beats paying $1000+ per night in a hotel room. An incredible value. We appreciated the little touches like snacks upon our arrival and fun games for the kids to play. Would definitely return!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at Katie and Liam’s! We would be happy to stay again.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is hands down the best AirBnB I've ever stayed in. The place is beautiful. Katie and Liam have thought of everything - extra towels, blankets, pillows, and 4 different types of coffee makers with instructions are just a few examples of the thoughtful set up and curation of items. I can't recommend their place highly enough. Will always stay there when I come through State College."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cottage was great! I really appreciate how clean it was and that all the products were fragrance free. It was definitely what was promised and was a great space to stay in during a business trip.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying at the house. It was family-friendly and great for our two little kids. For being ""cozy"" it was quite spacious! I was impressed with the house's layout; we had plenty of room to roam around and the kids could play in the family room. I appreciated that they had toys, games, a pack-and-play, a high chair, and kids' dinnerware. All of the decor was really cute, you can tell that they take pride in their home and want it to look nice and match the feeling of the house. It is an older home but that added to the charm. The neighborhood is very quiet too, that's always a perk in a college town. It felt safe and was in a good location to drive to campus or other restaurants. I also liked that they had enough supplies (extra blankets, towels, lotion, soap, etc.) The host was very responsive when we needed something fixed and immediately came to take care of it. I would definitely recommend staying here!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an adorable place! I honestly can’t think of a thing that should be changed or any advice for the owners. Someone mentioned in their review about having too many check-out rules…..growing up in State College, I know how crazy some tailgate weekends can get. My guess is those rules are in place because one or more guests left the place a mess. Besides, checking out wasn’t a big deal (and we stayed three days). Absolutely will return!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Most importantly the cottage was clean, secure and safe, and conveniently located to bike path. I appreciated the neutral scent and liquid soaps. The accommodations were comfortable, essentially stocked, and user-friendly. The tv channels were limited. It would have been nice to get ATT Sports, ESPN, Food Network, or TNT, all were unavailable. I would consider a repeat stay and would recommend the cottage to a friend. Thank you, Katie and Liam"

The books and games were a nice touch. My son loved the TV. My husband who is over six feet said bed seemed small. There is also a long list of things to take care of prior to leaving the house like sweeping, taking out garbage, washing dishes, just want to give heads up in case people are in a rush in the morning. Overall, it was an excellent stay."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Katie and Liam’s place is just as advertised. It’s a great location. We walked the 3(ish) miles to the PSU game on the nearby bike path. Katie and Liam were really good communicators. The house was very clean and had everything we needed for cooking meals for our family. Would definitely recommend to anyone coming into town.

We sat out in the back yard until dark talking and playing cards and watched the fireflies all over the yard. The home is thoughtfully appointed with plenty of fluffy towels, linens, kids toys and games, and baby accessories like a high chair and pack n play. Everything was organized and easy to find. I cannot emphasize enough how clean this home is. We look forward to renting another of Katie and Liam’s homes in the future!"

I loved the original fixtures and elements of the home. The exhaust fan from the '50s is especially cool! From first-hand experience. Great beds.

2023-07-01,3,Stayed one night,"While the townhouse itself was spacious, and the newly added bathroom through the mancave was extremely nice, upon check-in there was a distracting, stubborn musty smell in both the kitchen area (old sponge? sink drains?) and the whole upstairs floor. In the master bedroom trashcan there was some paper trash and a very large ball of human hair left behind. Considering the hefty cleaning fee included in the booking, you might expect a higher standard of cleanliness. The beds were spacious and comfortable, and we got a laugh from the love hotel mirror placement in the second bedroom. Good for special events where space is needed for guests, or for out of town sleepers, but just-ok overall."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The location worked well for our visit. We were in town to attend a graduation and to visit family. The townhome could easily sleep six people comfortably and if the basement bathroom was needed it gave us two and 1/2 baths. We did not use the deck out back but it could be a nice spot as well. Much better than any hotel stay and less expensive too.

2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"My first-time staying at an airbnb in State College. It was about what I expected. Townhouse north of campus...nice to have your own place, a bit older--not renovated, but the owners definitely keep it up. Would definitely consider staying here again."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice set up, wish we had more time to stay and use what was available. Didn't expect a basement with a second TV. And a back patio that would be great for warmer weather. Would definitely request this place again if our child decides to go to Penn State."

We especially enjoyed having our coffee on the back porch in the mornings. Would absolutely recommend and stay here again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Katie and Liam’s place was a perfect little BnB right on the edge of town. It was exactly as described, super clean, very soft and comfy beds, and a sweet little deck and yard for enjoying the surroundings. It was right on the main road, but we never heard traffic - not really a super busy area. It was 5 minutes from Rothrock State Forest - lots of beautiful hiking in there; and 5 minutes from great restaurants in town. The morning coffee options were the best we’ve ever had at a BnB; and there were spices and oil for cooking in the kitchen. We would happily return if we were in the area again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. This was the 2nd time here and I expect to be back.

Everything was organized and clean. I felt at home."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was perfect for a weekend basketball tournament. It was only 5 min from one of the courts, 12 from another, and the farthest course being 25 minutes from this property. Plenty of space and the beds were super comfy! The master shower was heavenly!"

The beds were comfortable and the fireplace in the living room made the home cozy. The hosts were very responsive and friendly. Short drive to Penn State University. Would love to stay there again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Willows place was stylish, clean, and thoughtfully designed. The beds were super comfy and she had truly thought of everything amenity wise. For the coffee and tea lover, it here is a real coffee machine and a wonderful selection of coffees. She also went above and beyond in kindness for my 4 year old, making her a pallet of her own and allowing her to feed the fish on the porch!! Although we didn’t get to enjoy it due to a busy schedule, the porch and back yard area is as relaxing as it comes. Thanks Willow! We REALLY appreciate you!"

Easy 10-15 minute drive to campus and perfectly located on a private, quiet neighborhood street. Ample parking for 3 cars and overall a very specious space with plenty of room for the 6 of us. Kitchen had all necessary equipment to cook and linens that were provided were comfortable and clean. Overall a great stay and would absolutely consider staying here again when we are back in the area."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a great space! Boalsburg is a really cute little town and it’s a short drive to downtown State College. The home is clean, with really comfortable beds and 2 clean bathrooms. Great kitchen space, too. We would definitely stay there again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at this comfortable and clean house. We were visiting our son at PSU and had my 83 mother and two teenager kids with us. The house was easy for my mother to get in and out of (there are a few steps to get in) and the one floor living was helpful for her. The bedrooms were spacious and comfortable, but the mattresses were all quite soft (we typically prefer a firmer mattress). A very open and big kitchen with lots of counter space. It would have been helpful to have a bigger couch as really only two people could sit in it. The living area has the space for a much bigger one or even a sectional and that would have made hanging out more comfortable. Nice and quiet location - away from the craziness of State College but very convenient and quick to get to town. And the Main Street of Boalsburg is charming! Definitely recommend this house!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing place and location. Perfect with a little one.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was very clean, the beds were comfortable, and the kitchen is well-stocked with everything you need.

If ever back in town, your place will be the first place I try to book!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bright and beautiful, quiet and relaxing. Perfect sized house for a family of 4-6. Everything is updated and clean. We had a great stay visiting Boalsburg and State College area. The owners are great communicators. Thank you!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Good experience as usual.
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,Appropriate for our needs and price paid. We were out for the weekend house-hunting and needed a base. Clean and basic items are present.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed staying here. It’s absolutely beautiful, very spacious, well decorated and comfy beds. The house also has tons of yard space to enjoy nature. I really loved how close the house is to everything in State College. Highly recommend."

Having toys and books for the kids was a big plus."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic stay at this Airbnb! The house was impeccably clean and well-equipped. The kitchen had all the necessary utensils, crockery, cutlery, and the special touch of a wide choice of coffee, nutribars and popcorns made it even more delightful.
Highly recommend this place!"

2024-02-01,5,Group trip,Liam responded right away when I had a question and the house was just perfect for our family. This is our second time staying at their house and we’ve loved it both times.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Batteries ran out in the remote, and the instructions said to contact the host to replace. They came out immediately and took care of it. Very responsive and friendly, a lovely place to stay when we had some work done on our home."

Very suitable for our needs
Would be nice to have a place (dresser) to lay things out in the bedrooms and small bathroom. Main bathroom very roomy"
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"The house was easy to find, was spotless in every room. They had books and games that you could use. It really snowed while we were there and they plowed the driveway, we were really grateful for that.
This was our first time doing a Airbnb, we would definitely stay here again. They kept in touch to see if we needed anything.
I would highly recommend them for their house and being in touch with you if you needed anything!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Worked out perfectly for visiting family in the area. thanks!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything was exactly as described and pictured. Clutter free, clean and exactly what our little family of 4 needed for an impromptu getaway! We appreciated the kids toys and games for all ages as we stayed with a 2.5 and 5 year old. Location was great with plenty of food options nearby and a hop, skip and a jump to the PSU campus. We will definitely stay here again in the future!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great time!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place for a repeat stay!

2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This house was a great value. It's very cute with lots of room to spread out. We stayed here with my sister and her husband: we have two PSU students and they have one - and we brought our older son along. The students came over for dinner since we had lots of space to spread out and dine, then all the guests of the house had a comfortable bed and bathing facilities that were private, attractive and clean. I recommend you bring your own pillow to sleep on since each guest had only one pillow provided - and don't plan on really relaxing in the living room. The furniture is perfect for perching but not great for snuggling in for a movie. There was also a pronounced musty smell when we arrived that either dissipated or our noses became accustomed to with time, so if you are sensitive to that it's something to consider. The proximity to campus was fabulous and the spaciousness of the home was a big bonus with all the gear we had for the tailgate we planned. I recommend this home."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Katie and Liam were wonderful hosts to a beautiful home in a great location.
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"I stayed here with my fiancé for our wedding in Boalsburg. It was the perfect space to get ready on the morning of the wedding with my bridal party! Clean, cute & a nice open concept living room/kitchen."

It was just the right size for our family gathering for the Penn State - Iowa football weekend, and we walked to nearby Duffy's Tavern for dinner on Friday evening, which was very nice. The home has a great setup for watching TV sports or movies, with a seating area for five, and the dining room table in rear of room, for others to join in. The rooms were spacious, and bathrooms were well appointed and clean. We would consider coming back to this home in the future."

2023-05-01,4,Group trip,"Katie and Liam’s house was perfect for our graduation stay. The house was clean, comfortable and photos matched. The only downside is that the family room did not have enough furniture to seat 6 people staying at the house, only 5 which meant somebody had to sit at the table instead."
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,Everything was better than expected and perfect for a quick stay!

Traveling for field hockey and house was a 10-15 minute drive from sports complex. Very close to Penn State and all it has to offer. Would definitely stay again!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We very much enjoyed our stay. The house was well located, close to State College and close to our family that lives in Bellafonte. The house was clean, easy to find and had a great layout.
While only four of us stayed at the house, we had three visitors for a quiet NYE in. The open floor plan made it a great space to do puzzles, play games, and be able to spend the holiday together. My mother-in-law especially appreciated the single floor living.

We are a family that loves to cook and eat and the huge kitchen with tons of counter space was ideal. We did end up buying cookie sheets to heat up appetizers but really could have done without by just using the foil that was in the house. I don't think most renters cook as much as we do but there were plenty of pots, frying pans, plates, ....
We would definitely stay again."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great host and clean house,responded very quickly to questions we had."
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"Katie and Liam were so kind and their property was exactlyas pictured!

Easy highway access was a great bonus!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Would give 6 stars if I could! The perfect place for little kids! The house is immaculate and kid safe—and the listing underplays the amenities: there is a pack and play, a high chair, a good selection of kids books, and an enormous backyard to play in. We were traveling from ky to Boston and spent the night here to break up trip. Best decision of the drive. Our 2 year old is already asking to go back to his “Pennsylvania house”"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Awesome location! We had a great stay and we look forward to coming back to walkable Boalsburg. Perfect distance from State College and if you happen to be in town for a wedding at General Potter Farm- this is the place to stay! It was clean and safe for our little guy to crawl around.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The property is in a great location- close enough to feel accessible, but far enough away to not feel crowded. The interior is nicely updated, but with enough customization to make the property feel less cookie-cutter. In terms of functionality, the bedrooms were spacious and separated enough to allow a family of four with 2 young children to move around comfortably. All around, it was a great weekend!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Was an amazing experience- clean, comfortable, and convenient. The owners were responsive, professional, and kind. Hoping this home will be available on our next trip to Penn State!"

The location is super-convenient to Penn State and there is a beautiful back yard to enjoy.
The home is perfectly clean and we loved the decor. We had everything we needed to cook and feel at home.
The scent-free products are so appreciated! I’m sensitive to a lot of harsh chemicals and smells and it was so refreshing to not have allergy issues.
We loved everything about our stay and hope we can stay again on our next visit."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a very nice stay in a spacious house with a terrific back yard. It's walking distance to Duffy's Tavern, which was incredibly convenient.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful kid-friendly place. This house is a nice place for anyone, but traveling with an older infant makes me super thankful for the lack of stairs (entrance stairs behind doors) or any hazards for a young explorer. We also appreciated the toys, pack n play, and high chair.
The backyard was lovely and my girls loved seeing all the bunnies and squirrels. We enjoyed the puzzles and the coziness of the entire place. It was also easy for us to get an Uber to downtown state college and back. The house was walkable to downtown Boalsburg. We enjoyed our stay and absolutely would love to stay here again."

The place was spotless-probably the cleanest airbnb that we have ever stayed in. We definitely would recommend this apartment!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Sharma’s place was absolutely perfect in every way. True attention to detail in every aspect of the listing. Immaculately clean and beautifully decorated. Five star Air bnb!!!!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely loved our stay here! It was so nice! So much detail was put into this being an amazing place to stay. We shared with another couple and had so much fun! It was a great convenient location to sporting events and downtown.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Might be the most perfect stay ever? This was a super convenient location for our visit to PSU. Driveway and walkways were completely clear of snow. Sharma accommodated our early check in request and even offered late check out though we didn’t need it. She os a wonderfully responsive host! The place felt special from arrival to departure.

Would definitely stay here again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sharma made us feel right at home for our weekend stay. The location was also perfect to get downtown, campus or the tailgates. From the snack bar to the hand warmers for a cold November PSU game, we can’t thank her enough for the amazing hospitality!"

We very easily got to the game and there was plenty of space for our tailgate food in the fridge."

Great location and easy walking to College Ave and all the spots!
10/10 would recommend you stay here!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay! Sharma doesn’t leave anything out in this clean and just the right size apartment. Walkable to PSU campus. Everything down to the plethora of towels, to kitchen amenities and even the nice touch of chocolates on the pillows when you arrive. If you are looking for a great place to stay near campus, this is it! Thank you Sharma."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay. The host provided everything we could possibly want and a few things we didn’t know we wanted like half & half for coffee, savory and sweet snacks and chocolates on our pillows.
Plentiful pillows, sparkling clean bed linens and thick thirsty towels made it feel very homey."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect location for our visit to PSU. The apartment was perfect!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a great place and with so many amenities. Really loved it there (and I don’t many reviews). But Sharma had extra-touches. She clearly cares and makes a huge effort.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is the second time we have stayed with Sharma. Love this place, my absolute favorite Airbnb, immaculate and very comfortable. She has everything that you need here and more. Hoping to come back for further visits."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place, perfect location (walking distance to Tadashi, the golf course and the arboretum!) and perfect host. The place is spotless, bright and relaxing, everything that one might need was provided - and a lot more. A lot of thought went into making this Airbnb as welcoming and pleasant as possible. By far our best stay in State College - we will be back!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sharma was so helpful and the place was terrific. My stay was excellent.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was stunning! The photos don't justify how beautiful it is and the location was perfect. Private and very cozy, felt like home! Perfectly clean! Spotless!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The apartment is absolutely beautiful! The entire space was spacious, clean, bright, and oh my goodness...the bedding was glorious! Everything - from the towels to the little amenities - was perfect. The outdoor deck, BBQ, and large windows lets in tons of natural light, and the décor is spot on. Sharma was very responsive & helpful throughout the process. It was a great experience and we will certainly return to the property if/when we go back to Happy Valley!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly described and perfect for a college visit to Penn State. Very walkable to all of campus and downtown. Apartment was very clean, and Sharma communicated throughout. Comfy beds. The chocolates on the pillows and snacks in the kitchen were an added treat. As noted in the description, it is right on one of the main streets, but it was not an issue for us. Would definitely stay here again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What an enjoyable stay for our kids first trip to PSU! Sharma's knack for anticipating guest needs cannot be overstated - she really thought of everything. After arriving, we began noticing all of the little touches she arranged. An assortment of snacks to hold us over while we were unwinding; basket of extra toiletries because there's always something everyone forgets; and my favorite, seat cushions, ponchos, and a stadium-compliant clear tote bag to borrow for gamedays.
The apartment was very clean with high ceilings that made it feel very spacious and inviting. Just outside the kitchen / living room area was a large deck with a grill if we wanted to dine in. The location is great as its walkable to campus and downtown, but in a quiet enough location you can retreat to and recharge - also close enough to walk to the stadium.
Overall great experience - Sharma and Rhett were super accommodating. We would absolutely stay here again!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our second stay at Sharma’s place and it didn’t disappoint. Our stay was short as we were in town to spend time with our son for his parents weekend event but Sharma made us feel right at home. She went above and beyond greeting us when we got back to let us know about the power outage and hooked us up with cables so we could still watch the final four games! Fortunately the power came back on rather quickly:)
I highly recommend staying here as it can’t get anymore convenient to all areas of campus. Thank you again for another wonderful stay."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful place to stay while visiting Penn State. Owners thought of everything to make your stay enjoyable. Incredible attention to detail.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Sharma’s place was incredibly clean and beautifully decorated. The place is fabulous and is in an excellent and safe location. The beds were extremely comfortable. Sharma provided a Keurig machine, coffee pods and all of your coffee needs and some snacks, which the kids greatly appreciated. She also had amenities in the bathroom if you forget items from home. Loved this place and will definitely book again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Sharma and Rhett are fantastic hosts! They let us check in early and were incredibly accommodating to our schedule. The place is gorgeous, clean and beautifully decorated. We loved all of the finishing touches including snacks and extra toiletries. The place is walkable to campus and downtown. We recommend this apartment wholeheartedly!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, we thoroughly enjoyed it! Great location, 1 1/2 blocks from the Nittany Lion Inn. Walking distance to PSU and downtown. From the start, Sharma was very helpful and responsive. The interior of the apartment was immaculate, comfortable, bright and like new! Beds were very comfortable. Sharma went the extra mile to include some snacks, cream for coffee and water bottles.
As Sharma discloses, the apartment is located on Atherton, but was not a problem for us. Leaving the driveway, all you need to do is wait for the light at Park Ave. to turn red and its easy to exit.
We highly recommend and definitely would stay here again!!!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"A great, well-decorated, spacious, light and airy space. Sharma was accommodating and responded very quickly to all our requests. Everything was new and clean. You should know that the only bathroom is accessible, though blocked by a table, to the queen bedroom via double doors that don't quite meet each other. If I had been here with anyoneother than family this would have been a big privacy issue. Otherwise, I have only the best things to say about this lovely space."

In addition, the location was perfect to access the campus and walk to Beaver stadium. We would definitely stay here again on our next trip to State College!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"1270 Circleville is very well located, close (but not too close) to highway, maybe 5 mins off - shopping including a Giant grocery store about 3 mins away - good restaurant options in area. Also close to campus which is what most of us are there for - we Ubered to events on campus for less than $15
The host distinguishes herself in her responsiveness - between renting it and our departure I sent maybe 8 messages in all and I don’t think she took more than 30 minutes to respond to any of them - while there with questions about house operations I know it was never more than 5 mins.
The house was so clean and kitchen had basics to make a great dinner. Plenty of room to entertain and the main dining room is a beautiful sun room we loved this. Seats 8 to 10 very comfortably. The beds were great and if anyone likes a tub, it was huge!
Also have a great private back deck and yard - wish it was warmer so we could have entertained more out there because it was quite large.
Big fan"

In fact, that night was the best night of our short trip. We will definitely stay again if it is available for our next trip."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As per usual with listings, it was slightly smaller than I had anticipated, but it was very cozy￼.

The back porch was a favorite in the morning while drinking our coffee and tea (provided by the hosts). The double bed was very comfortable. My friend wished the twin bed(s) were a bit bigger. She being 5’9” felt a bit squished. We utilized the living room the first night by watching a movie on Netflix. The sofa is not very comfy but is aesthetically pleasing. We would definitely stay here again next time we come to State College.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,Cozy and quiet spot! Lovely place to stay
2022-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Great location , comfortable and clean !! Would stay again !!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful time at Liam and Katie's place--it was very comfortable and clean, and just a short drive from campus. Our kids had a great time with the board games, and the kitchen was well appointed for a family meal. We would absolutely stay again!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute little house in a quiet residential neighborhood. Nicely furnished and decorated, very clean, looks like it was recently remodeled.. Kitchen well stocked. Beds/pillows a little uncomfortable. Blinds in bedrooms did a good job blocking light. We enjoyed our stay."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place for small group! Conveniently located to Penn State University. Would stay again!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and cozy. Very clean. Beautiful location as well.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful house. Ideal location. Always felt like the Hosts were easily reachable. Honestly the best Airbnb you could ask for. Would definitely stay again in the future.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay here. The place was so clean and well organized, with a cozy and cheerful design aesthetic. I particularly appreciated the kitchen, which has very modern appliances, everything you'd need to cook, and a washer/dryer conveniently tucked away just to the side. It's located in a quiet and safe neighborhood just a short drive into town. I'd definitely stay here again!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My husband and I and our 3 boys really enjoyed our stay at this quaint little home! It was exactly what we needed for a 2 day visit in state college, and I would recommend it to any families with young little ones. The home is exactly how it’s pictured- super cute with a great floor plan. There was more than enough room for our 3 little ones to unwind and play. I appreciated that the decor was simple and kid friendly, so I didn’t have to worry about my boys breaking anything, grabbing at things they shouldn’t, or putting small objects in their mouths. The outlets are also child proof, which was one less thing I had to worry about. The bin of books, the games, and the fun lacing activities were awesome. It was also nice they had a pack n play on site, and we put it to great use. I felt like I was in my own home. It was easy for me to relax and not feel out of place. The background is also a great size, so our boys were able to run around out back as well. The back door leads into the kitchen, so it was easy to keep our eyes and ears on the boys as they played outside. There’s also a nice covered patio out back with a table and chairs. The neighborhood is quiet, and the home is super close to walking trails. The kitchen had everything we needed to make home cooked meals, and we loved the “eating nook”. It made it easy to have a nice sit down meal every night. It was also nice to have access to filtered water from the refrigerator. Having 3 little boys, I was especially grateful for the washer and dryer during our stay. The home is very close to two grocery stores, and other restaurant options. The Military Museum is also right down the road, which was a fun thing to explore. The drive to downtown and campus is a straight shot and not too far. The next time we are in Happy Valley we will definitely try booking our stay here again! So much better than staying at a small stuffy hotel room!"
2022-10-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Three of us stayed at Katie and Liam's place for the Penn State - Ohio State football weekend. We arrived late evening Thursday and had events planned early Friday through Saturday evening.
Katie and Liam's place is clean, reasonably spacious for a small group and a 5-minute drive to the CATA South Atherton shuttle to take to Beaver stadium. There is plenty of street parking on the shuttle route for your own vehicle.
Some points to note about the house:
- the shower sound is very loud in the second bedroom; come prepared with ear plugs if you are a light sleeper
- the door of the second room rattles when people walk around in the bedroom or just outside it; a piece of tissue or paper napkin in the latch will mitigate it
- the front door latch does not line up when closing it; shut the door and push it in slightly to make it work
- towels provided are fairly thin; suggest bringing your own; there is dryer so might not have to pack them wet
- coffee maker did not work for us but we discovered Rothrock coffee located a 5-minute drive away
- TV does not have any broadcast channels so if you are looking for something like baseball playoffs, try to find a streaming login through your own cable/satellite provider"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This property is as advertised - small but sufficient for four. Nothing fancy but everyting you need. Clean. Short drive to town. We would rent again.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Greatly enjoyed our stay at Katie and Liam's place in State College. The listing is very accurate and well depicted; communication up front and answering any questions was superb as well. The house is in a quiet location, but only minutes (truly) from State College campus and most other points of interest. The house was well appointed with items you may need, and everything worked well with minimal issues. Enjoyed working on the back patio and just spending time with family in this cozy home!"

I am looking forward to stay again in this location in the future."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a cute Airbnb! Katie and Liam had great communication throughout my entire stay, which I appreciated. I would highly recommend this place if you need a place to stay in State College! The only downfall is I could not figure out how to turn down the air conditioner, so it did get a little warm. Other than that, high remarks all around for this place!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Katie and Liam never let me down. As always, the place was clean, easy to access, and had lots of little touches that made it feel like home. Matched the photos and the description in the listing, too. That's why I always look for their properties when I'm staying in State College."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Highly recommend this property- really clean & tidy and great for our family. There was everything we needed at the place, and lots of good details too- like nightlights in the bedrooms. It was pretty close to the elementary school playground and not far from both Boalsburg and Hills plaza, so easy to get coffee and groceries."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a nice little house to come home to. Charming. So clean, and the bed was super comfy. Perfect for a visit to State College to set up a freshman dorm room. Hosts communicate well. I will visit here again."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is in a great location (between Boalsburg & downtown) and was exceptionally with clean with wonderful amenities (towels, linens, A/C, cable, internet, washer/dryer, coffee/tea). It is a tiny house but was perfect for 4 people who don't mind sleeping in close quarters. We would definitely stay here again!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,best
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place for us to spend a couple days catching up with friends. There was plenty of room for 4 people, the place, including the kitchen, was well-equipped and comfortable. The neighborhood was quiet and friendly. It is only a couple miles and. few minutes to the center of town or the PSU campus. A great alternative to a hotel."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice quiet home with backyard and amenities. Close to State College, but not far enough from the heart of the city which made for a very relaxing stay."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Small house with two bedrooms, a full bathroom, living room and eat-in kitchen. Easy to get to from State College."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for a great stay. Cute house and very clean! We’ll be back to one of your places next school year!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This lovely 2 bedroom house is very nicely renovated place with every amenity for visitors. The beds are comfy, the bathroom and kitchen newly redone with quality, and many little touches to help you feel at home. The kitchen was well equipped and there was a nice set of complimentary coffee and tea when we arrived. Liam was very good communicating and took immediate care of a minor malfunction of the smoke alarm. There is also a nice green back yard with a table and chairs for outside dining. Our only issue was the irresponsible neighbors whose 2 big dogs barked right outside the bedroom windows throughout the day and night until after 11pm. The dogs are untrained and bark at everyone who walks by, also lunging to the end of their leash, and even trespassing onto the airbnb property when off leash. Anyone uncomfortable with lots of barking and dangerously untrained big dogs should be warned."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect home away from home for the kids and I. I loved having the ability to do laundry. My kids loved playing with the games provided in the living room. The home has everything you need in a great location, and the owners are extremely responsive if you need anything!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean with lots of extras! Hosts were very accomodating!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful little space. Cozy, comfortable and had everything that I needed. Would stay again for sure!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is beautifully remodeled, and includes a small backyard that allowed our children to get outside and burn some energy. Everything was clean, and the beds were comfy. I would definitely recommend a stay, if you’re looking for a low traffic area, and some peace and quiet."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cozy, just as shown in the pictures. Katie & Liam are great hosts. The kitchen had everything we needed and the bed was very comfortable! Great location too!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the house and the quality touches that Katie and Liam put into the experience. Location is great and I had a beatiful walk about 3.5 miles from my daughter's campus dorm. I would definitely stay here again. Grocery stores and restaurants are close by, and we also enjoyed a great hike around Coyler Lake, a short drive feom the house."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, very clean, responsive and attentive hosts. Appreciated the shoveled walk after a pile of snow during our stay."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very clean and accomodating.
2022-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,The home was a very cute and small cottage! Some of the downfalls of the home was the front door had a window without a covering/curtain. It was only one television in the home so once it was bedtime it was pretty dark lol. The kitchen table was very cute but was not sturdy so do not lean on the table. This home was nice and communication with the owners was nice and easy.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place, no issues"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Charming Cottage was a great place to stay for the long weekend. Katie and Liam were extremely responsive and have thought of everything. They have included things like extra blankets, shampoo, lotions, and books and games for the kids. We would definitely stay here again!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was so modern and cute with all the necessary amenities. We had a short girls weekend and it was everything we could have wanted. We would recommend to anyone coming into the area.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay in the cottage. It was very clean and in a convenient location. Would definitely stay again!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A delightful home located very conveniently to Penn State. I’ll absolutely recommend it to friends attending workshops at PSU.
2022-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,"I wish I could give a 4.5/5 stars but unfortunately, that is not an option. We enjoyed our stay in this cute little place. We rented it to take our preschool aged daughter skiing at Tussey Mountain. The location was super convenient to the mountain and to restaurants and grocery stores. They have thoughtfully stocked the place with everything that you would need including puzzles and games.
I would have given 5 stars but there were a few minor issues. One-there was not a tub drain stopper so our daughter could not take a bath. I did notify the owners after our stay though and they said there should have been one; hopefully that will be a nonissue for anyone in the future. Two-The floor vents were very dusty inside, it was quite visible. Again, I notified the owners after our trip and they said they would pass the word along to the cleaning team. Three-there was very little room to store shower toiletries, I think a little caddy would be beneficial. All three of us use different shampoos and soaps so the little ledge around the tub was not sufficient.
I would definitely stay here again. The owners are very responsive and check-in was a breeze. Again, I'd give this particular stay with those 3 issues a 4.5 if that was an option. If those 3 little issues did not occur, I would certainly have rated this a 5."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,Wonderful spot for a getaway. Enjoyed visiting family nearby. House is super cozy.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Katie and Liam’s home was a very lovely stay. Coming from New York this home was a nice getaway for the weekend. It was comfortable, and had everything we needed!"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very nice, extremely clean two bedroom home on a quiet street close to PSU. Katie and Liam were excellent hosts and very communicative. Check in and checkout was a breeze. This is a great place to stay while in State College."

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The photos don’t do justice to this stylish and cozy house! Katie and Liam have put a lot of thought into making the house comfortable for their guests, and our stay was terrific. It's located in a quiet neighborhood about a 1-minute drive from restaurants, groceries and shopping, and about a 5-minute drive from campus. Highly recommended."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Great nice cottage very clean and nice host with personal
And nice intentions
And gestires"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great house
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice house, good for a small family. Well supplied with daily essentials (kitchen, toiletries, towels, etc.)"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the attention to kids in this house. Our 2 year old was very entertained with the toy and book corner. Also the neighborhood was great for walking the stroller around and meeting nice people and dogs, which made our daughter so happy. The wifi was great for working virtually and for my video conferencing all day. We would definitely return!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Katie and Liam are extremely responsive hosts and the Charming Cottage was just that!
2021-07-01,3,Stayed a few nights,nicely furnished
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Katie and Liam's The Charming Cottage is indeed that! It was a clean, comfortable, and thoughtfully outfitted home base for my visit to the State College. The decor is cheerfully modern and the cottage has everything one could need for a pleasant stay. Katie and Liam are great hosts. I look forward to my next visit!"
2021-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at Katie and Liam's. The location is great. Close to running and walking trails, and near enough to everything we needed but far enough away to be peaceful and quiet. Great neighborhood. Nicely renovated, well tended cottage. We were 3 people so the space was just right. Definitely recommend."
2021-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Overall we enjoyed our stay at Katie and Liam's cozy home. The house is exactly what you see in the pictures however, some things to watch out for is the heating/ac system in the bedrooms. The main entrance has a window that makes it visible for outsiders to peek through which made us uncomfortable. There was no detergent and they mentioned that previous guests failed to inform them but it's their responsibility to make sure all items are available. There is no cleaning fee so you'll have to clean up after yourself and make sure all garbage is taken out, towels are placed in the bathtub, sweep floors, clean counters and wash dishes. There's many stores, restaurants, sightseeing views, and parks nearby. Oh and also go to waffle house for breakfast you'll enjoy it!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place to stay in, updated and modern! Wish my house was this clean! Easy check in! Great communication! They even have rabbits and chipmunks running around in their front yard….kids loved it!"

2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely stay! We really appreciated how well stocked this kitchen was. A very cozy home to spend a weekend getaway. :)
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Fantastic place! Would stay again!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute and cozy spot within super easy distance of all things State College: great food, great hiking. The space is perfect for a solo or couples’ getaway, but Katie and Liam have the place thoughtfully stocked with puzzles, books and games for the younger folks. Paved biking and walking paths everywhere! Liam and Katie were also super helpful with local recommendations."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was indeed absolutely charming! The cottage was cozy and clean and all instructions were clear. Definitely recommend.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great relaxing weekend at Katie and Liam's place. The house was beautiful and spotlessly clean with plenty of space. If you are looking for a great place to escape, this is the place to go!"

2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If we could give 10 stars we would. The location is perfect and easy to find, the neighborhood was quiet (loved sitting on the back porch) and the house was awesome. Katie and Liam have thought of everything you’d need and more. It’s so cozy just like visiting a friends house. We are hoping to make this our go to girls weekend getaway. Thanks for letting us enjoy your place."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Katie and Liam's place is so lovely- great location, super clean, quiet and lovely!"
2020-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Katie and Liam's place is absolutely beautiful! I would describe it as a temporary home that I didn't want to leave. Every detail is well thought, the kitchen is very well equipped, and the renovations they made make the cottage very comfortable. The WiFi and TV are also a plus! It is quiet (especially when you come from a noisy city like New York!) and the surroundings are nice to go for a walk. There are at least two supermarkets fairly close to the cottage (Weis and Giant) and if you have a car everything else is close too. I would definitely recommend it and would stay there again! In fact, I might steal some decoration ideas for my own place! :) They are great hosts as well, helping us beyond our expectations! 10/10!"
2020-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,It was my first time with Airbnb and I had a lot of questions.. I dealt with Liam more directly and he was very quick to respond and made the process easy. They also checked up on us multiple time to make sure all was well. I would highly recommend them if you are coming into the state college area.
2020-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Katie and Liam’s cottage is very sweet and cozy, with a nice layout. It’s clearly newly renovated so has all
new appliances, nice linens and towels, comfy beds. Would definitely recommend."
2020-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The house was so cozy and warm. We had a wonderful stay here. The interior was very nice, and all the quilt and sheets felt fresh. It had a lot of supplies, so we could really made ourselves at home. If I have to find a place to stay in State College, I would definitely look up Katie and Liam’s places first."
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage is the best, outstandingly clean, well supplied, beautifully decorated. You feel right at home immediately. Katie and Liam communicate to you to make sure you are ok with everything and if you do need them to let them know. Cant wait to stay here again♡"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great choice - nice layout, new kitchen and bath, lovely decorating, all the basics like coffee, tea available. Good location. Comfortable to stay for a night or a week."
2020-02-01,3,Stayed with kids,"The location is very convenient and close to campus as well as close to other shops and restaurants. The cottage is small but very charming and the furnishings and accommodations were great including good WiFi and a great TV. Although the house seems a bit old it is quite well updated! Beds and furniture were comfortable. There were some small issues with cleanliness but I felt that the interactions with the hosts were the worst part of my experience.
We are stationed in Washington DC and I was traveling by myself to meet a few family members with my two small children (both under 5). It can be difficult to estimate travel times with them so I arrived a little early. I asked but was unable to go to the location any earlier than the stated check in time of 3pm. Keep in mind I was arriving between 2:30 and 3 so I wasn’t asking for a huge change. When receiving my information on the Airbnb app the night before we left I noticed their check out time was 10am , which in my opinion is quite early. I checked many other properties in the area and found none with such early times except others owned by them. Upon realizing check out was early I asked if I could have a bit more time due to how difficult it is to pack up both of my children and all the many things they need when traveling in the morning and was again denied.
I feel I was very flexible towards the hosts when a few minor issues arose during our stay. I took care of them myself without complaint. It bothered me that the same kindness and flexibility was not reciprocated. Traveling alone with my children is something I do often since my husband is in the Navy and it is hard enough without having kind and caring customer service.
It is clear these hosts take seriously their rules and policies and they strictly adhere to them expecting guests to do the same. That is their right of course as it is their property, and I learned a great lesson. All of these policies were provided to me ahead of time and in the future I will read all policies and house rules much more carefully before booking.
I wouldn’t say don’t stay there but I would just advise anyone staying on any of their properties to carefully read all the rules and policies. Be sure you can stick to them 100% (even down to the minute for check in and check out) before you book!"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect little home with short driving distance to downtown State College. Lots of cute personal touches that made our stay feel homey! We can’t wait to come back!
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location, excellent value, excellent hosts!"
