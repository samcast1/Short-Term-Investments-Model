It was spotlessly clean and well appointed. Tammy was an amazing communicator from the moment we placed the booking through checkout and beyond. She answered questions quickly and honestly. My husband and I and four teenagers stayed at this home and had plenty of space. Tammy even furnished a cot with linens. No one wanted to leave. We all wished we had stayed longer and will definitely be back again. Thank you Tammy for your hospitality.

The home was extremely clean and comfortable, with plenty of storage for luggage. The kitchen was well stocked, and we were able to easily make breakfast. The beds were comfortable and we had a great nights sleep. Tammy was graciously flexible with us for a late checkout. My mother and grandmother have limited mobility, and they were able to enjoy the homes freely. There were many amenities that we did not take advantage of, but they next time we are in Sedalia, I will look for Tammy's homes first. My dad also posed the question, ""which AirBNB is your favorite"" indicating that Tammy's homes were at the top of his list! Thank you again, Tammy!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This house was perfect for our needs. We had an event in the area and this space was exactly what we had hoped for.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are even slightly hesitating about booking one of Tammy's Airbnbs, why? What are you waiting for? A sign from Heaven? You don't need a sign, or more information, just listen up! :-) You will never go wrong booking one of Tammy's Airbnbs, and you will NOT be disappointed whatsoever. From the moment you walk in, the space is entirely pleasant to the senses. There aren't any strange smells or peculiar candle scents—just an overall pleasant and clean-smelling scent and sensation as you enter. What's more, do you know that good, warm and cozy feeling you get when something is clean? I mean, really clean? You get that, too. It doesn't just look clean, it IS clean and it FEELS clean. Tammy's Airbnbs provides everything you need or want for those desiring a shorter stay, and it's even fully equipped for those looking for a longer stay. The bedrooms are equipped with the famous Serta and/or Nectar mattresses, respectively, as well as a lot of thought and attention to detail being put into the furnishings, decor, and overall style of the spaces. The entire place is inviting, welcoming, and you're tempted to never leave; never get out. Check-in is a breeze, parking is super easy—2 dedicated spaces—and there's even a back patio setup for grilling and hanging outside; day or night! There is no cable tv, but that's NOT a detriment! There's more to life and getaways than surfing meaningless tv channels. Besides, who needs cable when you have NETFLIX and the ability to stream your favorite content through all the various streaming channels? Just turn the tv on, find the app you're looking for, sign in and you're good to go! One could go on about the space, but the host...! Wow. Just wow. They don't make 'em like Tammy anymore and truly, she is a precious gem of a host. If there's anything you need, she's there. She is so welcoming, so friendly, so kind, so considerate, and extremely gracious. There is a reason Airbnb has dubbed her a ""SUPER HOST."" So, what are you doing still reading my review?! Get yourself to booking! :-) :-)"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice and clean, open and not crowded, the only downside is the 1 bathroom is off the main bedroom and it is a little inconvenient for a family member who might be sleeping on the sofa, but for a couple—OUTSTANDING"

If you are handy cap or aren't very light on your feet the entry way is a little choppy, I caught myself on it a few times.

We look forward to staying there again in the future."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My very favorite place to stay in Sedalia! This cute and oh so modern property is a conundrum of experiences. It is both quaint and small and perfect for a couples retreat (or even a single person's getaway - like I use it), and Modern. As I have stated before, The Meyers spare no expense to keep their guests happy in their properties, and I personally think that the Whistle House is the star of the show. Located just barely out of the historic downtown district, it's a short drive, or nice walk to everything downtown, it's also located nicely to some of the best eating in town (Fast Food, or Sit-Down Dining). Gas stations are just a couple of minutes away, and in less than half a mile to the south of the house, is the GORGEOUS St. Alban's Catholic Church, which architecturally is one of Sedalia's most beautiful historic church's (there are several others not far away, as well as many historic homes). I just cannot say enough good things about the Whistle House or it's owners!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Clean and quiet. Very nice inside.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"WOW does not describe this place. From the outstanding communication from the owners, to the super simple check in, the music playing as you walk in (immediately reminding me of good times and people), the ICE cold bottles of water waiting in the fridge, and the PERFECT space that was oh so comfy, this place is ""almost"" too perfect.... almost. The Whistle house is spotlessly clean, comfortable, and when you step inside you are immediately transported to an upscale apartment in a large city, that still feels very ""down home"". Christene has spared no expense in ensuring that her guests will have everything that they need. I cannot wait until I am able to stay again."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great host! She gave us everything we needed and was very responsive with any questions we had!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was unassuming on the outside, but so impressive on the inside. Very tidy and stylish. My stay was short, but cozy and comfortable without any issues.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Whistle House was much better than I had expected. The description by the Host was accurate but it was much cuter/cleaner than I expected. The place felt very homey. The Host has thought of everything you could possibly need for the Kitchen. It has a full kitchen, full size Refrigerator, Stove and Microwave. Pots, pans, dishes, glasses, silverware and utensils were abundant. All items you could need to cook your meals were provided. The bonus was the coffee, tea, breakfast/snack bars, flavored drink packets, Zip Loc bags, foil and storage containers! This was by far the best equipped Airbnb I have stayed at and would stay again! Good Job Christene, I really enjoy my stay and our fun conversation!!"

Christine even thought to have children’s plates and utensils as well as cups and straws!

Nothing at all was overlooked! The bed was comfortable with plenty of pillows, I believe of different firmness to chose from. Forget a phon charger? She had them! Such a small touch but so helpful! The kitchen is perfect for anything you need and more special touches like the little hot cocoa station and oatmeal/breakfast stand on the table. If I'm ever back in Sedalia, I know where I am staying!"

This property may well be the cleanest stay we have ever had! There is also a charming little fenced back yard area. We were in town to ride the KATY trail, and the location was perfect for easy access to the trail. Bonus....access to a locked garage for the bikes! And the modest cost is greatly appreciated! We highly recommend The Meyer House."

We appreciated the snacks and amenities provided until we were able to make it to the store. We definitely recommend staying at the Meyer house and would absolutely stay again!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I loved the Meyer house and it will be my home when visiting Sedalia every year!
Host takes extra care to make sure you are settled in and quick to address any questions you may have.
Pictures do not do this house justice.
Location is close to everything: grocery store, gas station, restaurants, all within 5-10 minutes drive. Quiet residential area. Privacy fences back yard! Plenty of parking.
Host provides start up of coffee, shampoo, soap, and breakfast bars and even popcorn!!
Fully furnished kitchen with spices available and excellent washer and dryer.
I highly recommend the Meyer House (10 stars if I could give that many)"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,It's a beautiful place to stay. has every kitchen utensil you may need. living room was nice and cozy. bed was very comfortable.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great house.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Meyer house is clean, cozy and comfortable. It's in a neighborhood near downtown Sedalia. Check in is easy. There's no need to worry about a key or anything. It has an electronic door lock which made things very simple. Once inside, there is a living room with a nice TV and cable and a comfy sofa for relaxing after a day visiting Sedalia. There is a kitchen stocked with dishes and pots and pans and utensils. There's a laundry room and an awesome little back yard with a grill and patio set. The bathroom is nice with natural light and plenty of space for putting your toiletries. They provided some shampoo, body wash, hand soap and toothpaste (but we had already brought our own). The bedroom has a nice large closet and the bed is soft with plenty of pillows and blankets. We will book the Meyer House again if we go to Sedalia. Christene was great with communication and very friendly and easy to work with."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very impressed. The thought put into the little things really separates this place from the rest.
Things like a binder containing local dining suggestions and carry out menus, board games, toiletries and an array of kitchen utensils down to a pizza cutter display a level of thoughtfulness and care you simply aren't going to find many places. It really seems like they've thought of everything that a guest may need and made it readily availible, just in case.
The the home itself is lovely. Large living room, ample kitchen and a furnished back yard with a privacy fence that's absolutely perfect for those who like to unwind outdoors.
Lastly, I was very surprised to find there was a garage. We didn't end up using it this trip but the fact it's even an option and not cluttered with stuff (like others I've seen) is very impressive and should appeal to anyone interested in staying during inclimate weather.
5 stars. Anytime I'm in Sedalia; I know where I'll be staying."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is a Katy Trail cyclist's dream! Not only is it clean, comfy, and sports one of the biggest TV's I've ever had the pleasure of watching, it also has a locked garage to store your bikes in! This was important, since my wife and I were traveling through on the Katy Trail. And the convenience to the trial is also a huge plus! The trail is only a few blocks away. In fact, the Sedalia MKT train depot, which is now a museum, is walking distance to this house.
There was also a grocery store 2 blocks away. Having no other transportation than our bikes, this was also very important to us. Because of the proximity of this house to the grocery store, my wife and I were able to have the one home-cooked meal of our entire 5 nights on the trail at this wonderful house! Thank you Christene! We hope to be back on another adventure soon."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Meyer House is a great place to stay. Clean, cozy, centrally located and in a nice neighborhood. Christene is very good to work with. We won’t hesitate to recommend the Meyer House to others or to book it again on our next trip."

The toys and coloring books made my littles feel at home. I would definitely stay here again and I highly recommend.
2021-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"it's close to downtown historical district and the fairgrounds. It's decent enough if you need somewhere to stay if you a little extra space. House is okay, was not a fan of the sliding door for the bathroom."

Only negative is we paid a $70 cleaning fee but then had to throw the linens (sheets and towels) in the washer and take out the trash ourself so what exactly is the cleaning fee for?"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Angie's place was a perfect base of operations for exploring the area on the Katy Bike Trail. We were only two blocks away from the trail and the road we were on had a 15 mph speed limit. The neighborhood was quiet and we felt quite safe in this cozy little house.
The kitchen was well equipped including some nice snacks that we took advantage of. Having a K-machine is always a plus, not having to lug mine cross county is greatly appreciated. The A/C in this rental was excellent in spite of the unseasonably hot 90 plus degree days. The shower had tons of hot water and great pressure - also much appreciated after log days of biking. The local grocery store was less than 5 minutes away.
The place was nicely decorated and all the furniture was comfy, including the bed. We slept very well during our stay. If was are ever in this area for another ride, we will definitely be staying here again!"

In fact I stayed another night just to spend time with my kids. I will be visiting again.
Hostess with the mostest!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful time at the Airbnb. It was so homey and cozy, I didn't want to leave 😹. The most comfortable couch I ever sat on in this breathtaking Living room. I almost fell asleep on it in the middle of the day 😂. A modern and minimalistic Kitchen. A very clean Bath/Laundry room. And a Beautiful bedroom. A very comfortable bed and a useful workspace desk in the corner that I really appreciate and don't see often in most Airbnbs. I can most definitely say I will return someday. Thank you so much for your Kindness and Generosity Angie. 😌🙏🏼"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a unique, rewarding experience, surrounded with history! Located in the historic district of Sedalia, this apartment, above Chelsea's Antiques, is the right mix of day's past and new - very comfortable, great value, with the right amenities (full kitchen, washer/dryer).

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location. Very nice hosts. Loved the coffee shop and pub just down the street.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,The loft was clean and had everything we needed. Cool historic district with easy walk to many locations and not far from state fair area. The hosts were very responsive and I appreciated their effort to fix the WiFi which wasn’t in their control as the internet company had some outages. I would stay again.
2024-02-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"I’ll give you the good, the okay and the bad.
The Good: Very responsive hosts and the apartment was clean and had everything I needed. Check in was very easy. Parking on the street right in front was good.
The Okay: The front door is an all glass door. While it obviously locked it didn’t feel very secure. And, if you walk out of the bedroom into the kitchen area you should be clothed because if someone walks by on the sidewalk outside and happens to look in the glass door and up the stairs…😬.
The Bad: Disclaimer, this isn’t the hosts fault. This area is super noisy. I’m not exaggerating when I say it was a relentless assault both nights from police and fire department sirens. Literally struggled to get to sleep only to be woke up multiple times both nights by sirens. I maybe slept two hours each night.
If I was rating the hosts and apartment alone I would have given a better overall rating but the constant noise was a real problem for me."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,This was our second year staying at Chelsea & John’s place. It’s becoming a tradition and we’ll be back next year. There’s plenty of space. It’s conveniently located in walking distance to multiple restaurants and even a coffee shop and brewery. CVS is across the street in case you forget anything. The place is clean and cozy and absolutely adorable. My 7th grade daughter traveled with me this year and is already looking forward to next year.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the location, the price, and the flexibility of check-in. We took the train in, and was easily within walking distance. Lots of great shops on the street, coffee shops, restaurants, the works.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"My wife and I have stopped staying with the big chain hotels and started using the Airbnb offerings when we travel, and this was an exact reason why. Chelsea and John cared about our experience at their place. We were greeted when we arrived and offered assistance if needed, and the room was excellent. Clean and very inviting. My wife and I love the historic buildings of downtown USA and this room exceeded expectations. We will absolutely stay here again! Highly recommend!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great stay. Quirky in the best way- you gotta stay here just to see the lamps. They’re great. There was plenty of room for three people and even with the sofa bed out the whole time. The AC is window units, but they were plenty powerful to keep us cool in August. Looking forward to staying here again."

It definitely felt like home."
2022-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely super cute, very clean, and so close to any restaurants downtown that we just walked. Super great value for the money. Close to everything. We loved staying there. It had every amenity we needed and didn't need (like a washer and dryer!) The only thing that made the stay difficult was the heating system kicked on and off every 5-7 minutes and was loud enough to wake you up if you were drifting off to sleep. It did keep the temperature perfect. It made for a patchy night of sleep, but I find that I don't sleep great any time I am away from home anyway.
We would definitely book this location again and I would recommend this stay to anyone."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is a comfortable stay. Lots of amenities. Comfortable bed and couch. In a very walkable area in the center of downtown Sedalia.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place and great location
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"There aren't enough nice things to say about Chelsea and John's apartment (also hosted by Kaitlyn). The experience of the stay was cozy and personable; it's easy to feel at home right away with knowledgeable, genuinely kind hosts like these!
They have the basics covered beautifully and over-deliver when it comes to thoughtful appointments (see: lightly scented hand soap + hand lotion! Plenty of body wash! Fresh, single-serve coffee pods from the roaster up the street! Trays of ice frozen and ready to go!).
I didn't notice anything missing or materially different than what was published in the listing. The photography is up-to-date and, if anything, undersells the openness of the kitchen and living space."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I stayed here on my first night of a Katy Trail ride. Apartment was safe, clean, and comfortable. Location is in old downtown within walking distance of restaurants. Nice stay."

We’d definitely stay there again."

The price for this location cannot be beat and I hope to stay there again during future visits.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful place to stay in Sedalia! Very easy to get to from the Katy trail and next to cool local shops. Hope to stay here again on a future visit.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a great, comfortable stop over for us as a part of our riding some of the Katy Trail. Owners were very helpful. They allowed us to check in early as the weather was poor for riding. Very easy parking. We thought it was a winner."

Great communication and seamless check-in/check-out. The location was conveniently located and within walking distance to several great antique shops and restaurant's. It is close to the Katy trail which was great for Biking on off days. I strongly recommend visiting Kehde's BBQ during your visit, there is a train car attached to the restaurant that you can eat in and they serve amazing BBQ. This was my first experience using Airbnb and I must say it was a great experience thanks to this great host, definitely a Super-Host!!!"

2021-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Couldn’t ask for better set up and location
2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We stayed at Chelsea & John’s Place in Sedalia for a week. The apartment is cute and was described accurately. There is air conditioning which kept us cool during a heat advisory period (98-99°F all week - see tips below). The entire place is very, very clean, and we enjoyed our stay immensely. There is street parking directly in front which had space the entire week. There’s also a free parking lot directly across the street. The apartment is situated in old/Historic Sedalia which is walking distance of coffee shops, restaurants, bars, the court house, a CVS pharmacy, and an urgent care. We walked to coffee every morning 1 block away and to dinner 2 blocks away at a good restaurant & bar.
The host was very quickly responsive to my messages and the check in and check out processes were easy. I will definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to stay in Sedalia.
Description and my impressions:
You walk in and go up a flight of stairs (see tips below) into the main room. There lies a kitchen with an island where you’ll find the glasses and plates etc, a sink, electric oven/stove, microwave and fridge. Off that is the main/sitting room with a small TV, couch with pull-out bed, love seat, and round dining room table with 4 chairs. The decor is all antique-shabby-chic.
The bedroom has a queen bed, dresser with mirror, and 2 nightstands. There is a closet with about 7 or so hangers. The bathroom is situated off the bedroom, and you have to walk through the bedroom to get to it (important to note if you are to have someone staying out in the main area on the pull-out couch) and has a shower (shower-head adjusts to different types of spray), tub, single-sink vanity, and toilet. There were extra towels and toilet paper under the sink. There is a laundry room with washer and dryer off the bathroom with laundry liquid detergent and fabric softener sheets.
Tips for future guests:
- There is a long, steep flight of stairs from the front door to the apartment. The door at the bottom (entry door) is completely clear glass and there is no covering, and opens up onto a main (sometimes busy) sidewalk and street. Soooo make sure to wear clothing, or a robe or something stepping out of the bedroom, as you will be in clear line of sight of the front door downstairs :D
- Bedroom: there is a window air conditioning unit which works very well — as long as the long curtain is not covering it, at which point you don’t get the full effect of the airflow. The curtain is on the rod with those rod rings with clips on them, and I just doubled the curtain up and clipped the ends up. That helped to not be blinded by morning sunlight, which is what happened the first morning when I just left the curtain pulled back/open.
- The air conditioning units (one in the main room and one in the bedroom) are FANTASTIC and kept the apartment entirely cool, even in the 98° temps. They both have vents which can be moved so the air can blow at different angles, which may be necessary dependent on where you sit in the main room.
- The fridge doesn’t have an ice maker but the hosts were very thoughtful and had lots of ice prepared in trays.
- There is no dishwasher but there is dish soap and a sponge."

There are other great downtown shops a few blocks from the front door.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Sara had great communication leading up to our stay and during our stay. We were able to check-in early and there was not rush on checking out. The check-in process was straightforward and smooth. There is a beautiful front porch that was utilized several times on our visit to sip coffee and listen to the birds. The home was updated, clean, and the beds were very comfortable. There are 2 full bathrooms and front loader washer and dryer. Great kitchen for purchasing your own groceries and cooking meals there.

Will definitely be recommending to others!
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,"We rented the White House for 3 nights while visiting for a high school graduation. The house is very nicely decorated and sparkling clean. The beds are extremely comfortable, from the mattress, to the pillows, to the down comfortors. There is a fabulous wrap around porch where we spent most of our time as the weather restr
icted us from being able to go do much else other than eat. The porch provided an amazing place to watch the storm. The house is walking distance...about 20 minutes...to Historic Downtown Sedalia. I would highly recommend a stay at the White House and we'd definitely return if we are ever in the area again."

2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is beautiful, comfortable and just overall fantastic but Sara is really the best part of this particular stay. She has been so thoughtful, flexible and accommodating!! Little extras like coffee, creamer & water in the fridge, tips on the best local spots to eat or check out were all wonderful but she’s also been really patient with me changing my schedule/booking at least three different times, looking out for me the entire time. I travel a lot for work and it was so nice to have a home away from home with a fully stocked kitchen & washer/dryer. She’s even got soaps and things if you need them. You can really tell she put in the work to update this space and make it a warm and inviting home. The neighbors are super friendly too. I very much enjoyed staying here and will do so again in the future!!!"

Close proximity to lots of fast food options and Starbucks!! So much more space than if we had stayed in a hotel. And when we forgot to log out of Netflix (which had my son most concerned), a quick message to Chandra had the problem solved. Absolutely recommend Aunt B’s with its cute bee theme!!"

We enjoyed the open floor plan and the kitchen had everything we needed for entertaining 20+ people and all new appliances. The backyard was spacious and the garage was perfect for extending the entertainment space. With the house being on an extremely busy road the three car deep and the 3 car wide driveway was nice!!!! Chandra was very easy to talk to and she even bended some of the house rules for us and we were extremely grateful! Over all the experience was very comfortable and went smooth from the time of booking to the checkout time.

The best part is it was a great deal, especially to not having a cleaning fee."

The complimentary snacks, coffee and waters was nice touch. Chandra allowed us an early check-in which was much appreciated! It was nice not having to strip beds or other household chores before leaving. We were near many restaurants and it was easy to get around.

Chandra allowed us an early check-in to change clothes before a wedding which was also appreciated. The living area of the house was comfortable. We liked the bottled water and a few snacks.

The first draw to Aunt B's House was the beautiful open floor plan and the great room. It only got better as I kept reading! All one floor, three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a driveway and two car garage! Then I saw the unbeatable price! The communication with Chandra was easy and friendly from the very beginning! The entry was flexible, smooth and easy. As soon as I opened the front door, I knew that it was perfect and EXACTLY as it looked in photos.

2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"Aunt B’s exceeded my expectations! Chandra is an awesome host! From the moment we opened the door, we loved the space. Everything is newly updated and remodeled. Five adults fit comfortably and easily in the living room. The kitchen was spotless and offered numerous amenities. Snacks and bottles of water helped make us feel welcome.

There were so many things to make the stay comfortable: microwave popcorn and snacks, little things of shampoo and conditioner, laundry detergent and more. My husband was running the Katy trail and this was a wonderful place for his parents and myself to stay while we offered my husband support. This house is only a few minutes drive to the trial. It was very quiet, I didn't notice any road noise. If we run the Katy trial again next year, we will look for this place to stay."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice house. Well equipped with new appliances and kitchen items. Would stay there again without hesitation!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We LOVED the house. It was so clean and decorated oh so cute! We had three young kids with us and we try to think of everything when traveling but it was awesome to see THE CUTEST toys waiting in a basket for our kids to play with. An extra pack n play in the closet and even a small highchair. We also appreciated her cute welcome basket and snacks. Everything couldn't of been better. We loved our stay and will definitely be back. The only reason we didn't give the location 5 stars was the house was right off a very busy street and that is a little unnerving when you have three kids. The backyard wasn't fenced in and my three year old was playing with the chalk and then came around to the front of the house and scared us all lol. Yes there were 4 adults around but kids can be sneaky. Also, this isn't a huge issue because both bathrooms were very nice but the tub in the first bathroom was perfect for kids to take a bath in. The house came with little shampoos and conditioners and body wash it would of been fun to have a little bubble bath on hand for the kiddos. Over all the house is fantastic and we WILL be staying again. Host was absolutely lovely and helpful."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An absolutely fabulous house. Tons of living room space with nice over sized chairs. Everything was clean and well cared for. It was nice having access to a garage! As far as I know, they don’t mess with the AC. This is one of the first times I’ve stayed in an air BNB where the owner doesn’t control the thermostat and keep the temp locked at 72 or 73 degrees. We had a lovely sleep at 69 degrees with ceiling fans! Heavenly.
Would highly recommend this house, particularly if you’re planning on going to the State Fair. 2 blocks away). There are stores and restaurants within walking distance. Great location! Very clean!"

Truly clean - no air freshener or plug ins, crisp white sheets, mattress and pillow covers, extra bedding for days....and can we talk about the bed? It was the best sleep I have had while traveling! The house was a charming, curated timepiece while meeting every modern need/want. There was so much thoughtfulness in her amenities.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"I visited the area because my daughters were involved in a 2 day wrestling tournament.

It had such a warm, home-like feeling to it. There was even a beautiful Christmas tree and other Christmas decorations displayed. Diane was wonderful at communicating as well, and gave clear instructions for our stay. I would definitely recommend her place to anyone wishing to visit the area. We'd stay there again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Diane was so great and accommodating our early arrival after a long drive to get there. The home was perfect.

The stay was great. We would definitely stay there again."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Diane was very nice to communicate with. Answered questions quickly, checked in on things throughout the stay and described her place wonderfully. Everything you need is there pretty much from items in the kitchen to toiletries in the bathroom. We had an event at the fairgrounds and it was right off the main entrance so we even could walk over if we wanted. Definitely would recommend and will stay again if we come back to this event. Only advice I have outside of her control is I think there was a tractor pull at the fairgrounds one night and was quite loud. Might want to bring earplugs but that is to be expected depending on timing with the location. Also Walmart and restaurants are very close so very short trip to buy groceries or pickup anything you need. I would definitely recommend her home to stay at"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Diane was absolutely amazing. She was so helpful, super quick to respond, met every need I had, and answered every question I had along the way. We even forgot something at the house at checkout and she was sweet enough to offer to send it to me!
The house is super cute, great space to lounge, the beds and pillows were amazingly comfortable, bathroom was clean and well stocked with the essentials. It’s in a great location very close to the fairgrounds, super easy to find, and a very spacious yard. It was a great place to stay, and the next time I’m in Sedalia I will absolutely see if her place is available first."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is cozy and comfortable. It had plenty of room for our family of four during our 4 night stay. Beds and living room furniture are comfortable, making it feel like a home instead of a hotel room. There were enough towels and basic amentities stocked in the house for our visit so we did not run out of anything during our stay. Communications with the hostess were seemless. She quickly responded to our inquiries before and after check-in. We will definitely book this home for our next visit to the area!"
