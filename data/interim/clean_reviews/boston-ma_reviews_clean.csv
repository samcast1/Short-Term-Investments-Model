2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The apartment was great. Communication and check-in was a breeze. The place was clean and comfortable. It has every amenity needed (a stocked kitchen, extra towels, an iron, a hair dryer, etc.). It was also nice and quiet, but close to everything."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay that is walkable to/from many good restaurants, shopping, and attractions. Very clean place with great hosts. Will stay again on our next trip to Boston."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good location walkable to a lot of things. Cute neighborhood. Place was just as described. You can hear the neighboring units and building noises pretty clear so it’s a hit or miss if you get considerate guests or not. Thankfully it wasn’t too disruptive during our stay. Overall the communication with Jessy and Diego was great and everything was easy and smooth.

Finally the hosts were very kind, prompt and supportive through my time there.
A perfect stay overall. Thank you again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Close enough to walk everywhere but far enough off busy streets for quiet nights. Very nice, clean well kept neighborhood. Felt safe walking around even at night. Very close pocket parks with lots of people walking and taking dogs for walks."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Best hosts on AirBnb. Super responsive, helpful and accommodating. Thank you for a great stay!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I was looking for a place that was close to metro stations and safe to walk around at any time, and this apartment was a great choice. There are 2 metro stations nearby, supermarkets, a convenience store, a mall, cafes, and restaurants. All within a very short walking distance.
The apartment was smaller than I expected, but it is comfortable for one person (or a couple) and has everything a traveler might need. I stayed for 1 week and liked the time I was there. The WiFi is good for work, studying, and video calls. The bed is very comfortable and the neighborhood is charming."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a lovely time here, thanks to you."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The airbnb was great for 1 person or a couple who plan on being out and about most days. It was very cozy and was a great place to come back to at night. I would stay here again!

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space was very clean and as advertised. The hosts are really incredible, very responsive and accommodating, as I had an emergency with my car and Diego came to the rescue within minutes. I am a very restless sleeper yet I slept very well here (I'm very easily woken up, but never had an issue here). The location and value is definitely worth it, I had a great time trying all the food nearby. it's also very easy to get around with the public transportation."

Easy to get everywhere!
Thank you!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, the apartment, location and hosts ranked as one of my better experiences on AirBnB. It is perfect for a single person but would still be cozy for a couple. It was a great space for either vacationers or work travel to Boston. It was an easy walk to many sites, several tube stations and the South End for great restaurants. I was attending a Conference for work at Hynes and it was an easy walk from the Convention Center. The internet and small dining area made it a great work space as well. Overall, really enjoyed the stay and will definitely look to stay there again. Thanks!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jessy and Diego were incredibly accommodating and very responsive! They went out of their way to make sure we were well taken care of. The bed was comfortable, and the foliage in October was incredible. I would definitely visit again."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I was staying in apt 3 which faces the trees on Cumberland Street on the first floor. The apt had everything you need to settle in and then explore the surrounds. I appreciated the well equipped kitchen to cook my own meals.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location of this stay was very central and very walkable to a large variety of restaurants, cafes, and grocery store. The apartment was a tad small, but very doable between two people. Overall, very nice stay.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I wanted to stay in Back Bay and this place meets my criteria. A tip: Logan airport has free express shuttles to Back Bay and the stop is 10 minutes walk to Jessy and Diego's place.
Jessy and Diego were very friendly and responded SUPER fast.
Enjoyed my stay!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was very clean, spacious, and furniture looked brand new. Diego made sure to be available to us and was very attentive. I loved his recommendations for the trip. We had a great stay!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect stay. Do not hesitate. Perfect space. Great owners. Perfect area for everything in Boston. Great price. Can’t ask for more
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing place. So unique. I loved the vibe and location.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I stayed here on memorial day and it was probably the best hotel experience I’ve ever had. While checking in, I was greeted by friendly staff, a welcoming atmosphere, and a unique location and vibe; full of musical memorabilia (and a killer record collection), I felt right at home. We found out we got an upgrade to one of the converted airstream trailers they have available- the room was beautiful, with decor that perfectly fit the “James Brown” titling. I love that they have a record player (with accompanying records from the room’s artist) in each room. We got to check out the pool next- It’s saltwater, which is a nice touch (great for your skin!). Particular standouts from the staff were Julian the valet and Elle at the front desk, who were both awesome- overall, the staff were all incredibly kind, and were always courteous and willing to help with anything. One of the coolest, most enjoyable hotel rooms and grounds I’ve experienced; I’ll be returning in the future."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I’d recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Boston. Great location and awesome staff. It’s not a traditional hotel but hits all the marks!
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Cute hotel, especially if you're into music. Great location. We didn't get a chance to take a dip in the pool, but I love that they have a heated pool. We unfortunately were not able to secure valet parking, as it is ""first come first serve"" (which I hadn't realized). There IS a parking lot across the street, but it's expensive (will depend on the day/time, but we had to pay $100 for our Sunday to Monday overnight, which is not insignificant). We were also told we were ""upgraded"" to better room upon arrival, only to find out the upgrade was one of their camper's in the alley behind the building. Perhaps that's an upgrade for some, but it felt as though they were trying to move us around to secure rooms in the building. And, of course, the annoying ""service fee"" they charge when you arrive. Yes, it's listed in the description. Yes, it's still annoying. Overall we had a nice stay, just a few small annoyances that could have made it better."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Highly recommend this place when visiting Boston! In a great area with so much to do within walking distance. Very comfortable room and friendly staff.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect great value
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The whole place is very cool, great comfy squeaky clean linens. It’s in Fenway NOT as shown on Airbnb map as being in the Beacon/Charles street neighborhood. Landed up being perfect anyway but good to know. Also read the fine print for the mandatory resort fee.. not a biggie but I hate being surprised"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a great and unique spot! Loved the record library and record player in the room. Location is awesome and staff is super nice and helpful.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was an amazing place to stay close to a it of things and dinning places. More than happy to stay again.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jason and Dabney's place felt right at home. The cozy apartment was clean and comfortable.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jason & Dabney are great hosts and the apartment is super cozy and comfortable. One has the whole basement apartment to oneself and a private entrance. Being in the basement it is a little dark, but then again, by stays have been in the dead of winter. I visit Cambridge to work once a month for a week and it is an easy walk to our office in Kendall Square. Can't say enough - great place to day and GREAT value..."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is an excellent apartment. It is in a good location, relatively close to the metro system and thus to the centre of Boston and the surrounding area. It is well equipped. The furniture and fittings are of high quality and there are helpful, illustrated instructions where required. The apartment suited two of us perfectly for our week of sight-seeing. On the few occasions that we needed to contact the hosts directly, they responded promptly and helpfully. We strongly recommend this as a comfortable and convenient place in which to stay."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The flat is spacious, airy and comfortable. It is a basement but lots of light comes in through the front windows and some through the back.
It is an easy walk to Cambridge Street, science museum and planetarium, and the Charles river.
Jason and partner are very quick to respond and very accommodating making the stay very comfortable.
The house was clean and uncluttered. Items such as shower gel, shampoo, laundry powder, herbs and spices, oil and tea were all provided which was a very nice touch. Thank you very much to Jason and partner for letting us stay in your apartment"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay here. It was just what we needed- enough space to relax after days of exploring Boston & Cambridge. My boyfriend enjoyed watching football on the TV. We appreciated you providing the coffee, filters, and creamer."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely self contained apartment below street level. Great washing machine and dryer. A bit more local knowledge re supermarkets and liquor shops would have been helpful….but we figured it out eventually. Good for access to Harvard Uni .
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect home base for our short Boston trip! The space was accommodating for us and our toddler, and we appreciated getting super clear instructions day of on checking-in. It made everything so easy and seamless for us."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place, lots of space for two people. Neighbourhood is quite, clean, safe. Just not a whole lot of natural light coming in to the apartment, which could be a downside for longer stays. Easy communication/check-in and -out."

This did not allow us to rest well, and the apartment is in a dim and airy basement."

We honestly had everything we needed for my parents and me. I slept in the sofa bed which was very comfortable and private enough from my parents room.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jason & Dabney's appartment was very clean and tidy. The place was easy to find and the check-in was really simple.

The location was ideal - situated in a peaceful neighborhood, yet with some dining options and grocery close by. The T station is just a 10-minute walk away, and it takes 20 minutes to reach downtown from there.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a very fulfilling stay in a quiet residential neighborhood and being able to walk to the center.It feels like you live there.I stayed on a business trip, but it was comfortable to cook a meal (there are also a few supermarkets, etc. within walking distance) and working at the door desk away from the bedroom."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Immaculate little apartment with basic kitchen necessities provided, very comfortable hotel-worthy linens, and a bonus of all possible channels to stream on the TV, along with washer/dryer. I would generally not use either, but came down sick and was grateful for both. Low flow shower and small shower head was the only bummer but definitely adequate. White noise machine provided to offset family living overhead was effective.
Extremely responsive host, very kind to extend check out a few hours to coordinate with late flight. Perfect location for my visit- walkable to the T and good coffee shops (Tatee, Vester). Would definitely recommend."

The hosts were very nice (although we haven't met in person). The place really has everything you need and is well renovated. But you need to know it's kind of in the basement.
I found it a bit far away to walk to the T, but when I stayed the green line did not run, which made it a bit difficult, but not a big problem. All in all, very convenient."

Would highly recommend their place to anyone traveling to Boston!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just had a great 3 day stay at Jason and Dabney’s apartment. Everything was as pictured and we enjoyed the modern style and thoughtful amenities like spices, shampoo and conditioner, toothpaste, streaming services and easily adjustable heat and air. They were also responsive via text. The only thing is to note is that the neighbors upstairs can be heard in the morning above the bedroom area, beginning around 7:30 a.m., so I would just plan accordingly if you are a light sleeper. Thanks again!"
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The location is fantastic and close to everything. All of the local restaurants and coffee shops are very convenient and good. Staying in Cambridge beats the high prices across the river and the place is cozy and convenient. Would book again!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jason & Dabney went above and beyond. We were attending a weekend event at TD Garden that started at 1pm on Friday. Jason & Dabney made the parking pass available to us early and even had the unit ready so we could drop our bags before the event started. Check-in instructions were detailed and easily understood. The unit was clean and perfectly appointed. It was within walking distance to TDGarden/North Station, Museum of Science, and tons of parks. And was located in a very nice and quiet neighborhood. I definitely recommend!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location, nice neighborhood, very convenient to downtown.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jason and Dabney’s place was perfect for my family’s trip to Boston. An Airbnb skeptic in our group was blown away by the quality of the booking. The place is in a beautiful, safe neighborhood in Cambridge within walking of downtown Boston. The unit comfortably housed 3 people and felt brand new, and was well temperature controlled. We were able to find free street parking within a block of the unit every time. The fully equipped kitchen allowed us to store and cook fresh food for most of our meals, which saved us a ton of money. There are so many more good things to say about this unit but I don’t want my review to drag on. I would absolutely book this place again for my next trip to Boston!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay with Jason & Dabney. Check in was super easy and convenient. The place was so clean, there was clean bedding and towels.

If we ever make it to this side of the country again, we would stay here again! Thank you Jason and Dabney!"

Great location, close to everything. Needed more time to explore!!!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was amazing! One of the best Airbnb we’ve stayed at for sure.
The location as extremely convenient, easy walk to most places we needed to go. The parking was convenient as Jason had provided parking pass on the street for us and it was plentiful in the area.
The place also had everything we needed as well along with the washer and dryer unit where you can easily do laundry. And everything was extremely clean.
After a long day of exploring the city, coming back to this place you can feel relax and comfortable easily. I would strongly recommend others for sure."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jason and Dabney are terrific hosts. The apartment was very clean, comfortable, and convenient, as well as tastefully decorated. It was nice to make our own breakfasts, and we even cooked dinner there one evening easily, since the kitchen is well equipped."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a great place to stay for our trip to Cambridge and Boston! The apartment was clean, well-stocked, and conveniently located. We found both the bed and the fold out couch comfortable, and we really appreciated the little details around the apartment (the art on the walls, the white noise machine, the closet with extra towels) that made the stay feel home-like. The Roku tv was a fun way to unwind after a long day of being out and about, and the windows looking up onto the street in the kitchen provided lovely morning light for reading. Also, we loved that the apartment was so close to various restaurants, shops, and museums. We’d love to stay here again on return trips to the area. Thanks!"
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The place is great but be aware that it's in the basement.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are coming to Cambridge, this is where you want to stay! They have an incredible home in a wonderful neighborhood and not too far from different places you can explore!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! In a great location to walk to things and the hosts are very responsive. Would stay again!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I stayed for a few days to explore Cambridge and Boston. Jason and Dabney’s place was wonderful for our visit. The apartment is in a great location, with many places of walking distance or a quick drive away. It had all the amenities we needed to feel fully comfortable. Would greatly recommend staying here if you’re looking to explore the nearby area!"
2021-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space was clean and just as described on the listing. Jason and Dabney were very clear with instructions and responsive to any messages or questions we had. The apartment is a basement-type and can be a bit small sometimes. Overall, the apartment is quaint and amenities - like fridge, utensils, coffeepot, etc. - are very much appreciated. The area it's located in is a nice, quiet neighborhood, close enough to walk to the big Boston sights but far enough not be in the hustle and bustle.
Some of the things that didn't work for us: the bed was very uncomfortable, and neither of us could get much sleep. I've travelled quite a bit for work so I'm use to not sleeping in my own bed, but the bed was rock-hard and difficult to sleep on. The apartment is at the bottom of a house and there are residents upstairs that are frequently heard - sometimes yelling and stomping around. We also discovered strange things after leaving the apartment for long periods of time that we couldn't recall either of us doing - turned off lights, moved items, etc. It spooked us a bit and we weren't sure what was going on.
It didn't keep us from enjoying our trip thought. Definitely a decent place to stay if you aren't particular about those things but probably not for us. Thanks so much!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful apartment. Everything you could need and more. Quiet street and within safe walking distance to the T station. Very thoughtful with decor and the extras. Highly recommend a stay when visiting.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great space for a trip to the Boston Area. Located in a quiet residential neighborhood in Cambridge. Very clean and stocked with everything you would need. Very modern decor and appliances. Host was very friendly and very quick to respond to inquiries. ""5-STARS"" across the board!!!!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Thank you again!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A really great place! Fun/stylish/clean, fully renovated, yet in a charming very old building. Building next door is from 1826 and this seems similar. There are two rooms so were ideal for us since traveling as parent and kid.
The neighborhood is also charming, it feels like it used to be rougher than it is, we enjoyed exploring a bit and found Curio Coffee 3 blocks over, great coffee and baked to order waffles.
We decided to stay here in Cambridge rather than in downtown Boston, that worked although we needed to Uber over to downtown. The closet T station is under some renovations at this time so train over to downtown wasn't going to work."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Book this place now! We enjoyed our four night stay in Cambridge while we toured Boston by day. All of the photos depict exactly what you will see in person. The bed is very comfortable and the bathroom is clean and modern (it also includes a washer and dryer). The full kitchen made it very easy to prepare meals. There is a Whole Foods a mere 10 minute bike ride away (there are other grocery stores but we used Whole Foods). We used the Blue Bike system all around Boston and Cambridge - highly recommend! There is a Blue Bike station less than a five minute walk away. Use the Blue Bike system and buy a week’s pass on the Subway (Charlie Card) and you can easily get around Boston and Cambridge!
2021-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful space. Excellent bathroom and kitchen facilities. Clean. Quiet neighborhood. Parking pass a plus, but a little tricky on street cleaning day. Was great space with private entrance for safe stay during Covid."

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect stay for a quick getaway. House was clean, easy to check-in. Very quiet neighborhood! Everything you needed was close by. I didn’t drive my car the whole weekend. Jason and Dabney were quick to respond to my questions. Highly recommended."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is awesome. No complaints at all. If you are planning on taking the T around Boston, it is about a 10 minute walk, but it is a beautiful Peary of Cambridge. The hosts are very communicative and keep it spotless."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This apartment is at a great location close to everything and very well maintained. It is very clean, functional and has all the amenities we needed.

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It’s very close to the airport and there are many restaurants near by. The host responded my questions very quickly. Would love to come back to stay when in town.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I live in Boston and needed a place to stay locally after traveling internationally so I could isolate myself from my roommates as a precaution during the pandemic. This place was perfect with a kitchen, bathroom, laundry, and parking. There were helpful notes everywhere to explain how to use keypads and turn the water on for the laundry so I could manage everything myself. The TV has a ton for options for binging and I was able to use the provided HDMI cord to hook up my laptop to project my barre workouts. The place was also very clean. Excellent home away from home. Thank you!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place for a weekend in/near Boston. The hosts are very quick to respond. They provided very clear instructions. The apartment was very clean and modern. Yes, the bedroom does not have a door, but it is separate from the living room. However, that does not take away from the appeal of the space. I would definitely recommend staying here. A+ for both the space and the Hosts."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and I decided to take a mini weekend trip to Boston and Jason and Dabney’s place really exceeded our expectations! The apartment has such a wonderful modern aesthetic look to it but at the same time is so practical and very homey! This place is conveniently located near the various activities we wanted to do which was a huge plus. There nice touches included to the place such as including a Cerve cleanser which I had forgotten mine at home so this really saved me! The Roku Tv also was put to great use since we were able to watch some Netflix or YouTube on there! Something else I really appreciated was having a dishwasher for sure! We would most definitely recommend this place to anyone thinking about visiting the Boston area and we hope to come back soon!
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I really enjoyed our stay. We appreciated the clear instructions, close parking and amenities such as the washer and dryer.

Only con for our stay was that it was on the basement level and the entrance was a bit hard to find. The bedroom does not have a door, which is no problem for a couple, but might be something to consider for someone else sleeping in the living room. The place was clean and very well renovated, so would recommend!"

2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jason & Dabney’s place is the prefect Airbnb! Well designed, comfortable, and sparkling clean. The bedroom was so comfortable that I woke up in the middle of the night thinking I was home. Conveniently located close to the T and nearby shops and restaurants plus free overnight parking, you can’t beat it! Hosts were quick to respond and very accommodating. We’ll stay here again on our next trip to Boston. Five stars!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I stayed here for one night. Check-in was an easy process. Parking is located in a garage left of the hotel. Room was very clean and I enjoyed the rooftop bar.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Me and my friend booked this place last minute for a concert and were stunned by how nice it was! We’re already talking about booking another trip just to stay in the Moxy :)
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay! Such a fun, lively place in the perfect location! The rooms are so cute and have everything you'd need!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a great stay!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean and new rooms, nice and convenient restaurant/bar on second floor. There is no refrigerators in rooms so keep that in mind when buying food or drinks for the room 😁
But overall great location and awesome deal !"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The most convenient location. Lots to do! Felt right at home. The customer service was out
Of this world. Will be revisiting and letting friends and family know about this gem !"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great experience overall! Loved the amenities and walkability of the location. A fun and lively area that's a bit noisy, but to be expected on a busy weekend in the city!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Moxy was great! Easy to check in and out. Prime walkable spot in Boston!
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great location. Super close to theaters, restaurants, shopping, etc.. Very lively night life scene. But, it is very near Tufts hospital and ambulance sirens are frequent. If you sleep soundly, no problem. But if you are a light sleeper, it is tough."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The snazzy hotel was ideally located for me, just a stone's throw from the Boston Common, and the room was clean and attractive (especially if Industrial Chic is your aesthetic). Accommodations in Boston are generally way overpriced, and I wouldn't call this place cheap. That being the case, I was unhappy to discover, after I booked the room on AirBnB, that I would be paying an additional $30 ""destination fee""--which turned out to be $35 when I was actually handed my bill, which turned out to be $42 and change after taxes. It would be more honest to notify customers of these specific charges before they book the room, but so it goes. The free chicken sandwich in the bar, consumed amid drunken Jenga players whose constantly collapsing structures were actually fun to observe, took the sting out of the added fees, at least."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect for my stay in Boston. Would recommend!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great Stay in the heart of Downtown. Parking is an absolute nightmare so be prepared to park offsite for minimum $40/Night. With that said, the hotel is very centrally located around a host of great restaurants and nightlife. They give you vouchers for each night you stay to compensate for the $35 Boston tourism fees. A very nice added amenity. All in all an easy and relaxing place to stay on my business trip."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,it was so close to everything. there were restaurants and entertainment literally next door
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect amenities for what was needed, and a complimentary drink to boot! Convenient nearby parking, vibrant Boston experience, what more could you want?"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"LOVE MOXY, IS SO AWESOME! They don’t have good elevators but the have AMAZING TEQUILA AND COLD TOWELS. Also it is rumored that Sean Kingston frequently stays here and chases fans down the stairs, #LIVELOVEMOXY"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice little place to stay for a night in Boston
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location with great location. Friendly service, clean rooms. The standard you can expect from Moxy ❤️"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was as expected and Alyssa made everything super easy!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a great place to stay while in Boston. The Moxy is in a great location. Parking was super easy. The view was so good from our room. Check in was seamless even booking through Airbnb rather than the hotels website. The noise from the city was very minimal and the room included a sound machine which was so nice. Will definitely stay here again next time we are in Boston!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is really nice, centrally located in downtown right next to all of the action, and very clean and comfortable. Has a really hip, dance club like feel. Very simple room, no microwave, refrigerator, or coffee maker. The bed is pretty comfortable, and we got an awesome view. Good black out curtains. I would try to get the highest floor possible, as you are downtown close to the greatest noise level. We were on the 7th floor, and we heard lots of noise the whole night from the street even with ear plugs in. Would recommend if you want to stay downtown!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"great location, easy access to everything, small rooms but comfortable"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very small room but nice. No fridge or microwave in the room but you can request a fridge be brought. No ice machines but you can get ice buckets from the front desks. Overall nice, but expensive for the room itself. But it’s nice and in the heart of Boston, pretty good overall."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Initially booked this hotel because of the location and how convenient it is to walk to restaurants and stores, ended up enjoying the room and what the hotel has to offer. Host is very quick to respond and the staff is very accommodating."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything was amazing!! It was super cute and cozy, and perfect location for downtown access without being too far into it. You are near the hospital so there is quite a few ambulances that will come by throughout the day and night which didn’t bother me at all but they do provide earplugs which was a nice touch for those that it might bother. It was a great place and i loved it will definitely be staying here in the future!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were so happy about our stay here. We frequent Boston & have never stayed somewhere that we liked this much. The location was incredible, they gave us drink vouchers and $35 off food. They let us check in hours early & we’re so helpful and kind. It was very clean, spacious & awesome views. We will definitely be returning!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Enjoyed our stay with our two pups. Only downside was no parking on site.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As always this was an excellent place to stay at - close in proximity to bars, gyms ( if you are like me and need to get a workout in), restaurants, print and office shops ( super convenient since I am often in Boston for work), the place itself is cozy, cute and comfortable. Both times I’ve had a window view which is such a pick me up."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Loved the stay; the room was clean and comfortable. The check in experience was strange because the check in desk was upstairs without a lot of signage.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved the festive vibe of the place. We'll be back!
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Nice stay!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Best shower ever, our room was small but really nice. We didn't have luggage and thats good because it wouldn't have fit in the room well. The place is modern, fun and the bed is comfortable."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Moxy was modern and nice. It was clean. The staff was helpful and nice. The free coffee was a big plus and the overall vibe was great. Lots to do in the area.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location and a lot to do around
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The hotel location and amenities itself should be the main reason you book. It’s close to everything and our room was nice with a view. Very trendy design and lots to do within the hotel as well. It was a great spot.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything is the best for travelers in a historic big city! What a surprise that it is just the next door to Boch Center Wang Theater where we watched Shen Yun 2024 in the evening 👍
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location of Moxy is great, as it is very central and walkable to other tourist hotspots, and it is close to the train station. The room is a lot more spacious than I expected, as I have stayed in other Moxy's. Staff has let us to check in earlier than 3pm, which was amazing and much appreciated."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The location is so close to restaurants that we want to explore and easy to get around. The room is not so big and comfortable enough to relax. The host was very responsive and checkin instructions are clear. I like it a lot!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Moxy was just what we needed for a night’s getaway. Clean and comfortable!

2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Good location but it was noisy all night and given the location you need to be prepared for that
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The location was perfect for me. Near the subway stations and near many restaurants. I would definitely recommend this place.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying here! It’s so nice and loved the food/bar as well. It was nice to just be able to walk over to all my favorite restaurants. Would definitely recommend!

2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay overall! Walking distance to train station. Hotel room (not an apartment).
2023-11-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rude staff, insects on the 5th floor, scam with payment.
I paid for full 3 days. I missed one day because my flight was cancelled. When I arrived on the next day, receptionist told me that they cannot check me in because check in date was yesterday. And I need to pay again for two nights more. Also receptionist was rude.
Strongly don’t recommend"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice place!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had an amazing time staying in this local hotel. So much you can enjoy with your spouse there.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Me and my girlfriend had a great stay, perfect location and a great breakfast!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our 2-day stay at Moxy, which is a fun modern boutique hotel with a quirky youthful vibe. The location in the Chinatown / Theater District area was walkable to plenty of attractions, including Boston Common, Quincy Market, Prudential Center and the North End. All the Moxy staff were friendly and helpful. We enjoyed the laid-back bar for drinks and a light lunch. The onsite gym was a nice amenity as well. The room itself was small, but typical for an urban hotel room, and the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was clean and modern. The rate we got through AirBnB was much better than the rate shown on the Moxy’s website, so we feel we got a good deal and a good value."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Convenient location, clean environment"
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great price for being downtown Boston and easily walk to any neighborhood or access the T. The food and drinks available in house was a nice touch.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a pleasant stay at the Moxy Downtown. Pleasant staff for check-in and check-out. Everything was smooth sailing. The location is amazing (walkable distance from Boston South Station). This was the perfect location for my one day stay in Boston.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Cool vibes
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent place for short or long stay in Boston.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed staying here! This is our second time staying here. We were seeing a comedy show at the Wilbur and it was a 2 minute walk. It had a lot of nightlife and restaurants less than a five minute walk away. It was quiet, we had a great experience! Plus they give you a drink/food voucher and the specialty cocktail we had was fabulous! Would recommend!"
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time! We definitely didn’t get a great deal, but it’s that time of year so we understandably paid a bit more than we perhaps otherwise would have"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location! Was easy to walk to most places we were going. Room was perfect for our short stay! It was clean and the welcome drinks were great!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Love the moxy ! Great area and great room
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was very nice and as expected. Breakfast and the bar surpassed expectations. Would stay again!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had a great stay at the Moxy for my first trip in Boston! Although the place is small, it was good enough for 2 people. A little noisy, but really glad they provided earplugs."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,convenient location and cute room. interesting choice of decor lol
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay at Moxy Boston was great! The staff was friendly and informative, and the room, though small, was cozy. The hotel generously provided food and drink credits upon check in, and the on-site bar had floor to ceiling windows that made it a perfect place to people watch. The only thing that could be improved would be to provide a wider selection of in-room toiletries. I also would have liked a blanket, but didn’t see anyone at the front desk at the time of night when I needed it. Overall it is a nice place to stay that I would recommend to others."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great time here. Pretty darn perfect location. Easy to walk to key landmarks, great restaurants and nightlife. Hip ambience with all the right amenities for the price. Would definitely recommend."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,10 out of 10 would stay again. Thank you!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location great place definitely worth it
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location. Walkable to restaurants, coffee, and the T."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Moxy Hotel is where it’s at! I had a great stay. It was clean, everyone was very nice, and the 2nd floor lounge/bar area is super cool. The gym on the third floor is awesome too- they even have a boxing bag! If you are a light sleeper I don’t recommend facing the city, it is very loud due to the crowds from the bars down below. But I would definitely stay here again!"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Cool place, and in a great location. Easy to walk to restaurants, bars, and attractions. Only con is that we stayed in room facing street and it was super loud, but they did provide ear plugs."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"No frills, but super functional, clean, fun, and a great staff at your disposal. Given the central location and energy of the place, it can get loud no matter where you are on the property. So definitely take note and make use of the supplied ear plugs. That said, no complaints here. This was a great home base for the price and we would definitely stay here again."
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fine stay, good location, and a really nice room—but this is really a hotel and listing it on ABB is, I think, deceptive. Also, do mot plan on leaving your bags for a period if time after checkout, no secure location is available."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The staff, especially the manager, have great energy and are super helpful and friendly. We felt like family.
Location is seconds or minutes from anything you’d like to experience during your stay in Boston. Hotel restaurant has tons of fun games; my daughter and I were able to laugh and just really connect.
Thank you! I’ll be returning, for sure. ♥️"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cozy spot in Boston! walking distance from the metro but the view wasn’t exactly what we were expecting. Regardless I’d still recommend to anyone on the fence whether or not to book!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Higher price of the spectrum based on space you get but good location and convenient availability to book on shorter notice. Hotel staff was great!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent place to stay, very central, lots to do both inside and outside the hotel"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The clientele is young so there is a bit of noise. Happily, they put me on a high floor to limit the noise. Although I was on the 20th floor, I could still hear Street noise. It was nice that they provided a white noise machine."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Place is cool and clean. Bed comfy and smart decor. Street mouse really loud on a Friday night. Food is just ok. My young-teen daughter loved it!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice hotel. Just minutes away from the Freedom Trail!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,very good
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,✌🏼
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It’s the Moxy hotel, booked here because it was cheaper here than hotels dot com. Appeared to have full hotel services despite booking as Airbnb."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The rooms at the Moxie are small but it was a cool experience. I would definitely stay again.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great!
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The location is good if you are willing to walk. Metro is two blocks away. Parking is offsite and it’s best to simply park the car throughout the stay. Bedroom is small and tight. Hard to walk around bed. Must live out of a suitcase but there is no room to leave it.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Many Airbnb locations do not accept one night weekend stays, but I needed one, so a hotel seemed best. This is Airbnb AND hotel in one: price was similar to booking direct with the hotel, but since I found it on Airbnb, I booked it on Airbnb.
Moxy Downtown Boston Hotel is one block from Emery College, so the city area was vibrant with people from all walks of life. Very enjoyable for my Saturday night stay. The hotel is boutique-y and fun. Nice cafe and bars."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Moxy was the perfect hotel for my stay! The location couldn’t be any better. I’ll definitely stay here if I come back. Parking is very hectic around here so I would definitely recommend getting the garage parking or you’ll do a lot of driving in circles trying to find a spot
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location was great and there was easy access to many of Boston’s attractions, either by walking or the T. The hotel itself was well maintained and loved the amenities and funky decor. Our room was as described and comfortable. Great views of the city. Definitely try the breakfast naan at the bar/restaurant. Would recommend and stay again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was great. It was as advertised. Extremely comfortable, and the location was fantastic. The host stayed in touch with us throughout the entire experience and was extremely responsive. Close to all the sites that we wanted to see yet was a way from the heart of the tourist district. We would recommend this place to anyone interested in visiting Boston and would definitely consider it as a place to stay should we come back to Boston for another stay. And lastly, super convenient to/from the airport."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location very walkable, clean, lively"

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We liked nearly everything about our stay. The only drawback was the noise level of the area at night. The hotel is near a major hospital, so we heard ambulance and police sirens every night. Everything else was great!"

The view was of the city and the room was clean. They allow pets to stay, my room had a slight pet odor. Besides that the stay was perfect for my business trip and they even provided credit for meals for each night that I stayed. I would stay here again for a vacation next time."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The moxy was great there is a hidden fee that chargers you an additional 20+ for each night you stay. It should be noted in the AirBnB
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super clean, great location and even better staff - made life easy, albeit I had a hectic work schedule."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gem of a place!!! Near walk to train station. Lots of restaurants, bars and theatres around. Very fun, hip place to stay at. Perfect for a party of 2. Love the decor- would definitely stay again!!!"

Would recommend and would love to stay here again in the future!! Staff were friendly and gave us recommendations for food and dancing in the city!"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable. Easy instructions. But room a little smaller than expected. And the ceiling light keeps flashing.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed my stay at this hotel. The complimentary breakfast for the hotel guests was a nice touch!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We needed a same-day place to stay overnight that was affordable and close to public transportation. We were fortunate to find this cool boutique hotel with all the expected amenities (check in with an attendant, secure spaces, and room room, and complementary breakfast) plus cool art throughout. It was an easy choice when the only other comparable options were rooms or small apartments that had spotty reviews."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was wonderful staying at Konrads! We absolutely fell in love with the place and appreciate Konrad’s kindness, especially when we accidentally locked the airbnb keys in the rental car place when returning."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is super modern, clean, in a building with personality, close to transport, easy to get in and out of. This was a perfect combination for the requirements I had for the stay.
As a bonus, the Zhi Wei Cafe around the corner by itself is worthy of the visit. The best Lanzhou Beef soup we ever had. We went back twice :-)"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great loft. Well equipped kitchen. Clean. Very nice style. Can get street noise at night but not a problem with earplugs. Safe neighborhood. Would stay here again

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Konrad's place was the perfect location for my short trip to Boston. South Station is a 30 second walk from the front door and many of the iconic locations of Boston are within 15-20 mins walking or 5-10 via Uber. The only issue was that the apartment was a bit noisy from the noises of the city and streets below but this was easily resolved by listening to some light music on my AirPods, a noise machine might be a good idea to bring along with if you are a light sleeper. Overall, an excellent space to explore and enjoy Boston from. Thanks Konrad! I'll be back!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful loft space, furnishings and design. Very spacious. Perfect for a couple. Everything you need in kitchen. Several coffee and tea options. Big bathtub. Host responds quickly. Walking distance to south st station and freedom trail and downtown and Chinatown and seaport and convention center. Thin walls so can hear neighbors noise is only downside. Overall great stay."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Immaculate and comfortable stay in an incredibly convenient location. Will return.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place walking distance to most things. Very spacious. Responsive and friendly host.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was great- very large/ spacious, clean and terrific location! Well-stocked and great host.
My only issue was that it was really dark but nothing a few extra light fixtures couldn't fix.
Highly recommend!!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We walked a ton each day in Boston, and Konrad's place was perfect for this. It felt safe and it was easy to get to everything. Loved the coffee place across the street. Really cozy couch for TV watching. Noise from traffic and neighbours so a sound machine is a great idea!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"easy checkin, convenient location, clean place"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Konrad’s place was great for our stay! He was able to help us to get in a few hours earlier than posted check in, which was extremely helpful. Super close to Chinatown with tons of great food. Also close to everything in the city, extremely convenient access to any modes of transport you would need. The only negative would be the street noise, but we brought a white noise machine and that was very helpful. Overall, definitely would recommend!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place that was so well-equipped. Super convenient location. Konrad was a great host who responded promptly and was very helpful. Thank you!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is nice, clean, it has everything you need and even more, we had a great and safe time, we had a great and safe time"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location for exploring and eating our way thru this part of Boston. Easy 0.6m walk to convention center and better value than surrounding hotels. Space had everything we needed and larger than anticipated! Great communication with host. Would recommend!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is large, clean, and tastefully decorated, as in pictures. We walk everywhere. South Station is a 2 to 3 minutes walk. It's great to have washer & dryer inside. The building
is secured by separate lock code/keys.
We'll stay here again and refer family & friends.
Thanks, Konrad
Alisha"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Konrad’s place was perfect for our stay in Boston. The location was wonderful. It’s central location made it easy to walk everywhere we wanted to go in Boston. His apartment offers a comfortable place to relax after exploring all the city has to offer. It was modern and well supplied. We recommend it highly.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice spacious apartment and good location, there was a lot to do within walking distance and the host was great and responsive."

Plenty of space and we loved the Elevator. thank you 5 stars all the way !"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great location. Walking distance to downtown, Chinatown. The loft on the 4th floor was cleaned, accurate to the pictures but is darker. Kitchen is well equipped. The AC in the main room is a e-cold air flow device connected to the window. Konrad was very responsive and helpful. The check in process was easy."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Where do I begin? This Airbnb is so beautiful & spacious, and well equipped for an extended stay. I loved the art - the buddhist statue, the cubicle display of scupltures. And the loft being tall with tall windows & high ceilings made it feel very spacious. The kitchen was very sleek and updated, with everything you could need. The only small thing is that the location is not the most quiet, with a lot of surrounding construction, and people making noise at night. However, if you reside in a city already, you would probably be okay with this. For myself, the highlights of this Airbnb far outweighed that issue. Everything was either in good walking proximity, or at least good walking proximity to the T - which Boston has an excellent train system. Konrad was also very helpful & responsive. Thanks for sharing your beautiful condo!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic loft space. Easy communication and entry. Thanks much.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The loft is very spacious and the kitchen (and other rooms) were equipped with everything my 13 year old son and I needed for our 7 day stay (June 15-June 22). Konrad was very responsive to messages. I accidentally locked myself out of the loft and he was able to come to my rescue. The location was great. Only a minute or two walk to south station, and a close walk to china town, downtown, and the Boston harbor. I felt very safe in the neighborhood and in the loft. Lots of great memories were made this week!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Konrad’s apartment was great! We stayed there for a week with our 8-month-old baby - the apartment was big enough, very well-equipped, and clean! The Wi-Fi was great as well.
The location is super convenient - it was so easy to get around on foot. It's downtown, though, so it can get quite noisy. Konrad was very kind and responsive and had some nice tips for us.
The coffee place across the street is really good."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"All the amenities were extremely well-stocked and comfortable so we felt right at home. The location was also excellent, as it was within walking distance of the train station and popular tourist destinations like the Freedom Trail. Konrad was very helpful and responsive and would always give us clear instructions and recommendations for places to visit in the area. We consulted his guidebook and found that all the recommended restaurants were conveniently located near the Airbnb and also served great food. The Airbnb was so cosy that we found ourselves eager to return to it after each tiring day of activities, and we would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to explore the best of Boston, with minimal effort."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Nice host, great location, very stylish room with everything you need for a great stay."

Konrad was responsive and accommodating. We will definitely be back.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here while attending a convention in Boston. Very convenient location, with most things needed not being more than a 10 minute walk away. The room was amazing and I was really impressed with how nice it was."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is in a perfect location. Near to everything. Place was larger than we thought. Two of us could work from the place without disturbing each other. Internet was great for remotely accessing my work computer and also take work video calls.

Lovely panelled entrance and elevator that leads to really large apartment with great storage, well equipped kitchen including Nespresso machine. The bedroom is light and airy and although it is not a superking bed it is still very comfortable.
It is true that there is a big construction site on the next road which creates a compressor noise occasionally, however it didn't bother us."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place. Exactly what was stated and easy to get into and around Boston from.
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is great, and as advertised, if not a little better than advertised.
Location is good.
I would give it 5 stars if it weren’t for the construction that is constantly going on nearby, some times starting at 6AM. I’m sure when construction is done, it will be an even greater place. Konrad was an excellent host, replying immediately to any questions. Check-in and -out was super easy."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, comfortable, roomy and artsy loft close to everything. Konrad was extremely helpful and communication was top notch. Very safe building. We would definitely stay here again!"
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent apartment, spacious, nicely appointed and fully equipped. Convenient location for access to train and bus station. The only complain is the high level of noise from nearby construction works which were 24/7 and compounded by the poor insulation of the windows. It really affected our sleep. Barring this issue we would have given it a 5 star rating."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This is a lovely loft which is a short walking distance from the Amtrak station and also Chinatown. There were lots of good food in that area and it was walkable to the downtown area. I found it quite comfortable and thoroughly enjoyed my time there. would definitely recommend to others visiting Boston! Hands down beats the hotels!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We had a wonderful stay at Konrads place! The unit has everything you need and was great for a longer stay! Very clean, spacious and having a laundry in the unit was an added bonus. Great location! Transit is close although we like to walk as Boston is a super walkable city which made the location even better for us. Although when we did need a ride, the location made for a very easy pick up for drivers to find. Wonderful restaurants close by and for the times you might want to stay in, everything needed to cook was available. Konrad was very helpful, responsive and checked on us to make sure we made it in with ease and everything was set. This was nice as we arrived very late. He also offered great recommendations as well! Per all the other reviews, everything that could be said about this unit and Konrad as a host has been said and we totally agree!"
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, well-kept, and spacious. Laundry is a great plus. Location is amazing, in walking distance to all downtown Boston has to offer.
Location is great but close to construction and quite loud at times. Neighbor's dog barked throughout the stay."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I've stayed here three times, and plan on returning in the fall. Great location - easy to get anywhere in Boston/Cambridge. Unit is spacious, spotless, up-to-date, and comfortable."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There are many things I like about this place 1) great location, close to South station and Chinatown, endless food options and I walked to the station to take the train to NYC, super convenient! 2) Very spacious, plenty of room, high ceiling, beautiful apt 3) nice decor and artsy feeling inside 4) The laundry is a plus! 5) Konrad is friendly and good with communication. I would recommend this place if you are visiting Boston!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious place in a great location! Fast wifi and can't beat how close it is to it all. If you are at an event at the convention center but want to be closer to the happenings of the city, this is your place."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Konrad is incredibly responsive and a gracious host. This loft is roomy, centrally located, and the perfect spot to stay for any first time Boston visitors. Very close to public transportation and a quick walk to many sights."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was exactly as advertised and maybe even larger than it looked in the pictures. Check-in was painless.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely phenomenal space. Hands-down it's the single-best urban Airbnb I've experienced in over 5+ years of travel.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Konrad’s place was wonderful! The location is incredibly convenient and is close to several neighborhoods and public transit. The space was clean and stocked with amenities to use during the stay. I would mention that folks should be prepared for some noise between people outside and the neighbors (but it’s a city, so there will always be something!). Those that are more sensitive to noise while sleeping may have a hard time. Overall, I had a great stay and would absolutely stay again!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful loft, ideal location, host is very prompt with replies and information. I would stay here again."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This spot has it all, and more!!! Stylish, comfortable, and fully stocked with all the amenities. Konrad is also super welcoming and helpful. No complaints! 👌🏻"

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Konrad’s loft was spacious and beautiful! Pretty central I’m the city. Easy access to anywhere you need to go. I would definitely stay again :)
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Konrad was an excellent host and this (surprisingly spacious) spot is very conveniently located within walking distance of South Station. Konrad was quick to answer questions, offer tips, provide local tasting options, and even let us check out late so we didn't have to tote our stuff around Boston on our last day!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great spot to be around various means of public transportation and food.
We heard stomping upstairs throughout the night, the neighbors downstairs or upstairs TV, dog, and general conversation in our stay. If you are a quiet group/person/duo, you will hear/feel everything happening around the building. Other than that, it was an excellent spot to explore the city."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Huge loft apartment.
Bottom line is tons of space, comfortable bed, everything worked and location easily accessible from transit, easily walkable to a number of attractions and 10/10 would stay again. Only minor quibble was the dresser not in the bedroom but more of a wardrobe in the hallway which I was slow to catch on to, but eventually got unpacked day 2 once I figured it out!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great location. No problems with the unit. Have stayed there before and will do so again. Host is very responsive. Great experience
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,amazing stay! first time in boston and the loft was better than the photos! thank you again for the amazing hospitality:)
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I will definitely be staying again. This was a perfect location and beautiful place. I was new to Boston, first time visiting and Konrad was so helpful. Thank you so much. Hope to be back soon!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, great location, comfortable, and very accommodating host. I will most likely stay here again if I find myself back in Boston."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great loft. very clean and in a great location. we would stay again.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Konrad’s apartment is in the center of town, its large, its clean and its private, quiet, and comfortable. If you desire a more adult, urban lifestyle this is the place for you.
No doilies in this apartment! But interesting artwork, loft style living, huge, amazing kitchen( sub zero etc) well equipped, Communication excellent! Need we say more?"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Konrad was an excellent host! His communication was timely and informative. The condo was artfully appointed, and the building residents were friendly. I appreciated that Konrad provided nice soap, shampoo, laundry detergent, toaster, french press, and bottled water — like the ones I would normally buy at home. The condo was conveniently located right by South Station and Chinatown. Though the prime location came with city noise. Overall, we enjoyed our stay!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful apartment in South Boston, well furnished with AC, washer and dryer available"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super convenient location, listing was larger and more impressive than we imagined! had everything we needed for a perfect workcation in Boston. Konrad is a great host and always replied promptly to our messages. 5 star stay. Thank you Konrad!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Konrad's place is in a great location, and he is truly a super host! The place was clean, the communication was excellent and timely, and check in/out was COVID conscious. I highly recommend this condo for anyone looking for a spacious gem in Downtown Boston."

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location! We would gladly stay here again in the future!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,👍
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The condo location was great. The condo was clean. I would have liked a bit more upscale property. The bed sheets were a bit thin, and the furniture was shabby. If you are looking for the basics the place is not bad. I would stay at the property again."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location a block from South Station for Amtrak and the T, and Chinatown in the other direction. Very comfortable for 2 people with enough room to have a few more over for a meal. Bathroom and bedroom have all the basics you would need for a week long stay, and it's nice knowing you have a kitchen at your disposal with cookware, silverware, flatware, and a few basic ingredients. Host was very accommodating and check in was easy and contactless."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great industrial-style loft at a great location. Konrad is very responsive and helpful. Would stay here again and recommend to friends.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"stunning space and location to rail. by far, the largest airbnb I have ever been to."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My fiancé and I stayed here for a week and we loved this place. Very convenient location, modern interior with high ceilings, spacious, and host is very responsive. Perfect if you have to work during the travel as well. One little thing to mention though is occasionally there’s a slight smokey smell (we think may be from the neighbor smoking) but we kept the fan on and it is not much of a concern. We recommend this place."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful place, a great location, and a very attentive and helpful host! A wonderful experience overall."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We are in Boston frequently visiting our college kids, and this was our fourth stay at Konrad's. It's like a home away from home for us - couldn't ask for a better place to stay!!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location in Boston, clean, fast wifi. Enjoyed my stay here!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Amazing place! Beautiful apartment, very well located, space is much bigger than what appears to be on the picture, we had a great stay!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place would definitely come again! Heat stopped working but Konrad was quick to fix the problem with bringing firewood to use the fire place!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This is our third stay here, and it’s definitely our go-to for Boston. See my previous comments for all that is great about staying here - it’s the perfect location and setup for us! Very highly recommend!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Konrad's loft is in a converted building just east of Chinatown; it is a huge space, very comfortable and tastefully decorated. The layout is a little unconventional, but we enjoyed our stay until it was cut short. Unfortunately, there was a problem with the hot water heater and we decided to move out early, but Konrad was very easy to work with in getting refunded."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This was our second extended stay at Konrad’s apartment, and it was the perfect spot - just like last time. Great home base location in Boston, very comfortable living space, and very kind and responsive host. We hope to be back soon! :)"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Konrad's place was in a great location and very nice. Konrad is very responsive and helpful.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We just returned from an 11-night stay at Konrad's loft, and we really couldn't have asked for a better stay in Boston! Konrad is so nice to work with, and so kindly accommodated us by shifting the reservation by a couple of days when our plans unexpectedly changed. The apartment is in a wonderful location - active and busy on the edge of Chinatown, but on a super quiet block (very little street noise, which is great for light sleepers)! Just a few blocks from the Red, Orange, and Green lines, as well as Emerson College, the Boston Common, and Downtown Crossing area - so, easy to get virtually anywhere in the city from the apartment. The unit is quite large, comfortably furnished, super clean, and very well-stocked! We were moving our kids to their colleges, and the apartment was a great space to have them over in the evenings for dinner, etc (nice, large table to eat and/or work at). The A/C worked perfectly, which was pretty important for the crazy August Boston weather, and the in-unit laundry was fantastic for a longish stay. This was probably the best Air BnB we've stayed in and we will absolutely re-book for subsequent trips out to Boston. Can't recommend highly enough! Thanks again, Konrad! :)"
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was perfect for my needs. Konrad kept up communication when issues arose with travel in the city (issues beyond both of our control). I'll definitely be staying here again.
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A great place. Large, well-appointed, clean. Very comfortable bed. Host is very responsive. Excellent location. Would definitely stay here again."
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place - much bigger than expected. Very flexible host. Great experience
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was even better than the listing shows. Great loft space in the middle of everything I needed. Wouldn’t hesitate staying again next time I’m Boston!
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was WAY bigger and better than we expected. It was clean, roomy, comfortable, and close to everything. There was a bit of noise from other tenants and from the street below, but that is to be expected when staying in any larger city. We would absolutely stay here again and will be suggesting it to all of our friends and family!"
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! The loft was beautiful, large, extremely clean, well supplied, in a secure building, across the street from a great coffee shop and only a block from South Station. A short walking distance to the Financial District, the Wharf, and Downtown. It made my work trip feel like a vacation!"
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,This place is really beautiful and HUGE. I feel like the pictures actually don’t do it justice because it was much better and bigger than I expected! Konrad was extremely attentive and helpful. This place has a lot of space and that bed was surprisingly one of the most comfortable beds I slept on in a very long time. I highly recommend this place and Konrad to anyone.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A wonderful place for our Boston adventure. The location was fantastic, the loft had such a homie feel to it. Everything worked beautifully."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Love this place. The kitchen is outstanding with great amount of silverware, equipment, and glassware. High ceilings and spacious living room. We had a wonderful time."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Location was excellent and everything was exactly as described!
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful space in a really great location. Stayed a week in this apartment and wish I could have stayed a month.
Konrad is a great host. Check in was smooth. He is very responsive.
The neighborhood is great. Close to South Station and lots of Boston sights. Local bars and restaurants. Chinatown.
The apartment is large and well appointed. Comfy bed. Nice towels. All the amenities.
Highly recommended. I will stay here again."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Konrad was a great host, meeting us at the apartment when we arrived. He responded quickly to all the questions we had. The apartment is a great space and an excellent location."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, clean hotel, great bar/restaurant! Would stay again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice place, although slightly small. Which for the price, can’t complain too much."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spot— will stay again.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little spot! Walkable to the green line and lots of local restaurants. We had a great view of the city. Loved it we had a great time there.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"otima Acomacao, beautiful city views"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay and Serena the Manager was great , also the two ladies when we checked in was polite, and very customer oriented."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The Moxy was a great stay for a short weekend trip. The beds are not that comfortable and it can get noisy at night. The rooms are also kind of small but manageable if you are organized. If you are looking for nightlife this is a great place to stay because all the clubs/bars are walking distance. I would recommend for convenience of being in the seaport area
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Great location and fun hotel, however, noisy as hell. We should have known when we arrived at our room, there was a sound machine and ear plugs. We stayed on the 23rd floor but there is a club in the alley below our room. We heard the bass and music until after 3am. Worst nights sleep ever. In their defense, there was also a card from the hotel offering assistance if we could not sleep?? Unfortunately, didn't see that until the next morning and wouldn't have wanted to change rooms at 3am. Would stay again, but request room on the other side."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay in downtown Boston!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was amazing and the view too. A little noisy but they provided ear plugs, comfortable bed, super clean, restaurant and bars inside the Moxy just amazing!! 100% recommend to any one that wants to find the wild side on you!!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Unique hotel
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome place to celebrate an engagement

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great central location! A bit noisy at night, but to be expected when staying over the weekend in the heart of downtown. The room was perfect for what we needed."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Went for a little birthday getaway for the weekend and this place was everything. It’s super nice and cozy and overlooking the busy streets of Boston. Everything is near by and we were able to walk the beautiful city. If you’re looking for a great place to stay, I highly recommend!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"You cannot beat the location. We were able to walk to a concert venue, restaurants and bars."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fun place, great walkable area. Very clean."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Moxy was perfect for what we needed. Close to so much, clean, functional. The roomy was small, but with great views."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super chic hotel right in the middle of everything - highly recommend it!
Spectacular view of the Boston commons and Beacon hill from our room too. Two enthusiastic thumbs up!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay, highly recommend."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place to stay if you want to enjoy downtown Boston, also great value for the booking because the two $35 vouchers we were provided at check in paid for dinner and drinks at their very cute restaurant. We were on the 22nd floor and had the most wonderful view of the Boston Common and Massachusetts State House. Recommend if you want to travel with your pet, very dog friendly hotel!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location with a great view. Friendly staff and we got a $35 meal voucher as well as 2 free drinks upon arrival. Definitely recommend!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Moxy was a hip, fun place to stay in Boston. It was the PERFECT location (1 block away!) for a visit to Emerson College for my daughter to check out the school. We walked everywhere, only needing an Uber to/from the airport and once in the rain. We had planned to drop our bags in the morning after our red-eye flight from Los Angeles. Instead, we were able to check in at 9:30 AM! This was totally unexpected and so appreciated!
The rooms are extremely small but well laid out with lots of hooks to help keep items off the floor. As long as you are comfortable being very cozy with your travel partner, this is a great place for the price. The restaurant and bar served very nice drinks a good food. We will come again if my daughter decides to attend Emerson!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Moxy lives up to its branding as a less expensive but quality hotel where there is actually some style and liveliness that you don't find a lot. Will definitely go back.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,perfect in every way for a couple
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Love the hotel, it’s funky & artistic & the theme is dope too. Loved the experience & will be back 😝🙌"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little place with amazing customer service and loved the lounge/bar area! Highly recommend
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Centrally located next to a plethora of to do Boston tours!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved our stay. So many great things to do within walking distance. Ubers also right in the area, meaning shorter waiting times. Chinatown was my hubbies fav spot and we walked to and from with ease.
Parking garages nearby as well, we drove in from New Hampshire and paid for a spot in advance (through an outside source) and literally left our car in the garage the whole stay. Staff was friendly.
We know we will be choosing the Moxy for every Boston stay in the future.
The rooms are small, at least the one we paid for, but we were ok with that as we were not planning on staying in our room outside of showers, clothing changes and sleep.
Definitely recommend."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thanks
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a weird AirBnB. It’s a funky new-gen hotel, which is okay, but have you ever seen a hotel with no closet and no dresser, like nowhere to put underwear and socks??? You hang hangers ON WALL PEGS.
And no in-room coffee, and the only restaurant has no decaf, just decaf cappuccino?? And all the furniture folds up and hangs on wall pegs??
But when they finally gave me the room type they had sold me, it was okay for the money and location was excellent for me.
If you’re not on a high floor, be prepared for sirens and horns honking."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay and very much worth the price. Housekeeping kept up with the room being clean, sheets and towels changed. The room also came with a great view of the city. I would for sure come back and stay here again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Maybe the best and most central location for a tourist in Boston.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very modern, clean, and hip. Bar, food and workspaces very convenient.
I overlooked the room size description, room was small for two people with luggage."
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The hotel itself was extremely awesome. Very clean, very friendly staff, great bar and food. The room was cozy and the bathroom was clean. The only thing we had an issue with was both nights our sleep was heavily disturbed at 1-3am. Both situations very obviously out of the hotel’s control as one night it was night construction with workers tearing up the road. The other night, the bar/club across the street kicked everyone out when they closed at like 2am and there was a massive crowd of people directly outside the hotel yelling and fighting. It created so much traffic that included people honking for over an hour and the police were called. This was obviously not something Moxy could control, but the rooms facing the street/front of hotel were very not sound proof and we heard everything outside. There were earplugs provided in the room. Overall good experience."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location with friendly workers!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful location. Definitely worth every dollar I paid.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Moxy was a great place to stay!! The room itself was very clean and had everything we needed (towels, shampoo, conditioner, hair dryer, and even a steamer!). The hotel itself had a bar (they make a great Old Fashioned) and complimentary coffee in the morning. Location was great - close to Chinatown and the T. Everything was very walkable. Absolutely loved it here and will come back!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved our stay, very pleased with our entire experience. Heads-up, read through the listing. This is a HOTEL. It's lovely and perfect in so many ways I just didn't read through the entire listing. We would give it a 10/10 - would recommend!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location is prime it’s walking distance Boston commons park. The w hotel is across the street l, which also confirms that it’s in a good location. Check in went smoothly, the room is pretty tiny if your used to normal size rooms, luckily the guy at the front desk upgraded me to a corner suite room for free & it was a lot bigger with a panoramic view of the city, so I was extremely satisfied. You can also pay an extra $20-30 to have this room, which I would highly recommend. Everything else went smoothly."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I was in Boston for a girls’ weekend. I thoroughly enjoyed the Moxy! My room was very clean and bright. I had a beautiful view of Boston Commons. The Moxy staff were extremely kind and very helpful with any questions I had. I definitely would stay here again in the future. Thank you for a wonderful weekend away!!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,The Moxy was nice and clean. The picture and name were deceiving though but the amenities were great and the space cute. Boston commons was close by with lots of restaurants. Overall a good experience.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Hotel in a fun part of Boston, would stay again if I was in the area. Easy walking distance to the subway and close to lots of restaurants and theaters. The room is small but cute and well organized - perfect for a night or two in the city if you aren't planning to need a bunch of space in the room. Other reviews mentioned noise, but I was on the 8th floor and didn't have any issues other than expected city noise. There was free donuts and hot chocolate at check-in which was a fun touch :)"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,It is located in downtown and close to the subway. The room is decent and clear.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Moxy was amazing. Great location, right next to Chinatown and the theater district. It’s also walking distance from many popular night life lounges. Room was smaller than expected but still cute and very clean. parking was a little pricey but pretty much the same everywhere else. Parking garage is 4min away from Moxy."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The people were so nice and the hotel was so cute inside. I’d definitely stay here again!

Friendly staff! :)"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cool spot with two bars and a great location in Boston. It's the city so you'll hear honking until the early morning and then again when you wake up though they provide earplugs.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Kaila was the most welcoming reception professional I have ever dealt with in my 25 plus years in the hospitality and people services industry!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Will recommend
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location but no parking not onsite and $40 day. Unexpected daily service charge of $25 which they gave us vouchers for to use at hotel bar and restaurant, however bar and restaurant over priced."
2023-10-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is pretty much a night club with rooms! It is SO LOUD they provide earplugs on the nightstand. We were on the 23rd floor and the 24th floor is a freaking nightclub and they were having a DRAG QUEEN SHOW!!!! Got zero sleep! They charge you $25 a night Hotel fees and offset it with a $25 voucher for food, but the food is literally $20 for a sandwich made at the bar and $6 for a Gatorade. They have Random people not staying at the hotel coming in and out because it's a night club! Location is great! it's walking distance to everything. TV didn't work half the time and when it did they don't offer local channels with dish! THE ROOM IS THE SIZE OF THE BED. Bathroom was nice but shower door didn't stay closed. Never spoke with host and front desk looked at us crazy because we weren't in the system."
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Accurate description. Very noisy and crowded at night.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It’s basically the moxy hotel in downtown Boston. It was a great hotel very fun and cool. Definitely recommend and will be staying again. Love it!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location! Walkable to theaters restaurants parks and shopping!!
We had a beautiful view of city & the Charles river.
The hotel is great! Small, fun, young vibes.. . Great spot for quick getaway!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to say. I would stay again!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at the Moxy for our first trip to Boston. We felt like it was a great location and one of the best values price wise that we could find.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"great location, fun vibe, lots of energy and good public spaces inside the hotel. small rooms but perfectly functional"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Cute hotel close to TD Garden. The room looks identical to the room shown. The view wasn't the same but was still nice. As for the noise, its near restaurants and bars, the hotel does supply ear plugs. Once I put those on I had a sounds sleep. The bar/restaurant on site had good food and drinks. Its also nice that they gave us a complimentary drink and $25 towards food."
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The place was nice and exactly as described. The space is small -- but that was okay, we knew what we had signed up for and the pictures provided were very accurate. Great atmosphere. It was nice to have a bar/nighttime hangout space in the hotel. My only complaint (and it's very minor) is that they advertise that your purchase includes two complimentary drinks. Excited to use them, I frequented the bar only to find out that you have to choose between three specific drink options that they have pre-selected and the coupons do not apply to any beverage you order. Any drink you do order will be pricy -- just expect it. Overall, great stay."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This room is most deff only for two people but such a fun hotel!
We enjoyed our stay!"
2023-10-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"This is not an Airbnb! It’s a hotel!
Not worth the money AT ALL! Not even enough towels for 2 people. It’s all about drinking and we don’t drink. The staff were excellent and very friendly and helpful, but the room was cramped, did not match the picture, there was no coffee maker, the room was cold with a loud fan noise. Barely slept a wink!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cool hotel and located in a fun and lively part of town!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful views....the top floor was great. The restaurant/bar was convenient the first night we got in later. Room was perfect. Perfect proximity to everything....very satisfied. Would like to come back soon!!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had an amazing time staying here! Was given a free drink coupon for the hotel bar. Only downside was how loud outside was at night, but they provide earplugs and a white noise machine in the room."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Moxy is a hotel, simple. We had a hitch with the first roomed assigned, it did not have a river view. However, the desk person couldn’t have been more friendly and efficient in changing our room. We also received 2 free drinks and a $25 credit to be used at Bar Moxy for food or drinks. The rooms are simply decorated industrial modern. The rooftop bar was closed for a private event on Saturday evening and not opened on Sunday:(. The location was perfect for us- we walked to Fenway one day and walked the Freedom trail the second. Would definitely stay here again."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Moxy downtown is one of the few modern options in Boston. It is so close to the Commons, and there's a T stop just a few minutes away. Great location."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The rooms were very hot. The air conditioning system was faulty and would blow out hot air at random times
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really great place to stay for a weekend! The rooms are small, but clean and great views in this area. Overall, a great deal for a hotel in an area that is walkable to back bay and newbury street!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I’ve always wanted to stay at a Moxy hotel so it was great to do it in Boston. You’re smack dab in the middle of everything; walkable to Boston Commons, Gardens, Chinatown, Downtown, the waterfront etc. and if you’re into it, lots of bars and nightclubs and theaters. Definitely would love to stay here again and definitely recommend others to do the same!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Do not like city views. This is a great city view over the park. Let’s you see places on the freedom trail you want to visit. Spent three days of cold baths at Marriott. It felt soo go to have a hot bath. Lot of party places for young crowd. I thought it would be loud at night. Did not hear party noice. The Thai restaurant across the street was the best meal for our week long trip. The ginger dish was great. If you do Airbnb w
Jen they e mail you respond back asking for a number code vs Airbnb letter code Airbnb sends."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Check-in is on the 2nd floor. Lobby is a bit loud, rooms are small (fairly standard for a large city) but super cute and clean."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely stellar and very accommodating! The staff was so kind and helpful to let me stay longer on Sunday at no charge since my flight was late in the day. The complimentary drink coupons are a fun way to get to enjoy the roof top bar. The room was very clean and modern. Even has a steamer for clothes! Nice personal touches.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Moxy was a pretty cool hotel. It had a bar with food options as well as a little self-serve area for snacks and drinks. The only things we didn't love were the bed was pretty firm and the room is fairly small. Otherwise this was a great stay!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Moxy is a great place to stay for a couples weekend in Boston. Clean, hip, so much fun, and walking distance to some great local restaurants and activities. Would definitely stay again!"

2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The unit was small but clean and pleasant. The staff were all very friendly and polite. If I were to describe the overall building and unit, I would say ""aggressively hip."" Just a block away from Boston Commons with access to plenty of food and entertainment. Close to the subway"
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved our stay! Check-in was on floor 2, but instructions to getting to desk were clear. 4 elevators, not a lot of waiting. Trouble getting into building after 10pm because card reader didn’t work, but an attendant came quickly to open the door. Room was quaint and enough room for 2 of us for a night. Awesome location in Chinatown and great customer service!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Moxy was a great place to stay! It was the perfect spot for a date night, great location, amazing staff, fun vibe, and offered great welcome vouchers!! The room itself was a perfect size for the two of us and offered a great clean space."
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a really cool, energetic hotel. Definitely a good place if you are looking to go out on the town to party.
Some trouble checking in with my airbnb booking but that was sorted after some minutes.
Gym was relatively well equipped and completely empty of anyone else (party hotel).
The only real problem was the noise in the room from police cars, traffic horns and nightclubs. I would have expected some noise of course, but I don't think the windows are well fitted (can also feel a breeze) so the effect of double glazing to suppress the noise is much reduced. it's not quite like being outside... but almost.
They do provide earplugs but if you want to get up on an alarm to get to the airport, maybe you don't want to use those.
I was also only there Friday and Saturday nights, so maybe less of an issue in the week."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location, all the staff are friendly and the building has a fun atmosphere. The rooftop breakfast buffet hit the spot on Sunday morning. I was given a room on the sixth floor so the view wasn’t spectacular and there was street noise, but overall really enjoyed the moxy. Oh and the noon checkout was nice, didn’t feel rushed in the morning."
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,View was amazing 🤩
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Easy check in. Close to everything. We did have issues with getting the tv to connect to the wifi so that was unfortunate during the evening if we didn’t go out. Overall, would recommend to a friend or even stay here again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"You can probably get a room here cheaper some other way. Bar is ridiculously expensive, my boyfriend got a double vodka soda for 30 bucks and we were not informed about it until after the check came. Otherwise very hip hotel, amazing location."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Generally satisfied. Good location,friendly employees and clean room. I got free coupons for two drinks and food when checking in, which made me feel welcomed.

Plenty of great things to do/see in the area and walking distance. Would stay again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice place
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great hotel for a short-term stay. They are equipped with a bar-restaurant, 24 hours small fitness center, and rooftop brunch on weekends. The front desk was very helpful with our luggage storage, and the luggage trolley on the first floor was helpful too. The room is a little bit space-limited, but everything else is just perfect."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved my room, totally met my needs. Loved all the storage and the location is right in the thick of the theatre district. The noise is to be expected, they provide complimentary earplugs and a noisemaker. Mattress was great."

2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Close to everything, lovely room and staff but use the ear plugs on the nightstand because between the cars outside and ac/heater in the rooms the noise is real."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great location

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The room was exactly as expected for a city hotel room, the view was nicer than anticipated! We stayed for just one night to see a show next door at the Wilbur and this was the perfect location. We did dinner and breakfast at the hotel bar because it was so nice and convenient!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super easy and convenient. Couldn’t ask for a better experience
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Close to theaters. Clean room and bathroom. We were on 23rd floor so noise wasn’t too bad.
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location is awesome! So many places around to eat, drink and shop. The view was great as well; especially at night. It’s a pretty small room inside of a hotel but the shower was really nice and the bed was comfortable too. There’s an extra $150 refundable deposit fee when you check in at the hotel so in total it was a pretty pricey stay but we had a good time."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay! I do recommend.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Always a pleasure to stay here. So trendy, classy, fun, and comfortable."
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"A nice place right in Chinatown and the theater district. The rooms are definitely on the small side, and storing lots of luggage is not really possible in the room since it doesn’t even have a closet, but it’s a great place for a weekend getaway if you’re traveling light. Overnight parking was an additional $40 at the Tufts Medical Center garage right down the block. The Boston common is a block away, and the Wang, Wilbur, and Boch Center Shubert theatres are all around the corner, so it would be a great place if you’re in town for a show. They also give you a $25 coupon to spend at their hotel bar, which is a nice touch. Room was clean and tidy, with an exposed concrete ceiling, and pegs on the walls to hang bags. The concrete walls and ceiling made the stay quiet, we didn’t hear any noise at all from the hotel, only the occasional honking of a horn from the street. Overall a great location and a good value, but if you don’t mind the smaller size, I would recommend the Moxy and would stay here again."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was great, had everything we needed. Really hope to come back again soon!"

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great modern place with stylish design. Small space but has everything you need. They give out two drinks and a $25 coupon for both food and drinks. Close to everything. The only complaint is if you are on a lower floor it is very noisy.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location
2022-03-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,This bnb location is wonderful if you are looking to experience the Boston nightlife. Honestly it was a bit overpriced for the size and it wasn’t as clean as I would have expected. Very much a college feel to this hotel. It’s generally in a good spot and had a pretty nice view over the city.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a funky hotel in a great location and the view from the 18th floor was amazing.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a pleasure to stay at Deborah's place for a few nights while visiting Cambridge/Boston. Her home was clean, comforting, and had a lot of character! The location is very walkable with lots of greats shops and restaurants closeby. It is also close to the Boston Blue Bikes system, which we used quite a bit.

There are grocery stores, restaurants, and a couple of breweries all within walking distance. I would definitely stay here again should I come back to Boston."

She offered us breakfast food and also left some chocolate treats for us. She went beyond and a couple of times shared her dinner food with us.
The neighbor is calm and quiet, but close to the metro that takes you downtown.
I traveled with my teenage daughter and she already misses Deborah.
I’ve been in a few Airbnbs and so far this is number 1."

The space was very clean and there were good amenities available to us—Deborah even went the extra mile and shared food with us. She provided maps and local guides to help us find things to do in Boston. The location of the Airbnb is right next to Harvard, so it was quiet and very beautiful. It’s about 0.5-0.7 miles to walk to the MBTA and being so close to Massachusetts avenue made delicious food easily accessible.
Should we find ourselves coming back to Boston, I would not hesitate to book with Deborah again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very good welcome from our host who agreed to receive us with our baby …
Kind, mindful of our well-being. Welcoming, available, very friendly touches (small chocolates, fruit, brioche).

The accommodation is super well close to Harvard on foot (10 min) and the subway to go to boston which is really convenient …
The environment is quiet and very friendly...
We recommend …
Thanks again"

All in all, it was a great stay and we can totally recommend this accommodation!"

I am so happy that I have found this place. We wish you, Deborah, the best of luck and hope to see you again!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Deborah's accommodation is located in a very quiet neighborhood within easy reach, close to Harvard Subway Station.

The location is great, walking distance to Harvard, restaurants, supermarkets and the train which will take you downtown. Highly recommend this air bnb if you are visiting Boston!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Deborah is a lovely host. She is super friendly and helpful. Her house is moreover ideally located, particularly for researchers and scholars who need to be at Harvard University. Her house is just a 10-15 minutes walk away from most Harvard University facilities that I had to visit during my stay in Cambridge. The room has a comfortable bed and a nice desk which I found very useful. The room is also very quiet. Also her bathroom is perfect, and has a nice hot shower. Her kitchen is well-equipped and was just perfect for me. Deborah has moreover fresh fruit most mornings and a great selection of tea's that you're allowed to use. I would certainly stay at here place again next time I visit Cambridge!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Deborah’s place was amazing! It was very homely and all the amenities we would need.
The bed was really comfortable, and the room very well lit up. The bathroom was reasonably big and right next to the bedroom. The kitchen was very well stocked and open to use. It had everything one could need, including bread, eggs, milk and juice.
The location is fabulous too, just under 10 min away from the metro and 5 min away from restaurants and the super market.
Deborah is a lovely host. She really cares about her guests and had helpful little tips. She made sure the kitchen was well stocked and even got us cocoa since she didnt have it and we asked about it.
She is very accommodating of requests and communicates about when she might have family over.
Overall, an amazing experience. Would definitely stay here again if possible."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Deborah is a friendly, generous, and accommodating host, and her place is on nice quiet street in Cambridge. If you're looking for a room with a (mostly) private bathroom and access to a fully equipped kitchen, you can't do better!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at Deborah’s during a visit to Walden Pond, the galleries around Harvard, and excursions along the Boston and Quincy waterfronts… oh, and a phenomenal Sunday afternoon Red Sox game! Her space is situated on an arts and community street. The whole space was a happy one for just pondering, reading, sipping tea and resting"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The layout of Deborah’s home is ideal for guests. The bath and kitchen are next to the guest room. Although it says the bath is ‘shared’, that is only if she has guests over for lunch or dinner. Deborah’s room and bathroom are on the third level. We felt very welcomed and right at home there."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,place was good to stay for a few days

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This spot was perfect for what I was looking for; great access to public transit on a nice, quiet street. Bed was quite comfy as well! Would absolutely stay here again on a return visit to Boston."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Deborah’s place is a great base for exploring Cambridge and Boston. A lovely, quiet neighbourhood with easy access to the subway. A spacious and cosy room, private bathroom and welcoming host make this a great place to stay."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I ended up only staying at Deborah’s place for one of the three nights I had booked. During my stay, I noticed that there were tiny ants all over the bathroom and the bedroom that I was staying in. I left early and went to a friend’s apartment and reported the issue to Airbnb. While this was concerning, I’m giving Deborah a 5 star review because of how she handled the situation. She responded to my claim with Airbnb very quickly and was gracious, apologetic, and accepted my refund request with no issues. It seems she wasn’t made aware of the situation previously, and was just as concerned as I was. Besides the ants, the listing is in a great location and it’s very convenient to get around. It’s very walkable and Porter Square T station is only about 11 minutes away if you want to head into downtown, and Ubers aren’t too expensive from there either."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Deborah is a wonderful host, and I highly recommend her place. I was in Boston for two weeks for a research trip, and her house was exactly what I needed. She lives in the house and rents out her guest room, so you have more privacy and quiet than you would in a larger Airbnb that hosts more guests -- bathroom all to yourself, and ready use of kitchen and public spaces in the house. The bedroom is spacious and well-lit, with plenty of extra blankets and pillows (and towels), a workspace, plenty of storage, and bookshelves full of good reading material. I like to cook for myself most of the time when I'm on longer research trips; Deborah's kitchen has all of the utensils and equipment you might need, and she offers to share cooking staples, as well as providing tea, coffee, and breakfast food. The location worked perfectly: a quiet street about a 12-15 walk from both Harvard Square and Porter Square, and a few short blocks to the grocery store and laundromat. And finally, Deborah is a lovely person; she enjoys chatting with her guests and getting to know them, but she is never intrusive. If I'm planning an extended stay in Boston in the future, I will absolutely try to book her place."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Deborah is a fantastic hostess and I can't recommend staying with her enough. She was extremely welcoming and helpful.
The location is fantastic if the trip has anything to do with Harvard."

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Deborah's home is centrally located, very cozy, clean, and comfortable, with everything you need. It was a perfect place for my research stay. Deborah was communicative and check-in/out was easy. Overall a great experience."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There is something special about this Airbnb. My partner and I immediately felt comfortable and welcome here because Deborah greeted us when we arrived and showed us around her kitchen, making sure we knew that we were encouraged to have juice, toast, granola, and so on. I've never actually felt comfortable eating host's food at an Airbnb until coming here.
Deborah is a pleasant host. She is enjoyable to talk to, but not forceful about conversation (I've had that with hosts at other Airbnbs!). She even shared her umbrellas with us when rain came on the forecast.
Check in was easy. Very residential, quiet street. The Airbnb is walking distance to all things Harvard and a quick walk to the Red Line, making all of Boston accessible.
I appreciated being able to control the temperature of the bedroom. The duvets on the bed are cozy. The room and bathroom are comfortable.
All in all, a great stay. I'd be happy to come back here again. The Airbnb quickly felt like home."

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super host is not enough to describe Deborah! She replied to my calls immediately and was extremely helpful. It is evident that Deborah truly enjoys hosting visitors!
She gladly shares with visitors her homey, cozy and well equipped kitchen and
many of the contents of the refrigerator for breakfast, as well as fresh fruit , teas and coffee.
Deborah is delightful to chat with as much or as little as you care too. She is quite knowledgable about the area, among other topics.
Her home is immaculately clean and follows strict covid protocols.
It is an older house in a well established neighborhood on a quiet street and close to Harvard University.
I cannot praise my experience highly enough and I look forward to returning the next time I am in Boston!
Especially if you are a visitor to USA consider Deborah's place for a warm welcome and lovely cultural exchange experience!"

2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Deborah's place was fantastic!! I unfortunately got into Boston very late and had a longer-than-expected Lyft ride to her home, so I was not in the best of moods when I arrived. But she was very friendly and accommodating. I was able to have a room and bathroom to myself (both of which were exceptionally clean--and very cute!). The room came with a portable heater, which helped a lot given that it was a cold night. Deborah also offered me fresh fruit and tea, and let me access anything in the fridge and kitchen. Her place is lovely and I would definitely stay again if I visit another time. My only regret is that I didn't have more time to talk to her--she's such a cool lady and an awesome host to top it off!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time we have stayed with Deborah while visiting our daughter. Deborah is fast at responding and a great hostess, we would stay here every time we are in Boston If she wasn't always booked!"

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Me and my girlfriend had a great 4 night stay at Deborah's place. Her real American house, located in a quiet street and neighborhood close to Harvard, is clean, well maintained, nicely furnished and equipped with every comfort. The bedroom, bathroom (which by the way only we used) and all the other common areas also fit in that picture.
Deborah is rightfully a superhost: friendly and helpful. She lives on the same floor as us and uses the same kitchen, but for us it felt like we had a lot of privacy. However, if you need anything or want to know, Deborah will be ready for you right away.
Nice to note is that Deborah does shopping which you can use during breakfast: fresh fruit, cottage cheese, juice, eggs and very, lots of types of tea.
As for the location, it's a 10 minute walk to Harvard Square and about 20-30 minutes to downtown Boston by public transportation.
Nothing more than praise for this Airbnb, it is highly recommended and we would love to come back here!"

Deborah is really a great host, welcoming us warmly and giving us tips and maps both of Cambridge and Boston. We had all our space when needed and we talk when desired. The house is really nice. Deborah provided us with a lot of food to prepare our breakfast. I would definitely raccomend it :)"

This is airbnb as it is intended; you step into the household of the host you receive with all the hospitality. Everything is clean, you can use everything from the well-stocked fridge.

I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else after this experience. Thank you Deborah!"

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a cute homey spot! It honestly was even nicer in person, notably pics have wall to wall carpet but the unit is now floored which is even better for me from an allergy perspective! The place was absolutely spotless, super clean, homey, comfortable bed and crisp sheets. Bathroom was well stocked as well. I spent the night for a conference near MGH and it was a perfect location as well. I was a solo female traveler and felt safe walking back late at night and sleeping alone. 10/10 would come back in a heartbeat!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect apartment in Beacon Hill. Walkable to city center but still feels quiet and private at night. Would recommend to others and stay here again.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A rental as described in the presentation, with all the expected comfort and, perhaps, a slightly outdated touch in a very small building which is no less so.…….
An exceptional location, a small apartment halfway between Cambridge Street & Beacon Street, on the top of Beacon Hill, halfway from Bowdoin and Parker Street stations (Blue, Green & Red Lines). These can take you, for cheap ($22 for 7 days with the ‘famous’ Charlie card), practically anywhere in Boston and its surrounding areas.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our host was very kind and easy to communicate with. The studio could use some minor renovations. The outlet in the bathroom didn’t work. Advertised a full size refrigerator, there was not one as well as a washer/dryer. The studio had a lot of character and charm but could use some minor updates for a better stay."

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome location! You can easily walk to everything from Fenway to the waterfront. The hosts were super responsive. The room itself was very clean but a bit worn. It's the perfect spot if you're looking for a home base and a spot to sleep.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This location was top notch! On the north end, walkable to the freedom trail, little Italy, and TD Gardens. The kitchenette was more than I was expecting which was an added bonus. Plenty of room for suitcases (including under the bed), had access to extra bathroom supplies and cleaning supplies as necessary. Check in instructions were thorough and easy to understand. It comfortably accommodated two guests with 4 suitcases. I will definitely be booking this place the next time I’m in Boston!"

just not a lot of hot water."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I came with my fiancé and friend for a concert. It was a great little place to spend the night. We walked to a restaurant for breakfast and overall had a great time. We found parking through an app called SpotHero and saved money!
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great and central location! One note is that WiFi was weak so we typically had to go to a coffee shop for work calls. We were eager to explore Boston so that was okay for us but I wanted to make sure you're able to plan accordingly too!

2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay
2023-11-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location is fantastic! Very close to Boston Common and everything downtown. I walked everywhere (Newbury St., Convention Center, North End, etc.) The apartment is fairly spacious but not at all how it looks in the picture. It's very dingy. Also, despite the closets having extra soaps and supplies, the dispensers were filled up with only a tiny amount. These were minor issues but made it seem like I was staying in a crappy motel, not a spacious apartment in Beacon Hill."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home on a beautiful street. Very convenient check-in and great amenities.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I stayed here because we had tickets to a show at TD Garden and wanted to stay the night. It was walking distance to a great breakfast spot, wonderful dinners places, and the garden! Thank you!"

2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The hosts were super responsive. They allowed us to store our luggage the day we arrived early in the morning, and also for several hours after check out. This is a GREAT location walkable to so many spots. We had about 36 hours in Boston and this was the perfect place to spend it!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect place to stay in the heart of Boston. While the neighborhood is quaint quiet it’s just minutes away from Boston Common filled with city life.
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great location, nice neighborhood!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Would definitely recommend this place for any Boston adventures—so close to everything you could want or need. The space was clean and the bed was very comfortable.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,lovely apartment in a beautiful area of Boston. Just a short walk from Boston Common and the State Building. Very quiet and extremely comfortable. The location may not be ideal for people with mobility issues because Beacon Hill is unsurprisingly hilly and some of the sidewalks aren't in the best order.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect location and host was very responsive.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was such a cute place located right in the heart of Beacon Hill! The host responded within 30 minutes of any questions that we had. The apartment was clean, cute, and in great condition."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This unit is in a great neighborhood, exactly what you think of when you think ""Boston"". The unit is actually more spacious than the pictures would imply, plenty of room for a couple. The only downside to the location is parking, we parked in a garage about 0.7 miles away and it was a decent walk with some uphill with luggage. Nothing too crazy though. We definitely felt at home and had everything we needed during our stay."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is in the best location and we did a lot of walking, and really loved the peaceful neighborhood atmosphere in the Beacon Hill area! Great restaurant options in walking distance and we enjoyed Ma Maison for dinner and Cobblestones Eatery for breakfast! We also loved the close proximity to the Public Gardens and we parked our car in the Central Plaza parking garage which was an 8 minute walk to this place. The studio itself was comfortable and well laid out. We are already planning to come back in May!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely and very central apartment, much better than a hotel. Big room with huge comfy bed and big bathroom. Beautiful old building. Lots of touches (nice bathroom toiletries, plenty of coffee pods and tea) and very nicely done. Be aware there are a number of units one on each floor so may not match photos. Great location. We parked in Boston common underground garage (very safe and secure and well lit) that was $38 for 32 hours, a ten minute walk."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The room was in a great location, about 15 minutes from South Station and Charles Street only a few minutes' walk, with lots of bars, restaurants and shops. The room was well-equipped and comfortable. The street at night was extremely quiet. Overall, a great experience and perfect for a short stay in Boston."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Close to a stop for the Trolley hop on off bus.
Pubs and conveient store closeby.. Quiet area."

2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect location was at the Boston Garden for a concert, and it was a 10 min walk. It’s a very simple studio, and fit my need for a place to sleep."
2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Would suggest towel bars in bath and dish towels in kitchen.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Straight and to the point. Huanan was responsive and helpful
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay, perfect location"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I really enjoyed our trip to Boston. Huanan’s place is in a perfect spot in the Beacon Hill neighborhood and is comfortable and private. Definitely felt like we got an authentic Boston experience from our trip.

Walkable to many iconic Boston sites. Adorable neighborhood."

Appreciated the help booking a taxi to the airport."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Location was outstanding, so close to Boston Common and Freedom Trail and great restaurants. Yet it was a very Quiet neighborhood. Bed was super comfortable and the air conditioning was great. All amenities were there. Huanan was super responsive. Definitely would stay again, hopefully more than one night next time."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,N/a
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"A cute and clean place in a beautiful, quaint part of the city with everything you could need and within easy walking distance to everything you could want. Parking and getting your luggage to and from the room can be a bit challenging as the street is very narrow with one side designated for parking which we found to typically be full, therefore I would suggest when booking your stay here you research parking options before you arrive. Overall I would give this stay a great rating and would definitely recommend."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great location. Home was clean but worn. You could tell it was a rental. Bed was comfortable. Bathroom sink was clogged and drained slowly. Carrying suitcases up three flights of stairs was a challenge. The walk up the hill to the condo was strenuous and streets were uneven. It would be a challenge for seniors. Value was good given proximity to many attractions, restaurants and bars but I was expecting more based on the pictures."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed in Boston for a week and really enjoyed calling Huanan's studio apartment our home. The location couldn't be any better right on Beacon Hill. We walked everywhere we wanted to go. The places that were too far for walking we used the subway which has a stop at Boston Commons and is just around the corner from the apartment. There is a shared patio on the back side of the building that we enjoyed on several occasions.
The bed was comfortable and the linens were clean. There is a portable air conditioner which helped keep us cool during the summer heat wave. The bathroom was roomy and clean.
Huanan offers free luggage storage in the building's basement in case you have an early arrival or late departure. We took advantage of this and felt that our bags were in a safe space.
Overall, I would definitely recommend staying here."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This beautifully decorated & well-appointed apartment is located in one of the most lovely and historically iconic places in ""old"" Boston, Beacon Hill. Conveniently close to almost every amazing historical site in Boston. There are a couple of BUTS, though, that may matter for some: there is absolutely NO nearby parking. You may even have to double-park and temporarily block a very narrow one-way street to unload luggage at the location. And it's a 3rd floor walk-up. We parked in the Boston Common parking garage (park nearest the ""State"" or State House exit!). It is a not-less-than 10-minute walk (for me at age 78, more like 15 or 20). From check-in at 6 p.m. Friday until check-out at 4:45 a.m. Monday, parking cost $68. It's a 10-15 minute walk to the nearest transit points at Park Place station or Arlington Street station. We did a LOT of walking. All of that said, though (now that we fully know what to expect) we absolutely WOULD stay here again during a future Boston visit!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"the location of Huanan 's apartment is unbeatable! right in the middle of Beacon Hill, at walking distance of everything! the appartment is just beautiful! We'll deffinitely come back! thank you!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,what a beautiful spot in Beacon Hill. The studio apartment was exactly as described. It was uncharacteristically hot during our time in Boston and it was an older building we were in. Our host made sure there was a portable air conditioner in there and it was comfortable. We were centrally located to everything we wanted to do and Beacon Hill is absolutely stunning. Would stay again in a heartbeat!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fabulous apt in a central location! This had every amenity we could have needed along with a super comfortable bed.
Huanan left suggestions for restaurants and great places to visit, which we took advantage of— including not to miss Florina Pizzeria. She also was able to arrange a bit later checkout, which was so helpful before departing on an international flight.
This spot is a hidden gem in a beautiful neighborhood, and we can’t wait to visit again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Airbnb is in the heart of historic Beacon Hill within walking distance from wonderful shops and restaurants. Conveniently, there's a market around the corner as well. The apartment was equipped with amenities like air conditioning and fan, humidifier, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, hand soap, and the softest towels. We didn't use the kitchen amenities but if you'd rather cook, you'll have what you need in pans, utensils, dishes, etc. as well as a microwave. The bed was a comfort especially after lots of walking. The neighborhood was friendly and peaceful. Huanan was responsive and all communication was clear and detailed. Thank you again, Huanan, for a lovely stay in Boston."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay here and would recommend it to anyone. Coffee, restaurants, and bars are all in walking distance. The space was charming, comfortable, and quiet. We would definitely stay at Huanan’s place again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This space was great for our stay in Boston. Great location near restaurants and parking was not bad for a major city. Parking at Boston Commons was cheap and about a 5 minute walk away. Overall a great place to stay with a comfortable bed!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was perfect for the 2 of us. The location was within easy walking distance of several things. She even provided a binder with instructions and recommendations. It was the perfect place to stay!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location in lovely Beacon Hill of Boston, just blocks from the Boston Commons. We took the Blue Line from the airport on a red eye, Huanan let us drop off our luggage early so we could begin exploring the city. The apartment was perfect for just the two of us and the location cannot be beat."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved staying at Huanan’s place! From beginning to end she was extremely responsive and helpful. When we encountered an issue, it was resolved almost immediately. The place was exactly as described and within walking distance to Boston Common and the T which made exploring the city easy! I highly recommend staying here!!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved the place and a fantastic location. So close to the Boston Commons. Would definitely stay there again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay here in Boston. We were able to park on the street and unpack then park in a deck close by. It was easy to get into and Huanan was very responsive. We were super close to Boston Commons, Back Bay, and the Esplanade which was great. The room is perfect for a couple night stay!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, quiet, leafy cobbled street location right in the heart of Boston and close to the Common and business district. Chose it because fed up with stale business hotel rooms and price is better than hotels. Entrance hall and stairs a bit grubby but then apartment full of character - great furnishings, comfortable bed, kitchen, shower/bath. I tend to prefer uber modern but was taken by the character of this place - will use it again. 2 minutes walk to the Common. 20 minutes walk through the common to the business district and all the best stores."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Listing was as described. Great location. Would stay again!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and easy, walkable distance to lots of fun in Boston."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beacon Hill is a beautiful Boston neighborhood. There is no better. Since Boston is very easy to visit by foot, the central location is also nice. Huanan's apartment has everything you're looking for at such a city trip. Almost all amenities are there. WiFi is not great (especially for Europeans spoiled in that area). But that's also the only thing."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Huanan's place was great! My wife and I really enjoyed and the check in process was very smooth with everything we needed. Would definitely stay there again if we visit Boston again!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is located in beautiful Beacon Hill and is a great spot as a home base for exploring Boston. We walked everywhere and there were lovely shops and restaurants nearby. We really appreciated the beauty of the location and how convenient it was to get around. The apartment had everything we needed and a comfortable bed. Considering how expensive Boston is, the apartment was great value for the money. We would stay here again and had a wonderful time!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic location, can’t beat it. Walkable to anything you need to do. The neighborhood is beautiful and highly recommend to others."
2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic location - on a quiet street and walkable with good access to public transit. Very thin walls, could hear neighbours at night. Wifi did not work 90% of the time and when it did work it was very slow. Strong smell of garbage in the apartment initially at check in. Mainly paying for the location here."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was in a great location! We were able to walk or catch the T and get everywhere we wanted to visit- all without a car. Beds were comfy and we slept well! Thank you!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything is exactly as listed in the description/pictures. Awesome location close to the T, parks and plenty of bars/restaurants (including Cheers if that’s on your list!). We had a great time!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The apartment was just as described. Very comfortable, everything you need for cooking. It is well laid out for a studio and the street is very quiet and beautiful. There are so many things within easy walking distance — Boston Common, tons of history, tons of shopping and great restaurants."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great visit and comfy place to stay! Highly recommend.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and just enough space for the two of us. Had a great time.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Stayed here for 1 night before flying out the next day, and it was great. It's on a beautiful historic street in the heart of Beacon Hill. Very peaceful and surrounding neighborhood filled with historic homes and great shops and restaurants. The apartment was very clean and was as expected. The host was easy to communicate with and worked with us to allow us to store our bags inside prior to check-in. I would stay there again, the next time we are in Boston!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place and great location!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location is amazing for sightseeing and walk ability. Beacon Hill neighbourhood is historic and quiet. The unit is compact, bed is comfortable. It was clean and well maintained. The building is very old, floors are uneven but it suited us very well during our stay."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beacon Hill is such and beautiful area! The studio apartment is so accessible to restaurants, shopping on Charles St, the Commons and the “T”.
Would definitely choose this location again and again!
Our host was very responsive and helpful!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed 4 nights at this studio in Beacon Hill.
Pros: Excellent Location, centrally located to all. Walk to Boston Public Garden and Boston Common in 5-7 minutes. The North End/Little Italy 15-20 minutes, Downtown & Quincy Market 10 minutes.
The studio is perfect for a multi-night stay. It has everything you may need. Kitchenette with pots, pans,utensils, dishes, microwave, etc. The bathroom had shampoo, conditioner, bodywash, full-length mirror, and small, cushioned stool to sit on while doing hair/makeup.
Comfortable bed, gorgeous view.
Cons: Studio smelled like cigarettes on arrival. I opened the windows, and the smell was gone. I let the host know, and she was responsive and helpful.
People upstairs walked loudly and slammed doors. Not sure if they were tenants or Airbnb guests.
**If you have limited mobility, this is not the place for you. 3 flights of steep stairs in a neighborhood of brick and cobblestone sidewalks and streets.**
We will definitely stay here again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My partner and I loved Huanan’s accommodations. Absolutely perfect location to explore all that Boston has to offer. We will definitely be back!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic location! Walking distance to so many sights. The unit is on the 3rd floor, with stairs into private studio apartment. This is an old building, so sometimes you could hear other units above or below but it was minimal.
The bed and linens are super comfortable. Lots of hot water.
Huanan was available, but we didn't see her, all the instructions were clear and there were lots of recommendations in a binder. I was pleased with the extras ( quality shampoo & conditioner, hairdryer, straightener, extra towels, blankets, coffee pods, tea).
The kitchen is minimal, but has what is needed
We would stay here again in a heart beat."

2023-03-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed in multiple airbnbs across the world and I have never left a 3 star review for anyone, but felt this one was needed. My chief complaint is that the place was dirty. We walked into the building and were immediately struck with a horrible smell of fish and onions that remained throughout our stay. The stairs looked like they hadn’t been vacuumed in months- if ever. The dirtiness proceeded up to our place on the 3rd floor. We arrived in our suite, and there were muddy foot prints on the bathroom floor. This floor also looked like it had never been mopped and there was sticky residue on the floor. The corners of the bathroom had black gunk in them. We look in the shower and there was loose hair all over the shower wall and a discolored shower mat stuck to the floor. The sponge on the sink was soured and had been used too long. I had to hunt for a new one. While the location was great and the bed comfortable, it wasn’t worth the money and overall was NOT a good experience."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was great.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our stay
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This apartment is tiny but very functional and comfortable for three. I found the bed to be extremely comfortable - firm but with a soft top, and the full-sized pull-out couch was about the most comfortable couch I've ever slept on (keeping in mind that I like a firm mattress). The kitchen was small but functional - don't plan to cook a 4-course meal there, but you'll be able to do breakfast and a simple dinner just fine. The bathroom was nicely spacious - my girls loved the ""dressing area"" with a large full-length mirror. The only problems I had were (1) I could not find any sheets for the couch, but I also did not try to contact the host about it since I was only there for one night. If you plan to use the couch as a bed, you want to check in about bedding before you arrive. And (2) parking was a bear. The street is adorable and old, but very narrow with no parking. We had to block the street to unload, and then I had to go pretty far to find parking."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay for a couple nights. Location is great, walkable distance for a lot of bar/restaurants, small
Shops and more.
Get ready to walk a little bit from the parking garage, but overall great place."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely Airbnb in a great location. The host was prompt and helpful. A great experience overall!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location - easy access to building. The loft is as pictured and described. Easy and affordable to see Boston when you won’t be in the room that often. Would stay again
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice little spot in Beacon Hill. Great walking to everything.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great location, close to everything, Huanan was very responsive and always on hand to help. we definitely recommend"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, Central to everything will stay here again"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Huanan’s space is quaint efficiency (or studio) in Beacon Hill. Great supply of coffee for a tired traveler was in the space. It is located very close to quite a few eating options and bars in the neighborhood. The neighborhood is very quiet. The bed was very comfortable and we truly enjoyed our stay!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved the space and location. Would definitely rent again if in the area!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great historic location in Boston!
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Good deal
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying in this apartment. It felt very cozy and safe, and the surrounding Beacon Hill neighborhood is quiet. Hunan was helpful in giving parking instructions and giving us information days ahead of our arrival. The space itself was clean, well taken care of, and everything was easy to use. We are hoping to come back in the future!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The room is on the third floor, up a narrow set of stairs, and on a street you likely won’t be able to park on, so prepare for how you’ll unload your car. However, with a second person to bring up bags, parking in the Boston Commons garage was extremely easy, and it was a very short walk back to the apartment.
The room is small, but has everything necessary for a comfortable stay. We stayed for the proximity to the hospital, and we’re happily surprised by how close we were to so many shops and restaurants. Huanan was quick to respond to my questions, and I’d rent this room again."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice, clean apartment with great amenities. Great location in downtown Boston, close to everything and accessible to public transportation."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Huanan's place was in a lovely and convenient area. It was clean and was comfortable for two people – the bathroom was especially spacious. Huanan was extremely responsive, sometimes replying within seconds, which we were grateful for."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay in Beacon Hill! The location was perfect and the space was very nice and cozy. Parking was a bit of an issue, but otherwise we were very happy and would definitely stay here again. Thank you!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A quiet place in a great location.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a great example of a perfect air bnb! There was everything you could possibly need (first aid kit, extra toiletries, extra linens) as well as a fully functional small kitchen. Although we only stayed for a single night, this is a great Air BnB for someone staying several nights and is looking for a home away from home."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely and cozy home. It was perfect for a quick solo trip. Easily accessible to the train. I would definitely come back!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Huanan's place is extremely well located! there are tons of restaurants and places to visit near by. She was also very quick to respond and offered clear instructions
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Exactly as advertised, perfect for my one night stay in Beacon Hills. 5 minute walk through quaint cobbled streets to many shops and restaurants. One of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. Studio style with a small kitchen sink and private bathroom. 10/10 worth the price."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,An amazing listing and host :) She was so responsive and clear about instructions for checking in. 10/10 experience!

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Perfect size. I'd happily stay here again when in Boston!
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location is so spot on! We were in walkable distance to the main sites. The place was great for our 3 night stay. It’s also a very safe area. CVS, Whole Foods, and Target within several blocks of the apartment. Bed was also super comfortable. It is on the smaller side, which is to be expected in a small and old city. Just right for two ppl, maybe tight with a child. Note that there is no elevator and the apartment is on the 3rd floor and the stairway is very narrow. It’s also a bit more dated and kitchenette is very small. Probably not fit for anything other than heating leftovers or boiling hot water. Huanan was very easy to communicate with and Ken was quick to bring us additional supplies. Would definitely stay again if in the Boston area."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location we walked to everything we wanted to do. The area is safe and quiet. The air bnb is spacious for a studio. Bathroom was large. Building was very quiet. Enjoyed our stay!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Huanan's place was lovely. Ken was most helpful. Perfect location.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Located a couple of blocks from the Massachusetts state house. It puts you within easy walking distance of the freedom trail and only 15 minutes from the north end. Would book this again.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, convenient check in and out, and has everything you need!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location and value. A quick hike up Beacon hill and centrally located to a ton of downtown Boston. Would return!

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location and great communication, thank you!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Worked great for a overnight stay in Boston.
Place was clean, fully stocked kitchenette with small oven/fridge/coffee maker. (note: no microwave)
Bed comfortable with lots of pillows and blankets.
Note: All spots are permit parking along streets. However there is a parking structure at the park (Name: Boston Common Parking) which is about 0.3mile walk. There is a subway stop close by.
Communication was super quick.
Overall, I would definitely recommend this spot!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This property was perfect for our stay.
Beacon Hill is in the centre of everything, we walked everywhere.
Huanan answered all of our questions promptly and the information made our stay awesome."
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Easy access, very clean, great location."
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The location is beautiful in Beacon Hill. its about a 10 minute walk to the park. The room is up a 3 floor walk up. It was very clean and was great for our 1 might stay. The issue was parking. There is no parking on this street and the cosest parking garage is about a 5 minute drive into the city. we had to drop our luggage off, had my husband park the car and walk back to the apartment. That's the only downfall of the location."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute house, cute neighbourhood. Communication was great. Everything was like the picture.
Would stay here again."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Huanan’s apartment in Beacon Hill was just perfect. It was equipped with everything we needed and the location was close to everything. We really hated to leave.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a great location in the heart of Boston, in a beautiful neighborhood close to transit and in walking distance of so many great stops. Super neat old building, too!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay in Boston!! It’s just a studio so it is a very small space but it’s perfect for a quick weekend trip for 2 people! we loved it here, amazing area in Beacon Hill, super close to Boston common. It was also super affordable compared to most airbnbs in the area since it’s such a nice neighborhood! I highly recommend staying here!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great apartment in the perfect location for seeing Boston's main sights . The hosts were very kind and considerate and I would highly recommend staying with them.
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Cute little apartment in a beautiful, historic neighborhood.
The apartment would be good for more a 1 night stay. (Unfortunately, time only allowed for us to stay 1 night.) The closest overnight public parking is over 0.5 miles away & $30 per day was the cheapest we found. The apartment’s bathroom had no ventilation other than a window- it was HOT. The air conditioner unit in the bedroom wouldn’t go below 77, so it was a bit warmer than our liking. Not unbearable, we just prefer to sleep in cooler temperatures.
The hosts both communicated quickly."
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"“Perfectly” located, very central in a quiet street. Very well equipped. Beautiful surroundings. One can feel really Welle at esse. Communication impeccable. So everything you could wish for."
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location.
Well-maintained apartment.
The only ""problem"" for those with a stroller is the lack of an elevator. Otherwise everything is perfect. Congratulations to your host."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute apartment in a very beautiful neighborhood. Walking distance to much of what Boston has to offer. Street parking is basically impossible so be ready to pay a pretty penny for garage parking!
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and Value. Outdated building compared to others in the area.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bed was very comfy, great stay for a weekend trip, fantastic location, and peaceful, quiet neighborhood"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Huanan’s studio is in a great location. It is right near everything you’d want in Boston. You do have to park in the Commons Parking Garage if you’re driving but it’s a close walk and convenient.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is located in a beautiful part of Boston within walking distance to many different places. The unit itself is very clean and super cute. Absolutely loved every minute of our stay.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful time we had in Boston staying at Michael's place. The location in Back Bay is perfect... easy walking distance to 2 train stations, grocery stores and restaurants. The place is exactly as pictured. Everything you need to cook your own meals and the bed is very comfy. Michael was very helpful with any questions we had. Overall just a great Airbnb experience."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Michael's place is absolutely beautiful! I had a wonderful stay and in to return in future visits to Boston.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved my stay at Michael's place. The place is so beautiful, even nicer than the pictures really. But the best really is the neighborhood, it is such a lovely area, walkable, beautiful street, amazing coffee shops around the corner. I couldn't recommend the place more to anyone looking for a space. I really hope I get a chance to stay there again. Michael was so responsive to any requests I made, he helped me with storing my luggage there and granted a later check out, which really made my day. I had the best experience at Michael's place!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice location and space

Space for your clothes and everything. I will definitely stay here again when visiting Boston in the future! Area was walkable to almost everything you need!"
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Michael’s place was spotless with all the necessary touches to make our stay seamless. and comfortable. The location is close to many options for food and drink, and quite walkable. We were very impressed with how quiet it was, and the blackout shades and comfortable bed meant we slept very soundly. Michael reached out during our stay to make sure all was well and that we didn’t need anything. Would definitely book again!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Michael was a great host. Super responsive and accommodating. The condo was spotless and just as described. The location is walkable to everything in the South End and downtown Boston.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I needed a place for the weekend to do some business planning away from my home and Michael's apartment fit the bill. Lots of natural light. Lots of space. Well kept and in a great location off Tremont Street which has a ton of restaurants to choose from within a 5 to 20 min walk.
The best part, it didn't feel like an Air BnB -- it felt like I was staying at a friend's home who was out of town!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super cute apartment in a wonderful, quiet neighborhood."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I love this airBNB. It’s super cute and spacious. Captures the brownstone charm of Boston. Well cared for home. You feel at home and the owner makes it easy for you to feel at home. Best experience ever. Hope to stay here whenever I’m in Boston.
You won’t be disappointed staying here,"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough nice things about Michael and the condo. Upon my entry, I noticed that the place is EXACTLY as pictured. It is pristine with plenty of linens and towels, all kitchen, laundry and bathroom needs. The views are beautiful and I felt safe walking alone through the neighborhood. It's a shame that others have led Michael to have to close the rooftop access because the view looks amazing from what I could see. Michael was proactive and lightning fast with responses to my questions. He checked in on me to see how things were going. He has a nice guestbook with restaurants and other areas of interest. Overall I give him my highest rating. This is the best Airbnb I've stayed in - NO false advertising here! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great place to stay in Boston! It’s very spacious, definitely great for 2 people. The bed is comfy and big, everything is clean, and it does feel like home. The neighborhood is amazing as well - walking distance to the main attractions, safe and quite.
A separate and special thank you to the host! He was very responsive, very helpful and friendly.
One of the best AirBnb experiences for me so far. 10/10!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very pretty and peaceful location, seemed upmarket and some good bars and breakfast places nearby. Also a handy 7/11 a couple of minutes away. The locals seemed nice chilled people. We felt very at home here."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This by far the best AirBNB that I stayed in in Boston. Large, open and convenient. The stairs up may not be for some but for me they were a great workout."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Apartment was exactly like pics and description. Michael was fantastic! He went above and beyond what was expected, especially for one request where it wasnt necessary, nor even expected. One of the best AirBnB experiences i have ever had.
Thank you, Michael!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for such a great stay at this beautiful brownstone! We enjoyed our stay, the airbnb was clean and right in the heart of Boston.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a great stay at Michael's place! In a quiet neighborhood within walking distance of restaurants and public transit, allowing us to get anywhere we wanted quickly.

Overall no complaints and we would gladly stay here again in the future."

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,My daughter (age 14) and I stayed in a Michael’s condo in the South End in July. It’s in a great location and Michael was very communicative and easy to work with. You should know the condo is up to pretty narrow flights of stairs so plan accordingly if you have luggage. Mine was large which was a little tricky. Other than that everything was very nice. The neighborhood is perfect for exploring the city!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ideal location for a no-kids get-away for my husband and me! Michael's description about his place being his home and not a hotel was spot-on and we appreciated the personal feel (and amazingly equipped kitchen!). We had no issues though we did wonder how Boston residents manage the steep walk-up steps in the winter and the uneven pavement when it gets icy (we're from Toronto so we think about these things!). We would return in a heartbeat. Thank you for sharing your home, Michael!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Michael’s place was perfect for our family. The location was walking distance to restaurants and very kid friendly. Quiet building and very comfy bed. Loved the art from around the world.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Michael's place is definitely a gem, with all of the amenities you need. It felt like I was staying at my best friend house - it felt like home. Would definitely recommended to our fellow LGBTQ community as it felt safe with tons to do around the area. Thanks Michael!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Michael’s place was an ideal home base for exploring Boston for a few days.

Exactly as described.
Beautiful, clean and had everything we needed for our stay.
Thank you Michael!!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely time, Michael was very accomodating"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Terrific AirBnB, great location.
One of the very best AirBnBs I've stayed at. Exactly as described in the listing. Bright and airy apartment, very well taken care of. Very clean. Good living room. Comfortable couch. Large and usable kitchen. Comfortable bed and linens. Clean bathroom. Nice hardwood floors. Good heating and air conditioning. Nothing at all to complain about in terms of the living space or condition.
The location is pretty much perfect. You're within walking distance of many excellent restaurants, Copley Place, Newbury Street, and all the rest. But you're on a quiet street.
The only caveat--and this is mentioned in the listing, but I'll reiterate--is that this is four flights of stairs up, and there's no elevator. So if you have trouble navigating stairs, this won't be for you. But if that doesn't bug you, no problem. And there's good central air conditioning in the unit, so if you're sweaty after climbing up, no problem :-)
You won't be disappointed."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Location was lovely! Charlie's is a great greasy spoon and I was close to my conference in the Hynes Convention Center.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location is really convenient and the apartment itself is kept very organized and clean. I'd definitely recommend this Airbnb to anyone, though I would caution those with physical disabilities that there are 62 steps between the street and the apartment which was a little rough after a long day of walking around Boston."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We can very highly recommend the 'Eagles Nest' -- It is an extremely well kept and attractive apartment in an excellent location. It has a real Boston brownstone on an attractive tree lined street that manages to simultaneously be central urban living and yet is as quiet as a country lane. The apartment is attractively furnished and comes with a very usable kitchen (we enjoyed making eggs for breakfast one morning). In addition, and in importantly in the summer heat and humidity that Boston is known for, the air conditioning is very effective and quiet. We slept well there after busy days visiting colleges and seeing a few sights; and were always happy to come home to our 'home away from home' in the evening to relax. Highly recommended."

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Eagle’s Nest is a spacious 1-bedroom with nice kitchen, living area (comfy couch, big TV) and king-sized bed in the bedroom. The South End location is central, with easy walks to restaurants, bars, and cafes. Michael was responsive to our messages and check in was easy. There are nice touches, such as phone chargers scattered throughout the apartment.
Two things to be aware of: the unit is 4 flights of stairs up, and there is very limited street parking (we used a public garage near Warren Ave for $35 / day). Asides from that, the place is great."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Michael’s place is the perfect spot for one or two people if you need to stay in Boston’s South End.

2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super space. Ultra clean. Quiet neighborhood close to lots of shops, restaurants, sights to see. Use a parking garage and take Uber’s. It’s Boston. Completely stocked with supplies. Extra phone chargers. Didn’t need any help from Michael but knew he was there.
Will be even better when roof deck is finished and open."
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Michael was a great host, quick to communicate when this Florida girl panicked and couldn’t figure out the heating. The space was very clean and really cute. The neighborhood is quaint and the perfect retreat at the end of a busy day exploring the city."

Note that the apartment is on the third floor and getting there includes climbing a set of steps to get to the front door of this beautiful brownstone house. Highly recommended!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I come into Boston frequently for work and stay at an Airbnb when hotel rates are sky high. Having stayed at a couple of different places I would recommend Michael's place because it's lived in. This means an umbrella, tote bag, first aid, and comfortable bed; no broken cabinets or hidden surprises. Apartment is close to Orange line Massachusetts Ave stop which is before Back Bay commuter chaos on the inbound. Lastly super easy checkout without need to strip beds and other housekeeping items I usually have to do by waking up early before I go into the office."

Excellent location for exploring Boston - we have walked straight to downtown Boston several times and the walks were wonderful.
Plenty of trendy restaurants and bars in 6 block radius.
We recommend this place whole heartedly."

It was clean, comfortable, stylishly decorated and very accurate in the descriptions. As he mentions in the description, there are 3 flights of narrow circular stairs up to his beautiful apartment. It was close to public transportation though we didn’t use it. Michael was very responsive and check in was super easy. He was extremely kind to let me check in early because my flight from the west coast got in early morning and I needed to freshen up before a college tour.
Thanks Michael for a great stay in Boston! I will definitely stay here again!"

Michael was super responsive and the place was also well kept and clean. I've been to Boston before but this time around, it was definitely a different experience due to where we stayed. I highly recommend this home away from home!"

2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This condo is in a brick rowhouse built in the mid 1800s, tons of character, completely updated inside. The neighborhood is stunning, we enjoyed walking around admiring the charm and exploring local businesses. Michael was super responsive and friendly. Couldn't have asked for anything more. I definitely recommend this place if you want to feel a bit more local and a bit less touristy."

2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot!
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place looks much better in real life than in the pictures. It has also a beautiful view to the city, and the street has even an iron cast water fountain. It is super quiet, even with the windows open. The mattress is firm and supportive, which is important if you have back problems. The host is very patient and attentive, and answered all my questions in detail. The location is great, within a walking distance to some of the best restaurants and bars of Boston: Meyers and Chang, Wally’s Caffe Jazz Club, Beehive, Giacomo’s etc. It easier to get to the historical area, to the museums, ball game, Charles River Esplanade etc. The only con is that being a top floor/attic with two sky windows, it gets warm during the day in the summer, but the air-conditioning fixes it quickly. You also should be willing to walk up three floors with your luggage (I was). I could not recommend less, and I am planning to come back."

,,,"got upgraded to a very noisey, cold room the aircon was so loud had to turn it off"
,,,"The hotel itself was fine and a cool place to stay with a lot of perks like a complimentary drink and food, but Daniel (the host) completed disregarded the fact that i cancelled one of the nights and refused to give me a refund even though I followed all the guidelines. Just book through the hotel website and not through Daniel"
,,,"DO NOT STAY HERE. My boyfriend and I booked this place 5 weeks in advance and fully paid for it before our weekend in Boston for fanexpo. We were searching for parking for an hour and 40 minutes around 8:30pm when I got an email saying our booking was canceled for “unforeseen and immediate circumstances.” Apparently they “ran out of rooms because our room wasn’t reserved.” They claim they gave me a full refund of $356 for one night but only sent $285. The host also sent me to the basic Airbnb help line rather than dealing with the problem HE CAUSED himself. The help line said it’s his responsibility yet he refused to take it. If you’re booking here, have a plan B. I’ve never experienced such unprofessional behavior for such a “nice and $$$$ hotel”."
,,,The place was nice. There was rotted food in the fridge and the water and ice from the fridge priced dirty water. The hot water stopped working and received no word from the host. I fixed it myself. The neighbors in the building were rude and even contacted Airbnb providing false accusations. I personally think they don’t want an Airbnb there so any one that goes there will probably face the same things.
