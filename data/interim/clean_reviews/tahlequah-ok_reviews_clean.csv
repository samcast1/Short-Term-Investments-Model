We wished it was our actual home! Our 1 year old pushed her walker up and down the long driveway and I was able to get a long run in on some nearby dirt roads. We were close to all of the family we wanted to spend time with and were able to explore downtown easily as well. I wish we’d have been in town longer to enjoy the cottage even more. The beds and sheets were so soft and we had everything we needed in the kitchen as well. One of the best Airbnb’s I’ve ever stayed in and we can’t wait to come back and stay longer.

My grandson loved, loved, loved the screened in porch, he insisted we have each meal out there. Sitting on the porch we had soft comfy chairs, listened the soft sounds of rain, and melodic sound of the soothing wind chimes, we Soo enjoyed Sue's warm, quaint, quite little house.

Easy to find, parking is more than ample. It is a spacious cottage, welcoming and cozy with every little amenity you can think of. We were delighted to find a record player in the living room and immediately put on a Jimmy Buffet album!
You’ll be super impressed with how sparkling clean everything is, and all the thoughtful little touches, bottled water in the fridge, awesome dispenser lotions in the shower, fluffy towels and such a comfortable bed!
Sue has truly shared her flare of putting together a quintessential home away from home.
And remember what I said in the first sentence? If you’re coming to Tahlequah, book it!"

Far enough off the beaten path to be peaceful, but close enough to restaurants and activities. Misty and Tony were very responsive and helpful with giving directions to fishing. The cabin was clean and comfortable. We hope to either come back, or rent the cabin next door and bring the family!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Spring House and its setting are off-the-charts beautiful and tranquil. The fishing was fun and easily accessible by walking a short distance.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super relaxed birthday weekend getaway. We loved the surroundings, hiking and the quiet. Felt secluded but easy access to Tahlequah for dining and shopping."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,So fantastic. My absolute favorite Airbnb experience in my 10 years using it:)
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a must stay, for people who like to get away from city life. I prefer to book air bnb for work travel versus hotels. Misty and Tony were very responsive and helpful. The river access is a great place to kick back relax. The cabin was beautiful and I plan on coming back in a few weeks and staying again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,this was a fun little weekend trip my wife and I took. everything was how it was presented in the listing and it was very peaceful out. The water wheel attached to the side of the little cabin has a tiny little squeak to it if it's completely silent inside you can hear it but that didn't bother us too much. overall pleasant experience and we will be back for sure.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cute tiny house. Great value for a clean quiet Airbnb. There was nothing lacking in the house to make your stay comfortable. Thanks again to Misty and Tony for making this memorable and enjoyable. God bless
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Was a very nice place to stay for 2. Will definitely have to come back when the weather is a little nicer. Loved sitting on the front porch with the rain.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,This was our second time staying on the property. We had a great time and will be back again!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"If I could give 6 stars I would! The attention to detail and thoughtful consideration of the traveler was just over the top. Lovely property. Relaxing. Peaceful. We wanted to get away from the chaos of life for a night so we booked a quick getaway an hour from home. My husband and I never even touched our phones. We played cards that were provided and simply enjoyed one another’s company. The cabin is exceptionally clean, stocked, and well cared for. I appreciate the hosts going above and beyond. This is the second best getaway location I’ve ever been to, just after Yellowstone National Park. The only recommendation I have is that if you are concerned about privacy (although there are no buildings that could offer a direct view nearby, so it really shouldn’t be any issue) that you bring a little pop up car window shade or something because the kitchen window doesn’t have a curtain.
Fantastic. Will visit again. Will recommend!!!"

Hosts were always extremely responsive and were graciously accommodating of an early check-in request. I cannot recommend this place any higher!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Amazing and peaceful. Perfect place to spend a Thanksgiving. We needed to chill and enjoy it all. Misty and Tony were wonderful
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful stay. Although we could hear occasional passing cars, it was quiet and peaceful. amazing view of the sky to look at stars ⭐️ highly recommend.. and we can’t wait to come back and stay for longer than one night to really enjoy the place more!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was the perfect little getaway! This cottage was so unique and one of the cleanest airbnbs I’ve stayed in. The decor was adorable, the bed was cozy and the campfire was perfect. Will definitely have to come back to stay longer!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a peaceful place to unwind and relax! Everything was so clean! I wish I had more time to explore the trail that was near by! But I definitely would love to come back and do this!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"A cute little gem of a cabin, cleverly constructed by Tony & Misty with all of the amenities, nestled in the Tahlequah hills. Sorry that I only had one night to spend there."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was very relaxed and at ease here.
The river was beautiful and the water felt great. I loved how secluded I was, a great get away. There was also quite a lot of restaurants just down the road. Misty had stocked everything I needed for a great stay!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay in the Spring House and will surely be back. It’s exactly what we were hoping for in a private, comfy place to stay a short drive from both restaurants and float outfitters. It was the perfect place to relax after a day on the river. Also, we were given excellent recommendations for food. I absolutely loved water mill, the cows we could see from porch swing, and everything you needed to enjoy a wonderful night. The bed was very comfy too. This has been my favorite Airbnb experience. I highly recommend."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was just my husband and I for the weekend and our first time staying in a tiny house; we loved it. Misty and Tony thought of every possible thing you could need for your stay. The house was spotlessly clean, nice sized bathroom and shower, soft towels, comfortable bed, pillows and blankets. The futon couch in the living room isn't real comfortable, so if you plan to use it as an extra sleeping area, you may want to bring a full size air mattress to place on top. It's a beautiful drive or walk through the ranch to the Flat Rock area on the river. We spent a few hours out there swimming and visiting with the rafters and floaters. It is a beautiful area on the river! We'd like to visit again with our teenage kids and reserve the larger A frame house. They were jealous when they saw the pictures we took at the Flat Rocks. Great place to stay, beautiful, little tiny house."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Thank you!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter and I had a wonderful experience staying at The Spring House. Misty provided excellent instructions/directions and the tiny home is just as pictured. The surrounding acreage is so peaceful and includes direct river access. We had a minor hiccup with the lock while we were there and the response was immediate. The home was well stocked, far beyond expectations. We are hoping to visit again soon, as this setting is beautiful year round. Thank you Misty, Tony and Tony Sr.!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a special place. We really loved sitting on the porch and listening to the sound of the spring and cooking on the fire pit/grill. Flat Rocks is the perfect swimming hole--such a quick, easy walk too. The house was cozy, clean, and well-stocked. Can't wait to come back!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend. Serene, secluded, and peaceful. Easy river access. Incredibly responsive hosts. Great use of space. Wonderful sitting area outside to cook on the fire pit. Just a really lovely experience with very accommodating hosts."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location for my needs - close to area river activities. Extra river access is a bonus.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,So thankful for this affordable option nestled in beauty! Well laid out space and the flat rock spot was so relaxing and fun!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely fell in love with this place! Misty was so sweet and responsive and gracious with their property. So beautiful inside and out and you cannot beat the view all day long. The sound of the water wheel is extremely relaxing and waking up to the cows and deer was awesome! Can’t recommend this place enough, will definitely be going back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I can’t say enough good things about our stay. Misty communicated quickly and was very informative. We felt like we were guests at a friends home rather than just a customer. This tiny home is well worth every penny and then some. Very clean, perfect for a couple, private access to the river and close to several activities.
They made our stay comfortable and can’t wait to go back again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place for two. Misty was very responsive and even let us check in early. Loved the place and the flat rock!!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Cozy and private. We really enjoyed the place. We used the fire pit and they provided firewood. Would stay here again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Misty and Tony have created a really thoughtful space in the country. It's relaxing and peaceful but has all the amenities you need for a comfortable stay, including an extremely cozy bed and well-stocked kitchen. They are warm and helpful and very responsive should you need anything. Highly recommend."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at The Spring House. We arrived after dark but the directions were very good and check in so convenient that we had no problems. On arrival the personal touches made us feel like welcome guests. The property was so spotless it looked like it was brand new! I was especially pleased to find a full sized bathroom with a walk-in shower in a tiny home. The house was comfortable, and well stocked with everything we needed.
In the morning we found the location to be beautiful with impressive landscaping. It was peaceful with little traffic.
We look forward to staying here again the next time we are in the Tahlequah area and would be glad to recommend it to our friends and family."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We recently had the pleasure of staying at the ""Tiny Spring House"" in Checotah, OK, and I must say it was a delightful experience. The home itself was incredibly comfortable, and the split air conditioning provided a refreshing escape from the summer heat. Misty, the host, has thoughtfully provided everything you could possibly need in this tiny home.
The interior was beautifully decorated and exuded a charming, cozy ambiance. It was evident that a lot of attention to detail went into making the space feel welcoming and adorable. Spending the 4th of July in this lovely retreat was the perfect way to celebrate."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,They were above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable the place had everything you could possibly need they were very responsive it was actually a gem.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my first time staying in a tiny home. It was amazing. The house had everything you need plus some.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing place! If you’re looking for a getaway that involves nature and a private spot, Misty and Tony offer a great cabin by the Illinois river! Definitely made a good choice on picking them as our host, would love to do it again in the future!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an absolute gem! Great hosts! This tiny home had all the amenities anyone would need. The natural spring was picturesque and we had close access to fishing & swimming, and float resorts were just a couple miles down the road. I would highly recommend this stay to any couple wanting a peaceful, scenic getaway."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Truly enjoyed our few days away at this adorable tiny cabin. Everything is well thought out, and the space is perfect for a short getaway. We sat out by the fire our last night and had the best time on a beautiful evening enjoying nature. Thank you!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"One of the most beautiful views I’ve had in awhile! This darling tiny home has a working water wheel and stunning scenery. Mother Nature at her best. The house is cute and compact. Perfect for me and my dog. She cried when I went upstairs to the loft so I slept on the fold out futon below :-)
Be sure to keep your dog on a leash if they chase! Lots of deers and bunnies were out prancing in the high grass. Be sure to hike to the river as well. Such a special spot!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This cabin was the perfect getaway for my child and I, we loved the quiet countryside and the of course the beautiful view.
Both Misty and Tony were so nice and thoughtful through the entire stay. I definitely would love to visit here again in
the future. 💛"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,My husband and I loved this place so much. We have had a rough year so this was much needed. Beyond peaceful out there and the location is wonderful. There’s nothing nervy so you don’t hear ANYONE or ANYTHING. Just like we wanted. The private swim area was so beautiful and I for sure didn’t wanna leave. The homemade peanut butter balls were my favorite. Thank you so much for that and the welcome card. We can’t wait to come back soon. Thank you for having us and thank you for being so helpful and responsive.

I’ve never given a tiny house a try. It was perfect for us. The cliffside behind and the large open fields across the road or breathtaking! The huge fire pit adds the perfect touch for a nice evening. It was soooooooo quiet! Loved it and plan to come back"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful tiny house on a lovely farm across from a pasture with deer bounding through. We enjoyed having coffee on the porch swing listening to the sounds of nature and seeing the deer. Bonus points for cows and horses on the road to the house. This previous small farm girl from upstate NY loved the country environment. Well kept clean house! Such a great use of space and well stocked with supplies. I wish we had spent more time there to explore the land but we were passing through on our Midwest journey on a visit from our home in Alaska.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jessie was a great host the house was totally amazing I highly recommend thanks again for everything I loved the home.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a lovely stay here for Cherokee National Holiday! The house is between the events downtown and One Fire Field, making it a convenient location. The home was clean, easy to find, and super comfortable. It was super hot while we were there, but even with the A/C set at 74-75, we were completely comfortable (that's our usual setting at home, and with the wonderful ceiling fans I even found myself a little chilly and had to turn the fan off!). The hosts are wonderful, communicated in advance the check in and check out instructions. We appreciated the welcome binder with restaurant recommendations. The pastries to welcome us were a lovely touch and made the kids super excited. Thank you all for a wonderful stay!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Jessie’s listing! Super clean! Loved the blueberry muffins they kindly left for us. They had firewood in the pit ready for us. Super nice bathroom (and good TP which is bonus points in our household 😂). Communicative. Super easy to navigate. Covered parking. Clear instructions. We will return for sure. If you can stay here, count your lucky stars! We stayed to float the Illinois and it was a perfect 7 min drive to All American Rentals! This space is wheelchair accessible with a ramp and open spaces (large bathroom and rooms) which I think is amazing. Loved this host and space!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This Tahlequah home was spectacular! Newly remodeled, beautiful, and close to downtown! Perfect location and the river is only 15 to 20 minute drive. Lots of different restaurants to choose from! I highly recommend this rental for anyone!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Precious house, one of the cleanest of the many places we’ve stayed. Loved the fresh flowers and the blueberry muffins were a wonderful treat. The Tahlequah pillows and coasters were a cute local touch.
Everything was exactly as described and we really enjoyed our stay. Having a washer/dryer was great and I loved that the closet was stocked with hangers and I was able to hang up all my clothes - certainly helped make me feel right at home for our week in the area. Very pleased!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Super cute place! Beds were comfy. Great location to get to everything you need in Talequah. We will be looking for this home on future visits. Oh and the muffins were amazing!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the location. It was close to downtown area and conveniently located. The home has been tastefully updated and has a comfortable layout.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the best stay we've had with Airbnb! Perfectly located, this property is nestled in a quiet neighborhood, across the street from a wooded creek area and park (and less than 1/2 mile from restaurants and retail stores). The beds were super comfortable, the sheets were extremely soft (900 thread count?), the decor was fresh & fashionably designed. All appliances, lighting & plumbing fixtures were new, functional and beautiful. The furnishings were superior to any we've had before. The property exudes classic relaxation! Jessie understands hospitality - and it shows. She was so thoughtful - she even had fresh flowers (and muffins from Morgan's Bakery) for us when we arrived! We really didn't want to leave, but we will definitely be back. Great experience!!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was super cute, updated, clean and easy to find. The furniture and beds were comfortable. The personal touch of flowers, muffins, fruit and a thank you card with a gift card to a local coffee shop was thoughtful. This was the second time to stay at an Airbnb and my husband was impressed with Jessie and the house compared to the other place we stayed. One thing that was missing was coffee mugs, there was coffee, filters and coffee pot just no mugs. We will definitely keep this place in mind for our next visit to the area."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was so clean and decorated nicely! We will be staying there again in the future!

Very accommodating and would recommend!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a little slice of heaven. If you get the chance, you should stay with Jessie. She was more accommodating then anyone I have ever stayed with. House was spotless, that is a must for me with my OCD. My flight got canceled, due to hurricane Ian. She was so understanding and helpful. Flowers, fruit, and muffin's on the table was a nice touch 👌 I will definitely be back 😁"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Rhonda's place. The home is charming, spacious, and comfortable. It was probably built around the 1920s, but everything worked perfectly. The rooms were really big, and there were tons of windows. Since most days were sunny, this was great - always lots of beautiful light. It truly is easily walkable to the main street (Muscogee St) in the historic district. The Cherokee Nation's museums are there, as are numerous shops, galleries, and restaurants. It's also fun to walk the nearby neighborhoods. I think there are buildings from every decade from the mid-1800s to today. Rhonda was helpful, almost immediately responding to any question we had. The house is very private and has a large, fenced backyard. The house is well supplied with just about anything you would need. We would definitely want to stay here if we come back to the area. Highly recommended."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Such an amazing gem! Rhonda was a great host. House had tons of character and felt like I was at home away from home! I highly recommend and will definitely remember this spot. Thank you again Rhonda.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our time at this house. It’s very cozy full of character. Front porch sittin with a cup of coffee was relaxing. Rhonda was very helpful and very accessible to us. Location was perfect for the lake or River we will definitely be back

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The stay was fantastic! Hoping to get my whole family into both of their cabins sometime this fall for a trip down the river! Was immaculately clean! I'm kind of a clean freak. ; )
Phil was super accommodating! Super close to the float companies! Amazing view of the river and the valley, and could see the Cabin from the river when we floated by. Bald eagle was perched on a tree close to the back porch and watched it soar over the valley for a few moments. Could see dear down by the river too.
Kids had a blast swimming on the small peddle beach on the property even though the river seemed up a bit. Roasted marshmallows at the huge fire ring and the boys played on the hammock. Phil even brought over some yard games!
Peaceful and serene!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is so beautiful and well kept. The view of the Illinois River from the back deck is stunning! Me & my family really enjoyed our stay at the Buffalo Cabin and would absolutely do it again. The host, Phil was great everything needed to accommodate was already taken care of with no real need for interaction. Very private and pleasant."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a beautiful view!!!! Lots of deer accross the river to watch!!!! Very peaceful , and a great place to just relax!!
Looks just like the pictures, and has everything you need to make you feel at home."

2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Had a great stay at this cabin! It's an absolutely beautiful setting, perched above the river and the overall grounds were very peaceful. Fairly easy access to the river down the trail. The cabin was spacious and very clean, with ample sleeping spots for our guys' trip. Host was very responsive. I'd love to bring my family back here some day!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was a beautiful property. Ran by a wonderful family and amazing hosts. I would gladly stay here again and again as I traveled back to this location. It was absolutely worth every penny.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"100% best airbnb we have ever stayed at! We certainly hope to be back. Highly recommended for any occasion!! Phil was a wonderful host and we loved his wife's taste for decorating. Honestly, pictures don't do the place or the scenery justice so go see for yourself! Bring your hiking shoes so you can enjoy a trip to the river and a sack lunch for the picnic table in the valley!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"It was difficult getting everyone to leave, they loved it so much. Beautiful, peaceful, calm, and the horse was really cute and sweet. We said bye to him and he nodded his head up and down! Downtown was really fun and interesting. The Lift has yummy coffee and food. The Branch has great service and food.
Hosts were very sweet and responsive and we can’t wait to come back."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I would recommend to any and everybody who would like to visit that area it's a little Slice of Heaven on Earth
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had the best time! The cabin was so clean and smelled nice. Comfortable beds and the view out of every window was picture perfect!

We have absolutely found our new favorite place and will be back!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Gwen & Grace were phenomenal hosts. Their cabin was perfect for my group and the nature surrounding us was beautiful and serene. I highly recommend booking with them as they were responsive, answered questions clearly and were overall very kind. Thank you!"

2024-05-01,5,Group trip,It was more beautiful than the pictures very homestead awesome place beautiful inside and out me and my family loved it. We used it for our daughters birthday trip not too far from the river had a blast.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,What an amazing place to stay and what an gracious host! The cabin was beautiful and built with love. The entire surroundings were peaceful with plenty of places to explore and things to do. The cinnamon rolls were hands down the best ever! My family and I will definitely be staying here again.
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Gwen was always responsive to our question. very peaceful and beautiful scenery.
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"The house is lovely and rustic; woodworking on the inside is beautiful and homey. There are many books and games in the house, and the living room chairs are particularly comfortable. The lighting in the house is quite cozy, too. We stayed one night for a bachelor trip, and all the guys enjoyed it. The cinnamon rolls in the kitchen are real and delicious! We also met the host - very kind woman!
The creek in the back is pristine and ice cold... refreshing! Trampolining was fun too!
The house makes efficient use of space; it looks smaller from the outside but has plenty on the inside. With that, the smaller bathroom and shower are not very spacious, but the larger bathroom with the tub has plenty of room. The upstairs has a lower clearance-you'll have to bend down a little to get through the doors. The 4 bunk beds and 1 nook bed are smaller, though we slept adult men in them just fine. They would be great kids' beds for sure.
One negative point was low air circulation in some bedrooms."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Home is absolutely gorgeous! Very clean. We felt at home during our visit. The decor was perfect and everything looked very up to date. Would absolutely recommend staying there. Cherie is great! Instructions were extremely clear and easy to follow. We loved every minute of our stay!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Such a great stay! Cherie was very good at communicating and helping us accommodate for a fun bachelorette weekend! Highly recommend this stay
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved this stay!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a really good stay, any questions we had were answered, had a small issue with the Keurig but it was addressed immediately, super friendly hosts. The only thing I would say is if you have a bad back like me, back a mattress topper, one of the beds is super super comfy but the other two are a bit to firm (this is a taste/preference thing though nothing was wrong with the bed just too firm for my weary bones lol I gave my mom the comfy bed). Has really good amenities the dart board and the pool table are awesome. Would have like to do a longer stay to get to enjoy the backyard and bbq and all the board games."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great house and great host!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Friendly hosts with great communication. Spacious home. Great yard for the dogs. Conveniently located. We hope to be back soon. Thank you.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cherie was very responsive when we had question, the listing was near everything and Main Street. Place was very homey and welcoming from the moment we stepped in. Definitely recommend!! 10/10"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I were able to walk in and feel right at home. The space was so clean and Cherie has done such a great job decorating everything so that the space feels welcoming, but at the same time it is very kid friendly. We were close to the river and also close to downtown Tahlequah, lots of great restaurants nearby. We will be looking to book with Cherie again whenever we come back. Highly recommend."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,highly recommended
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful home. Loved the fenced in yard and pool table. Also loved that she left treats for not only us but our pets as well. Has all the little things you may forget like phone chargers! We will definitely be back!

2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great place and wonderful Host.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We traveled to Rose Bud Retreat over Thanksgiving weekend. There was 5 adults and 5 dogs. The layout of the house was perfect, very roomy and the game room was nice. Kennels fit nicely by the back door away from bedrooms, back yard was fully fenced so they could run. We did bring our halo fence and was glad because the gate is a little loose and then we didn’t have to worry about it. Kitchen is well stocked for normal meals we brought a few things ourselves and glad we did. But hosts did offer to have everything we needed there I just thought it was easier for me to bring it myself. Host was in communication multiple times during visit, we will definitely keep this place in mind again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cherie's Rosebud Retreat is charming, beautifully appointed, spotless, and provided everything we needed. We had a wonderful time there and expect to be back!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything was GREAT, including the Host!! I would recommend having clay or glass dinnerware as I dont like using plastic for hot drinks or food. Otherwise, we would definitely stay here again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful house with great decor in a nice little neighborhood. I would definitely come back and stay again if I’m in the area.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The house was spacious with lots of area to hang out. The game room was fun. The kitchen was well equipped for cooking. The front porch was really fun. The fenced backyard was great set up with a fire pit and grill and lots of grass space for the dogs to run. We enjoyed many of the nearby restaurants. The location was very convenient to get anywhere in Tahlequah. We enjoyed our stay and the space for the dogs was really lovely. We only had 4 people and the dogs but there way plenty of room for 6 and dogs. I highly recommend this home.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,loved it! exactly as advertised :))
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved the rental! Great location and comfortable bed! You had to leave the door to the bedroom open with the fan blowing into the living room to keep it cool because there is only a window unit in the bedroom. The shower is huge and the patio area was awesome!
2024-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"The place is very nice, clean, and comfortable! Even though the neighborhood isn’t ideal, it is centrally located and convenient. I would definitely stay there again. 👍"
2024-06-01,3,Stayed one night,"The whole place is cooled with one window unit, it’s pretty hot. The decor is pretty. The tile is pretty but the tile installation is poorly done. The patio was nice but the mosquitoes are terrible. Seems secluded from the patio, but the street noise is terrible. Water pressure for a shower is great. Needs a need Keurig. Lovely wine glasses. I liked the tv was already logged into Netflix. The bedding was quality. Only room for one car to park there but that’s all we needed. But if you need more parking than that, it would be a struggle. Fresh flowers were put out. Those were pretty. Plenty of clean supplies. The appliances are top notch."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Best host in Tahlequah!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Everything was great and we had a wonderful time. Only issues was the carbon monoxide alarm beeping but we believe the batteries were dying and some finger prints on the stainless steel other than that everything was perfect. We had a wonderful time and the bed was extreamly comfortable and the Airbnb was in the perfect spot directly in town. It’s actually on top of a tattoo shop we almost stopped and got tatoos while we were there.

It’s tucked in the back of building so there’s privacy, lots of walkable restaurants, and everything in there is cozy and comfortable.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,5⭐️
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I really enjoyed this Air BnB stay. Edna waz a great host. Very responsive. I have grown tired of the staying at the local hotel venues. I regularly come to town for work at one of the hospitals. This location makes it very convenient to respond while on call. The best endorsement one can give is to rebook after an initial stay. I have booked all of my stays going forward with Edna at this location!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great Place to Stay
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time there. I will definitely be back. Edna was very responsive. I will book her place in the future if it is available.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,The hideaway is a perfect location! Close to downtown and not too far where we needed to be. Definitely would stay again
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for a place to stay in Tahlequah, ditch the hotel and stay here! This place is beautifully decorated, comfy, quiet, and safe. I’m definitely booking here in the future when I visit my family. There’s nothing else quite like it. If you’re a clean freak like me, the place is spotless. You don’t have to worry about the previous occupants’ cooties. Finally, if you’re a security expert/freak like me, you’ll be glad to know there are no hidden cameras, so no need to worry about being spied on like you hear about with some other Airbnb sites."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"super cute place, and central to the whole town. I would definitely stay there again"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I went there to do some work. Cozy place and got the work done quicker than I expected.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You can beat this value for a night or extended stay. I’ve lived in Tahlequah and come back often to visit friends. This place has nice homey touches. Motion lights helped me feel safer walking to and from my car. The host thought of everything.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute and cozy. Easy check in, good location, and very clean."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect little loft! Extremely clean and the host was very responsive and informative. The location is awesome too; you are close to pretty much everything you need in Tahlequah and then you're only 30 minutes or so from Tenkiller lake.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a great little apartment close to everything. Super super cute and very functional. Very clean. The bed was great for me but hubby didn't love it. A little firm for his taste but it's was really not that firm. So many pillows! They didn't skimp on the pillows! Wish we could have stayed longer and taken advantage of the nice deck. It was a little noisy being right off the main road but we turned on the AC fan and it covered up most of the traffic noise. Would definitely stay there again if in the area.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect spot in town.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Thank you! Very kind host
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a very nice place. We enjoyed our stay and the location was perfect.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Edna is a great communicator. The loft is decorated so nice and very clean. The deck is really nice in the back.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved this little apartment in the heart of town, it was close to everything but private with the lovely deck out back. The bed was super comfy, the shower was amazing, it smelled nice when we walked in and it looked just like the pics, the furnishings and decor were beautiful. The kitchen was equipped with anything you might need. I personally enjoyed the coffee bar and wine glasses.
Although you are on a busy street it was peaceful and quiet for sleeping. I’d love to stay here again, it was a great place for my husband’s birthday getaway!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Stunning place on the inside. Located above a tattoo shop near all the downtown shops. Had everything you could need for a trip. Edna was so incredibly nice and made sure we were taken care of and enjoyed our stay.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Wish we had more time. This was a lovely loft situated above a local tattoo shop and next to a car salvage lot that luckily were closed while we were staying there. Once you climb the stairs and are on the patio you are secluded. We really enjoyed this well designed and decorated loft apartment. Perfect for our one night getaway.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed the loft very much. So much room in living area and bedroom. Convenient location. Would stay again.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,The Hideaway was perfect for us! The attention to detail was evident. The photos were an accurate representation. Very clean. Comfortable bed.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,Awesome space with an awesome host!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love this cute little Hideaway! Great space for two people close to downtown. Edna has thought of everything. It was 110 degrees outside when we stayed and the air conditioning was able to keep up! It was too hot to walk to downtown but if we come back in the fall we will definitely do that. The kitchen is well stocked and we enjoyed the Keurig. Thanks Edna
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super convenient, on the main road, 62/Muskogee with a big nice outdoor deck."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Cute small place within fifteen min walking of downtown tahlequah. Very comfy king size bed.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great stay! Place was great. Zero complaints
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Our stay exceptional! Highly recommend.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean and great location. Cool spot!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I've stayed on many different occasions at one of Edna's properties, never disappointed. I love her fashion sense. I will always chose one of her properties if available. Always immaculate 👍"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Edna was very accommodating and the place was the perfect lil hideaway for our weekend trip! Would definitely recommend to friends!!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is an absolutely gorgeous property. Don’t think twice about booking with Edna! This is my second time booking one of her properties. She is great at communicating and ensuring happiness and comfort for her guests. Thanks, Edna!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay! The cozy home was decorated very cute! The bedroom was big and spacious, and the bedroom AC kept it nice and cool all night long. They were stocked with detergent to wash my clothes and towels from floating the river. And the bathroom had full sized bottles of shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. The front porch was very peaceful to sit and read and drink my morning coffee. It was a great stay!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Edna was more than accommodating during my stay. Location is on the Main Street in town, but noise wasn’t an issue. Cute place!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Such a cute little loft! Was the perfect place to stay in Tahlequah.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay. We floated the river, it was a quick 10 minute drive. Edna was very responsive and the place was precious! We loved the precious porch."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best treasure Tahlequah has to offer.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The stay was great! We loved the aesthetic of the place! We would stay here again!
2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the aesthetic of the house! Great for a 2 person trip. The house seems smaller than the images and was located on top of a tattoo shop. But overall, it was a good stay! Also enjoyed the privacy of the porch."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,great place. I totally recommend this space.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a pleasant surprise in the heart of downtown Tahlequah! Everything was thoughtfully and beautifully designed, organized and presented. We felt better than right at home! The bed was super comfortable and a welcome change after having been camping for four nights!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Edna’s place was well furnished, modern, comfortable and truly a home away from home! The apartment is on the second floor above a Tattoo shop, in walking distance to some coffee shops and stores. There’s a little alley at the bottom of the stairs, where you could park your car for free. The deck is wonderful and surrounded by trees, great for evening sips. Even though the apartment is located on a relatively busy street, it is not facing it and it was actually very quiet at night.
Edna was a great host, very communicative and hospitable throughout our stay.
We would love to return in the near future and would absolutely recommend Edna’s lovely apartment to anyone looking for a cozy and comfortable place to stay in Tahlequah!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place w/everything you’ll need. The bed is SUPER comfortable!! Host is attentive to needs & responds quickly. Great location if you’re a traveler on contract @ a local hospital.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very understanding & Very organized.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a really cute place. I would definitely try to stay here again. Although I never needed it, Edna made herself available if any issues came up."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This Airbnb was beautiful and very clean. The host was great at communicating with us during our stay.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful and quaint place. The name does justice to the place. Would definitely book again.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Very modern and clean Tahlequah is a great town to visit.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Wonderful stay! The house was adorable, quiet environment. My favorite detail was the deck hangout area :)"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This stay was wonderful! Small town area with access to everything a traveler needs. Lovely area and attentive host. Highly recommend:)
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a very nice place to stay. Right in the center of town. It was relaxing and we loved the porch.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautifully decorated space. Everything you might need is available. Another reviewer said it was in an industrial area, but in my opinion that’s inaccurate. It’s basically located between the college area and the newer shopping/Casino area. A few older houses across the street, and older shopping area surrrounding it, but it’s right there on the Main Street that runs from the newer Shopping area to the college campus.
The only issue I had was that there was a lot of street noise through the night, cars mostly, but if you live in the city that probably wouldn’t be noticed. (We live in the country and are used to quiet nights.)"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay that is within walking distance to lots of fun downtown things to do.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I wanted a quiet few days in a clean, well-furnished place as a writing vacation and this place was fantastic for it. It was well-stocked and had everything I needed to cook all my own meals there in the full kitchen. I even got a impromptu tattoo from the shop below!
So, while the place overall was glowing for me the only thing I would mention for future renters is that if you want a place to go outside and walk around to see the sights it probably wouldn't be the best. The area nearby is pretty industrial, but there are things a short drive away. Inside though, everything is perfect!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very comfortable stay! Space is lovely. Easy walk to bars and restaurants. Had everything we needed.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super nice updated place. Very cozy and affordable.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Perfect place for a couples get away!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Edna was very attentive and her place was immaculate. Location is near sites, restaurants and shops. Easy to get around from there."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,10/10 recommend; beautiful little get away :)
2022-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The place was beautiful and had everything I could need! The attention to detail really stuck out to me. Everything was well equipped and well prepared and very clean, and close by downtown Tahlequah. The host’s communication was clear and responded quickly. The only negatives were: 1) no central heat and air, although there were plenty of space heaters available. And 2) it was located in a somewhat iffy looking area and there was some yelling and fighting at the house across the street, as well as a random stray dog wandering near the patio (not at all the host’s fault, but something to be aware of)."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place and Edna was amazing!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Edna’s place was so cute! The deck was adorable, the bed was super comfy and it had everything you might need. It’s above a tattoo parlor but it was closed by 10pm when I arrived and I didn’t hear anything other than an occasional car passing by. There is no central heat but she had several electric heaters already on and it was nice and cozy by the time I arrived. Such a cute little space for a stopover on my long distance drive. Hotels are boring."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Another wonderful stay!
Very cozy and clean!
Host is very accommodating and quick to respond!
Would recommend to anyone"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful, quiet place to relax! Very clean and cozy! Will definitely plan to stay again!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clear directions for check-in and unit was exactly as expected! Clean and pleasant, very homey. Bed really comfortable and plenty of clean linens. Would definitely stay here again!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cute! Just as described.
2021-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This was a super cute place to stay! The couch was comfy and the bed was huge! The unexpected cold weather made it a little difficult to warm up the place but there are so many heaters around to help warm it up! The house sits on top of a shop/building that is being renovated so there were some construction going on during the day but besides that it was a great stay!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay in a great location. This place is certainly hidden away, however, right on the highway. There are some great food places that you can walk to. We enjoyed being able to make our way anywhere in town via car. As a small heads up, this is a smaller rental so taller individuals may have to navigate and this is a shower unit if you prefer baths. Felt cozy with the decor and like a break from fast paced life. Overall wonderful host (very responsive) and excellent amenities (washer/dryer/ kitchen/etc) for pricing!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great accommodations and in walking distance to many sites; restaurants and museums!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were so pleased with this apartment! It's very comfortable and cozy; even nicer than the pictures. The kitchen is well-stocked; we had everything we needed for a relaxing couple of days. We'd definitely stay here again.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute and comfy place for a little getaway! It had everything we needed. The location was perfect, walking distance from restaurants. Loved our stay!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Edna’s place is great and so cozy! If it’s available book it!!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I love the hideaway and think it’s perfect for my needs! Thank you!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very beautiful and great location on the Main Street!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This place is a true treasure. So well balanced and decorated. Who decorated here must be a professional. The colors are soothing and tasteful. The bed is the most comfortable. She has everything that you would want, I do mean everything! Beautiful dishes, glasses, silverware. If you need it, she has it there. The little fireplace was so relaxing. But the deck, morning and night we were out there. It has a table now to eat at and we ate every meal there. If you want to relax, this is your place."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Hideaway lives up to its name! It is the perfect little place to get away! Edna’s place is charming and everything was wonderful from check-in to check-out. I can’t wait to stay again! Thank you!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This rental was perfect for our trip, and the location was close to everything in town. The apartment is spacious, well equipped, and beautifully decorated. Edna was a joy to work with. We will definitely stay here on future trips to Tahlequah!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little modern apt very close to downtown and NSU. It was very comfortable and had everything we needed!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, clean, and simple. Perfect spot in Tahlequah."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wish I could give this place ten stars! Beyond exceeded expectations. Edna did everything in her power to make sure our stay was perfect. The place is much bigger and nicer than the pictures show. Would be the perfect honeymoon spot. We are only sad we couldn't stay longer. The only Airbnb I've been to that was a hotel 5 star experience. Not stingy with soaps and towels, which was a huge bonus!! Beautiful spot!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a gem! If we’re ever in the area again we know where we’re staying. Everything was perfect and we loved that we could bring our dog along!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute, clean, and easy. Couldn't have asked for more."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved this place. Clean, stylish, comfortable. will definitely be staying again"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place exceeded our expectations 🤩. We liked the spacious bedroom bigger than pictures. The kitchen is fully stocked. And the front deck was wonderful to relax and eat dinner. Even though it is downtown Tahlequah, the deck is set among trees so feels like you’re in the country. The Edison stringed lights cast a relaxing aura as well. If you’re looking for a space that’s beautifully decorated, spacious enough, and pleasant owner, this place is for you. We were pleased with Edna’s prompt response and friendliness."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Edna was an amazing host and ""The Hideaway"" is a beautiful bnb to stay at!
We had accidentally forgotten a set of keys when we checked out.
Edna messaged us to let us know and also kept the keys safely for us to pick up!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had an enjoyable, accommodating stay! We loved the outdoor deck area. We will stay here anytime we are in town!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Recommend this place. Edna will take care of you
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a Tahlequah Treasure!! Super clean, very stylish, and extraordinarily welcoming and homey! Edna was very quick to respond to requests, questions, and even silly inquiries.
We simply LOVED this little Hideaway loft! Enjoyed some wine in the comfy back patio and slept like babies in the big ole king bed. Even our dog was better rested after our time there. The loft and Edna were amazing- HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is perfect! Great location and private. We will be back
2021-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Edna was fantastic! She made sure I had everything I needed during my long-term stay in Tahlequah. She checked in with me throughout the stay to make sure everything was going smoothly, which I appreciate. She was always quick to respond when I had questions."
2021-05-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The spot is modern and well-equipped, however there were ants in the kitchen when I checked in. Edna was quick to respond and sent an exterminator right away, and I was able to check out early to get a partial refund."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful little hideaway, you’d never even know was there. Sparkling clean. And cozy."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I only stayed for a couple of days so I didn’t get to fully utilize the space but wow is is packed with stylish and welcoming decor.
The space has everything you need for a stay."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Even better the second time around. Super adorable place and super clean. The deck is sooooo cute and a great place to hang out - only place I would stay in Tahlequah!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2021-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"A little pricey for being out of season in Tahlequah, but it’s a nice quiet place. The watered down soap in the bathroom was a little weird. Definitely stay if you’re planning to stay more than one night!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super clean, super cute, very convenient to everything Tahlequah. I cannot say enough about this adorable little place, all the extra touches makes you want to move in permanently!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute loft, clean, stylish. Easy check-in/out"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing and really has everything. From towels to a keurig with k-cups and sugar, there’s also a full kitchen with some basic spices and cooking oil. It’s very clean, and has a beautiful patio.
The only recommendation that I have is that if you are a light sleeper bring some ear plugs or a white noise machine since the hideaway is on a fairly busy street and it was pretty noisy at night.
Overall, I wouldn’t hesitate to stay there again if I’m back in Tahlequah."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect Tahlequah stay! Very convenient, clean, and homey. 10 out of 10 stay and would recommend to anyone."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Edna is quick to respond and give information! The stay was clean and the place was well stocked and prepared for our stay!
2021-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The Hideaway is a great option for a stay in Tahlequah. My wife and I spent eight nights there and really enjoyed it. It's a loft above a retail space but the way access is set up it's very private and feels very secure. My wife was impressed with the décor, the bed was comfortable, the kitchen was well provisioned and it was quite clean.
Edna was great to work with and very responsive. There was an ice storm the day of our departure that coated the access stairway. It was icy enough that I wouldn't have tried to walk down it empty-handed, much less with heavy suitcases. I contacted Edna and within 30 minutes a guy showed up and scattered rock salt on the deck and stairs and when we loaded up our luggage about an hour later the ice was a non-issue.
If you’re going to Tahlequah and you want a private, comfortable and well-appointed place to stay give The Hideaway a try."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Hideaway is truly a hidden gem in downtown Tahlequah. I cannot thank Edna enough for being such a great host! I will recommend this rental to anyone staying in the area!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had an excellent stay at Edna’s place! The loft is located on the Main Street, but traffic noise wasn’t a problem. I was traveling alone & arrived at dusk, & I must admit that I was a bit apprehensive at first as the building next door (on the other side of a six foot privacy fence), seemed “creepy”. I contacted Edna, who responded immediately & set my mind at ease. I was delighted with the deck with its outdoor lights, which looked so inviting. There’s a stackable washer & dryer, gorgeous gas stove, full sized refrigerator & an electric fireplace. The loft is stylish and comfortable and perfectly clean. There’s a cozy king bed and a futon sofa in the living room for extra sleeping options. I felt completely at ease and wouldn’t hesitate to book Edna’s again!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great hosts of a great space that is very clean, full of amenities and many design elements to enjoy. I would absolutely stay here again"

2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is beautiful and was so clean! It would be great to come back in the spring or summer to enjoy the porch! I am from NY and the pizza at Napoli's was as close to NY pizza as I have ever had!

2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"A hidden gem on the main street. Loved the decor, huge bedroom, & great outdoor deck."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for our anniversary and it was the perfect little getaway! We really enjoyed the nature, being able to jump in the spa and relax, and watch the floaters go by! We ourselves floated the river and got out near the cabin to check out the scenery, it really is the perfect spot. I highly recommend it and we definitely will be back!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,clean and comfy great view of the river

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fabulous stay at this adorable cabin in the woods!
The cabin was clean and spacious but still cozy, perfect for two people. The bed was comfortable and the kitchen had just about everything you would need. The location was very private, especially with the neighboring cabin being empty during our stay. Mitch was super friendly and provided clear, helpful instructions.
The view of the river and sounds of nature while soaking in the hot tub made for a super peaceful getaway!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute place! Absolutely loved it and the views!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Easy directions and exactly what we expected. Beautiful place.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful location, beautiful views, cozy cabin, and responsive host. We didn’t want to leave! Mitch was very helpful. Couldn’t believe how gorgeous the view was, especially with the hot tub there. Would stay again 10/10"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our first time getting an Air B&B and we could not have had a better experience. Mitch’s cabin is beautiful & the kind of place that gets into your heart — one you hope you return to for more memories.
The cabin is equipped with everything you’d need — kitchen equipment, shampoos & soaps, cleaning supplies. The bed was comfortable & between the screen sliding door or the climate control unit, it is easy to get the temperature of the room just right for sleeping. The hot tub was all ready to go, and like everything else, it was perfectly maintained.
The river view is just incredible. Like another world. I can see why Mitch says the river gets into your soul. We cannot wait to come back!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place to stay! Super responsive and nice! Definitely recommend
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was perfect! 🤩 It was very peaceful & we had all the amenities needed during our stay. We highly recommend this cabin for a great getaway!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to go to get away from the city. Perfect location for a weekend getaway!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super helpful host, and a beautiful place to stay!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is a hidden gem! Incredible location; beautiful place to rest and relax.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This A-frame cabin on the banks of the Illinois River is the perfect spot for a romantic getaway. The view is amazing with the clear waters visible from inside the cabin as well as on the deck and from the hot tub. We were lucky to be greeted by a river otter swimming and playing in the gravel bar directly across from us. Five stars
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Second time staying, perfect retreat. Great place to just be, in quiet.. bring your own food to cook/grill, not too much is close. But even more reason to just sign off and rest!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay if you want a weekend getaway with your significant other!! Beautiful windows with lots of natural lighting and the hot tub over looks the river which is gorgeous!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely weekend at the A frame!
The views were absolutely beautiful and we arrived to a bald eagle greeting us across the river. We got to see lots of wildlife and enjoyed it! The views were just stunning and we highly enjoyed the hot tub! Mitch was so kind and very responsive and made sure we were doing good with these crazy cold temperatures. We cannot wait to come back again in the summer and enjoy getting in the river! We tried to go to double r&p for dinner due to seeing it had great reviews but I would call ahead if you go in the colder temps, they were closed due to no water. We ended up at Callahan’s in Arkansas and it was just a good! Thanks again Mitch for a great peaceful getaway! We highly recommend you giving it a try."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures do not do this place justice! The views alone are worth a 5 star review. The decor is perfect and cozy, furniture is comfy (bed is pretty firm, but not a complaint), and the place is well-stocked with everything you need, from spices, corkscrew, and utensils to coffee! There is a learning curve with the induction stove, however, Mitch gives great instructions. The hot tub was perfect and we even saw shooting stars! No light pollution of any kind made the night sky incredible. Though we went in Arctic temps, the other places near ours are spaced out enough I still think we’d have plenty of privacy. The access to the river makes us excited to come back this summer! Mitch is a great host, very responsive and accommodating."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Disclaimer - this is our second time here in 30 days! And it was as amazing as the first time.
It’s private and cozy. It was easy to get in. It’s fully furnished. It has everything you need for a quiet getaway. But the best thing about it is the view. This time it snowed, and it was absolutely breathtaking. Do yourself a favor and- if you’re on the fence about booking this place - DO IT!
Don’t forget - if you stay here on a weekend, go have a steak at the Double R & P in Westville."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute cabin and beautiful views! This was a great getaway for the weekend.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was very charming and comfortable. We had a wonderful time. Mitch""s check in instructions were great!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is absolutely stunning and perfect for a peaceful getaway. I hope to return again and will be recommending it to everyone I know.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was an absolute gem!!!!! Exactly like the pictures! The hot tub was a major plus and having the river right it the back was such while sitting by the fire and we such an amazing experience. Mitch was such a wonderful host and was very responsive with anything. Huge bonus was the outdoor cat who would sit in my lap by the fire?
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I have now dubbed Mitch’s place “Our Cabin in the Woods” because we plan on returning so frequently! It’s quaint and perfect for a peaceful, private getaway. It had everything we needed (even half n half for the coffee!). The bed was comfortable, the furnishings are new and comfortable. The hot tub was clean and well-maintained. Our favorite thing about Mitch’s place, however, was the view out the back. It’s breathtaking. We stayed 3 nights and 4 days, and we were blessed to witness a family of 4 bald eagles (2 adults and 2 juveniles) each day we were there.
If you have some time and want a good steak, make the trek to Double R & P’s in Westville. It’s a big “barn” literally in the middle of nowhere. Best steak we’ve ever had in a restaurant (and we’re steak people). And Mitch’s place has a great fridge so you can keep your leftovers for breakfast!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I wanted a weekend getaway with my girlfriend to relax peacefully, and this place was perfect! The cabin had all the essentials you needed, and I was pleased I could watch my soccer game at 6:30 am (Liverpool vs Man City) when I used the Roku TV on hand. We made the most of the hot tub every morning and evening; we looked out at the river and the trees; what a picturesque place to be with some wine and mimosas. We had a fire on the balcony at night and will certainly be back! This place is fantastic and of great value, and Mitch made it very easy with the directions and communication. Thank you, sir!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is absolutely beautiful, inside and out! Mark is a great host and very responsive. The location is private, super peaceful and relaxing, looks like something straight out of a storybook. It felt just like home.
Thank you Mark!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect couples getaway! My husband and I enjoyed 3 nights here, and loved every minute of it! Highly recommend!!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Honestly don't want to right a great review as selfishly I want to make sure there is availability for me to visit again! It was a picture perfect location on the river for 2! Had a running and gravel cycling event nearby and simply had a wonderful time. Been awhile since I have been to Tahlequah (20 min away), has not changed much. Overall, I really liked Mitch & Jody's dream for getting away - it was well appointed, clean, not too big, fancy in the right places, and yet super simple to just sit on the deck on the Andirondack chairs and look at the stars and the every flowing Illinois river! Even saw a large gathering of Egrets at night - some sort of commotion or territorial thing - not sure, need to look it up! Huge thank you!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mitch was a wonderful host and the cabin was exactly what it looked like in his photos. The space was super clean and well maintained. We felt right at home and safe the entire time. It was the most relaxing trip we’ve been on! Beautiful views, great bird watching, the hot tub and chiminea were amazing on the cooler nights. I can’t wait to come back!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,So happy that everything was as it seemed! Just like the pictures online and all amenities that were listed were available. Such a beautiful cabin and location. Mitch was very informative and quick to answer any questions. Stay here if you’d like a peaceful getaway in nature.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed our weekend get away. It was nice to unplug for a day and watch the wide life and the kayakers float down the river. Will definitely be back!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I loved the A shape cabin! Everything was beautiful from the view to the inside. Definitely coming back!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Adorable! Great location. Great escape and peaceful view.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time here! Lovely little cabin and we enjoy that it was right off the water.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mitch was a great host and this place is one we would definitely come back to. The cabin was clean, beautifully decorated and had an amazing view of the river.
The only thing that would have made it better is if it had easier access to the water….. that steep ladder is a little janky and the path to get there was pretty rough. But otherwise, this place was great!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing views, such a fab place! Will be back!!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous, clean, and private cabin! Had a wonderful time. It was priceless waking up and looking outside to see a beautiful view of the river. Host was responsive to any questions. Highly recommend"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mitch’s cabin is absolutely amazing! I’ve never seen a comparable cabin on the river. It was immaculately clean upon arrival, beautifully decorated, perfectly comfortable. We could retire to a place like this and live the rest of our days on the back deck sipping coffee and taking in nature. The river itself in this spot is perfect. We saw tons of fish swimming by from the deck and birds soaring overhead. It was super easy to just walk down and hop in, which is pretty uncommon We will be back!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wow is all we can say. Beautiful condo directly on the river. Has private river access which was so nice!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place with modern interior. Could use blinds on the entry door window for privacy and perhaps the patio doors as well. If you’re sensitive to the smell of sulfur please advise water well is high content for sure. Other than that…nice place for the money.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at the Cabin by the river. If you're looking for somewhere to get away with that special person, look no further. It was very clean, modern and secluded. Wildlife was abundant on the river with the occasional floater heading downstream, all viewed comfortably from the back porch. We will always remember our first stay and we look forward to going back."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mitch was very friendly and communicative. The space was beautiful with a fantastic view. It was very peaceful having a morning cup of coffee listening to the river rolling by. It is definitely worth the stay when traveling through Tahlequah!

It was located so we could easily walk the downtown Tahlequah area. We visited quaint and charming stores and eateries. The Cherokee Museum is a must visit and were able to walk there too. We all slept great, the mattresses were comfy. Paula was quick to respond and we loved the treats she left from the local bakery. I would stay there again and would highly recommend booking Paula’s home."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Always enjoy staying at Paula and Tammy's place. They are great hosts, super responsive and flexible. Look forward to booking the place again."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my families second time to stay here. That should say enough. This place is great. Walk to restaurants and shops. Once we arrived there was no need to drive anywhere.
Extremely clean, kitchen has everything you need and then some. Grill outside in the private patio. Family games provided.

Really enjoyed the back yard picnic table, and the outdoor lights were a nice touch. The front porch swing was a plus. The kitchen had what was needed for cooking meals. Very spacious. Good location, close to everything, downtown, the river, a park, restaurants and the casino. I would definitely recommend this house and would definitely stay here again if my travels took me that way again. Thank you."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,I absolutely love staying at Paula’s air bnb. Right when you walk in you feel at home. It was the perfect distance from town which was great.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Thank you Paula! My family and I had a wonderful time. It was my intent to have a ""home"" experience and cook for my son and family. I was able to do just that.

Close to downtown, very close to our family members who reside in Tahlequah. House was very well decorated, very clean, had a washer and dryer. Had a great outdoor area in back.

There’s even various chargers for your use and smart TVs throughout the home! WiFi that’s fast! The yard is spacious and very cleaned up. We were left wanting for nothing as the kitchen was fully stocked and the bathrooms had toilet paper and lots of clean towels. The keurig with pods was a bonus we took advantage of!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Darling place. Spacious for our family of four.
2023-05-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"First appearances were nice but there were a few things that were off putting. Both shower heads were awful, spraying water in every direction but where it’s supposed to go, making it very hard to wash long hair. There was some trash on the floor in the closet, stained towels, the bath mat was already damp, bedroom rug needed to be vacuumed, and a noticeable layer of dust on the ceiling fans. The bed was so hard we both woke up aching. The sofa felt like it might collapse. The house also isn’t level, it almost felt like walking in a fun house at first. We only stayed in the main bedroom, so could have missed some things in the others. One or two of these issues could be overlooked, but for the price point, I’d expect it to be a bit more clean, comfortable, and functional."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Will definitely be staying here again on my next float trip! Great location with big yard and back porch. Super responsive host and beautiful home. Excited for my next trip up.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,I was happy to stay but I thought future guest would like to be aware that two of the beds were hard. The master bed ( king) was soft. The place looked really nice and had everything that we needed for our stay. Great unobtrusive host.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Stayed here to float the river with our two dogs. Edna’s place was super clean and conveniently located.

Will definitely keep this place in mind for future visits to the Illinois River!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This sweet little bungalow was clean and spacious enough for our family of 4. Easy access off a main road. I will say the area was a little busy but noise was not a problem. The house was clean and well stocked with full size shampoo, conditioner and body wash. Plenty of towels and all request upon leaving the house were easy to obtain. I will say the coffee was French roast which I’m not a fan but my sister house by the same host had some regular and they worked out fine. Neighborhood wasn’t what I expected but seemed fine and we never worried about the safety of our cars or things. I would definitely stay here again. Great job Edna."

The kitchen is well stocked with utensils and a nice gas stove. The propane grill outside is new and full of propane. The beds are comfortable and clean. The bathrooms have plenty of clean towels, and nice hot water and pressure for a shower after floating the river. Also, the washer and dryer with laundry detergent for washing those river clothes is nice. The host, Edna, is kind and professional with communications. I would recommend this place to anyone! You will not be disappointed."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay loved every minute.
2022-05-01,4,Group trip,"This was our first time staying at an Airbnb and we really enjoyed the experience. Edna was great to communicate with, check in and check out was very simple and the house was exactly what we were expecting. Loved having a washing machine and dryer and a full kitchen for meals! The two front bedrooms and bathroom are on the smaller side but we were able to make it work. The only down side is the traffic on the main road behind the house was very load through the night Friday and Saturday. We will certainly consider staying here again next time we are in town."

Property owner was very attentive to any questions I had, and extremely helpful with any request. Home was spotless and wonderfully stocked. I'm a big coffee drinker, and having a well stocked coffee bar was a big plus 🙂 I recommend this property for business or pleasure. Added bonus... I was able to sit on back porch and have my early morning cup of coffee with a beautiful family of deers grazing in the back yard. Coming from a big city, it was an amazing experience 🥰"

2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,So we stayed 4 nights here. We were both really surprised how nice this place was on the I side. The rooms are good size. Master bedroom was great especially with a massive closet. All our luggage was able to fit in there and didn't even take up half the space. Entior design was really nice and cozy. We had zero issues other than maybe a little road noise from the highway but nothing too bad. I would certainly recommend this location if you are headed to Tahlequah in the future.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in Tahlequah!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place. Extremely clean. Photos are accurate. Very comfortable. As my first Airbnb, I was extremely impressed and will likely never stay in a hotel again.

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tastefully decorated and updated. Great location if your activities keep you in town. It’s a larger lot and was well lit for my after dark arrival. It includes special touches like well placed phone charging cables and coffee station.
2021-11-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Places was really good other than a big bug problem. Very good place/host other than that.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"An issue was noted when we first arrived,but it was addressed quickly. the house was perfect for our two week stay. it was decorated beautifully, well stocked with coffee, cleaning supplies, paper products and towels. The furniture was comfortable and seeing the deer in the yard in the morning was an added bonus. Also, when we needed to extend our stay by one night, Edna worked with us to make that possible."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,This home was ideal for our needs. My husband had a quiet office space with reliable internet access while working remotely. I enjoyed setting up a sewing table under the picture window in laundry room and enjoyed my hobby and occasional visits by neighborhood deer. The location gave us great access to family visits both in town and out on the River. Decor was fresh and well supplied. Hope this place will be available next time we need it. Thanks

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay. We have enjoyed it and hope to get to visit again soon. We get to visit with our daughter that lives there. We love the surroundings and that Cordelia is there if needed or request her help but otherwise you just get to enjoy your stay without interruption. Thank you again for a wonderful visit. It was relaxing for us especially this time since the towns where we live and work were hit by tornadoes two weeks before our visit. It was so nice to have a place to rest. We did not suffer any damage but the loss to our communities was great and it was nice to get away for a couple of days. Our trip was planned before the tornadoes and we were ready to have a restful quite place to stay.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay and highly recommend this location.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful place to stay!
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The smokehouse was stunning and unique. It was interesting to stay in a round building with a sense of history and modern conveniences. We loved the outdoor pavilion and the friendly chickens that occasionally roamed about the property. The property is in a quiet leafy neighborhood and is only blocks from town center.
Cordelia replied quickly and was helpful. We would definitely stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place to stay!! We will stay again when we are in the area.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The smoke house conversion was a charming and comfortable stay for the two days we spent exploring down memory lane on only two returns to Tahlequah since we lived there and worked in the Hastings Hospital. Cordelia was a helpful host and even had excellent free range chicken eggs available to us to enhance our cooking in the cottage.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was nice to spend Easter there with my boyfriend and 2 kids, such a great experience overall!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I were visiting family in Tahlequah. Cordelia's place is unique, beautiful and as described. We will stay here again if we have opportunity."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Smokehouse was a complete delight! Charming with so many touches that made it a perfect stay! Cordelia has thought of everything!
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay! Close to town but had a private feel.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,I stay in a lot of Airbnbs for work and this was one of my favorite. Very cozy and cute. Everything you need. Fast communication from host. I would return
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute place. Very comfortable and clean. Everything you need and close to town. Would absolutely stay again.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Smokehouse is a family favorite; so cute, comfy, and accommodating. Cordelia has it stocked with everything we would need for a stay in Tahlequah. With a daughter in college at NSU, we are in town from Dallas often. I've tried other Airbnbs when popping in alone and wanting to be closer to events and activities concerning my university student, but have to say, Cordelia's is the best value by far for all she provides- plus, she's still in close enough proximity to the college and town. Highly, highly recommend! We will be back, again and again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Everything was as nice as described. And the home itself is a one-of-a-kind. We have already recommended it.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was wonderful. My husband was raised in his family's 100 plus year old farmhouse so we love the historical place. We felt right at home. We love the walkin shower since we are older. It was quite and peaceful. We were close to restaurants and shopping areas. We are hoping to visit again in a few months. Thank you for such a wonderful place to stay.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Super cute spot! Very unique and and quiet but still conveniently located. Would recommend and will stay again. Thank you Cordelia!!!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The smokehouse was really nice. it was cleaning cozy we enjoyed our time there. the host she was very nice and friendly.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was a unique and fun place to stay!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for a comfortable place to rest.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the Smokehouse was great. The house was decorated very nicely, with period correct accents. The kitchen was supplied with many things you might need and more. The bathroom is excellent, great shower. There is a lovely, private garden on the property with lots of room for out door meals or just relaxing."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,As described. Excellent!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place. No issues whatsoever.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cordelia was an absolute pleasure to stay with. my brother and I felt right at home, and her communication was top-notch. such a peaceful and quiet stay. I HIGHLY recommend this spot to anyone traveling through or to Talequah."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I've been interested in Cordelia's Cherokee smokehouse listing for some time, and our recent visit did not disappoint. The place was perfect for time spent in beautiful Tahlequah with my son, getting my daughter settled into NSU. I needed to work which I was able to enjoy on the veranda looking out over the chickens with no problems due to strong wifi. (Great change of pace as opposed to my peers who were Zoom meeting with me from our Dallas conference room and the trafffic that many were late because of and complaining about!) The smokehouse is close to the main house but we never saw another soul except Cordelia, and only upon our arrival. Though we ate our meals in town, the place has everything one might need for a stay. I particularly enjoyed the cute bathroom and modern shower. I'll be visiting my daughter very often and will look to book with Cordelia again soon."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful cottage with a blend of quaint history and modern amenities. The sheltered garden was a peaceful oasis. The chickens were amusing, too."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cordelia’s place is gorgeous. The cottage is such a charmer and the grounds (and chickens!) are beautiful. You feel super secluded even though you are in town! We will be back again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed the peace and quiet. The outside deck and patio area was relaxing and exceeded our expectations.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The smokehouse was absolutely beautiful! Cordelia was very friendly and a great host overall. We spent our first night enjoying the porch-swings on the outdoor covered patio. There were outdoor fans and provided bug spray which was a great addition! The shower had consistent temperature and was very spacious. The covered parking area was nice; though, do note that larger vehicles may not fit as well. Our full-size pickup made it, but we had to tuck in the side mirrors. One last thing to note, our maps app took us to the wrong street. I submitted a request on the maps app to adjust the directions, but if you’re lost, just search for The Blue Feather Bed and Breakfast. Overall a great stay!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,great place to stay. host Cordelia was very accommodating. recommend this place.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Really enjoyed it.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a unique and charming place to stay! Our family loved the smokehouse cottage and the beautiful property. Location was convenient to the quaint downtown, museums, and local hiking trails. The kitchen was well-stocked and the cottage had all needed ameneties. Host was friendly and great communication leading up to our stay. Highly recommend!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really loved Cordelia's place and have been here before. Not only is it very peaceful, clean and beautiful, it's very convenient to the location where my husband's dad is living. We really appreciate this little bit of heaven and the hostess, right where we need both."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved this place! Staying in a historic building is a wonderful opportunity. Hostess was very quick to answer questions and kind.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the most charming Airbnb I have ever stayed at. The space was perfect, cozy and inviting and the kitchen was equipped for cooking. There were places to read and have conversations. Even though it is in town we felt like we were in a cottage in secluded area. I want to go back in warmer weather so we can enjoy the garden and the patio."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The smokehouse, not Smokey, was a cozy and inviting place to stay. Unique in its history and surroundings. We stayed in winter, during the summer I would think the grounds would be reminiscent of an old English garden, not the formal type."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful and private place allowed us to come and go at our leisure. The area itself was gorgeous and the inside was well kept and clean. We checked in with no issues and had all numbers available to us if any questions arose. Cordelia provided a beautiful place to escape for the weekend.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, lovely home and pretty garden area. Would stay again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,A wonderful and unique place to stay right in town although it feels like it's out in the country. It has everything we needed for our few days there. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,a cute little gem tucked away off of the street and very private. a very unique and surprisingly country place to stay inside a city with a lot of history.
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,It is super cute!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very homey place to stay. It feels like you’re secluded in the country but you’re actually in town. Amazing historical place to stay!

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable, will stay there again"

a little slice of heaven"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My wife and I and our 3 year old daughter had a lovely stay here. The history of the building is fascinating, and the property is situated on a beautifully manicured garden complete with fountains and a shaded deck. The house was comfortable and had everything we needed, and the location was convenient to central Tahlequah while still tucked away and private. Thanks for a great stay!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful gem located in the heart of Tahlequah! The history of the home was alluring, but the charming setting is what we loved the most. Beautiful gardens, perfectly decorated home, clean and modern, and romantically secluded.
We will definitely be back!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We love staying here!
2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very unique place with the outdoor space, the renovated smokehouse, and my GF loved setting outside watching the chickens. Google made it a little difficult to find entrance. We would def stay again if in the area."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The pictures posted here do not do this place justice! My family and I enjoyed our visit so much! We will definitely be back to visit.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Smokehouse Airbnb is set in a park like setting with a private parking area and entrance. Although located not far from a major highway, it is very quiet and serene. The smokehouse is a ""one of a kind"" with an interesting history. We found it to be very clean and well furnished. Host Cordelia responded to emails, but was not at all intrusive. The Smokehouse Airbnb is truly a gem."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little house was super cute and just spacious enough for the 3 of us when we stayed. It’s right in town, though pretty secluded, it didn’t feel like we were in a busy area at all. Beds were comfortable, the house was clean and the kitchen was stocked with anything needed for cooking a meal. The area around the house would be fabulous to sit outside and relax the day away, it rained most of the time we were there so we didn’t get to enjoy that. Cordelia made check-in easy and even texted to check on us after we arrived. We would definitely stay here again!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Went great.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What an incredible find. Tucked away behind a beautiful BnB is this historical smokehouse with everything you need and then some. You will want for nothing during stay here. Ample heaters or AC to regulate the temp to your desired level throughout the dwelling major plus in my book. We only used the downstairs bed but the upstairs appeared to the same quality as downstairs bed and I found it quite comfortable. Parking was ample and directions were both concise and accurate. All and all a fantastic stay and we are quite interested in a stay at the BnB as well as a repeat stay at The Smokehouse.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Historic Smokehouse is a charming and unique place to stay in Tahlequah! Cordelia is a great host and you feel like you are in your own peaceful space. I hope to stay there again on a future visit.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a neat, unique cottage! Cordelia is a wonderful hostess. Highly recommend this hidden gem!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I honestly said ""I think I could live here!""
This place is a wonderfully planned out small space. Hooks, shelving, nooks all in the right places. I didn't have enough time in town to fully enjoy this lovely home, but the time I did have just made me happy. Don't forget to peek under the stairs :)
I really enjoyed choosing from a nice selection of different pottery mugs for my coffee. Huge, beautifully tiled shower with no water issues was also very nice. Many of the switches in the home are labeled, which I very much appreciate.
Cozy, fluffy and warm bedding made for a great night's sleep. Plenty of space heaters available for any comfort level on cool spring nights.
The sitting area in the living space was great for reading next to a large clean window that brought the outside in. It was a bit cool for me to enjoy the front door chairs which listen into a gentle trickling fountain and nature calls of birds, but the indoor space was lovely, too.
I had been traveling a bit, so the washer and dryer were a big bonus to run a small load to get me through my next several days.
If you're away from your home church, I found Roots Church in downtown Tahlequah at the old Dream Theater to be a welcoming family on the Sunday I was passing through.
Close to the city and happenings and highways, yet a very quiet neighborhood secluded by the trees of the property. I really enjoyed being here and also knowing its history was pretty cool, too."
