I will definitely stay with Marianne every visit."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,While there were a few issues Mariana addressed each one in a timely fashion. Enjoyed the stay as in the past.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A cozy, clean unit with parking was perfectly located to visit friends in Lakeland. Kitchen had all we needed. Quiet neighborhood & close to the historic center & multiple lakes. Would recommend it & also stay again next time."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There are several reasons why my wife and I decided to stay at Mariana's Place. The price was reasonable which is what initially attracted us this place. The description and the pictures were nice, but we found it to be better than we expected. Mariana messaged us daily to make sure everything was in order which it was. All in all staying here was wonderful and well worth the price we paid."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This homewas super cozy & inviting. The coach & bed were very comfortable. I felt very relaxed & calm there
I could easily live there."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mariana's place was truly a home away from home. We were there for a week and loved having our own place in the historical Dixieland Neighborhood. We loved feeling like a local and not a tourist in a stuffy hotel room. We would recommend this home to anyone who wants to feel comfortable, relaxed and cared for!!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is by far one of the best places I have stayed at. I felt so safe ! The host texted me everyday to make sure I was okay and any issue I had she answered right away! Everything was spotless clean!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Mariana's place.üôèüèº
The apartment is really very nice and stylishly designed! You were right at least.
Large kitchen with everything you need. The apartment was very clean.
The TV was a SmartTV, which also allowed you to use Netflix and Co.
It is a highly recommended accommodation and Mariana has always made every effort to ensure that everything runs smoothly and pleasantly.
The only downside (for all smokers), there is an absolute no smoking on the entire property, even outside! In case of disregard, it will be expensive
Unfortunately, we were affected here and had to enjoy our morning cafe & cigarette on the walkway.üòÖ"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect set up for a stay in Lakeland
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had an excellent stay. Great place
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The unit was exactly as described. It was perfect space wise for two people and was very comfortable, The kitchen had everything we needed as we tend to eat in a lot when we travel. The only thing missing was a corkscrew (minor thing) but Mariana delivered one to our front door the next day. It is convenient to stores, restaurants, and golf courses. If I could have rated Mariana higher than a five (5) in communication, i would have. She was very attentive and prompt with her replies. Parking is in front of the unit and can be a little challenging as there is a school nearby and parents line up to pick up there students, but if you pay attention to times and what you're doing, it's NO PROBLEM at all. I would definitely recommend this unit!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Mariana‚Äôs place was a pure treat! It was a great apartment just perfectly suited to the needs of two of us here in Lakeland for a conference. The bed was great, the kitchen and dining area nice, and the living room comfy for the brief rests we needed during the busy week. Quiet and peaceful in a relaxed neighborhood was so much better than any busy hotel. Mariana was attentive to any questions and needs and we were well taken care of! Thanks again for a beautiful stay!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mariana's place was PERFECT!!! The pictures were point on if the home and it was so inviting. The couch was very comfortable to relax after long days. I wasn't there much as I was there for an event at the RP Center (5 minutes away). However, let's just get a ""hallelujah"" for the comfort of the bed! It was amazing.
I loved the office/ dressing/ washer and dryer area..... Perfect for meetings.
I will definitely be staying again when in the area and would highly recommend it.
Mariana was very communicative and responsive. Would check to see if I needed anything but was not intrusive."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my second time using Marianna‚Äôs place. Her place has become my primary preferred place to rent when I have to make campus visits. She is wonderful to work with and pays attention to the details. There are so many nice things about her place and I like it that it is close to restaurants and a main Highway. I hope her place is available the next time I have to make this trip.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for a weekend for a family wedding and we felt very safe and comfortable. The neighborhood is peaceful. The bnb was easy to locate, easy instructions to get in and the house was clean. The area doesn‚Äôt have much locally so nothing is really walkable. But Ubers we‚Äôre easy to use to get around. I asked for a later check out time due to flight delays and she happily accommodated."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first Airbnb stay, so others have a lot to live up to.
We used the kitchen that was adequately supplied for our basic needs.
The office in the laundry room/closet was quiet and away from the TV noise.
The bed was comfortable, which is always a plus!
My husband enjoyed drinking his morning coffee in the covered front porch.
Would love to stay here again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is so cute and perfect for a couple or single traveler. It‚Äôs everything you need and very aesthetically pleasing. The only small issue is the bathroom door, it‚Äôs hard to open and close, but that‚Äôs not enough for me to give this space less than five stars! I‚Äôd rent from Mariana again for sure!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really nice place, very clean.
If the opportunity comes up again, most definitely will book again!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Host was EXTREMELY accommodating and responsive. I had a few amendments that needed to be made last minute and she was very helpful in assisting with that.
The place is adorable, looks just like the photos. Private, great spot and nice vibe inside.
It would have been 5 or 6 stars if I could all round if it weren‚Äôt for some minor cleanliness items that were already discussed with the host. Overall, great stay."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mariana is a great host - she checks in to make sure everything is ok and is quick to respond. The place is clean, and has a large common area and bedroom. The kitchen had everything I needed. I was pleased at how close the place was to Lake Hollingsworth, a nearby park, and downtown. You can walk to several restaurants nearby."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great base for a Lakeland visit. Super clean and newly renovated. Bigger than in the photos. Comfortable bed. Easy off street parking. We really liked that you could walk to the lake in the morning and to a local fun pub at night. Quiet family neighborhood.
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was perfect for my bf and I. Walkable to bars and restaurants if you are down for a 10-15 min walk. The location is amazing. The only bad thing I can say is it you are trying to cook some of the stovetop burners will turn on and then turn off‚Ä¶it was kind of weird. While we were there there was also a huge man hunt for a guy on the block which made us a little scared but other than that it was a fun vacation. Thank you.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute little spot that was perfect for our visit to Lakeland and surrounding areas. We had no trouble throughout any of the stay and Mariana was proactive about communicating with us. Would definitely stay here again!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This 1920s bungalow in Dixieland is just as described. It is clean, updated and decorated with comfortable furnishings. It is spacious for one or two people. Not pictured is a nook off the bedroom that includes a desk, as well as a washer and dryer. As others have stated in their reviews, the hot and cold are reversed in the bathroom. It is a minor inconvenience. The kitchen has everything needed for meal preparation.
The home is located across the street from an elementary school and within walking distance of a lovely park. The driveway is tight but manageable when care is taken to back into the assigned parking spot.
If you‚Äôre a golfer, there are many courses from which to choose. If you do not have a rental car, an Uber to Big Cypress Golf Club is $10 plus gratuity.
If you‚Äôre a teacher attending the Center for Guided Montessori Studies at Lakeland Montessori School, this bungalow is a great option as a short-term rental."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was very comfortable and homey. It was also quiet at night so sleeping and relaxing was very easy.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was great. Good location across from a school. I had a hard time with stream tv . She got back to me right away. Was good place to stay!!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect for one or two people. Convenient to SUN n FUN which is why I was there. Great coffee shop ‚ÄúConcord‚Äùa few blocks away and many restaurants within short driving.

Mariana is a really good host
Thanks/"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great house in a convenient location. We were able to bike to all of the beautiful Lakes easily. This house is a duplex but we never heard the neighbors. I recommend this house if your visiting Lakeland.

2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely, small home in a nice residential neighborhood. A school and park are right across the street - great place to work off our Thanksgiving dinner! Parking is very tight as there are 2 units & requires backing into fairly busy street. The plumbing is switched in shower so hot is cold & vice versa. Small quirk that adds to the charm of this older home! Great choice for a single or couple traveler."

The look and the feel showed the care that Mariana put into making it an enjoyable place to stay. It is indeed a wonderful place to stay. It is close to stores and restaurants.

We had everything we needed during our stay and highly recommend this place.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Would recommend!
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Mariana and her family's creation of air bnbs as a business is definitely very fitting. they have a talent for interior design (I wish my house was designed how the did theirs) and they have an aparent love to make people's stay while traveling as smoothe as possible.

We were able to cook and enjoy our time in a very clean space as well as a very tranquil neighborhood. There is even a Walgreens within walking distance to get anything else needed in a moments notice.
Prior to our stay, I wrote to her asking if there was an iron and an ironing board in the unit. She stated there was a steamer. Which is fine of course. She then proceeded to purchase an iron and a small ironing board for our use prior to our arrival. That was not necessary but definitely greatly appreciated. Very kind and thoughtful of her. One can tell she genuinely cares about being a host. I will definitely stay again for sure."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were in town for a competition and shared this space with a few others. It accommodates everyone comfortably. The beds were pretty comfortable and there were plenty of linens and items in the kitchen to work with. The bedroom doors are thin so you can hear the noise from the kitchen. Other than that, our stay was fine!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was not only welcoming and immaculately clean, it was located in a beautiful neighborhood that was close to all the places we needed to be. Stephen proactively reached out to us checking in with us before during and after our visit.
We had plenty of room for the four of us visiting- and the place had all the amenities from home. I was able to cook some special meals for my family and we could relax in the living room to watch tv and do laundry when we needed to.
The checkout instructions were clear and easy.
This is a true gem in Lakeland and Stephen and Madalyn were perfect hosts. We will definitely return for the next time we are in Lakeland- which we likely will be since our daughter performs often with the Lakeland Community Theatre.
I can not recommend this place and these hosts enough!!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Awesome house, clean, supplied well with name brand products. Plenty of everything. There will be no running out of toilet paper in this house!

Would definitely stay there again when the opportunity arises."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"Open floor plan is nice. Kitchen is big with lots of space. The living room could use another small couch or chair. The couch can seat 3 people, everyone else needs to sit at the kitchen table. The back yard is great for dogs!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Stephen and Madalyn‚Äôs was the perfect place for us to stay while attending a conference. It was peaceful and private, and Stephen was very responsive to our needs. The lake is literally one block away and is very beautiful. There are grocery stores and good restaurants only a short drive away. We would definitely stay here again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,We were having one house renovated and then moving which is good stress but still stress. This place was a perfectly peaceful retreat close to great restaurants and Lakeland Town Center. It also has easy access to Polk Parkway. Thus is a lovely home and our little dogs loved it too. Gorgeous tile floors. Well stocked with things you need. Amazing laundry. Just a great place. Thank you Steve and Madylyn for the best communication and making us feel at peace.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice and quiet neighborhood, close to where we wanted to be .
AC worked fine . We requested extra hour for check out and were granted .
I am just wondering , how come they charge hefty cleaning fees and expect us to clean before we leave the house .
I would have preferred putting dishes in washer , (luckily we didn‚Äôt have many),turn it on and leave . It was expected to put them back in its place , so we have to plan accordingly."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"This house was so beautiful, maintained, and super clean. Stephen and Madalyn were great hosts, and very responsive. They even provided a link to a list of restaurants near the area. We loved the recommendations and used them!
This house is in a lovely area and truly felt like home staying here. We miss it already!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The host was extremely easy to work with and the house was exactly what we needed. We stayed for a baseball tournament near Lake Myrtle Sports Complex. It was convenient to get to and lots around for food. We have no regrets in staying there and would stay again.
Hosts are very proactive and made sure my family was comfortable. Was very open to criticism and fixed any issues we had immediately.
A+++"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A very nice place to stay in
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Loved our stay here! We had plans to come down and do a day at Disney and Tampa and it was only a 40 minute drive to both. They were very welcoming to our small dogs (hard to find!) and the pups certainly enjoyed the backyard. The hosts were very responsive when we arrived late into the night after a storm and had some questions regarding the lock. As for the stay itself, the house was exactly like the pictures and located on a lovely, quiet brick lined street. There was a great supply of household items such as toilet paper, which I‚Äôve experienced, can be very limited at other rentals I‚Äôve been to along with other items such as shampoo and conditioner. All in all, we had a fabulous time and plan on coming back here when we return. Thank you both for making my weekend with my grandparents a breeze!"

This was my first Airbnb room, and I know they are not all like this, but Melanie‚Äôs private entrance suite was perfect! I am starting to travel to Legoland for business and I wanted to cut some drive time (interstate 4, specifically). Arriving on Sunday night at 9pm, I had a very restful night‚Äôs sleep and around a 20 minute or so drive time the next day. Her attention to detail is remarkable (!!!) and I will stay again!
The private entrance and private backyard were amazing. It was enchanting, especially in the morning when I woke up to a treasure - natural beautiful landscaping and a well placed yoga mat that was available for use.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second year staying here as we have an annual competition nearby, same time every year. We love the neighborhood, it‚Äôs close to RP Funding Center, and always very clean and nice to have two bedrooms and a kitchenette vs a small hotel room. Matt is very informative and responsive as a host. We will definitely stay again."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our second time at Matt's place and we will definitely be back again! Clean, cozy, and amazing location central to all of Lakeland. A few ""amenities"" not listed that really are great perks: 1) great overhead lighting in the living room, but also lots of lamp lighting if soft and mellow is more your jam! 2) hooks EVERYWHERE! So great for towels, keys, purse, sweatshirt, lifejackets, clothes, etc etc! Also can we talk about those beds?? I would spent $80/night to sleep in a cardboard box if it came with that bed. Having laundry is a huge plus when you're traveling light and/or with kids. Overall, 200% recommend if you're looking for a home base in Lakeland!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay here. The place was clean and really nice. We had a great stay and Matt was great at responding fast and gave clear instructions in what to do.

There is no microwave, but there is a great toaster oven and heating element in the kitchenette. Not a deal breaker but good to know ahead of time. Highly recommend!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"was very happy here and if the schedule works will stay again. responsive and helpful host and kind and proactive even when I ask questions that were kinda... ""duh"" like how to unset the shower drain. It's full house but divided into separate ""apartments"" to rent, but with totally separate entrances, very private. I saw another car while I stayed but otherwise never heard or saw any other people staying in other parts of the property. Has a under-counter fridge which was perfect for leftovers and lunch sandwiches, because in Lakeland there are so many scrumptious restaurants we ate out for dinner the few days we were there. Very pleasant, very comfortable. thank you!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first Airbnb experience and I had a blast. The location was in a nice, rich neighborhood that made walking and enjoying outsides easy."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Finally, a place with soft beds!!!! This is a very important issue with me since I can't sleep at all on a hard or medium firm mattress. What a great night sleep! Nice place to hang out and be comfortable in the evenings ... cute, modern and clean. Host is very responsive and friendly."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location. The kitchen is small so don‚Äôt expect to ‚Äúcook‚Äù per se and the apartment refrigerator doesn‚Äôt have a freezer, but no big deal if you eat out at the plethora of restaurants and DoorDash. The price is worth any of the minor inconvenience of not having a large kitchen."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Matt was a great host! He was very responsive and accommodating. The place was clean quiet and comfortable. thank you!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place just a small walk from the beautiful Lake Hollingsworth with a fabulous walking path and great views.

2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a nice time at this AirBnB. Stayed over the weekend for gymnastics competition and it was just right for our little family.
The only slight complain is the bunk bed is extremely loud,
Must sleep without movement.
Everything else was perfect!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for being such a wonderful host!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay would do it again no problems what do ever
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,Lovely place in a lovely neighbourhood. Very clean and very cozy. Would recommend
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"So well designed!!! I‚Äôve stayed at dozens of airbnbs and this is one of the best uses of space I‚Äôve seen! It‚Äôs a small add on apartment to the main house, but we never felt crowded. The furniture was so nice and comfortable, and the location couldn‚Äôt be beat. I wish every Airbnb was like this!"
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Another party and ours expected exclusive use of entire home. Although both groups worked in out, Matt's description of the rental was misunderstood by both parties. Each made do with fewer rooms than expected. Perhaps each group just made a poor assumptions that could be avoided with a clearer description. Suggestions 1. Have a paper towel roll in kitchen area. 2 Post a copy of the written rules in the area. 3. Have instructions on how to use remote control and TVs. 4. Post a reminder of shoes off request on outer door. In Summary it was a lovely place in a lovely neighborhood and besides confusion with the other group I was very satisfied and recommend highly. Thanks Matt"
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything i figured it was by the listing, it was. Quaily mattresses on the bed frames and decent tv's to watch while winding down at the end of the day."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The location was the strongest selling point for us, and the price was cheaper compared to anything else we could find in the vicinity. If you're looking for a place to rest your weary head after the end of long days this is the place for you. The kitchenette is very small but serviceable for what we needed. We would definitely stay again, the tiny things like single ply toilet paper and no Kleenex were easily remedied. :)"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My stay at Matt‚Äôs was great. Small place that had everything I needed. Place was clean. Neighborhood was very quiet and felt very safe. Walking distance to park and lake. Great for someone coming with children or like to take leisurely walks.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! The place perfectly matched the pictures and Matt was super responsive and always ready to help in anyway. The location is by downtown and near alot of good resturants. Overall, if youre in lakeland this is a great place to stay."
2023-01-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"For a family that would have to pay for two hotel rooms, this would be a good deal, but for the two of us, I kind of wish we had chosen a hotel instead. The furniture was uncomfortable and gave me a migraine. There was some confusion trying to find the check in information and the door knob is so close to the door jam that it pinches your finger if you‚Äôre not careful turning it. There was no shampoo/conditioner in the bathroom, the kitchen is awkward and tiny crammed inside the laundry closet with the central air unit. It is in a beautiful area but not within walking distance to any restaurants or grocery stores. And since the house is divided into multiple rental units you hear others in the house. Very strict parking instructions and other rules. Just overall felt like a stressful stay instead of a valued guest. He kept emphasizing being a good guest but didn‚Äôt show he was a good host."
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very good just no way to open the door if you accidentally lock the door. Took me few hours to figure out how to get in the Door. Had no tool to get in the room at all.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great for three adults and a baby for a few days. Cute, clean little place walking distance to lake Hollingsworth."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Matt made our first time staying at an airbnb a pleasant one. The pack n play was a life saver traveling with a baby.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Matt‚Äôs place is so lovely! It was my first time in Florida and my parents‚Äô first time in the US and Matt was extremely helpful and hospitable. It is super cozy and had everything we needed for the week stay. The general area is also very peaceful and beautiful. Will definitely recommend and will book again! :)
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend this place is beautiful peaceful and convenient. On my next trip to Lakeland, I will definitely rent this place again if available!"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My week stay at this clean and cozy apartment was wonderful. Quiet neighborhood so was easy to for me and the my family to sleep. Whenever I come back to lakeland i will definitely look no other place. Thank you Matt for everything I appreciate it.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We did the reservation at the very last minute and Matt was very helpful, fast and responsive. Great use and accommodation of the space too!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The perfect place to stay in Lakeland. I rarely stay in an air bnb where the beds and pillows are comfortable but this house was the exception.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect apartment for no more than 4 people. It‚Äôs clean! Cozy! And enough room for a small family. Location its great. It is near a lake which has a trail around it, great for running. Central AC and fans were a plus! Private parking for your vehicle was also a plus. Will definitely recommend this to anyone"
2022-11-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was very clean and very comfortable. I just didn't like sharing the parking lot

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed at this property 3 times now and love it. I'm sure we'll say stay here more times in the future.

We had everything we needed and then some. Wifi worked great and beds were amazingly comfortable. Plus you are minutes away for everything we needed and Matt was quick to respond to any needs or questions. We would definitely stay again if in the area.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Kid friendly with toys and pack n play available. Perfect location in a great neighborhood!
2022-08-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,Airbnb is in fantastic location. House was being converted from single unit into a multiple unit(s) Airbnb. Arrived to find other half of house undergoing concrete work. Awoken Sunday morning at 8 am with more construction work. Seller is not easy to work with. Seller failed to disclose state of other half nor acknowledge that the other half was under construction. Hopefully by the time you stay the house will be completed and you don‚Äôt need to communicate with seller.

Thanks again, Matt!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great place to stay!
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Thought the unit was a stand alone structure based on description but it was very nice. Super clean and close to everything we needed. Thanks for having us
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great apartment! Love the location, clean and modern."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location and accommodations! Our party included two adults, a six-year old, and an infant. It was the perfect size. The location is very close to the main lake in Lakeland (if you‚Äôre a runner, it‚Äôs a great route‚Äîit‚Äôs a little under a 5k) as well as a local playground. Additionally, it was close to downtown, which has a ton of great places to eat. Matt was very responsive. I would definitely stay here again because A) the place is nice with an ideal location and B) Matt is awesome!"
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Love the location! Close to everything. I love that it is close to the lake. It's so pretty. Checking in was super easy. After talking with him he allowed me to check in early for a small fee. It was nice to have that as an option. The pictures make the place look bigger than it is. It's not tiny but in my head I thought it would be bigger. Everything has been updated nicely except for the shower/tub area. I thought for sure it would look nicer than it was. The shower worked very well. But just the decor of it. Old tile, water stained handles, etc. Just expected more from a new renovated place.
Overall though it was a very good place to stay though! I'd stay here again."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful 2/1 nestled in between lakes and posh homes. Very quiet neighborhood, with a walking path along the lake that has a bunch of black and white swans! Centrally located, ease of access to a lot of places. Matt made the check in and check out process very clear and easy. Will be back when we are back in this area. Much bigger than the pictures... Super clean, has a laundry area, kitchenette area, comfy couch and extra blankets."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lovey place,very quiet an cozy"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is clean and in a beautiful location! The host is very communicative. The kitchenette was more than enough for our needs. We only had 2 drawbacks and they are not necessarily bad things depending on what you are looking for. First of all the beds and pillows and VERY soft. If you like soft mattresses great! But we had trouble sleeping and ended up with a lot of back pain. Again that's very person specific. Secondly the suite is attached to the main house which means doors, dog barks, voices, etc carry through. The host was great about keeping sounds down at night. Unfortunately we were trying to nap in the day often. Ear plugs will fix that one if you have a weird sleep schedule like us. Otherwise the place was wonderful! This is by no means a negative review, but I often wish people would comment on mattresses and showers when im looking for a place to stay. (P.s. shower does get nice and hot)."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very easy access in and out of the house, great location and excellent communication with the host. Would definitely stay here again or recommend anyone to stay here for their trip to Lakeland."

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The bnb was so clean and felt so home-like. I could tell that a lot of time and care were put into the layout, decorations, and amenities."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Matt‚Äôs place was perfect for us! Exactly as described! We wouldn‚Äôt change a thing about it and plan on returning next year for our Florida trip!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Matt was extremely quick to respond to any questions and the property was exactly as advertised. We would definitely stay again next time we are in Lakeland!
2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,This was a cool little place to stay at. The neighborhood was very nice and the place was safe. I never felt like my children were unsafe at any time even when playing outside in the yard. I would stay here again for sure.
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,Nice place located in a great part of Lakeland. Really nice TV and good fast internet. It is attached to the main house so you do get noise from there sometimes but not a huge issue for me. I would stay again.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice clean place , very well located"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Very clean and comfortable. Beautiful area with a lake and walking trail very close. Not far from places to eat and things to do. The bed was the best I have slept on and maybe the reason my wife finally gets me to buy an adjustable mattress. Matt was very responsive and was a great help.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place and beautiful stay!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved this stay! The room is more spacious than the pictures portray. Very lovely. We also took a stroll down to the lake only a few minutes walk and it felt safe and welcoming. Would definitely stay again.

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little Airbnb was fantastic! There were just a few of us adults, but seems well suited for a small family as well. The location was nice and quiet and very convenient! And the beds were unbelievably comfortable, we slept really well!"
2021-03-01,2.0,Group trip,"I didn‚Äôt have a very positive experience staying at Matt‚Äôs place. The space was clean, but quite small and not well-suited for more than 2-3 people. There were a number of thoughtful touches and the host was very quick to respond. This said, the place was advertised as having a stove, and we quickly discovered that the tiny kitchenette does not allow for any meal prepping or cooking. This was a deal breaker, especially during a pandemic when you have a high care to avoid dining out."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is as advertised and in a great neighborhood. If you are in the market for some large space, this isn‚Äôt it though. However, it is so well designed and a lovely short-term stay. As mentioned before, the kitchen is tiny so that may be a problem for some. Other than that, I don‚Äôt really have any complaints!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really quality space and great location to get around Lakeland. My business partners stayed there and loved the space.

The space is very clean and stylish! Matt has a huge tv in the living space which we took full advantage of to watch the Super Bowl. While there isn‚Äôt a full kitchen, you there is enough to store drinks and reheat food. There was a hot plate but we didn‚Äôt use it. The washer and dryer is a plus.
We also felt really safe. Both in terms of neighborhood environment and Covid. There was hand sanitizer available! I also appreciated all the use of environmentally friendly products around the space.
I would definitely book here!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was perfect! Walking distance from the lake. Neighborhood is safe and quiet. The beds are so comfortable considering replacing my mattress now. Very clean, extra towels, and two smart TVs!!"

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great location by the lake. We really enjoyed walking around it! Also if you are going to Tampa or Orlando - this is a great spot. It‚Äôs right in the middle.

2020-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,This place is amazing! There were toys for my toddler and super comfortable beds. Also.. the shower pressure is on point. The renters in the main house are pretty noisy and are home all times during the day. Probably wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal if you are going to be out and about most of the time.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Matt was a great host and the place is well kept!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Definitely a cozy and clean place. Perfect for couples or a small family.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Matt's place is centrally located in Lakeland which was perfect for us. It's very clean and well appointed with new furniturec and comfortable beds. We appreciate their attention to details and cleanliness. The desk was a nice touch for getting work completed as well. Finding it at night the first night took a couple of turn arounds, but Matt and his wife were very responsive. Once we settled in for our six nights there, we were extremely pleased and will book again in the spring when we get to visit our son at college again."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We love the unit and the location. Matt is a great host and kind.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cheryl‚Äôs home is extremely beautiful cozy and most importantly clean! I I would give 10 stars but 5 is the max. Communication was amazing and I couldn‚Äôt be more happy with our choice this past weekend! I would recommend this house and any other house she‚Äôd own!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"In the travel industry there is a term called ""duty of care"". Meaning that companies sending employees on the road for work have a duty to ensure those people feel cared for and safe. Cheryl is a pro at ""duty of care"". I walked into her home expecting to have a long list of items to get at the store, but she had everything you could possibly need for the stay. When I was worried about the lovely plants in a storm, she came and made sure they were going to be safe from damage. The neighborhood is nearly silent in the evenings and the porch is really the star of the show. Highly recommend for a short or long stay."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed a wonderful stay during my work week at Cheryl‚Äôs abode. It was quiet and just what I needed to relax at the end of the day. Cheryl gave clear instructions and anything I went looking for, I found easily in the kitchen and bathroom. There were some neighborhood cats around but they were very skittish and kept to themselves."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cheryl‚Äôs hospitality is above and beyond. She has anticipated every need with an aesthetic eye.
I highly recommend her place. It is in a neighborhood that is convenient to all things Lakeland and sets the stage for a restful and enjoyable stay."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Cheryl is amazing! She thinks of everything!
The location of the bungalow is near everything we needed but still in a quiet neighborhood. The house is spotless and nicely decorated. Sitting on the porch is a great way to relax and enjoy the balmy weather. The shower has great hot water and water pressure; very invigorating start to the day! The bed is comfy and the kitchen has all the basics and more.
We enjoyed our stay and this is our go-to spot when staying in Lakeland. Book early to get a spot in this lovely home.
Cheryl is a 5-star hostess, very quick to respond to questions and concerns. She provides everything you need to be comfortable and enjoy your stay."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed 4 nights at this wonderful cottage in the historic district. We were within a few short miles of visiting our relatives who live in Lakeland. This home has plenty of room and we appreciated the snacks left for us in the kitchen. Added bonus was use of a washer & dryer. We never had that at any other Airbnb.
This home is well decorated and the front porch is to die for. üå¥ I sat on the porch many times enjoying the sunshine and peacefulness of the neighborhood. I even took a walk around the block on 3 days just to admire the other homes in the area. Plenty to do and lots of restaurant choices nearby. We recommend Black & Brew Coffee House downtown for coffee and breakfast. We went there twice! Fish City Grill was another favorite having dinner there our last night. Thank you for offering your home, Cheryl."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Worth every dollar. The space is gorgeous and in a great location. The home is super clean. All amenities and comforts were available. Cheryl was a fantastic host!

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Cheryl is indeed a Super Hostess! We had a beautiful. warm and inviting place to stay while in town to visit family. The house is within walking distance of Old Town. There is a beautiful front porch to sit with coffee in the morning and a cocktail at night while friendly neighbors stroll by. We had privacy , but Cheryl did check in regularly by text. We had everything that we needed and am hoping to return soon when we return for another visit."

We enjoyed walking to the lake and feeding the birds, my wife made friends with a neighborhood cat who walked with her, and the place is clean and perfectly appointed for a short stay. Restaurants nearby, easy to find, and very comfortable. We didn't cook much, but the kitchen has everything you would need! We are super hosts in Las Vegas, have hosted on AirBnB & other platforms since 2009, and stayed in MANY other homes, and this is one of the best airbnb homes we have EVER enjoyed!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great Place to stay. Very clean. Good communication with the host. Everything advertised and more. Would definitely recommend to others

Cheryl had everything I needed - from kitchenware to shampoo. The bed was so comfortable! The home is perfectly located in central Lakeland, close to downtown and Lake Hollingsworth. I can‚Äôt wait to come back and stay again!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"An incredible rental home with an even more incredible location. You cannot ask for a more attentive, understanding host than owner Cheryl. If you have done your homework regarding Lakeland and it's many lakes, and preservation efforts towards its water fowl, particularly the swans on Lake Morton, located in the center of the city, you would jump at the opportunity to rent this place. It's a classic craftsman style home that's impeccably decorated by it's owner (Cheryl), I am looking forward to our next stay at this home. Two strong thumbs up."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great place to stay for a single person or a couple. Very close to Lakes Morton and Hollingsworth. Close to shopping and downtown Lakeland. I recommend this cute bungalow.

The bed was comfortable, with high-quality bedding and pillows. The location was perfect, in a quiet, clean neighborhood. Cheryl was a terrific host. An activity we had planned was cancelled because of weather and she gave us a fantastic plan-B. This AirBnB is well worth the price. We will stay here again when we return to the area."

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We found the ¬´ charming bungalow ¬ª to be just the right space for the two of us for a long weekend seeing family we hadn‚Äôt seen since the Covid-19 shut down. Cheryl‚Äôs place was immaculate, which was very reassuring these days, tastefully decorated and simply furnished in keeping with the 1920s bungalow style, thoughtfully equipped with the essentials, and a delightful retreat, especially sitting on the beautifully renovated front porch amid the lush greenery. Wish we could have stayed longer! We will definitely look to stay at Cheryl‚Äôs place again in the future. Thank you for your wonderful hospitality!"

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here for three nights. The kitchen is well equipped with a pantry including spices, flour, coffee and just about any bowl, pan, mug, etc that one might need. The bed was really comfortable, a softer but firm mattress. We loved being so close to the Lake and enjoyed recreating in the area.
The only thing that I wish had been made more clear is that there is no smoking on the property. We went for walks to smoke but it would have been enjoyable to respectfully sit on the porch to do our thing."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was such a charming place to stay! So clean and cozy. Cheryl thinks of everything you might need. I highly recommend her place any day.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely home in a great location and very accommodating host!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Let me start off by saying that this place is a dream! Awesome quiet neighborhood with lake Hollingsworth in the mix, a lake they made this stay more at home. Let's forget the lake for a sec, the host is who made this stay even better. Cheryl, when you & potential renters read this I just wanted to say thank you from the bottom of my heart because you're genuine, very transparent, & completely there for your renters, no matter how many YouTube vids it takes. You made my renting experience super accommodating. Small note, I love clean cars so having no sprinklers was a huge plus in my book. The parking is great being right in front of the house. I will admit, when I received the instruction text the day before I kind of thought she was going to be a possible rough host, absolutely not, Cheryl was/is worth every penny. BY FAR the best place I've rented from Air BNB & will definitely be going back. I now have experienced Lakeland FL for the first time & really loved it, it was the peace for me guys. Also being located in between two big cities worked out very well with many possible activities, only if you're willing to take the trips out there. This home is perfect for just yourself or for a couple. Again, Cheryl you were the epitome of what a host is & absolutely nothing short of sheer professionalism and with a splash of spectacularism lol"

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This spot is even better than expected - better even than the photos. Cheryl has thought of everything when furnishing this home: ceiling fans where needed (even the porch), plush bath towels, quality bath products and we even had excellent coffee. The location is perfect for walks to Lake Hollingsworth and Florida Southern College. It's exceptionally clean and comfortable. Can't think of anything Cheryl could have provided to make this experience better."

2023-04-01,4.0,Group trip,"It was a good Airbnb. We had 6 guests, which is the max. However, I‚Äôd say only have 4 guests here. We tried to sleep on the couches, and I got the absolute worst sleep. Technically, yes, this place can fit 6, but idk about it being able to sleep 6. That‚Äôs where I feel like it wasn‚Äôt a good deal."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,beautiful and great place to stay
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Tatiana was very considerate and responsive in accommodating our request and answering inquiries. The place looks exactly as the photos. Everything was good! The only downside was the extra blanket for the sofa bed seemed like it hasn‚Äôt been washed in a long time because our friend said it stinks. Could‚Äôve used more cleaning and dusting. I woke up with a stuffy nose probably from the dust. Overall, it was a good place to stay overnight."

2023-03-01,3.0,Stayed over a week,"What was listed on airbnb was not accurate.. we were told it was not her fault.. as far as I know, that has not been corrected. Nice place for a short stay. Would not recommend long stay. Wifi modem in front unit, spotty to weak service in the back unit{ours} mentioned screens had been fixed by me on the porch, was told no one uses the outside of the house. Bushes that impeded front door were cut back 3 days before we left, we were there 2 1/2 months
Maintenance is not a priority, units are always rented, no time to maintain just repair."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay here. The location was perfect for a visit to Southeastern University. We walked to the College right across the street! It was quiet and spacious. Extremely clean, no dust anywhere, not even on the blinds, which is a constant battle at my own house. And not on the piano, which is also impressive since it probably does not get used much. It‚Äôs old, but very well done, not cluttered. Kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, all very clean. We didn‚Äôt cook there, but everything looked functional. Loved the desk and work chair in the bedroom as I had to do some work. WiFi was fine. Lots of storage in the closets. The shower had great water pressure and water was hot. Again, bathroom was older but very clean, no issues. Highly recommend and would absolutely stay again if my daughter chooses Southeastern."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This spot was perfect! it was 2 minutes from my brother's house where we went down to do some renovations. It was way closer than the hotels in the area and way more comfortable and clean which we really needed after working for 17 hours. the beds are so comfortable and it was easy to get our shows on the TV. The shower was great too after work- no problems in the house whatsoever. and there are plenty of places around to grab food quickly. we'll definitely book again next time we're in florida!

2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Next door to Southeastern University and not far from local Country Club on the lake. Quick drive into Lakeland and 20 minutes from airport. Very nicely set up. We thought the two beds were great. Couches were not quite as comfortable, make use of pillows to settle in for great tv time with Netflix or whatever. We watched a movie or two each night. It is right on a road so traffic noise is not terrible but occasionally there is some knucklehead coming by with loud mufflers or stereo. I am fairly sensitive to that sort of thing but did not need to use ear plugs. We got good needed rest here."

The kitchen has everything you could need, and the washer and dryer are so nice to have available. If you aren't from Florida, be aware that you may see Palmetto bugs in the unit.

highly recommended giving it try if you are looking for a nice comfortable house to call your own if only for a short time"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were here for 9 days felt like a home away from home. The world can be so small sometimes in connecting with the we found out they were fellow Canadians and too make it even crazier they had family that owns an airbnb right in our backyard. When we booked it we didn't realize we had friends a short distance away. If you stay here make sure you visit Circle B bar reserve it was one of our favorite spot to see a bunch of wildlife. The location is very central to Florida an hour give or take to both Tampa and Orlando airports. Close to Disney, Legoland, Busch gardens, Clearwater Beach. We made lots of day trips to all these places. If you wanted to stay close Lakeland has everything you need. Dont forget to try Fred's Restaurant southern home cooking buffet and Catfish country to get you catfish, gator and frog legs. Also when your in town make sure you get to Whiskey Bent BBQ supply. We would for sure stay here again. The McMasters and Hunter families."

2023-12-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nice sized house in a convenient location, safe neighborhood. A little disappointed in how minimal the furniture/decor was in the house. However we took pets and the open house/minimalist space and the fenced yard were perfect for our needs. But don‚Äôt expect to entertain here, minimal seating and not an inviting atmosphere.
One concern was lack of curtains on some of the windows. Anyone driving/walking near front or back of house can see in day or night. Also, all smoke detectors were disconnected.
We had a good stay, but felt improvements could be made. Thank you for your hospitality!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Let me start off by saying, the photos do not do this place justice. The house was beautiful inside and out. It had lots of space and the host thought of everything. Board games, pool toys, cleaning supplies, movies.. all the makings for a great anniversary weekend for me and my husband. If I had to list some complaints I would have to say. The back window could use some curtains or blinds for more privacy. And maybe some clear instructions on how to work the thermostat and lockbox. Otherwise the house was great lol I didn‚Äôt want to leave."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,we had a great stay. I love the work station! plentiful beds. great yard. great location. thank you.

Thank you so much"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My second time and won‚Äôt be my last. It‚Äôs my get away whenever I‚Äôm in Lakeland. Beautiful,clean,private,safe and Karen the host makes you feel like you have known her for years."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is by far the best place I‚Äôve stayed in for my needs in Lakeland. The host is a wonderful woman who is so incredibly accommodating that I honestly felt she was undercharging me for my stay! She even unprompted provided a bicycle for my son to ride and was very kind to my old dog. As long as this place is available I won‚Äôt stay anywhere else.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Karen‚Äôs cottage was cozy, private and close to everything in Lakeland. The place was nicely stocked with treats, coffee, bathroom supplies and there‚Äôs even a washer and dryer, outdoor grill and beautiful courtyard with table and hanging lights. Karen is extremely kind and we plan to return as this place is literally minutes from our son and grandchildren. We are also looking forward to seeing the swans on the lake downtown that Karen suggested along with all the other great locations she shared with us as well as her store, Dixieland Relics. Highly recommend Karen‚Äôs cottage!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Had a wonderful stay! Place is cute and cozy, on a brick street in a nice neighborhood. Perfect location! Karen had the fridge stocked and great coffee and even pet snacks! Such a nice touch!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This will be my personal favorite in Lakeland because of the outstanding Host! Her cottage was beautifully decorated,very cozy and private.

I recommend staying here and you will fall in love with the home and with Karen,she is amazing and thoughtful!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Karen is an ‚Äúabove and beyond‚Äù airbnb host. Between the friendliness and the amenities, I thought she must be a professional in the hospitality industry! I stayed at her place to avoid a hurricane and she was even nice enough to offer an early check in to avoid traffic. The space was really cute and so was the neighborhood. Lakeland has a lot more going on than I thought!
Thanks for accommodating me and my parrot last minute! üôÇü¶ú"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super cozy and great feng shui. Karen was a great host. Thank you.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely perfect. I lived in Lakeland for many years abs moved away a few moths ago. I took an impromptu trip back to Lakeland and was fortunate enough to find Serenity available. Pet friendly and affordable. Steve was gracious with my multiple questions and when I locked myself out. My dog, Misha loved the cold terrazzo floors after walks around the lake in the Florida heat. The space is large, nostalgic and decorated with simple, Lakeland decor that is true to the local artist, Swan loving community. Super comfy King bed, very quiet neighborhood, fully stocked kitchen, and WiFi. I got my steps in with multiple trips a couple blocks away to lake Morton, which is home to tons of aquatic birds, but Lakeland is specifically known for their Swans. My local Lakeland recommendations for visitors: Swan Brewing (try the Bean), the downtown Saturday market, Mitchells Coffee House, Born and Bread and Palace Pizza. Staying in the historic district on the lakes, refreshed my soul."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent area to stay in Lakeland. Nice visitor house with everything you need, very comfortable and quiet place. I had the pleasure of speaking with Stephen and he recommended some places. And when I return to Lakeland I will not hesitate to stay at Stephen's guest house."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cottage was very nice. Just a block from the lake in a quiet neighborhood. Host Stephen delightful. I definitely would stay here again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Serenity was an adorable little house that was perfect for our family‚Äôs weekend visit. The decor inside was cute, the bed was extremely comfortable, the water was hot, and the AC was cold! The kids enjoyed the games. The house was well stocked with everything we could possibly need. The neighborhood is beautiful and definitely within walking distance to FSC, downtown, and the swans. Stephen was an incredible host (and incredibly patient) and helped us with everything we needed. He even rescued us a couple of times with the front door. As an FSC alumni, it was so nice to be back in town and Stephen‚Äôs house was just perfect for our visit. I would highly recommend this house to anyone!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stephen 's place was very nice. We felt very welcome there. His place was everything you need and more. Very close to everything . We will be back again
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was great! Place is older, but in a fun ""remember when"" sort of way, clean, owner is a pleasure to deal with, and the location is very nice ""old Florida"". Will be back next year for the airshow"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stephen was super responsive! I really appreciated that he was responding to questions even when he was away himself!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We absolutely loved staying at Serenity at Success! The house is cute and comfy with everything we needed as well as a few unexpected bonus surprises. The neighborhood is beautiful and we enjoyed numerous walks to Lake Morton to see the swans and ducks. Having our furbabies with us made the stay even more enjoyable. Stephen is a great host who is friendly and helpful with recommendations. We are looking forward to staying at Serenity or his other property in the future.
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute little mother in law suite located 15 mins walk from downtown, 4 mins walk from Lake Morton and 10 mins to Lake Hollingsworth. Location is a huge plus, and Stephen was very communicative and welcoming. The main drawbacks: the WiFi (which was not fast enough for video calls, which I needed to do one morning for work so ended up using my phone as a WiFi hotspot after the connection froze several times), and the somewhat dated finishings (linoleum floors, rickety pocket door on the bathroom‚Ä¶). Also, keep in mind that the car park area is right outside the bedroom windows, so sometimes if a car pulls in early in the morning or late at night with lights on, it‚Äôll light up the room, even with curtains pulled. Overall, a well-located, affordable place to stay for 2-3 days."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Host made the entire process so easy and the home is beautiful and fun! Highly recommend!!!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and even better host! From the wine he set out to the recommendations he made for our morning jog to the restaurants. This place is amazing. Thank you Stephen
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We stayed at Stephen‚Äôs place for one month. Our experience was very pleasant. The house was clean and great neighborhood with many lakes around. It was a great area for my daily walks.
The host was always quick to respond to our questions and needs.
Should we be back in Lakeland we would not hesitate to rent his place again. We give the host and place an overall rating of 5 stars!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stephen‚Äôs home is in a fantastic location, and we loved staying there. We were in town for a wedding but managed to take a walk around the lake that is just down the street, where we saw the swans. It‚Äôs beautiful! A lovely coffee shop is also nearby, and we walked to that. The home is comfortable and peaceful."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I stayed a month at Serenity. It really is a perfect place for a long, or short, term stay. It is located an a historic, quiet and central area of town. The guest house is spacious and the kitchen is well equipped. I liked it so much I already booked it again for a month next year!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This cute little cottage was just what we were looking for. The place was spotless and just like the pictures. The bed was very comfortable. Def will stay here again when we are in the area. Stephen was great at communicating.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My wife and I was extremely pleased with the house and the way we were treated by Steve. We loved the neighborhood and with two walkable lakes with swans. We will definitely try to rent this place again when staying in Lakeland.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Enjoyed staying here. I‚Äôm a repeat visitor and always try to book this place first if it is available!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was perfection! Stephen is definitely a SUPER host as he has given attention to the smallest of details for a wonderful stay. The property is clean, very comfortable, so peaceful and in a beautiful location, to boot. We could not have asked for more! Stephen was there to greet us when we arrived to make certain that we had everything that we needed and I appreciated that as most properties have hosts that are ‚Äúoff site‚Äù and rely on email for communication. It says a lot that a host is eager to meet you and to understand the nature of your stay so that he can make sure you feel attended to. If I could give him more than five stars, I would!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great hosts, great place, great overall location! We had a blast and if they'll have us, we are sure to be back there soon!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stephen was and excellent host, best part was he was super responsive. The location is beautiful and perfect a side of Lakeland I didn't even realize existed. I plan to stay here every year when we have our annual CrossFit competition, its SUPER CLOSE to RP Funding Center. They have the cutest little private outdoor area, bed was super comfortable, fun games, basically everything you need!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stephen was an excellent host. The set up had everything you need and more. Super close to Florida Southern, walking distance to campus. Stephen was super quick to respond and always approachable. Would definitely recommend!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay at this clean, comfortable and adorable place. The neighborhood is upscale and quiet. It had everything one would need for being away from home. The king bed was firm and comfortable with good linens and lots of extra blankets if you need them. The kitchen had what we needed including coffee and cream and a few extras that made it personal. The bathroom is cute, with many toiletries and good water pressure. I loved the terrazzo flooring throughout and the pink tile in the bathroom. There were family games and the TV had Netflix. My dog was welcome and that‚Äôs important to me. The yard was pretty with a deck and seating. Stephen checked in on us and was very accommodating to a special request I had. I almost forgot to mention that this has cold AC which is a must here in Florida! We will definitely be back!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stephen was an excellent host and checked in to make sure everything was going well.
The guesthouse was clean, comfortable, and quiet.
Access to the guesthouse and parking were very easy.
Would highly recommend this place to others."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Lovely guesthouse in a nice and peaceful neighborhood! Host were awesome! I totally would recommend and stay with them again! üëçüèΩ
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was perfect for us! We moved our daughter into Florida Southern College and enjoyed the close proximity, peaceful neighborhood , and walking around Lake Morton . We will definitely return ! The host is very friendly and responsive . The cottage is clean and well maintained."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed here for a couple weeks while we were buying a house and getting settled in the area. The cottage is in a great location, perfect for figuring out the area. Stephen was very helpful with recommendations and always was available to answer questions.
The cottage is in a quiet area that is perfect for walking or riding bikes. There is a lot to do within just a few blocks."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I would definitely stay here again. The location is great! Morning walks around Lake Morton are a stones throw away. Stephen was so accommodating and friendly. The bed is super comfy and the kitchen is well stocked.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We absolutely loved this place. It was perfect for us and our doggo Buck. Great neighborhood and lakes for walking. Quiet and safe. Close restaurants and entertainment.
We will definitely be back."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great location and spacious rental!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great place in a great location. For those who don‚Äôt know Lakeland that well, this is a really nice location between two of the larger lakes in Lakeland with easy access to fantastic local cafes and food. A bit of a longer walk to The Joinery and the rest of downtown, but still not bad. About a quarter mile to the library and art museum. Short walk to one of the richest architectural treasures in the US, Florida Southern College.
The house is a really cool, more than a century old bungalow. The place you will stay is a well appointed cottage behind it. All around great vibes and accommodations.
Stephen was an excellent host, super responsive and helpful. Highly recommend."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Super cute place with lots to do within walking distance yet the place was very peaceful. Little slice of Heaven .
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This whole stay was really great. The mini splits are a wonderful addition. The location is fantastic, the bed is comfortable. I know it‚Äôs silly but the paper plates were such a great touch. It simplified dishes! Overall the place was adorable and perfect for a little staycation for Lakelanders that were just trying to have a night away from their kids. Lol. Our one issue: we found out Stephen is a Florida Gator fan, and as FSU fans, we almost had to reduce the stars just for that ;) But seriously, wonderful hosts and wonderful place - 5 stars for sure."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute place and good location.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs a word to describe our stay except saying it was spectacular!! This place exceeded all expectations! Stephen deserves a top rating for making sure that everything was perfect! Absolutely perfect place, with an absolutely perfect host! We live in the area, but we have already talked about staying here again just for a staycation!! We highly recommend this place! Close to the lake, a short walk to downtown, really close to everything that you need! Great job Stephen!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Steven‚Äôs beautiful bungalow had clean floors with soft textile rugs and fabrics. The place smelled fresh and clean. There were board games to play, and plenty of channels to watch. There‚Äôs an well-kept outdoor patio with clean, maintained furniture and a cute backdrop for pictures. Steven also left a fresh pitcher of water, coffee creamer, and wine in the fridge. Oh and the giant bean bag was a blast for relaxing and watching tv. My 8-year old loved it.
The bungalow was only a few blocks away from Lake Morton. There are plenty of restaurants, shops, and parks within walking distance.
This place felt like a steal. Probably the best Air B&B I have stayed in. The price was exceptional."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had the most wonderful week long stay in Stephen‚Äôs accommodation. He was so friendly and helpful and we could check in early after a long drive to Lakeland, which we definitely appreciated.
The accommodation was perfect. Clean, very well equipped, a lovely comfy King Size bed. It was very peaceful and close to the lake, for morning walks with our dog.
The split air condition units were absolutely fabulous, and kept the accommodation lovely and cool. The shower had lots of hot water and a very welcome powerful pressure. It was so comfortable and peaceful. It also had a very comfortable blue bean bag, that was huge for relaxing on. We felt very at home and welcomed, and very much appreciated the welcoming bottles of wine, coffee, and water.
We would love to stay again when we‚Äôre in Lakeland üòä"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great Stay!
Host able to accommodate on very short notice!
Thank you"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Thank you Stephen for a great stay.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a delightful place. Love the vintage historical feel of the home and area. Beautiful street; lakes a both ends ~ we will be coming back.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Stephen was a great host and his place was exactly as described. Great spot, quiet neighborhood, close to anything you need. If you‚Äôre attending an event at the RP Funding Center, it‚Äôs literally 5 minutes away. Stephen was very responsive and proactive, giving several recommendations for restaurants and things to do. Nice, quiet and peaceful neighborhood to take my service dog on walks. Lastly, the bed was extremely comfortable! We always try to book a place with a king and this was by far the most comfortable, best sleep I‚Äôve gotten in a while! Will definitely use again if down in Lakeland!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The bungalow was so cute and perfect for what we needed it for. My daughter had a dance competition at the RP Funding Center which was only 4 minutes away. There were plenty of little restaurants within walking and short driving distance. The home was clean and had plenty of space. There were full size bottles of shampoos, conditioners and bodywashes, plenty of towels and rags, cleaning supplies, and extra sheets. The kitchen was fully stocked with those extras you might not think to bring but need such as sugar, salt, pepper, etc. The kids had fun swinging on the tree swing he had in his front yard and he didnt mind them using it. Such a beautiful little old town feel. Wish we would have been in town for longer to enjoy it more. Thank you!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Stephen, and his place, is everything we had hoped for. He allows pets and my three little dogs loved when he stopped by to say hi to them. The location is centrally located between Lake Morton and Lake Hollingsworth and are great for bird and people watching. Awesome restaurants are within either walking or bicycling distance. Every Saturday morning is the Farmer's Market uptown. We cannot express how much we enjoyed our stay."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"If you are looking for place that is pet friendly, impeccably clean, safe and a place to stay with walkable streets filled with quaint homes and serenity surroundings, then this is the place for you. There is outside seating in the yard to enjoy with company. There were so many places for us to walk our dog and he loved it! The beautiful house was only a short five-minute walk to Lake Morton with all of its bird life...swans, ducks and more! So many of the homes in the neighborhood are 100-year-old historic places and were absolutely charming. We met people on the sidewalks who treated us like we were part of the neighborhood. We were moments away from art museum, library, downtown dining, the Saturday Farmers Market, movie theater, shopping and entertainment.
Stephen was available to answer questions, make suggestions, and attentive to needs.
A great place to spend a day, a week or a month! You can't go wrong with this one."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We‚Äôll definitely be back! Great location and home.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our visiting family stayed in this rental over the Christmas holiday. Can not tell you how much they enjoyed their stay. The rental was perfect and Stephen is the perfect host. Beautiful rental on one of the most beautiful streets in Lakeland - close to everything. Stephen was the perfect host with fast and accurate communication. He was beyond generous and could not have been more helpful. The rental has everything you could possibly need including a super comfortable bed. Our visiting family just would not stop talking about how much they enjoyed their stay. Thanks again Stephen for your generous hospitality.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"As a DPT student I needed to secure housing for my rotation at LRH. I struck gold with Stephen‚Äôs listing. Unfamiliar with Lakeland, I needed somewhere with parking, workspace, privacy, peace and quiet given my busy schedule and student budget. The place is much bigger than it looks online. Plenty of space for indoor workouts in either the living or bedroom, huge TV, clean bathroom with great water pressure, Fully equipped kitchen with everything mentioned in the listing. Cozy and charming across the board. Surrounding area is idyllic, with the public library, historical district, restaurants, etc. within a 5-10 minute walk. Of course, Lakeland has lakes, and they‚Äôre beautiful. Running around Morton and Hollingsworth became part of my routine and the neighborhood is lush in nature and suburban architecture. Above all, Stephen is a phenomenal host. I had a 4 hour drive to the place and he waited around to meet face to face and help me get settled in. He has my highest recommendation."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Everything was wonderful! Exactly as described, great host! We were glad to have a place that welcomed our dog. We walked to the local coffee shop and a restaurant for dinner, both less than a 1/2 mile away. We hope to stay here again on our next trip to Lakeland!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It was a true pleasure to stay at Stephen‚Äòs bungalow. He was very communicative on the day of check-in and went above and beyond giving me advice on transportation to the concerts I was going to that weekend. The bungalow is a dream. Very cozy and easy to settle into, and I truly appreciate that he has dressers and closets available to the guest. Often when I have rented an Airbnb there is very little storage for my things. Stephen took good care of providing amenities, such as shampoo, condiments, and he even went as far to have both red and white wine, coffee creamer, filtered water, snacks, and even a small stick of butter!
Little touches like that go along way in making a guest feel special.
The location of the house is fantastic - it is just up the street from a beautiful lake and just a few blocks away from restaurants, stores, and downtown Lakeland.
Finding this bungalow was a real treat, and I highly recommend a stay there to anyone. I hope to be back up and visit again soon."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sweet little spot tucked away on the best street in the historic neighborhood of Lake Morton. Stephen is an exemplary host who is super responsive, very accommodating and knows Lakeland inside and out. We loved our stay and we‚Äôll be back!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a perfect spot and nice place to stay in Lakeland. It‚Äôs close to everything and in the perfect location near downtown. Will definitely be booking again next time I‚Äôm in town!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stephen is a very conscientious person and thoughtful host. He responds to texts in a very timely manner. The attractive bungalow is in an awesome location - very close to many beautiful, iconic Lakeland places: Lake Morton, FSC, Lake Hollingsworth, and downtown, to name a few. The establishment is clean, well cared for, and suitably furnished. The kitchen has ample dishes, silverware, and very nice pots and pans. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay while my own home was being re-tiled. I felt very comfortable and safe and really enjoyed every minute."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Stephen was an amazing host. He was responsive from the get go. He checked in to make sure our stay was going well. My family was in a bind due to a natural disaster and Stephen made navigaton a stressful situation easier. Would highly recommend
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend!! Such a cute place, cozy and clean! Cute neighborhood:) host was amazing, can‚Äôt say enough positive things, I will be back to explore this lovely town!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We booked this place for its pet friendliness, but I am so glad we kept it even when we decided not to bring the the dogs. It is very clean, comfortable, and convenient to everything. The shower has fantastic water pressure- 5 stars!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay. The place was very clean, well appointed, and Stephen communicated well. We'll definitely be back!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for having such good communication and hosting me last minute! This stay was perfect and I will be sure to come back if I need a place to stay again.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This air bnb was absolutely wonderful. Every detail of my stay was taken care of and I was able to relax in such a clean and comfortable place and enjoy. My son is at a local college and since I do not live close, it was such a blessing to have a place to spend time with him and I was even able to cook dinner for a group of his friends. The kitchen had everything I needed and it was amazing to have this opportunity. It was so nice to provide a ""little home away from home."" experience. Stephen checked in often and always asked if I needed anything and I really appreciated that communication. The neighborhood and surrounding area is beautiful too and I was able to go for a few jogs around Lake Hollingsworth which is super close. I hope to be able to return and enjoy this experience again."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A great little place in a great location. Enjoy a beautiful walk among great home architecture or a short drive to everything you like to eat. We will be back.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great place to stay! So many small details and amenities provided. A convenient location to easily walk to some of the lakes, down town Lakeland, and Florida Southern College. A clean, bright little house that worked perfectly for our college drop off trip- our kiddo slept
comfortably on the fold out couch.
Stephen is a wonderful host who clearly enjoys giving his guests a great experience. He let us drop bags off early and even let us borrow some tools we needed to work on our kid‚Äôs bike before we left him at college. We will definitely look for this rental (or any other hosted by Stephen) next time we are back in town."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location in the Lake Morton Historic District. Safe for walking and enjoying nature at its finest.
Accommodations - perfect for a couple. Stephen has thought of everything and more.
Availability - when we had questions, Stephen was a text away. He answered promptly and thoroughly.
We will definitely stay here on our next visit to Lakeland."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Wonderfully appointed bungalow cottage in the lovely Lake Morton district near downtown Lakeland. Everything about the description is spot on & Stephen is a gracious host. Look forward to the next time.!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wow! Just a perfectly wonderful stay, from start to finish, top to bottom. The location is quintessentially Lakeland. No vehicle needed; once you exit this warm and well appointed auxiliary residence, it's a convenient trip to any number of noteworthy Lakeland landmark locations-Lake Morton, Lake Hollingsworth, Hollis Gardens, Munn Park and downtown Lakeland, the recently revived Dixieland area, Florida Southern College and its world class collection of Frank Lloyd Wright-designed architectural...the list could go on and on.
We stayed a month, and, if it were up to me, we would've stayed many months more. Being a dog friendly property in a dog friendly neighborhood that's located in a dog friendly city meant our 5 year old Dalmatian-labradlor (Dalmador? Labratian?) had as enjoyable of a time as we did.
Along with being an active, well-respected member of his community, and a snazzy dresser, the host is exceptional in his thoughtfulness, expedient in his communication, courteous in his presence (his main residence is adjacent to the stand alone AirBnB), knowledgeable about the area, and exceedingly receptive to suggestions.
If you're on the fence over a Central Florida destination, don't be. Do yourself a favor and book the stay here. Since I moved to Florida in 2015, major media outlets have consistently ranked Lakand as one of the best places to live (in the entire USA). And, for me, having lived in several fabulous cities, (from Chicago, IL to Portland, OR) I wouldn't hesitate to place Lakeland at the very top for its quality of life. It's authentic. It's energetic. It's engaged and it engages. And this property is the perfect entryway to the idyllic Lakeland life.
Perfectly sized for the individual traveler, a couple, or a small family (maybe even a doggo or two).
Other, sometimes overlooked, opportunities to make this listing your 'home base'...
‚ñ™Ô∏é Orlando theme park-based vacations? ‚úÖÔ∏è
‚ñ™Ô∏é Gulf Coast beach trips? ‚úÖÔ∏è
‚ñ™Ô∏é Space Coast outings? ‚úÖÔ∏è
And make sure you let the host know ""Jonathan sent you""!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed here for a wedding & we couldn‚Äôt get over how great the space is. The house is clean, open, and stocked with everything you need for a comfortable stay. The location is ideal for walking around the neighborhood, lake, or to restaurants. We were both very impressed with the space itself and the overall experience and would highly recommend Stephen and his Airbnb to future travelers."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at Stephen's place for a two-night business trip in the Lakeland area. The place is easy to find and in a perfect location near Lake Morton. The home has everything you need! The air conditioning works great, awesome water pressure, and spacious rooms. I would love to stay here again when I return to Lakeland."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Having travelled extensively over these past 6 months, and with lodging accomodations running the gamut from activity-filled resorts, extended stay hotels, roadside motels, and a multifarious array of short term owner offered properties, I have enjoyed, what seems like a lifetime's worth of travel related experiences. And, paramount of all amongst these lessons is what attributes (to me) make for the 'perfect' stay. While this mix of amenities and features, provisions and acoutrements, may differ dramatically amongst travelers, I am very confident when I say this:
Stephen's listing will provide you with a stay as perfect as it gets.
This comfortable, well provisioned space, which is amply sized, impeccably located, dutifully attended, and proudly offered shines as a beacon of hospitality amongst a sea of souped up toolsheds, which (while apropos and acceptable for a great many instances) lack the composition and character that this guest house intrinsically displays upon arrival.
Do yourself a favor when in Central Florida and go see for yourself. But, I'd recommend doing so expeditiously, or else, you may find that the author of this review and his family have booked everything available .
An abbreviated ""highlight reel"" (things that really resonated with us):
‚óè Not only was the house immaculately clean upon our arrival, the host provided every cleaning supply and tool imaginable, which we gladly made use of (when traveling with a 5 year old boy and a 5 year old Dalmatian-Labrador mix, this type of host forethought is a gamechanger)
‚óè There is no lack of water pressure in the shower, and the water temperature heats up very quickly.
‚óè The air conditioning blows cold and strong, efficiently and effectively cooling tne whole place using 2 Samsung minisplit systems, both of which are jam packed with user options and are remote control operated.
And the pi√®ce(s) de r√©sistance....
‚óè Fully stocked and thoroughly supplied kitchen? Definitely! No shortage of host-provided flatware, silverware, drinkware, and serviceware!
Extra neat bonus finds: a digital toaster and 4 different types of Ziploc baggies - now, that's a host that really cares!
My entire family- 2 adults (human), one 5 year old (human), and one 5 year old (Labrador-Dalmatian mix) all scored this listing as ""the perfect stay"".
(especially the dog...he liked the ample squirrel population for recreation and nearby green spaces for relief)"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Stephen was a fantastic host and this location was equally great. Both exceeded my expectation for an Airbnb visit.
The residence was within walking distance to many of the best things in Lakeland (lakes, restaurants, shopping, etc) and was furnished with everything needed for a comfortable stay."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Everything about Stephen's place was perfect! Especially for long term stays, which ours was at 6 weeks. First off, the location is not only perfect to the downtown area with places to eat & to go shopping , but it's also beautiful. The cottage's street is lined with beautiful moss trees and a view of the lake--a pretty place to come ""home"" to each day. The kitchen was well stocked with all things needed for cooking, a Keurig for coffee as well as a full size refrigerator. There's a full list of suggestions on what to do including weekly events and options for laundry. And if you ever want to hang outside for a bit, there's a darling patio with furniture right outside the doorstep. Stephen was a very welcoming host and very attentive to our questions , wants &needs. He always responded in a timely manner and was easy to reach. When we come back to Lakeland, we will definitely be booking here again."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A highly-recommended must-stay gem in Lakeland!
We had a wonderful stay at this spacious Mother-in-law guesthouse. Just the perfect space with a very comfortable king-size bed, games and books in the living area, and a kitchen with everything you would need. Excellent location: walking distance to Florida Southern College, downtown Lakeland, numerous restaurants, coffee houses, and interesting shops, and between two beautiful lakes if you'd like some exercise or birdwatching. Stephen is a very attentive host and gave many suggestions as to activities and places during our stay; we wish we had more time to do them all!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic stay, great location. We walked everywhere, didn‚Äôt use the car once. The airbnb was adorable and equipped with everything you need and more! The swan accents were a thoughtful homage to Lakeland. Stephen had great recommendations for local places to try. He went way beyond to make our long-weekend comfortable and memorable. Highly recommend this gem!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful visit! Great central location with so many parks and things to do. We love the area and will be back.
Thank you again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This beautifully decorated home has a comfortable interior on a large, open air backyard. Located in the well established, SW area of Lakeland, it is nestled in a quiet neighborhood while just a few minutes drive from Lakeland‚Äôs beautiful downtown area Munn Park and walkable picturesque lakes.
From the moment you enter the home you can see, smell, and feel the attention to detail that the owner has dedicated to this space and this is confirmed in her quick and friendly responses whenever we had a question or need. This is the home I will recommend when friends come to visit."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My Sister and I love it. The home was beautifully decorated and the neighborhood was so peaceful throughout the day and night, not to mention The Host Madison was a great help with our needs She was wonderful. I surely would stay again"

Dog friendly, our sweet doggy felt right at home. Madison was responsive to any questions we had and even helped us out when we needed to extend our stay. We definitely plan to book again whenever we are in town."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Madison is a true artist! Every detail was beyond MCM perfect. We had a great night's sleep & very pleasant time. Will definitely book again if free when back in the area on projects. Thanks again, Madison! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Loved this home, Madison made us feel like family and her home felt like our second home, very clean and roomy.
Madison has looked after all the perks that anyone could ask for, she hosts for your pets, dogs and cats and prepared your visit even if you forgot something she'll make it available.
the home has a very large fence in yard that's great for your pets to run and roam freely.
Madison even provides protection covers for her furniture from your pets.
Everything you would need back home she provided, from cooking to cleaning and laundry facilities.
I would give this home 10 stars if they allowed it.
Definitely coming back next year, it's in the best location in Florida. Centered between Orlando and Tampa or only takes about an hour to get to either side of Florida.
There's so much to see and do in Lakelands you'll never be bored.
Thank you again Madison for hosting us in your home."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed for a couple of days while we were dealing with my mother passing away and handling all the details. Madison's house provided us with the peaceful and relaxing setting we needed as we worked through a difficult time. She was responsive to questions and provided us with everything we needed.
And the cute mid-century vibe was fun and comfortable."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Love the house and the neighborhood is super quite
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Our family loved this place very comfortable
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Everything was perfect. I really appreciated the security of the backyard.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a great little place. I was born and raised in Lakeland up until about 5 years ago. It was nice being back home and enjoying what Lakeland has to offer. Madison was great, very friendly and responsive. Rules and instructions were very clear and house was kept very clean and in order. Huge backyard in a nice and quiet neighborhood. My family and I will absolutely use again when we make another trip to Florida."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing experience and adorable home! Thank you so much!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Super cute house in historic neighborhood yet still close to everything. The photos don‚Äôt show how big the backyard is.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very great place to stay in a very peaceful location! Everything was as described!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We are obsessed with this property. The aesthetics of this place deserves its own category. The mid-century design was warm and cozy. The small details providing all the bells and whistles for our dogs was the cherry on top. Madison was very responsive with any questions we had.
We recommend you stay here to experience it for yourself."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Awesome place.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,very comfortable stay. thank you.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,this is a very comfortable home with a great yard. thank you.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This home was the most pet friendly and pet secure vacation home I‚Äôve ever been in. It had a large backyard that was very secure and comfortable to sit and relax in. Both the front and the back of the home are double entryways, which is a really nice safety feature when your pets are in an unfamiliar environment. Thank you Madison, this was the most comfortable and relaxed I have felt with my dogs in a vacation home."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was super cute and exactly what our family needed for our stay! And it's super close to a lot of the town. Will definitely be looking into staying here again if we come back to Lakeland!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Pro‚Äôs
- Very clean
- Very cute and decorated well
- Large fenced in backyard for pets
- Lots of extra little touches for pets (treats, poop bags, toys, etc)
- Beds were comfortable
- Close to everything we needed including shops and restaurants
- Plenty of off-street parking
Con‚Äôs
- The house was well taken care of outside, neighborhood was mixed
- Getting into the house was tricky, host did give instructions but the 8 digit code for the sunroom door was too long to ever remember. Then before you could get into the house, you had to get into a key box to retrieve the keys. The laundry room also needs the same key as the front door to unlock it. Not hard to do, just kind of pain because of the extra added steps
*I am a nightshift nurse, so for me the sheer blinds and curtains let it a TON of light during the day. Probably won‚Äôt bother most, but just incase anyone likes it dark too."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay! The house is so cute and well decorated, and stocked with everything you could need. Madison gave clear instructions that made check-in very easy. The yard is huge and perfect if you‚Äôre bringing a pup. There are even dog bowls and treats provided!
Madison was also responsive and communicative throughout the stay. There is also a binder with tons of local recommendations and helpful info about the house and area, which was a nice touch. We would definitely stay here again if we visit the Lakeland area in the future!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We got this very last minute as my husband brought us in town for work and I didn't feel that the hotels were too worth it, we're sooo glad we chose this house. It was absolutely perfect especially since we needed to stay an extra night, Madison was very accommodating. It was easy. Everything was there, I've been to some houses that really skipped out on some basic amenities but she even had the spice cabinet stocked. the backyard was perfect for our dog to run around and it was nice and cool inside for us afterwards. I'd definitely stay here again should we need to be in town for work in the future."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was definitely everything I hoped it would be in more. Very peaceful, cozy and comfortable. Mariana was very nice, helpful and communicative. If anyone is looking for a place to stay in Lakeland look no further. You will not be disappointed!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful location. Perfect for my business trip. Close to everything downtown.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect stay. Highly recommend! Easy check-in, great neighborhood, comfortable home. Great place to stay!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent accomodations and location. Mariana reached out frequently to ensure all our needs were met. Highly recommend.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cozy little home, snuggled right in a quiet part of time. Private and peaceful. We had a great stay for a family of 5!"
2024-04-01,2.0,Stayed with kids,"I can‚Äôt recommend staying here for 2 reasons.
First, the headboard in one of the bedrooms fell down. We found that it was hung on the wall with large picture hangers and tape. There were no screws and no anchors. It was unsafe. Thankfully, no one was hurt. I sent a message and photo to the host but she did not respond. The next day, she sent another message asking for ‚Äúpositive feedback.‚Äù She never mentioned the headboard. I‚Äôve had minor problems in other airbnbs before but I never had a host that wouldn‚Äôt respond at all to an issue.
Also, the floors were very dirty. Someone had swept but hadn‚Äôt mopped in a long time. Our feet and socks were black on the bottom after walking around the house.
Otherwise, the house is in a great location and looked like the photos when we arrived besides some very minor issues - like a rip in the couch, broken nightstand drawer and missing faceplate on one of the outlets."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Exactly as listed‚Äîvery nice apartment.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Mariana's home was the perfect fit for my family and I. The apartment is spacious, clean, and has a lot of little touches that make it feel like a home. The pictures really do not do it justice. There are 2 bedrooms, one at the front and a slightly larger one at the rear of the home, with a spacious and open area with the kitchen and living room in between. The couch is huge and comfortable, great for everyone to stretch out and watch TV in the evenings. There is a master bath attached to the rear bedroom, which was also very convenient. The nicely lit outdoor seating was a plus as well. The location was great, being just down the road from Florida Ave and a short walk to Lake Hollingsworth. The lake has a 3 mile walking/jogging trail that runs all the way around it. There is also a really nice coffee shop/commons area just across Florida Ave. On top of this, Mariana is a friendly and attentive host. I would definitely recommend her home!"
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Mariana was a great host. Any questions were answered promptly. The house was missing a steamer which we needed for our clothes [and was supposed to be included]. She dropped one off the next morning.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mariana has a beautiful home that we will definitely stay at again. We enjoyed the convenient location and the quiet of the neighborhood.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our host was easily reached and very helpful the location Ideal for us with all the dinning options we like in the downtown area. Very peaceful and good privacy. Would certainly recommend.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I thoroughly enjoyed our 2 night stay at this property. it was tastefully decorated, located in a great walkable neighborhood and peaceful. Really liked the primary bedroom and bathroom and felt very princess-like especially due to the lovely chandelier lamp! The other bedroom is more subdued and was to my friend's liking. Really enjoyed the privacy, quiet, and parking garage.
Thank you Mariana. I would definitely stay here again when in the area. Highly recommend the in-depth walking tour at the Frank Lloyd Wright Visitor Center, as well as First Fridays in the nearby downtown area."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay here when traveling for work. The unit is spacious and very clean. Having a parking spot behind the unit made for easy loading and unloading. Marianas place is in a beautiful & quiet neighborhood which was pleasant to walk.

The house was very convenient to grocery shopping, coffee shops and bakeries, and is in a very walkable, historic neighborhood.

We recommend and advise you to consider your upcoming trip to Mariana's üòâ"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Honestly, great place to stay for short term, could see it being stayed in long term. The only real complaint I have is the driveway off the alley. It's just tight and nothing the owner can do anything about. I feel the total price, the cleaning fee and all, was a tad steep for what ya get, but not so much that it ruins the experience."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a great place! We stayed for 2 days for a wedding at The Terrace Hotel. It was super close to everything. The decor is gorgeous and everything was spotless! I would absolutely recommend it if you want to stay in the area!

The space worked well for us, the location was great and we had nearly everything we needed! I would just add a bottle of water for guests upon arrival (after traveling long day) and regular shampoo & conditioner rather than 2-n-1. The water pressure in the shower was really nice. I stayed in another Airbnb in the area that had no water pressure and it was not pleasant. I also liked the parking pad and garage access. And the Keurig. Big fan of the Keurig although for some reason I didn‚Äôt use it this time. We were on the run - there are so many things to do in the area. But you can relax here if that is your schedule and sink into the comfy sofa. üí´"

Also we were lucky to meet the owners of the house, Mariana and Federico, a lovely couple with a beautiful little girl, who supported us in every way they could so we could feel comfortable. Total thanks to you. My recommendation is to book this place as soon as you see it available, because I know it's already full for a couple of months in advance, and it totally worth it.
We really had a wonderful vacation in this house ans we will definitely come back SOON!"

They had the bathroom stocked with essentials that were appreciated. My only complaint was the floors were not the cleanest they weren‚Äôt super dirty but a lot of debris and we had a dead lizard in our room. Cleaning people could do a better job but all in all it was a great stay."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Had a great time at Abel's place - this was our second time at the property and we're glad we kept the tradition alive.

Plenty of space in the kitchen for whatever you need, and a spotless bathroom."

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Abel's place was nice and had a very nice autumn TV screen saver with delicate jazz in the background. After complementing her about these things on our wedding night, she first congratulated us on our marriage, then immediately followed up with a request for us to take the trash to the street the next morning. Sorry, not our responsibility. Next time, we'll be sure to bring our bathroom cleaning supplies too, if that's preferred.
The house was good, although we almost ran out of toilet paper, the bed wasn't as comfortable as we would have liked, and the bathroom is so tight, it's almost impossible to not soak the floor when getting into the shower.
My new bride used to be a super host and always leaves places cleaner than most, and have had reviews complementing her on this. The request for the trash definitely put her in a foul mood for a little while. Checkout time was a little on the early side too."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Clean, homey, welcoming entry area, outstanding provisioning of every amenity possible. Very comfortable size, with surprise amazingly large/beautiful/private/fenced backyard. Extremely well done."

The location was ideal, with easy access to all the attractions I wanted to visit. I appreciated the thoughtful touches throughout the property, from the well-equipped kitchen to the cozy and comfortable bed.
I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this Airbnb experience. It truly exceeded my expectations, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a perfect getaway. Thank you to the hosts for making my stay so special. I can‚Äôt wait to return!‚Äù"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cutest hidden gem! We absolutely loved and enjoyed every minute of our stay. The home totally embodies everything that the charming city of Lakeland represents and offers!
As you walk into the home and open the door you are immediately greeted by beautiful classical music. The layout of the kitchen is very open and functional. The couch was large and perfect for hosting a family. The decor was everything. The beds were actually one of the most comfortable beds I‚Äôve slept in.
This home was also equipped to entertain your family outside.. there was a nice fire place and tree swing, multiple seating areas as well as a large outside eating table under a pagoda style gazebo.
Best part of the experience was that hosts showed incredibly thoughtful and high level hospitality! They left a personalized welcome card with cute message with our names. (I‚Äôm so bummed I forgot to take the card with me I wanted to keep it for my scrapbook)

Backyard well lit with a small Weber grill, covered outdoor seating and fire pit. Indoors was spotless. We were there for our son's wedding so, although it wasn't part of our original plan, we had his best man use the spacious kitchen to prepare the deserts for the event. Because it was in the week between Christmas and New Years the house was decorated with holiday lighting. Upon entry we were met with a Yule log on the TV screen, holiday music, electric candle light, and holiday theme decor. We are familiar with Lakeland on day trips, but this was the first time we had an opportunity to experience it from a living point of view. Highly recommend this host if you need a little space and place to relax."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was the perfect little house for the month. I was doing a veterinary rotation at the Lakeland SPCA and needed a place to stay for the month. This house was super clean, was in a very quiet and safe neighborhood, close to downtown and shopping areas. The newly renovated bathroom was super nice and the water in the house was always hot. The house had a lot stocked for us when we got there: tons of spices, flour, plastic bags, silverware, plates, and there was even a fully stuffed care package basically in the bathroom! Had shampoos, lotions, makeup remover pads, toothbrushes, toothpaste, razors, and so much more. There wasn't a full grill in the backyard but there was a charcoal grill which was super easy to use and all you had to do was buy the charcoal of your choice from the store. Anytime we had to text or call Abel, he was always quick to respond and answered all of our questions. If you need a clean, safe place to stay in the area that is close to a lot of things, this is the place!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very nice little home, well designed and homey. Very convenient to everything and comfortable. There are two things that you might want to know if you are going to be staying here. 1 ) There is a very strong fragrance when you walk into the home, it wasn‚Äôt a bad scent but a bit overwhelming. This comes from two people who use fragrance free soaps and pretty much everything else. To some, many, this might not be important.
The home has a very nicely remodeled bathroom. However, if you are a larger person it will be tight for you.
A one last thing, the home has a smart thermostat which is controlled by Abel. He was very responsive to changing the temperature but you did not have the ability to change it yourself."

Everything we needed and then some. Comfortable, clean, perfect amount of space. Loved the brick road, the houses decorated with Christmas lights on the drive up to the house. Fenced in yard. Our dog loved it. Large windows. The outdoor space with the stringed lights and the hanging hammock chair. The amazing front porch chair I actually napped in one afternoon. We fully took advantage of this place. Felt instantly like home. It was so nice to not have to make an extra trip to the grocery that first night after a ten hour drive to get there. The kitchen had enough goodies to get us started. Took our son to Legoland which is only a 40 minute drive away. We spent a week here and it was the perfect start to our Florida vacation. We were a little sad to leave. Could totally live in this house with its lovely historic charm. Definitely a gem! We hope to come bank. Fell in love with the house and Lakeland."

So the beautiful gas lamps in the street, the older homes surrounding, and close to beautiful Lake Hunter! The beds are comfortable with dark curtains for late sleepers. The kitchen is well appointed and well stocked for the Keurig and specialty teas. The backyard is set up with lights and a table that seats six for outdoor dining on the patio. We had a lovely time and plan to come back in the future!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wow! This home is easily one of the best Airbnb‚Äòs I have ever booked. That is saying a lot because I have utilized Airbnb numerous times. The host was very attentive and the home is absolutely lovely with lots of charm! There were Christmas decorations and fully stocked cupboards to ensure that our stay was comfortable. There were even fresh flowers in the bathroom and in the kitchen. The fence back yard had a lovely seating area with market lights which created a cozy outdoor environment. The bathroom is absolutely beautiful! The house was very well laid out and was a great space for us to relax and enjoy each other‚Äòs company. The front porch is so cute and so welcoming with a gorgeous view of the nearby lake. Lots of historic charm on a brick street! Definitely will be staying at this home again in the future.

,,,"BEWARE, this home has storm damage to the roof, the soffits are missing, the roof is covered with a tarp, it is not in the condtioned that is pictured. It has been damaged for 7 weeks and exposed to Florida humidity. We entered the home at 1 am and could not see the damage outside. Upon entering, there was a very strong smell of mildew and it was very damp inside the home. I thought that turning the air up would help. Considering the vents are in the ceiling running the air made the smell even worse instead of better. Upon waking up in the morning our nose and throats were burning and my son who has allergies was very congested and had a headache. I searched the home for mold and discovered the damaged roof. We left immediately and informed the owners. The owner refused to offer a full refund and made a stressful situation even harder. If I was made aware of the damage to the home I would have chosen to stay at a different property. The home is well decorated and could be lovely but unfortunatly at this time it is in need of roof repairs."
