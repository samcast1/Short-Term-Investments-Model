2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Christina’s place was amazing! Very comfortable for us and she’s more than accommodating! Will definitely return!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home in a very quiet, nice, and safe neighborhood. Huge back yard for our kids to play in between our trips to the surrounding state parks along with a nice play room they converted from part of the garage. The whole house was prefect inside and out. It had everything we could need for our week long stay and more. We couldn't be happier. I would suggest this home to anyone. From a long stay wanting to explore NW Ok. to a weekend stay for a quick trip."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Clean and cute home! Close to main roads of Woodward and only a few minutes from groceries, restaurants, and gas stations. Quiet neighborhood. House was pristine! The yard is large and has a tall privacy fence all the way around it. Comfortable outdoor furniture though it was too chilly for us to enjoy it. Had all kitchen basics as far as dishes, pots and pans, utensils, etc. The bonus room (converted single car garage) was a nice additional space for kids to play-lots of board games and a tv. Bedrooms were spacious. Everything seemed very new-the windows, carpet, flooring, etc. We enjoyed our stay!"

2024-06-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"The house was clean and spacious and booking was easy. However, the location was very, odd! We had to drive behind a motel (with what looked to have long term residents) to access the house. Pictures ,while booking, seemed to make the house look secluded but it was not. We were also not able to use backyard because the grass was so tall. It was ok and served our purpose."

Super clean and comfortable. Ashley was always quick to respond and was easy to work with. My only negative is that the house is on a narrow, dead end street. The person directly in front of the driveway parks an RV in the street. This makes it a little (very) hard to get in and out - especially if you have a trailer (UHaul) like we did."

2019-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Our stay was extended and Anna , Ronda and Bob made it so easy for us. The lovely little home was very comfortable in the summer heat and now after SNOW it has stayed toasty warm!
The appliances are great! The stove and oven are easy to use and clean. The dishwasher and washer and dryer are a blessing! We even used the little fireplace on the snowy day just for the ambiance! While we are working away from home, there is not a finer place to stay or any more gracious hosts!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We feel blessed to have been able to stay here. The house is welcoming, bright, and clean!
Anna, Ronda and Bob are wonderful hosts. They are always available and gracious. The very best!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is THE place to stay! We did not want to leave. The entire house is comfy & cozy, super clean, and has everything you need plus more. The backyard was like a little paradise in the evenings. We loved sitting out there and drinking a cup of tea while the kids played until the sun went down. The hospitality can not be beat and sweetens the stay! The hosts went above and BEYOND to make our stay wonderful. You leave feeling refreshed. Stay here!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This was our best Airbnb experience ever!
Our two month stay at Lola’s on Maple was not only comfortable and convenient, it was the beginning of a great friendship. Ronda, Bob and Anna go above and beyond great hospitality and will do anything to help out. Their knowledge of places to eat, things to do, great dog groomers, nail salons, a storage place nearby (for our motorcycles) and a notary. You name it, they can help!
We loved the location of the house, everything was so convenient to get to. The living room is nice and open. The bedrooms are cozy, beds are comfortable. The large, fenced-in backyard was our favorite place to hang out. It’s a great place to cook out, let the animals run and visit with friends.
If you want a great place in Woodward- look no further than Lola’s on Maple!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Wonderful space, great location."
2019-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you want a comfortable and affordable spot near that is roomy and very comfortable, this is a great choice! The house is cute and livable. Listing is accurate. There's plenty of room for a 3BR, and the neighborhood is safe and relaxing. We travel a lot and are also ARBNB host. This place is sure to please. We are already planning a return trip.
Thank you Anna and Rhonda!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"So this was my second time staying at this property and as always Ms. Christina was so helpful, responsive and overall very friendly
I really enjoyed my stay and she would check up on us periodically. Hopefully I get to go back and I’ll get to stay here again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved this home! If I’m ever back I will definitely be staying here.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our second time staying at this delightful Airbnb gem, and once again, it exceeded all expectations. From the moment we stepped through the door, we were enveloped in coziness and cleanliness. It's evident that the hosts take great pride in maintaining this space to the highest standards.
Having experienced our fair share of Airbnb stays, we can attest that it's rare to find a place that feels as fresh and inviting as this one. There's a tangible sense of care and attention to detail that permeates every corner of the property. Despite staying here twice in the span of 15 months, the place feels just as pristine as the first time we arrived.
The hosts have clearly invested in not only maintaining the space but also in continually enhancing it. We noticed subtle improvements, from new linens to an even better-stocked kitchen, which made our stay comfortable and convenient.
Overall, we cannot recommend this Airbnb highly enough."
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"Christina is great host, she was very accommodating, and understanding when we even extended our stay twice. Our work sometimes get extended on short notice and most of the time we need to find other accommodations because we can not extend our stay, but Christina was gracious enough to extend our stay on short notice, not once but twice. House is very clean and spacious, and the location is great, close to stores, markets, and restaurants. My team and I were here for work and we definitely enjoyed our stay, and would love to stay here again when we come back for work next season. Thank you Christina for having us and for being such a gracious host. Highly recommend."
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"Great home, felt right at home. Christina was very helpful and nice. We definitely enjoyed our stayed beautiful and nice cozy home. Thank you so much for everything."

2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"This review represents the second time my wife and I have stayed in this property, but this time we had the kids with us and there was plenty of room for our family of five.
We were pleasantly surprised to find some upgraded patio furniture since our previous trip. We enjoyed our morning coffee on that new comfy furniture.
Overall, we had the same pleasant experience and convenient place to stay so we could visit family in the area. We would recommend this host and property to any one who needs to stay in Woodward."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice and clean great place to stay
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home was comfortable, clean, and inviting. On this trip, it was just my wife and I, but there would have been plenty of room for my kids too, had they come with us.
The place was clean, as advertised, and convenient to stores and dining. We used the place as a place to sleep at night while visiting extended family who live in the area, but it would have served well as a restful vacation spot if vacation in Woodward.
We were very happy."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Christina was amazing. We arrived in Woodward early and I had messaged Christina about checking in early. She responded right away and then was able to check us in early. The house was beautiful and perfect for our family. Made our stay for the Woodward Elks Rodeo and the Miss Rodeo Oklahoma pageant a relaxing one. We would stay here again and would recommend this house to other.

2023-03-01,5,Group trip,Christina was very helpful and communicated often and immediately when I sent messages. She even accommodated a late check out for our group. I would definitively recommend her place and her as a host.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for my husband's surgery and Christina made a very stressful situation for my family much easier! The house was beautiful and comforting to have a place to really rest! We would absolutely recommend staying at her Airbnb and we will definitely be back! We were three hours away from home, but we were home! ❤️❤️❤️"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We came for a national livestock show and after our 20 hour drive we made it to the house. It was BETTER than the pictures! We enjoyed our stay and felt right at home! Will definitely be back!!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lovely stay - the house is cuter than the photos show. It's a cozy place with everything you need to be comfortable.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great AirBnB if you are looking for a place to stay in the area. Very clean and accommodating.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Quiet neighborhood, nicely decorated without clutter but not sterile either. All essentials were available in the kitchen which made cooking in easy. Beds were comfortable and there was plenty of room to lounge around the living room and sit at the kitchen table comfortably. I failed at double checking the check out time and while I wouldn't suggest taking advantage of Christina, she was graceful with me leaving a wee past check out time. She was very kind in her communication and there was nothing complicated or stressful about the stay. The backyard has plenty of room to let kiddos run around or to lounge around by yourself. Will stay here again when we pass through."
2022-12-01,4,Stayed about a week,Comfortable stay
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Christina's place is fantastic! If you need a nice, quiet and clean place to stay in Woodward, look no further. We'll definitely be returning."

2022-08-01,5,Group trip,Amazing place!!!! I will definitely stay there again if I’m in Woodward.
2022-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"My family stayed here for 5 days. Place was clean and spacious. Not a lot of nick-nack decor items which I really like. Bringing a toddler on vacation, I really appreciate this. Communication was lacking in the beginning, we didn't get the key code until after check-in when I messaged host upon arriving. Communication improved when an issue came up and host took care of it by quickly. Shower head is low, my tall husband had to bend down significantly or wash on his knees. Nice backyard which my toddler enjoyed."
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay in a quiet neighborhood. The house is very clean and they have all the necessities needed. We will definitely be booking this house in the future! The owners communicate very well and in a timely manner.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I enjoy Christina’s home. We have started at other AirBNB and they weren’t as comfortable as this location. If you are looking for a place away from home that is clean, comfortable, peaceful in a good location. I would truly recommend Christina home. We will definitely be coming back."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house is right down the street from a delicious Mexican Restaurant Luna. Very close to Twister Coffee. The house was great in central location.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Robin is a great host. Will recommend this place anytime. Lots of room and very clean.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Robin is an excellent host. We were there for a business trip and brought a crew with us. This is the second time we have stayed there. For checkin, He noticed that I was having difficulty locating the information I needed and was there to assist before I called. He was prompt, gracious, and happy to show us around without being invasive .
As to the property itself- it was just as it appears in the photos, kind of a community house with lots of bedrooms and a large open space for gatherings. There is something not shown in the photos but a great help to us- Robin had several large tables and chairs (like you might find at a community center) which were great for us as we could all spread out for work and a mini conference session.
There was a large tv with good access in the main room, as well as tv's in each bedroom. This made it really nice for us.
After two visits, this is our ""go to"" location when we are in town.
HIGHLY recommend for budget accommodations.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,nice spot to stay liked the inside of the place alot
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and very cozy home. The beds are really firm but we thought they were very comfortable. The main bathroom doesn’t have a shower so keep that in mind when staying there but it wasn’t a big deal for us. We had a great time!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,Excellent house to stay in. Never had an issue with anything! The host was always checking in and making sure I didn’t need anything since I did stay awhile! 10/10 stay
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great house, perfect for stays in Woodward!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"we really enjoyed staying there,
id definitely stay there, again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"House is put together nicely and very clean!!
Beds are SUPER firm, so if you don’t sleep well in a hard bed - this is not your spot"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home was wonderful. It was clean and in a great neighborhood. We walked through the neighborhood on Saturday night and everyone was friendly. The 2 larger mattresses were harder than we would have hoped for, but that's a personal issue. Would definitely stay here again!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!! In a great location too. Very nice house!
2023-02-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The house was clean and mostly comfortable, the host was good but not sure what was going on with evolve and the host. The amenities were good and everything was organized. Unfortunately, there was some bad.
The main trash bags were not much larger than a standard grocery sack, shower nozzle in master didn’t work, shower only sprayed extremely hot water that couldn’t seem to be adjusted, the guest bath has no shower, the internet was not good at all and ended up going out completely for a full day. The cleaning fee was excessive in my opinion for the town and size of the house. The house can be a great place to stay but not happy with how it is run."
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"Great stay with excellent communication leading up to our check-in time. House was spotless, very comfortable, and had everything we needed. The details show 2 bathrooms, one of them only has a tub, no shower. The shower is in the master bedroom. Not a big deal to us but it did require some additional communication on showering schedules with multiple families staying together!"
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,Excellent
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend!! It's a beautiful place.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, spacious home. Very clean. Good location but it’s Woodward, can’t really be too far from anything in town. Pots, pans and plates provided but need to bring everything else you want for cooking. Not a big deal, just a heads up."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home to stay in!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at the Loft. For a large group coming in from out of town, this place was perfect. It’s very functional and charming. Natalie was extremely accommodating and quick to respond to any questions I had. We would definitely stay here again!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Loft is a great place to stay! Being on Main Street, we were walking distance to so many great places … Long Shots, Walker Mercantile, and the Homestead, just to name a few.
The Loft has a very homey feel. We had plenty of room and it was very clean. We enjoyed our stay!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,fantastic place. great price.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Stayed there for a night while working anesthesia at the hospital across the street. Every bed is comfortable it’s eccentrically designed . Probably the coolest place I’ve ever stayed in

2022-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,Absolutely fantastic stay definitely will be back!

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We stayed here when we were going to see the bat migration in Freedom. It is a unique and roomy place to stay in Woodward. Love that the owners promoted local artist in the rental. Easy to find and access.

2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"This place is absolutely great! The downtown location is great; the restoration which kept the historical beauty was amazing! It was well stocked with toiletries as well as kitchen supplies. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Woodward, and I give much of that credit to this incredible place we were able to stay."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in Woodward. Very nicely decorated. Plenty of space for a group. If stairs are not your thing then consider something else.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing loft, great location and close to all that woodward has to offer"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is wonderful! It was a great weekend! Thanks 😊
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay if you are in the area. We really enjoyed the Loft!
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,Enjoyed our stay!
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful place
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We love the Loft on Main! It was our first time visiting Woodward and it was perfect! We came for the mineral springs, and stayed at the Loft. It did not disappoint. It was even more lovely than the pictures. Every touch is a mixture of antique and luxurious. We would HIGHLY recommend instead of a hotel! We hope to come back every year."
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,The Loft is a wonderful place to stay in Woodward. So nice and convenient location. The sheets we soooo soft! Great place for a girls weekend (or lots of other occasions as well).
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you're coming to Woodward and need something a bit more posh, this is your stay. There are 3 bedrooms and 1.5 baths. Each bedroom as at minimum a double bed, I'm not sure if the loveseat in the master is also a sleeper.
You will need to bring your own coffee, tea, or breakfast as this is just a B without the second B. There's an ample amount of bedding, pillows, and extra blankets. Toiletries outside hand soap are not included. Kitchen utensils are included.
With that said, the decor is nice, the rooms are designed in an interesting way, and the space is comfortable. There is a blood red room with games, cards, a chase lounge, and interesting artwork for sale. Two bedrooms share the main bath, and the half bath is inside the 3rd bedroom. A common area bath does not exist. Each bed has a different comfort level: one is an older spring mattress, the next is foam, and the master was more hotel level. I preferred the foam bed in the leopard print carpet room. Allergy alert, the comforter is down in the master.
There are 12 places to eat in the kitchen and formal dining. I loved the elevator and stair option for those needing fitness and others needing knees.
The space is clean, near, and as photographed. It's downtown and eateries are as close as across the street. It appears they close rather early. You have to do some light chores before leaving. I didn't remember to take out the trash, but you need to put clothes in the washer, do the dishes, and take out the trash.
Noise? You will hear absolutely nothing from main street inside the house. I was worried about this with the loud trucks, motorcycles, and bar nearby. It was extremely quiet which is something I need.
The price is high compared to other comparable AirBnBs (for instance stayed at Disney world park in a 6 bedroom, 5 bathroom home with a heated pool, full breakfast, arcade room, Playstation 4s, and TVs in each room for only $98/ night. I'm sure they see more business though, so the overhead isn't as bad. Is it worth that price? Well considering the options when the only few hotels in town are booked, I say absolutely.
It's the best thing Woodward has to offer and you'll have a great time, so long as you're prepared. Grab some groceries, some drinks, and some good bath stuff and enjoy.
speaking of bath, one hint. if the tub is running cold for you and won't heat up, I learned that by running the shower on all the way hot a few minutes will fix that. My mom, poor thing, had a very chilly bath. I tinkered around and found the hack for myself.
Have fun! Thank you Jana et al for wonderful opportunity and stay."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice loft. We enjoyed staying there.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"From the moment we booked until we checked out, we experienced amazing fare and support! We can’t wait to come back for another visit. Our family came for a visit with local family and this was a wonderful home away from home! We forgot a few things as can be expected, but I was so thankful for the resources and snacks that Douglas provided! It helped this busy and tired mom not have to make random store runs. We didn’t do much cooking at our stay, but they had a fully stocked spice cabinet and all the things you might ever need to prepare a feast of any sort! My children are older but they made accommodations for babies up to adults! Every part of their home was beautifully organized and there were wonderful binders with perfectly detailed instructions and information about the area. It is near a busy road but Douglas has made great efforts to minimize the traffic sounds to ensure you have a peaceful stay. We will definitely book again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely love this beautiful home made us feel at home and was very clear on what to do upon check-out. Me and my family would love to stay there again. Made us feel right at home very clean I definitely loved that about this lovely home

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you r lookin for a place to stay in Woodward Ok. an don't stay here well you missed out. the fenced in patio an grill an Blackstone is the perfect spot to have a drink an get reacquainted w an old friend, or a family member that has just been working to much . This place slowed the world for me with the comfy couches an recliners an big screen tv's ,with any channel u could want. I'd come in from work an leave it at the gate, and its also roomy enough, that if i didn't Wanta see my roommate i didn't have to, i could play my guitar an not bother anyone else in the house:) ive only been playin for a couple years so not the best,hahaha. But I
honestly don't think i could've set down an designed a house an the host for my trip any better that Douglas an his wife have already did , thank you for allowing us to stay in your beautiful home ,i will be back!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is one of the very best Airbnb spaces we have ever booked and we have booked coast to coast. It is a charming building with perfectly selected and inviting decor. Everything was super clean and cozy. We used this property for family to rest during sitting round the clock with a terminally ill family member. The layout of the home provided us ample space for some family to quietly rest while others could decompress and visit and grab food. We could easily come and go during shifts with our mother. When our mother passed away, our host had provided a bottle of chilled champagne and we gathered to share a beautiful and memorable moment to remember and toast the special life we had lost. We would highly recommend this listing and are grateful it was available to us."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jamie is hands down, one of a kind! We can’t say enough about how welcoming and helpful he was throughout our entire stay! He is a wealth of knowledge and I would venture to say that every person that stays there learns something new! Jamie is so welcoming and was always available to us if we needed anything, yet always respectful of our space and privacy. The view is breathtaking and he truly has a little slice of heaven he is so lucky to call home. The location is definitely remote, yet a short drive to the dunes and Waynoka where we wanted to visit the Rattle Snake Hunt event for the weekend. We had our dogs with us and it was the perfect space for us to set up to have them with us but also safe while we went into town. Thank you so much Jamie, for the hospitality and sharing your beautiful property with us. We will definitely be staying there again when visiting the area!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I cannot thank Jaime enough for the hospitality and kindness he showed my boyfriend and me. We decided last minute to get away and Jaime took us in with no problem and quickly got everything ready for us. We have never had a host respond or take care of us in a way he did. It was so peaceful and so amazing to be able to be in the country like that. And I absolutely loved the star gazing we did! It's a must for us to go back. We shall see you soon Jaime!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Quiet place. Good shower
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This stay is one of our most unique and cool AirBnB stays. We caught some incredible weather with clear skies….you could see for miles with some of the cleanest air ever. Enjoyed several good discussions with Jamie about life and gardening. A really nice host. The guest house while adjacent to the old Wolf house was private and fully furnished to meet all our needs. Very comfortable. Spent twilight with my binoculars watching a family of deer play in a field down in the valley below. Saw the Milky Way in the middle of the night. Too cool! Jamie’s garden is impressive. Would definitely go out of my way to stay there again!

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My experience at Jamie’s place was spectacular. He is an incredibly gracious host, and went above and beyond to ensure my comfort was guaranteed. And the night sky out in the country…there is nothing so beautiful. Close enough to town to make getting food and supplies easy, but far enough away to know you are away from it all. I loved it!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jamie has a nice house with beautiful countryside that is very secluded but may be hard to find. Jamie is very nice and helpful, great stay!"
