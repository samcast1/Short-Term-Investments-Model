2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Google maps kept bringing us a block further than where it actually was. Stayed here so we could avoid all the city traffic of indianapolis.
Mary was nice and easy going. I had an interview at 11am and she gladly let me stay past the check out time to do it. Responded every time I messaged her. Great host."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Clean apartment, quiet place, near groceries, bank and pharmacy.
Mary was very kind and clear on all the answers.
I will be back!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was clean and tidy and Mary was always responsive and helpful. When we arrived the heat wasn’t on or working, which was very inconvenient in the winter. But Mary replied quickly and had someone over to fix it asap. Location is nice and overall a great stay. Only thing is the apartment does not come with any shower supplies (shampoo, soap, etc) so be sure to bring your own! Overall a nice place in Danville"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my first time staying in the owl house. It was really hard to leave. Everything about it is perfect. The smell, the shower, the screened in porch, the bed, the small kitchen."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cutest!! Everything about this place was fantastic and Dave was a great host. Peaceful surroundings (you can hear some road noise but it really isn't bothersome at all), everything about The Owl House was well thought out. Dave was accommodating, responsive, and so kind. Sauna was wonderful, having no TV was perfect, and the trailer bedroom was adorable (and the bed was comfy!!)."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and exactly as advertised. Dave was a very friendly and responsive host!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is what an Airbnb should be! Dave's place is clean, peaceful, has any amenities you could need, except a TV, and you don't need it. I can not recommend this place highly enough. We'll be traveling back through in June and I hope we can stay again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We booked the Owl House for a few days in April in order to be close to 2024 total eclipse path. We absolutely loved the Owl House. Start with the clever design of the cabin around the Shasta camper and the setting in the woods on the edge of a creek valley. The windows and screen porch make the most of the woods sights and sounds. This is a birder's paradise.
The extremely clean is modern, yet rustic, small, yet spacious, uncluttered with everything you need. Beautiful lighting and furnishings in harmony with the settling. We appreciated the high quality craftsmanship and attention to detail inside and out.
The shower was a delight, the bed comfortable, the kitchen perfect, the desk space and living room all offer peaceful views of the woods. The screened porch was our favorite space of all. The cabin is set back quiet a ways from the road and there is little traffic so not much sound interrupts the birds singing.
We appreciated the wifi, but no TV.
We hope to return!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Owl House was exactly what my wife and I were looking! We try to get away 3-4 days a quarter from our busy lives to completely disconnect and this place was perfect! The home and grounds were beautiful. The place was spotless and super tidy. Dave and Joel were very friendly and were very responsive when needed. They were readily available but respected our space and privacy. Shower, kitchen and open concept living area was amazing and The bed was super Comfy! Sleeping in the Shasta was also very cool and Unique! The 3 season room was perfect to sit and have a meal, or just relax and take in the literal owls and birds outside! My wife enjoyed reading on the hammock chair while outside! We will be coming back again as this has taken the trophy for our favorite getaway location!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I stayed at The Owl House for an AQHA show at Gordyville. His place was perfect - a 10 minute drive to our show grounds and a comfortable, serene location to relax. The RO system was a stellar touch, as was the walk-in shower, screened in porch, fireplace… the bed was as comfortable as my own at home. I would love to come back and I’m upset with myself for sharing it with so many horse show folks! ;)"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Owl House was an amazing escape from our busy life in Chicago. We wanted a place with all the amenities but still surrounded by nature, and that's exactly what we found at the Owl House. It had lots of outdoor features like fire pits, swings, a netted sunroom, and even a fireplace. The netted sunroom was especially nice because you could enjoy your morning coffee or read a book outdoors while still being covered. Inside, it had a modern cabin feel, but with a twist—the sleeping area was a Shasta camper built into the home, giving it a cozy and unique vibe. Dealing with the host, Dave, was also a pleasure. If you ever need a peaceful getaway like we did, we highly recommend this place."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my 2nd stay at the Owl House and won't be my last! The most peaceful surroundings, coziest fireplace, unique bedroom and restful stay. Close to home yet feels a million miles away. Thank you for your hospitality!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very peaceful, cute, and cozy! Was better than the pictures!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay. We took a walk around the property and down to the river. There was a camping kit in the draw that they let us use. While we were there we carved pumpkins and played a lot of board games. Some of the things we really liked were the swing on the porch, the trees through the windows during the fall, and the camper bed. We really enjoyed our stay. Signed, Lily-11 & Hazel-9
What a beautifully peaceful & relaxing location to make great memories. It was truly magical!!! Signed, Grandma Chris-66"

I look forward to staying longer next time. Dave is a wonderful host, and the property is lovely. I really enjoyed the large windows and screened in porch. We saw deer and way too many birds to count. It's a great place to stargaze and really relax. Owl House was spotless and ready for our arrival. The whole experience was exactly what we needed. Five stars!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I love staying at The Owl House. Dave & Debbie are the perfect hosts!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were warmly greeted by Dave when we arrived. It was a great getaway for our Anniversary. We enjoyed the screened-in porch. We spent most of our time out there. I could have slept in the hammock. It was so comfortable! My husband loved all of the cedar wood that was inside. The vintage camper that we slept in was very cool. The king bed was amazingly comfortable. It had everything that they said it would, and the accommodations more than exceeded our expectations.. We enjoyed watching all the birds and nature. On our last morning we even saw a pileated woodpecker. It was very peaceful and relaxing. We would definitely recommend for a quiet and relaxing getaway.
Ps: We even found the best steakehouse around. Longbranch Steakhouse in Gifford, IL. It's family owned and operated."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at the owl house, if you're looking for a place in the area I highly recommend it. The hosts were wonderful and the accommodations were superb. We especially enjoyed sitting on the enclosed porch and melting into the hammock swing.
We were in the area for a graduation at University of Illinois which was a very doable drive. Thank you so much for a wonderful stay, we hope to be back in the future!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A Peaceful and Unique refuge. I recently stayed at The Owl House for Mom’s Weekend at UIUC. At just over 30 minutes out of town, Owl House was a wonderful retreat from the hustle and bustle. Everything was sparkling clean. The view off of the porch is so pretty and the porch itself is such a pleasant place to hang out especially with morning coffee. The Shasta is SUCH a fun touch. The bed is comfy and it felt like glamping with the working camper windows open to allow the cool spring air in. Great LARGE rainfall shower and bathroom with plenty of space. The open concept living area with fireplace was a great place to hang out in the evening after returning from our day. We really loved our stay."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The cottage was AMAZING. It was old school charm and super cozy. Katelyn even had a Christmas tree up and cute decorations throughout. We definitely felt at home. The location was perfect and I’m just sad we didn’t have time to eat s’mores by the fire.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Katelyn's cottage was a pleasant surprise with such charm! The pictures don't do it justice! It was in immaculate condition with adorable farmhouse decor inside and out. The furniture and beds were extremely comfortable with good quality bedding and linens, which I appreciated so much. There's a TV in each room, she provided grilling and outdoor supplies, had all necessary kitchen utensils and supplies, and offered good quality coffee in the morning. My daughters got to thoroughly enjoy the swing set, but my only regret was not arriving with enough time to enjoy the fire and s'mores she had set up so nicely for us! It was conveniently located to the interstate, easy to find, and close enough to town that there were many door dash options. We will definitely be staying here again the next time we have a trip out that way. I highly recommend staying here, you will be so happy you did!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Stayed a few times here now. Love it every time. So peaceful and relaxing. I’ll stay here every time I come to the area if it’s available.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Super location and great for pets
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Rustic and serene are the perfect words to describe this lovely little cabin. It was peaceful and private, and really just a lovely little getaway in a lovely set of woodland along the river. They had a great biodiversity of trees and understory plants, and wildlife was aplenty, we saw several bird species, including a full showing of wild turkeys- males displaying and all!
Hosts were very clear in instructions to enter and check out and it was obvious that they thought of all the little things- fire pit, unlimited firewood, various board games and activities and a great DVD selection, with lots of cozy blankets. They provided great food and drink recommendations, and everything was cozy and comfortable.
My only recommendation for fellow “cold feet” folks would be to make sure you pack your slippers (I forgot mine!) because the floor gets a little cold, but they had plenty of soft, warm blankets and area rugs to make it all comfy nonetheless.
Thank you to the wonderful hosts!"
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Love staying here.

The outside is amazing and such a beautiful escape from the city!! Really happy we found this place and would highly recommend for a unique escape and little cabin feel 😊
We didn’t realize 2 would be sleeping on recliners or sleeping bags, so maybe keep that in mind. It would be perfect for 2 and you can make it work for 4 like we did! 😉
Our kids really loved the games to play.
Thank you Eric & Lindsey for a cozy place to stay!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Always a pleasure to stay here!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I absolutely enjoyed our stay and our little puppy too. It was very cozy and relaxing. we have been married for 41 years come August and we try to do these little getaway trips every so often to relax and refocus since we work so much. This was one of our best trips. It was a little chilly but I sat out on the porch early morning in the rocker drinking my coffee, it was so calm. The place had little extras that were very nice. Their hospitality was amazing!! Thanks again Eric and Lindsey for your great little cabin!🏚️

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was our second stay at this cabin. We came back because we love it so much! It is a great way to unplug and be in nature. It has everything needed to not have to go anywhere. Check in and check out is so simple and we appreciate the privacy of this cabin. I’m certain we will be staying at this location again
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The lack of water pressure is what keeps this review from 5 stars. This is something that might be out of LindseyandErice's control. Other than this, we would stay at LindseyandEric's again! Their place is way above any other place around Danville. . . . . . . .in terms of being quiet, safe, and clean."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The hosts were very responsive and made the check in and entry very easy. They also made an early check in available to be flexible with my schedule. When I got there, they had written a very nice sympathy note due to my grandmother’s passing. Everything was clean and comfortable.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,the house is small and set back off the road. it was perfect for the two of us and our two dogs. the bed is FIRM but oddly comfortable. If visiting in winter bring slippers as the floor is concrete and can get chilly. all in all great stay and we will be back
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lindsey and Eric's cabin was perfect for a quick anniversary getaway! So peaceful and quiet. Felt like we were in the woods but it is right off interstate. We also enjoyed a wonderful dinner at Possum Trot just down the road.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this cabin in the woods! The kids loved it and enjoyed playing with the Lincoln Logs. We had them set up in the living area and us in the bedroom which worked out perfect because the bathroom is accessed though the bedroom.
We’ll definitely be staying here again!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Another great stay at Lindsey and Eric’s! My husband and I already agreed we would 110% stay here again when back in the area next year. After each of hiking or hunting at nearby parks it was wonderful to come back “home” to take a hot shower, make dinner, and relax."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved, loved, loved this little cabin!! It was SO quiet and peaceful. We had been on the road for several days and this was just what we needed to relax and unwind. Our dogs also loved the wide open space to run and explore. Sad it was too cold to enjoy the porch and fire pit areas. With or without pets I would 100% recommend this cabin. We will be staying here again for sure!!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely little overnight stop at this cozy cabin. Lindsey & Eric were extremely helpful and genuinely make guests feel welcome.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location and home away from home for our outdoorsy weekends at a nearby State Park. We loved having a comfortable place to come back to at the end of the day to warm up and relax. Even though the home is right outside of Danville, the setting is tucked into the woods and very private and quiet."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a pleasant surprise. On the edge of Danville and a very outdoorsy setting. Lots of open spaces around the cabin for corn hole toss, bocce ball, horse shoes or just throwing the ball for your pet. I mean really throwing it! The cabin backs up against acres of woods as it stretches down into a valley.. The vintage of the cabin is old and interior and exterior are very unique in decor and design.
Because of its location it has easy access to Danvilles amenities, antique shops, one of a kind cafes / restaurants, a wine
vineyard and nearby an off grid brewery. Again all nearby your cabin while taking advantage of beautiful area state and local parks and bike trail.
This cabin is near our route to and from Minnesota and North Carolina. With an active young dog it is also the perfect place to stay at a great night(s) rate. As traveling seniors and grandparents we love this type of place. We will stay here often on our travels to and from Charlotte."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It was a quick stay for us, one night, but we loved the private surroundings. Way better than any hotel! The place was clean, comfy and just what we wanted. Loved the rustic decor and the flexibility of having our dog with us. Would definitely stay here again if in the area. Even though our stay was short we still got in a hike at Kickapoo State Park and enjoyed a local brewery."

Our dog had the best time of her life running around! I love the fact that they had all these dvd’s (nostalgia) available to watch on their tv. Everything was very clean and nicely organized! They recommended going to the MadGoat Coffee shop, so we did and it’s definitely worth the visit (great coffee and some nice breakfast choices).

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What an awesome little gem...tucked away, thrown back in history. This is a fabulous little settlers cabin, in what seems like all alone in the woods. Complimentary furnishings to remind of a prior time. Comfortable, cozy, and clean. Nice set-up to sit outside and have a meal, enjoy a fire, or just listen to the birds and take in the surrounding nature. I didn't see if there was wifi, so that might be an issue for some...my 5G worked fine.
The hosts were responsive and helpful. Truly enjoyed the stay and looking forward to coming back again."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The cabin is exactly how it is described and a nice, peaceful place to turn to after several hours of driving (like in our case) or a very busy week at work. The house has the feeling of an old barn or an old cabin and is very comfortable and suited the two of us (and our dog) perfectly. Comfortable bed and updated bathroom. The kitchen is basic as an invitation to use the grill or the fireplace instead. Most of all, Lindsey and Eric are very gracious hosts, very responsive and caring. We had a great stay and would recommend their place."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, quiet private space surrounded by woods and singing birds. The cabin is comfortable and had what we needed. Highly recommended!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,It’s been about two years since we booked and it’s always fun to see what thoughtful touches they add to the space. We love to get away from the city for a mental health break in nature and their cabin is in such a great area for outdoor activities. Lindsey is a awesome host!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is such a cute little cabin and was very peaceful! It is a gem of a place and just what we needed for our Anniversary getaway. Easy check-in process. Everything was clean. There were very thoughtful amenities scattered throughout the cabin (phone charger -my husband had forgotten his, games, sound machine, extra blankets, space heaters, books, some snacks, and coffee, popcorn, lots of DVDs to watch, etc.) I could go on and on. I have literally never stayed at a place that put so much thought into making someone’s stay so comfortable, convenient, and homey. The hosts were very welcoming, friendly, and responsive to my messages. We would love to visit this little slice of heaven again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute place that provided a quiet get away. Very clean and Lindsey and Eric were very easy to communicate with. Felt very welcome.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It was the best stay for my husband, corgi, and I on our cross country move from VA. We were able to check in easily, great communication, and private area making it a home feeling. It was rainy and we only stayed the night, so we weren't able to use the firepit.

Thanks again for hosting us Lindsey and Eric and we will for sure be back!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Quaint little cabin! We would definitely stay again. We had about 6-8 deer welcome us as we drove up. It was a little chilly outside so we did not choose to take advantage of the great fire pit area. Our dogs absolutely loved it. We felt at home since our home sits in the woods as well. Thanks for having us!

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Of all my experiences with AirBnB and other short-term rentals, my experience with Lindsey, Eric, and their cabin was the absolute best. The cabin offered a truly serene escape for my boyfriend, his dog, and me twice after very long travel days between North Carolina and Minnesota, and we greatly appreciated the opportunity to rest in the perfect place. However, the owners were the most incredible part of our experience. They were extremely kind, friendly, and responsive. Check-in and check-out was a breeze, and it was so refreshing to read sweet welcome notes from the owners upon check-in. We plan to book future visits at this wonderful little cabin in the woods during our travels, and I would highly recommend this to others as well."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My little dog and I were charmed by this lovely house in Danville. We especially went to Danville to attend a lecture that was, unfortunately, cancelled due to the presenter’s having been injured in a fall but we made the most of our trip enjoying the cozy little house. We had nice walks outside and were comfortable and warm inside (despite cold weather and - surprise!- snow). We have been traveling a lot this year so it was a treat to sit on the sofa, read and snuggle. The electric blanket was a welcome addition to warm up the bed before bedtime.
We have learned to travel with our own tea, electric kettle and teapot due to hosts usual failure to provide for tea drinkers, but we were pleased to see that good black tea bags and an electric kettle were provided. There was also coffee from a local shop.
We may return in warm weather with our kayak to enjoy some paddling and hiking. The little house (former donkey stable) makes for a very pleasant home away from home."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Lindsey and Eric have a beautiful cabin on a large piece of land close to national parks and bike trails. We loved making fires and playing ghost in the graveyard in the evening! It was a very memorable time for our family. We would love to return!

We love this place, our 2nd stay here.
Close to interstate 74. Plenty of attractions both in Danville as well as next door in Indiana. Be sure to see Heron Park, the restored theater downtown & the museum in Danville.
Covered Bridges galore just next door in Parke County, IN & lots of festivals.
Champaign/Urbana also has lots of things going on.
Or enjoy the quiet to read a book, snuggle, or hear yourself take a deep breath.
Enjoy."

They allowed my dogs to run around off leash and even into the field, which was unexpected and wonderful, the dogs were so happy. We had a 30-40 minute drive to get to Turkey Run and the Shades.
Entering involves turning the lock at the top and not just the knob. The kitchen was a bit bare bones but was fine for us.
Note that in order to stargaze, you’ll have to walk quite a bit into the field to get away from very bright and tall lighting."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We really enjoyed this quiet spot for our new years! Exactly what we wished for on a fairly short notice! Thank you!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I had to make a trip for a funeral and needed a place to stay. How lucky we were to have found this gem among gems as a small refuge while we attended a two day funeral. The coziness and cleanliness stood out, for sure! The bed was like sleeping on a cloud with quality linens and the bathroom was spotless. The kitchen was perfectly stocked and the living room was downright cozy. The farm is beautiful and the history all among the airbnb is a pleasure to read and see. We will be back and can't wait to have time to take in the beauty of the farm. If you need a retreat and a place to call home away from home, Highland Farm is it!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We were very comfortable at the farm. We appreciated the peace and quiet. The place is nicely decorated and the master bed is very comfortable.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was our 3rd stay here. We have family in Georgetown so this makes it very convenient and we can bring our pups with us.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at A&B, hosted by Kaloni. The experience was nothing short of excellent, offering a peaceful retreat where the night sky dazzled with stars a perfect contrast to the hectic city life. Kaloni’s hospitality was comparable to a concierge at a five-star hotel, attentive and highly accommodating.
One particular instance that stood out was when my electric car ran out of range. Kaloni went out of their way to find a fast-charging location that wasn't publicly advertised, ensuring my travel plans remained uninterrupted. This level of thoughtfulness and effort truly set Kaloni apart as a host.
For anyone seeking a tranquil getaway with top-notch hospitality, I highly recommend A&B. My stay was a delightful experience, and I look forward to returning."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We came to the Farm from Ohio for a funeral. the host was very accommodating and super helpful! even when we were struggling with electric in the Master, the hose was quick to get it fixed.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful country setting with beautiful views. Clean and comfortable. The beds were so comfortable my parents slept in every day! They got the much needed rest that they came for. Safest place to stay in the county! Great hosts, awesome everything!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Very relaxing with great views.
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time the location was great. The sheets and towels we're lovely and the place was very clean. Be prepared that this is not truly a two-bedroom. It is a one bedroom with a walk-in closet that has a full size bed inside of it. you have to walk through one bedroom to get to the other. another thing that would make a world of difference in the comfort of the guest would be to provide some shade. there is a large slab of concrete and gravel but no umbrella or awning or anything to provide shade when you're sitting outside. there's a wonderful place for a campfire but bring your own wood. we would stay there again these are just some things that would take it to the next level. We are a very seasoned Airbnb group and these are the improvements we discussed. overall good clean place to sleep, shower and relax."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was my first Airbnb (the farm) and it couldn't have been more perfect. I was a little nervous in the beginning, but Kaloni and her brother truly made me feel very welcome. I felt right at home from then on. This beautiful place is steeped in family history and you can feel it in the land surrounding you. Unbeatable sunsets and sunrises! The vantage point of this property allowed me to see one of the most spectacular lightning shows I have ever seen!
Wildlife abounds in this area. Ive not seen so many deer! They literally take their time crossing Mill Road, so be careful! Ive had to stop and just watch as 20 or so deer casually crossed the road. It was great! It is a magical place for sure.
I cannot recommend the farm stay enough. It is Indiana at its finest! Thank you Keloni, for allowing me to stay! I absolutely will be back very soon!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The farm stay is an interesting stay. Kaloni does a great job on keeping things up to date and clean. The place is easy to find and parking is great. It serves us perfect while visiting family in the area.

House was great and centrally located for spending time with family in Illinois and Indiana. Bed was very comfortable.

2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location very convenient to go to covered bridge festival‘s nice sitting area outside even though it was too cold for us to enjoy would be perfect in the spring in the summer for visiting .

2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay here was great. Perfect location for visiting our family in Georgetown. Kaloni was very accommodating and communicative. The decor was adorable and the beds were comfortable. The kids loved playing with the toys available. One thing to note is you do have to walk through the queen bedroom to get to the master bedroom. Wasn’t an issue for our stay, but may be awkward for 2 couples staying there. That being said, we would definitely stay here again."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at the farm! It was super comfy, private, but also close enough to activities so you don't feel you have to drive far to get places (brewery, restaurants, parks). We would love to come back again in the future."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Kaloni's property is beautiful and right on the farm. It has the charm of a barn, but all the comforts of a modern home with nice farmhouse touches. The place was clean and the coffee bar was well stocked. The patio was a perfect setting for us to barbeque under the stars and enjoy the sound of rustling corn crops. We were able to make a day trip to the Amish country and Aikman wildlife adventure. Our dog loved the open grounds. Check-in and out process was smooth and Kaloni was very responsive. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who would like to experience living on a farm in an updated setting."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Echo everyone’s positive comments. The place is truly a gem. Everything you could possibly need is in the cabinets. Even dog bowls.
Wonderful, fast communicator. Fabulous taste in interior design. The bed was SO comfy. The layout of the living room was cozy. I have not one bad thing to say."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Highland Farm was such a spacious, comfortable and well needed get away from the city. The sunsets are GORGEOUS and our dog loved trailing all the scents of nature. It’s perfectly nestled and a short drive to all the trails we love to hike. A true gem if you’re looking for a weekend stay within 3 hours drive of Chicago."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Excellent! Clean, VERY QUIET, and close to everything we wanted to do.
We visited family in Indianola, Danville, Westville, went to Forest Glen for a reunion.... The place was central to all.
Out in the middle of the cornfield, so did I mention quiet? This is a huge plus for this property in my opinion. On top of that, it was SUPER comfortable, and communication/accommodation was top notch. Immediate response to questions, extra linens when we needed them - superb owner experience.
I think the best response from our family members was when we said we were in an AirBnB in Georgetown was, ""I didn't know there WAS one out there"". Well, we spread the word and hope to use the space again. 5 Stars."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A relaxing place to stay. I loved the sound of the rustling corn fields in the cool of the night. I liked reading about the history of the farm.

Kaloni is very helpful and quick to respond. Would definitely stay again!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place !
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I originally booked this to just find a quiet place in the country to get some heads-down work done, and it was perfect for that and more. The unit itself appears to be part of the business office of what was a working farm. They renovated and decorated it beautifully. Despite the heatwave outside, the unit stay nice and comfortable the entire time. The master bedroom has a big bed and the softest blankets I've ever used. I had a large desk to work on, and the wifi was robust and reliable.
The BEST part of this AirBnB has to be the secret fishing hole near the back of the property. I brought my pole and tackle box and secured permission with the hosts to venture to the pond (get permission first). It's about 1/2 mile across a cornfield in a grove of trees off in the distance. This is a man-made (70s or 80s?) pond that you would bet was natural. It was stocked for years because the owner wanted to make it a great place for his grandkids. He succeeded, for sure. It's beautiful and largely pristine, and better yet, teaming with fish. I caught at least 10 large mouth bass over 2 nights. Despite the bugs in early evening, and the hike, it was completely worth being able to spend some time in this beautiful spot.
Even though this was technically a working trip, I was able to relax and enjoy myself a little which was icing on the cake. Thanks Kaloni!"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This airbnb was lovely, and far larger than I expected! I was in the area for work, and the internet was speedy enough that I could finish work from there on the evenings. I didn't have time to cook this trip, but I noticed that the kitchen was stocked with everything I would need for a good meal, even a stand mixer!
My GPS tried to send me a mile or so down the road. If you have the same problem: the rental property is well lit (unlike the random farm house my GPS tried to send me to), and easy to see from the road."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is an extremely comfortable and clean space. It's well stocked and decorated beautifully! You'll definitely enjoy your stay.

The Mad Goat Cafe in Danville is a good place to have breakfast."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This Airbnb is a gem - was a wonderful place for a weekend getaway. Oftentimes pictures make the place look nicer than it is - not the case here.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful place to stay for the eclipse! we had 98% totality from the little river viewing spot where the campfire pit is at. it was so peaceful to be at this Airbnb; the sauna was pristine and so nice to use!
longer walking trails were a bit further away than expected but we did enjoy walking all along the acreage! The wren house is attached to the host's house but it still very private and cozy. The host's also respected our space and we felt very secluded. Will come back again someday! thanks!"

We enjoyed a camp fire by the water and hiked at Forest Glen Preserve, Kennekuk County Park, and Kickapoo State Park, and had a sauna after being out in the woods all day. Thanks for creating such a lovely retreat! —Ellie"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very nice house! Dave is very kind and helpful. I really recommend this place to stay with family.
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,We had such a beautiful and peaceful stay at the Wren house. Me and my family loved how quiet and private it was. The view of the woods was amazing and it even stormed while we were there so we got to enjoy the sounds of the rain. The location is attached to their home and I was actually very nervous about this because we have two toddlers and I honestly didn’t want to bother them. The only complaint I have is the water pressure is very low and you can’t run any other water if someone is trying to shower. Despite that we really loved the space and area.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Awesome weekend getaway. Love being in nature!!!! The space is beautiful.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our experience far exceeded what we expected. We will definitely return to this place for another getaway. The fall colors were amazing! Perfect time of year for this place!

Thank you"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is fantastic. So peaceful and beautiful both in terms of the space itself and the outdoor surroundings. I really enjoyed the sauna and the screened porch, especially. Just perfect for relaxing solitude. Can't wait to be back on another visit."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect weekend getaway less than an hour from Champaign. Debbie and Dave have done an amazing job at creating a beautiful space to share and they were great hosts. Highly recommend!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice little place to get away. Plenty acres to relax on, property borders the river, enjoyed one evening by the river and fire. State park not too far with plenty of lakes. Kennekuk County Park and lake vermillion require a $13 daily pass for all watercraft."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A very peaceful stay. Reasonably close to Champaign-Urbana but in another world. The birds sounds and nature views were wonderful. The space is clean and uncluttered and a perfect getaway. The porch swings were especially enjoyable!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Wren House was a beautiful home surrounded by nature. The screened in porch with 2 chair hammocks was extremely peaceful.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Debbie and Dave are wondering people! They were so nice and always available. We stayed at the Wren House and it was even more beautiful then the pictures showed! If we ever come back to the area, I will definitely make sure to stay with them again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the nicest property’s I have ever stayed. If you are looking for a private spot with lots of nature, this is the place that you should book! Will definitely be returning to this location. The hosts were amazing people. Felt right at home. Loved the sauna as well!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is our 2nd time at Debbie’s place and it was just as amazing this time as last!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Deb and Dave are great host. We can’t wait for our next stay.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful quiet retreat near a lovely river.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a very pleasant stay! Debbie and Dave were lovely to visit with and very welcoming! The beautiful tall trees blowing in the wind by the river were breathtaking and peaceful. Will definitely be back! My wife loved the scent free linens and the towels that actually dried us off.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay. Very serene and comfortable. Great hosts and very responsive and helpful. I really enjoyed my stay.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My family came for graduation, and they loved having a beautiful, private, peaceful place to stay! They already want to stay again. Thank you!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wren house was beautiful and peaceful. We loved the wide variety of birds. Bring your binoculars for bird watching from a cozy porch. The hosts are lovely people and provide a lovely Airbnb experience. Our autistic adult son enjoyed the porch swings and the quiet restful space. The scent free linens and towels were also wonderful to have. Would love to have another long stay at Wren house. Restful and delightful.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed my time here resting and listening to birds.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot say enough wonderful things about our hosts Debbie and Dave! We were met at the house upon arrival with a lot of helpful Information and enthusiasm, as if we were family. The home is well appointed, comfortable with the peacefulness of the woods and birds at your reach. They allowed up to pick vegetables from their garden and to tour their new guesthouse on the property called the Owl House, where they incorporated a 1963 Shasta camper into the build of the home and is the the master bedroom. Thank you for allowing us to stay, until next time."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Debbie and her husband were very polite and was very quick to respond to any questions I had. The property very clean and peaceful with the screened in porch. I would definitely come back again for a relaxing weekend escape again!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"From start to finish, A+. I had some issues with the website (I'm newer to airbnb) and Debbie was very patient, communicative, and helpful. Throughout really, great communication, and very nice to work with. The place was gorgeous, clean, had everything it needed and no more. The location was really quiet, we absolutely felt at home, more at-home than we sometimes do at our actual home. Debbie was very responsive when we had questions, but mostly she set things up well enough for us to be autonomous and happy. Easy-peasy, A+, spent the car ride back home chatting about when we might be able to come back and visit again!! 🙏"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A lovely spot in the woods with a river close by and lots of birds and other wildlife. Would highly recommend this place.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay! The space was more beautiful than the photos, and the setting was so serene. The beds were comfortable, and no detail was overlooked. Debbie was so helpful and friendly—a perfect host! The whole family, setting and story behind it is a treasure. We will definitely be staying again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great Stay!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing. It was beautiful inside and out. I would live to stay again. The Debbie and her husband do an amazing job at making you feel at home while you are there. The place was immaculate and the property it's on is beautiful. Thank you so much. We will see you again next year when the horse show is back in town.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My adult kids and I spent the weekend in Wren House to mark the anniversary of my husbands passing. Debbie and Dave went above and beyond to make us feel welcomed and comfortable. It is a beautiful and peaceful setting, and everything was spotless. - the perfect place to unwind and recharge. If you love bird watching, this is the place to be, and the swing chairs on the deck are wonderful - even in January bundled up in a blanket with a cup of tea!
The sauna was a real treat! You can feel the love that has gone into designing and building this space - so many little touches that make it special. The red cedar used throughout is beautiful and I’m sold on underfloor heating!
We will definitely come back and highly recommend Wren House."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wren House was a great experience! The views in every room were amazing. Wish the weather was a bit warmer so we could enjoy more of the hammocks. Definitely would love to be back, I can see there’s definitely a lot more to explore and do with nice weather! Debbie was so great with responding with all the questions we had, very friendly! There’s no tv, but for us it was no issue at all. We played lots of card games, (Debbie and Dave did provide uno and a deck of cards which was nice to have extra) and enjoyed each others company! Definitely what we wanted was quite, away from all the chaos and wren house absolutely did that for us. Do plan ahead to bring plenty of groceries because there really isn’t anything near besides a Casey’s gas station and dollar store as Debbie explained in her description. We didn’t plan on stepping out at all so we had no issues with that :)
Overall enjoyed our weekend stay and would recommend to anyone!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"All I can say is, wow! This trip far exceeded our expectations.
First and foremost - the property is perfect. The home is attached to the hosts home but separated by two garages which offers the feeling of total privacy. The living area, bedroom, and porch look out to a river that is not only beautiful, but the sounds make you feel completely at peace.
We got lucky with phenomenal weather and had the pleasure of seeing a stray cat, tons of entertaining squirrels, and an array of birds (including a crane, a wood pecker, and a hawk). If you love nature, take this opportunity to live only a couple windows within it in a beautiful space.
The house is cozy and feels right at home. No TV, which is okay if you love the person you’re with because there is more than enough to see and talk about.
When I texted and asked Debbie for Tylenol, she had it delivered to the door in less than five minutes. How awesome! No doubt we will be coming back.
Thanks Debbie & Dave, you were so kind!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay at the Wren House!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wren House is a lovely, peaceful, retreat and we will definitely be back! We had a fire, hiked around Kickapoo State Park and also Kennekuk County Park, sauna-ed and generally relaxed. Thanks!!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A very peaceful and clean place to stay, the screened-in patio and hammock chair swing were perfect for sitting with a hot cup of coffee or tea and admiring the woods and the birds. The large windows in the kitchen let a lot of light in when the sun was out and the high ceilings made the space feel very spacious."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our weekend in the Wren house! The place was super clean, had everything stocked, and had a beautiful view. Hosts were super helpful in anything we needed and we felt right at home. We will definitely be back to visit!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, comfortable and calming! That’s the best way I can sum up the Wren house :) This is a slice or nature at its best. Thank you Debbie for hosting us!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Our stay was wonderful. The house is so beautiful and comfortable. Definitely want to stay the next time we come to town. Our hosts were wonderful. Only recommendation would be to have games and a radio. We bought dice and Uno and had great nights as a family playing.
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"we had a great stay, a couple of things that people should be aware of. First the house should really be listed as a guest house. it is connected to the host main house. you do have your own entrance and the host gave us our privacy and it is separated by the garage. Second, you have to contact the host to use the sauna. Third and this is completely out of anyone's control but if you come at the beginning of October the two oak trees above the house might be dropping acorns. Three of the 4 nights we were there we had acorns pelting the roof. They sounded like rocks hitting the roof and in the middle of the night they will wake you up. this isn't the fault of the host but it is a risk you take coming in the fall. The house was very clean and we loved sitting on the porch and listening to the birds and watching the squirrels. We even had a visit from a woodchuck. We really enjoyed our stay, but just a few things to know when you book."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Debbie’s while attending a wedding nearby! We made use of the screened porch and sauna, and loved the decorations. This place is exactly what we needed for a weekend getaway."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed staying at the Wren House. At first I was a little disappointed when I didn't see a television. However, after spending the first morning enjoying the peacefulness on the screened porch, that all changed. My time at the cabin was very restful, which was really what I needed, especially having only two days between the long trip coming and going on. The cabin was very clean and cozy and had everything I needed. Debbie and Dave were very gracious. I really appreciated their sincerity in wanting my wife to come and enjoy the Wren house with me. When she couldn't and we thought my brother was coming, I appreciated their genuine kindness in saying he was more than welcome to come and stay. Debbie was quick to respond any time I messaged her with a question. She was very helpful and friendly. I had traveled to the area for a family reunion and didn't have time to enjoy the sauna and the other amenities, this time. Hopefully, I'll be able to return with my wife next year and get a chance to enjoy them then. Thank you Debbie and Dave for providing a nice place to rest."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay in the Wren House was blissful! Debbie & Dave thoughtfully designed the cottage with a variety of R&R getaway comforts in mind. I felt at home and pampered every minute. The very friendly hosts were always just a text away for any need or question I might have. My favorite place to relax was on the nature-surrounded, fully screened in porch. I cannot wait to return."
2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Debbie’s place really was cozy. It has the potential to be something extraordinary. A great relaxing place. Just a few things I think the viewers should look out for. It is connected somewhere to their main property house. So the Wren house is further in the back of the property. Also wasn’t a lot of nature to view in the surroundings, those are places you can visit. And one last thing, it might’ve just been the storm they recently had, Debbie does mention this in her listing about the bugs, mostly spiders and some other insects, we did go over with Debbie about treating the property Because….bugs want to be cozy as well lol. Other than that nice property, very good host accommodating, loved spirit the dog. But just some things to keep in mind especially if you want to be somewhat secluded on your own. Though they give you your privacy , It’s good to know their property is somewhat connected to the Wren house in the rear."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The wren is wonderful experience. The access to river was great. The place is very clean and fresh. The screened porch was the highlight of our stay. We pretty much lived out there.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent stay - perfect peaceful get-away with great hosts.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to relax in nature!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Oh, how we love the Wren House! A friend and I stayed at this beautiful cabin for a few days to get away from the busyness of life and do some writing. PERFECT SPOT. Debbie and Dave are wonderful hosts and the cabin is charming with just the right amount of minimalism while well stocked and comfortable. Love the screened-in porch and can't wait to come back."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is the perfect place to stay in East Central Illinois. The house is perfectly clean, every detail has been thought of and it’s such a relaxing place to be. The hosts are amazing. They were both so kind and willing to share information with us and always welcoming us to ask questions or ask if we needed anything. We didn’t really need much because they had done such a great job of thinking of all of those details. If you visit this area, I highly recommend this location for your visit."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful and relaxing get away.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Simply delightful. Walking in and smelling the wonderful aroma of the red cedar. Peaceful surroundings. Private. Quiet. The porch was our absolute favorite!!! Loved relaxing in the hammocks and listening to the sounds of nature! Hosts were wonderful! 🤍
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Dave and Debbie’s place was a great place for us to call home while visiting my family! The owners were quite a bit closer than we had initially thought, but they made us feel at home. The grounds are absolutely gorgeous. I loved starting every day listening to the sounds of nature while hanging out on a hammock. My 3 year old loved the house but was a bit apprehensive of the stairs and how steep they are. We loved staying and wish we had a bit more time to explore! I definitely recommend staying here. They are even constructing a really neat looking other building to rent out on the property."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had another great stay at The Wren House. Summer is even better then Winter. Beautiful and peaceful.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at the Wren House. Being surrounded by trees and singing birds and nothing else was just the break from the city we were looking for. Unfortunately it was incredibly hot and muggy so we didn’t explore (the AC worked great!), but we made great use of the screened in porch in the mornings and evenings. The fireflies were amazing- so many!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This little get away spot was perfect. Everything was very good and we had everything we needed. The cabin itself is so very pretty. I loved the craftsmanship and care put into every detail. The screen porch was my favorite place to be listening to the birds and sitting in the hammock swings. It was good for my soul.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Wren House is a lovely place to stay. It was beyond clean; it was spotless. Because we were there to watch our son play baseball in nearby Danville, we didn't get the opportunity to enjoy the walk down to the river, but we did enjoy sitting on the screened in porch each night and seeing the fireflies and occasional wildlife. I enjoyed the porch each morning while getting a little work done before going to baseball games in the afternoon. Our hosts were great. In short, we came to the area just to see our son play baseball; the Wren house made it a relaxing vacation, also. We will always look to stay there when in the area, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a clean, safe, relaxing place to stay."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wren house was a great escape while being on the road for work. The place was very nice and clean. The host were also very nice and were nearby for any needs. Would definitely stay here again.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing spot! A great space for relax
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A very comfortable space to be around nature- whether enjoying it on the trails in the yard, from the screened in porch, or inside through the big windows."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My daughter used this house to get ready for her and her bridalmaids for her wedding. It was a wonderful place and a lot of woods to take some gorgeous pictures. The home owners were wonderful and very helpful. My family wants to come back to visit just to stay here.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"One word: INCREDIBLE!
We loved this place & had a wonderful stay. I highly recommend & hope to return sometime soon. If you're interested in birding, dark skies for stargazing, communing with nature, or just want to stay somewhere cool, stay at The Wren House. We experienced all of the above & then some.
We brought food & I recommend the same, just for convenience since stores are a bit of a drive away. There were utensils available for cooking & eating on-site... we made a delicious dinner & enjoyed it immensely. Everything we needed was right there.
And really... just the overall experience of staying in such a unique space was wonderful. The enclosed porch was my favorite. The hosts were so kind & accommodating. Inspiring.
If you're considering... just book it already 😊"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is such a beautiful place. Lots of natural surroundings and the living quarters are very cozy. I loved staying here and will come again!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My partner and I had such a relaxing couple of days. The wren house was very clean and the smell of the wood was to die for. We explored the land but spent most of our time on the porch playing chess and listening to the birds.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wren House is like a delightful nature getaway. I have never seen so many different birds without leaving my very comfy hammock chair!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wren House did not disappoint! Fun quiet getaway for a long weekend. Lots of time spent on the patio listening and watching the birds, and of course, time relaxing in the sauna. We check scout Sonrise Farms and Prairie Farm - worth the outings."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is gorgeous. I spent hours on the screened in porch watching birds, deer, raccoons, squirrels, and even a beaver! I was here for a work trip, and staying in this sweet little place turned it into a mini-vacation. A lot of love has gone into this land and home."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I loved our stay at Wren House. It provide a perfect respite from our routine and stress. We enjoyed the sauna, the hammock chairs and loved trekking on the property. Dave took the time to explain how to access some of the local running spots. We cannot wait to come back. The listing for Wren House is so much better in person!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,**sent a private review
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,a wonderful place to stay to be tucked in nature
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely adorable and impeccably decorated get-away.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely cabin this is! A treasure in central Illinois. A well-furnished, thoughtfully-designed space with an amazingly relaxing sauna. We refer to this place as our ""spa,"" since it's so close to home. This is a gorgeous, well-appointed home-away-from-home that we love so much. A nice, spacious open floor plan on the first floor (good for people with mobility challenges) and so full of light. The hosts are always kind and friendly too. I couldn't recommend more!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was absolutely wonderful! The hosts, Debbie & Dave, provided excellent communication, directions, and additional information that made our stay smooth, comfortable, and hassle free. The property itself is absolutely adorable, comfortably furnished, and nicely decorated and is overall a great place to rest and relax. If we had more time, we would have loved exploring the wooded 15 acres more! Located directly off the highway outside of the main drag of Potomac, yet nestled in the woods, it is both extremely convenient, yet has the secluded feel of a cabin getaway. The property was impeccably clean and stocked with anything and everything you may need (pots, pans, cooking utensils, extra blankets, etc). The screened porch was our favorite part! It was so nice to start our day with a cup of coffee while listening to the sounds of the creek and watching the local wildlife. Everything was clean, well cared for, and welcoming. We will definitely be staying here again!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay. What a perfect cozy nature retreat! The space was lovely, and we enjoyed the screened in porch and sauna even in the winter."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I love this place. Ihave stayed here several times. The host responds quickly. The house is close to theirs but they give us privacy which I appreciate. The house is clean, relaxing and smells good. The screened in porch and hammock chairs are our favorites for sure. Even in the winter. We saw a blue heron which was neat."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"WOW! What a peaceful getaway. My husband, our 2 year old, and I felt so spoiled staying here over the weekend. Even though it was chilly outside the property was so beautiful to explore and the house itself was gorgeous. We used the sauna a few times and enjoyed that as well. Dave, Debbie, and Joel are so kind and caring and we are so blessed that they opened their home to us. We look forward to scheduling a time to come back in the summer for another getaway."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If I could give 10 stars I would! Everything about this house was perfect down to every detail. The bed was comfortable, and the dimmable lighting was really nice in the whole house. It has a beautiful kitchen and bathroom, and we especially loved the heated floors. Dave and Debbie are extremely friendly and always communicated quickly, it almost felt like we were family. The sauna was relaxing and just what we needed after some walks to explore the nature around us. We would love to stay here again!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to stay while in the area. House is clean and meticulously designed. The porch, the sauna and the kitchen will make you want to stay forever. Communication with Debbie and Dave were great and they accommodated every request. Truly wonderful hosts. Hoping to come back soon."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our family has needed to observe strict COVID distancing guidelines, so we were looking for a place to get away that was near our home where we could relax with some spa-type amenities. The Wren House and sauna were perfect. It is accessible - level floors and doorways with low shower lip access and a seat, as well as easy, level access to the sauna (for wheelchair or other accessibility support needs) paired with very comfortable bedding and seating. We used the sauna the maximum amount over the 2 nights and final morning of our stay. We feel deeply refreshed from our mini-spa vacation! The hosts were both helpful to get oriented on how to use the sauna and other amenities and gave us our privacy.
We would book this location again, as a quick weekend getaway, any time! If you're in central Illinois and just want a writing retreat or quick refresher, this place is wonderful. We were there in winter, which was beautiful for sure, but the middle fork river and forest that surround the house are undoubtedly beautiful in Spring, Summer and Autumn. If we go in warm weather, we would certainly kayak and have a bonfire! We could not recommend this location more highly."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We spend great time in this house,very clean.Thank you.We recommend😍"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A tranquil place, easy to get to and great hosts.
The lodging is first rate and clean. Great kitchen and bedrooms. Big, comfy bathroom and shower.
The trees and rivers bring peace to the head and heart. The quiet and darkness is soothing to the soul. In just a few short days, being unplugged and away during this moment was much needed.
And oh, the sauna, so nice.
We're planning our spring return already.
Thanks, Tracy and Danny"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Wren house is a wonderful location. There were 3 of us and we had plenty of room. We stayed in December, but still got to see a lot of wildlife in the woods behind the house. The house was spotless and very comfortable. The owners are very nice and helpful. We will definitely stay there again!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a real gem. Debbie and Dave are amazing hosts and will go above and beyond to make sure that your stay is comfortable. The house and property are beautiful and so well put together. There are so many little details that really elevate the experience. Also, this is the perfect place to stay if you are hoping to visit Middle Fork State Park as it is just a short drive away. I can't recommend this stay enough!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Wren House was a perfect spot for a quick getaway from the city. The place was nestled in the woods and looking out the windows you’d almost think you were in a tree house. I kept my binoculars handy and saw many birds and deer during my stay.
The kitchen had all of the basics I needed to cook a few meals during my stay. As the hosts say, I would highly recommend bringing your own groceries.
The house is a short drive from the Kickapoo State Recreation Area which has many fine hiking and mountain bike trails."
2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wren House is a gem, period ! The wooded area behind the house is something from poems and we loved our morning walks on the property. My favorite part, though, was enjoying coffee on the open-air patio."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Buy groceries off 74 before venturing out to the rental. Very few stores close by. Kitchen has just about everything you need. Google maps thinks the property is on the left if you are travelling north, it is actually on the right. Long driveway to the rental attached to owner's home."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Debbie and Dave were great hosts! Their place was so beautiful. The scenery around the house is so pretty. It was a great place to relax and wind down for the weekend.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The perfect place to unwind and enjoy nature! The hosts are super lovely and kind people. I'd reccomend checking out Kickapoo state park- great mountain bike trails
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Debbie and Dave’s space is a great place to stay if you’re looking for a peaceful getaway. We spent most of our time in the porch listening to the bird songs in the morning and the concert in the woods during the night. Having the porch as an extended living space (w/o mosquitos) was well thought out. The addition of the swings was the perfect touch. The indoors was cozy and just the right size for the four of us. The kitchen was well stocked with kitchenware but definitely take everything edible in since stores aren’t close. Take your yoga mat, a good book, board games, and put your phone on mute!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful house! It smelled of cedar, which was wonderful. The view of the woods was inspiring and beautiful, and I felt very safe since the hosts were close by. Dave and Debbie were quick to respond to any questions and were very friendly, but also respected my privacy. It was a wonderful retreat from the world."

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very attractive and comfortable apartment. We enjoyed the screened in dining space which is bordered by woods. Enjoyed listening to the birds. Friendly hosts. Spacious kitchen. Lots of hiking nearby. Enjoyed Forest Glen Preserve in particular. Would recommend.

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is fantastic - exactly the spot to be if you want to be somewhere quiet and relaxing. Debbie and Dave are extremely responsive, friendly and kind. We will definitely plan to be back! They also have a sauna that you can use. The place has a bedroom and a fun/cool loft area as second room. Modern lofty vibe. Screened porch with hammock was where we spent most of our time reading and having meals. Buy your groceries before you arrive as closest store about 20-25 mins drive away. Overall a wonderful vacation and much needed relaxation."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at the Wren House exceeded our expectations. The space was airy and spotless, and the property is beautiful. It rained much of the weekend, so we spent a lot of time on the screened-in porch, which almost gives the feeling of being in a treehouse. When it wasn’t raining, we did some hiking at Kickapoo State Park and spent an afternoon at Sleepy Creek Winery—both about 30 minutes away. Debbie and Dave were fantastic hosts, and we can’t wait to stay at the Wren House again."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Wren House is the perfect place for a weekend gateway for our girls trip. Hands down our favorite part was the screened in porch with hammocks that overlooked the forest leading to the river. If we were not out by the river or hiking, we were out on the screened in porch taking in the beautiful landscape. The hosts were fantastic, quick to respond, and they even built us a fire one night. The house was adorable and had everything we needed. It really was the perfect place and is on our list to go back to!"

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location was very pretty and peaceful. The house was Gorgeous, with the cedar that was used in the house it made it smell really nice. We really enjoyed eating breakfast while reading in the enclosed porch in the mornings. The hosts Debbie and Dave were really nice and even made us a bonfire one night which we really appreciate. All around it was a really nice trip!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"10/10 recommend! Read the listing because no joke, there’s nothing around but a Casey’s and Dollar General but the property is the perfect escape for city life. Dave and Debbie live in an attached home and couldn’t be sweeter or more helpful! We will definitely be back"

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place on the Middle Fork of the Vermillion. We used it for a river trip base camp and it was ideal. The location is nice for driving to the rivers and parks. The screened in porch off the back is a very nice oasis in the evening. The hosts were very friendly, hospitable and helpful. The place was very clean and well kept. It could not have been a better experience! Except the river could have been a little higher!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Wren House was absolutely perfect. It had everything we needed. It was very clean and everything was in beautiful condition.

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at the Wren House! What a beautiful little home. Windows everywhere looking out to trees, birds, and a river. A lovely screened-in porch with comfortable seating. Full kitchen and comfortable bed.
Wifi was very good on the whole, though it had two outages while we were there - one for about an hour and one for about 10 minutes. The rest of the time, the wifi was good enough to support me and my husband both on Zoom calls simultaneously with no lag.
The hosts offered really special experiences to complement the gorgeous, comfortable home. They built us a fire so we could have a romantic evening by the river and helped us get fresh eggs from their chicken coop. They also showed us around the property and let us pet their dog. A great stay. Total privacy if you want it, and great support from the hosts if you want that. I highly recommend this home!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I can’t say enough wonderful things about this place. What a perfect getaway from the city for our little family! Every detail is thought out and beautiful. We had everything we needed and enjoyed cooking there. We loved the smell of the Cedar and being surrounded by the woods! It was the perfect place to unwind and detach. Debbie and her husband were welcoming and very responsive. They helped us find great hiking trails we could take our little babe on! I am hoping we can visit again!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was a perfect spot to stay while at a horse show in Gordyville. Wish we had time to explore the woods and sauna. Maybe next time. Loved it.

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is so beautiful. Perfect for a relaxing vacation. We went there in March, but I think it's going to be even more beautiful in fall with all the tree colors changing. You can see the woods and the river through the windows and it's beautiful. Dave and Debbie were super helpful and always there to help us. This house was built recently so everything was brand new and clean."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place! I came here with my two kids to escape the city. We had a relaxing experience and enjoyed the quiet. I would definitely stay here again!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Debbie and Dave built a really beautiful place. The sunlight comes pouring in all day and you're surrounded by trees and birds, right on the river. It's a very functional and comfortable space. The sauna is amazing and there are firepits to use as well- and fresh eggs from their chickens! Debbie and Dave are incredibly nice, interesting and fun to talk to. It was the perfect quiet, relaxing getaway."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The screened in porch might have been my favorite feature, we sat out there quite a bit during our stay. Everything was very clean and the space is so welcoming. We cooked all of our meals there so it was nice that the kitchen was well equipped. Debbie even left fresh flowers by the door for us while we were out one afternoon, it was a nice gesture. Definitely recommend Wren House."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a gem! Our hosts were welcoming and Wren House is lovely. We did some hiking nearby, had a fire, enjoyed a sauna, and hung out on the back porch listening to birds! We will definitely be back. -Ellie and Candy"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We couldn’t of had a better stay. The weather was nice for our kids to explore all the land they have. This place has everything you need and more. Fresh eggs from the chicken coop for breakfast and a nice sweat in the sauna before bed. We hope to come back over the summer to see all its beauty.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great house and a great property.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great spot to escape the city for a weekend - super clean and cozy, and the sauna was a treat! Very welcoming hosts, they even gave us some eggs from their chickens! Would love to come back in the spring or fall to explore the walking trails more. Highly recommend."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the Wren House way exceeded our expectations! First off, the place is a gem. Newly built, thoughtfully constructed, and exceedingly comfortable thanks to the radiant flooring, despite temperatures that fell below 0 F while we were there. It's a bit hard to tell from the listing, but the Wren House is attached to the main house where Debbie and Dave live. So while it's not isolated, it still felt private. We weren't able to hear any noises from the house. The views of the woods and river from the house are amazing, and there is quite a bit of forested area on their property you can wander. There is a beautiful screened in porch that we would have used more if the weather had been better. The kitchen was well-equipped for cooking meals, and the mattress in the main bedroom was wonderfully comfortable. While we spent most of our time at the house, we did run a few errands in Champaign-Urbana which is just over half an hour away.
Debbie and Dave were incredibly hospitable and treated us like family. They welcomed us at check-in and said goodbye at check-out, and communicated very well via the Airbnb app and text. They gave some hiking recommendations and coordinated access to the sauna (so nice!!!), and even built a fire pit down by the river one evening of our stay.
We couldn't recommend the Wren House enough for a getaway weekend to relax, connect with nature, and enjoy Debbie and Dave's hospitality."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was the perfect getaway for three friends! Beautiful property with a ton of trees, plus access to nice hikes (plus some local tips from our hosts!). Everything was clean, contemporary, and very cozy. And the sauna! The sauna melted all the stress and cold of this winter away."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful home and location, especially with everything covered in the snow."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Wren house is a lovely, quiet getaway. We loved how clean, bright, and quiet, and cozy it was.

I recommend catching a sunset from the bench overlooking the river. Debbie and Dave are wonderful hosts with lots of fantastic recommendations -- very hospitable folks!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Debbie and Dave's house is amazing! Our family of four had a most relaxing trip. From the moment we arrived we were overwhelmed by their hospitality and friendliness. They lit us a fire down by the river on our first night and we made s'mores and took in the beauty of the full moon and stars. Our kids loved sleeping in the loft and hanging out in the hammock chairs on the screened-in porch. They also loved greeting the chickens that hang around the property. The house is nestled in a beautiful wooded area and you will love waking up to the sunrise through the expansive windows. The sunsets are spectacular too! The house is very clean and comfortable. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a peaceful getaway!

2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"I was looking for a place for my friends and I to spend a long weekend celebrating my 50th birthday away from the city, and Dave’s place was perfect. He was communicative and friendly from the start, and the house itself was beautiful. There was a large deck outside great for conversations — loved seeing the stars! — and the kitchen inside was perfect for cooking up a meal with friends. Lots of warm, comfy living space — we didn’t feel cramped at all. Highly recommended if you’re coming soon a big group and need room."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Such a perfect place. Beautiful surroundings. Home was very clean and comfortably furnished.
We would definitely recommend to anyone needing a spacious home."

2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"I gave you a “4” for accurate description because I did not notice you mention an additional 1/2 bath on 1st floor. That was wonderful to find. Everything was perfect for myself, my brothers, and my cousins that stayed with us for my mother’s memorial service. We would definitely stay there again! Thanks Dave."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,The house was great and all the native plants and wildflowers on the property made it a perfect spot!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at the most idyllic farmhouse retreat, and I cannot express enough how truly extraordinary my experience was. From the moment I set foot on the property until the moment I reluctantly left, I was enveloped in a serene ambiance that left me rejuvenated and inspired. This review is a heartfelt ode to the charming farmhouse that provided the backdrop for an unforgettable vacation.
Nestled amidst picturesque landscapes, this farmhouse is a slice of paradise that transports you to a simpler time. The first thing that caught my attention was the authentic rustic charm it exudes. From the exposed wooden beams to the tasteful antique furnishings, every detail has been thoughtfully curated to create a cozy and inviting atmosphere.
The farmhouse itself is a testament to the perfect blend of old-world charm and modern amenities."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful farm house, even better than the pictures. Very well furnished and stocked with everything you need. Dave was very responsive and fair. Look forward to staying there again for our next visit!"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you've ever wondered what it's like to live in the country on a farm... this is pretty close! As farmers ourselves we felt like we were at home.
Beautiful rennovations that preserved this farmhouse's history.
Wonderful stay. We'd come again if we're in the area."
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Great house! Great history!

2022-08-01,4.0,Group trip,It was exactly what was stated in the description. Great home!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely wonderful.
Regardless of what brings you to this part of Illinois, you will experience what makes this part of the world so amazing.
Originally from this area, this house and landscape was the perfect reminder of home.
Ample place to relax, break bread and enjoy family time. Despite the amazing rooms and surplus of beds, we decided to stay tucked in together every night we were there.
And if you’ve never seen a starry night outside of town, walk out to the road and experience a night sky that’s surreal.
Dave made everything about the stay easy, responded quickly and was overall a great host.
Recommend a 100 times over.
From an east central IL gal who misses everything this home offers."
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house and setting is beautiful and exceeded our expectations. The beds were comfortable , rooms spacious, and we enjoyed walking the wildflower path. We listened to the owls as we fell asleep. Thank you!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Peaceful Modern Farmhouse is a wonderful, updated farmhouse on a very quiet location about a mile outside of Hoopeston. We were fortunate enough to have been put up there by Hoopeston’s Loraine Theater while we were in town for a performance. The house had all the charm of an older 100 year old home but with all the modern conveniences such as updated kitchen, bathrooms, laundry etc. The back porch was a great place to sit and visit with band members in the hustle and bustle of our busy traveling life and it was such a treat to sit and listen to listen to and watch the birds while having morning coffee. There is a nice gas grill, the kitchen has all that is needed to cook meals, including new appliances.  The downstairs has a lot of comfortable seating space in the two living areas plus a large flat screen TV.  The beds in all 4 bedrooms were very comfortable. The only negative I can think of was that the air conditioner, which kept the downstairs very cool, struggled to keep the three bedrooms on the second floor cool enough so it was a little warm. The upper attic room had its own air conditioner so was very comfortable. Other than that, it was a wonderful stay and I would happily stay there again. I recommend it to anyone needing a place to stay while in Hoopeston.
 
Diane"
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place is exactly as it is described and better. The remodel is done so well. The beds were so comfortable and the grounds were teaming with song birds, rabbits and squirrels. We also were able to see the owls as we enjoyed the awesome deck. This home was space and comfortable. We hope to return."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,BEAUTIFUL home with a lot of space!
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Ive been staying in air bnbs for nearly 10 years all over the country. This is my favorite of over 50 places I’ve stayed. It is an old country farm house on a currently working darm. completely renovated with modern amenities but with all the historical cool features and elements kept. Wonderful for a long weekend or week long stay. Its really out in rural Illinois but we loved it. Only an hour from UIUC. And just 5 mins from a small town. Its the perfect quiet weekend place for family or that girlfriend weekend!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I've never met Dave face to face, but from every interaction I have had with him, he has been great to work with. He is very professional, responsive, and accommodating. The property is awesome, well maintained, and beautifully renovated and decorated. It is a home away from home. Highly recommend."

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home has been completely renovated, everything brand new. Plenty of dishes, utensils, towels, etc. The pictures don't do it justice. We had 7 adults and 3 kids for a family reunion, and it was perfect. With 3 floors you didn't feel like you were on top of each other. The eating area had plenty of room for everyone. Just be aware it is a farm, and a few miles from the nearest town."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place! Perfect for large family gatherings.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed our stay! The house was so comfortable and absolutely beautiful…definitely a home away from home. There was plenty of space for our large family and staying here allowed us to all be together for Thanksgiving. The host was great and always available when needed. We highly recommend this home and plan on staying again in the future.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at Dave's Hoopston farm with a group of of 4 other friends and two small children. The home itself has undergone a beautiful restoration and the kitchen and bathrooms in particular are extremely beautiful, modern and clean (as is the entire house) - it was a perfect environment for the many shared meals our group collaborated on during our farm stay! At the back of the property is a beautiful fire pit where we spent our evenings with AMAZING night sky views - it was just after the new moon and we could see the milky way each night!! On the opposite side of the property is a large field of wildflowers and native pollinating plants - most was dormant during our stay but there was still a lovely walking path through the field and I imagine in the summer the blooms are a sight to be seen! Dave was extremely timely in his communication and helpful with every question we had. 10/10 recommend a stay at this beautiful spot. We will definitely be returning!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Dave’s family home was such a great retreat for our friends and their kids - 4 couples with 4 kids under 5. We had so much fun learning about the history of the farm and exploring the wildflower meadow. Very comfortable stay with a big group - loved the big living room and dining room table which was great for playing games and letting the kids sprawl out with their toys.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Dave’s place is a perfect place to meet up with family or friends. It is comfortable and well stocked with anything you could possibly need. Great sunset view from the back deck. Thank you, we had a lovely stay."

2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,This house is great if you want a big group to split or just your family. The land is AMAZING my kids played hide and go seek in the yard and we took walks through the beautiful wildflower field!!! It was our parents 50th Anniversary and we got BEAUTIFUL pictures right outside on the land with my siblings! My brother is terminally ill so it was nice for him to be able to be part of our parents vow renewal and not have to travel he just sat inside when he got tired of taking pictures and the venue for the party was 6 minutes away! Everything was comfortable and beautiful!!!! The grill worked great all utensils were there. They thought of everything! I LOVE the dispensers in the master shower and the HUGE soaker tub!! It was wonderful and so stress free which is the best when you’re in vacation!!!!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Dave’s place in Hoopeston was wonderful! House and property are beautiful. Kitchen well appointed. Views from the windows are gorgeous. Lovely, low traffic gravel roads for running. Great coffee shop and IGA grocery in town."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of the most beautiful ABNB’s we’ve stayed in. The decor was beautiful- wish I had the money to hire Jamie to design my home! Clean, easy to find, easy check in and out, felt safe.
The bar next door is noisy at night- but we played white noise on the phone and drowned out the sounds. Was amazed by all the extra amenities available! My only discomfort was the bed was a bit uncomfortable and noisy (when rolling over I was scared I would wake my husband). Such a minor thing however— overall I loved this place! Would recommend to all my friends to stay! Thanks for having us Jamie!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Always welcoming and a great place to stay. I plan to continue to book with Jamie every time I am in town.

If I must be away from home, this is the ideal surroundings. Thank you again Jamie!!!"

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The ABB was easy to find and has a store within walking distance. There are also two restaurants within walking distance. One is a Mexican bar/grill and the other is a cafe type. The best restaurant was on the same street but not walking distance. It is called Benjamin’s.
The scent walking into this ABB was amazing. The living room had a big tv on the wall and a very comfy couch. Big enough for two people to stretch out. The kitchen was very nice with all the stainless appliances. The bedroom was cozy and the whole ABB was decorated nicely.
The only cons during our trip were:
There’s a tornado siren located right behind the ABB. It did go off twice at 11:38pm. Totally not the host’s fault. Also, we heard a large truck pull up outside and someone tried to open the front door. Apparently, a family had broken down and a police officer had escorted them to the ABB, hoping the ABB was vacant. The host advised the officer the ABB wasn’t empty.
Overall, a good stay."

Jamie is very responsive, made the process easy and created a beautiful and enjoyable space. I would love to actually live in this space!
Decor is beautiful and property is homey and clean. The back patio area is a gem.
Even though it’s next to a restaurant/bar, we didn’t hear any noise, at all.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place is fantastic. I've stayed in 20-25 Airbnbs around the US and Europe and this is easily in the upper echelon in terms of cleanliness, decor and being stocked with refreshments."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We grew up in the area and needed to come back for personal business and the townhouse was a great alternative to the rising costs of hotels in Danville. We never heard anything from the bar and had no troubles with parking.
The beds were super comfortable and the sheets were amazing. The 2nd bed was more private than expected with the barn door that was not shown in the photos. The living area was a show piece, fun, eclectic, and would be great for a small friends gathering. We will think of the townhouse first if we need to come back to our home town again."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A spectacular find. The place is beautiful and Jamie is the best. Will return as often as I am able

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I cannot say enough good about Jamie’s Airbnb! The attention to detail and extras throughout were top notch. Plenty of linens, towels, blankets, and pillows. Stocked kitchen, complete with oil, cooking spray, salt and pepper and a few other spices, condiments, paper products. Even the bathroom had some extra soaps and lotion and feminine products, should you need them! The coffee bar was fantastic and very well stocked! Appreciated the snacks and water left for us! Plenty of cleaning supplies if needed. Very nice washer and dryer in a large laundry room with plenty of hangers. Liked how the place was designed (and decorated beautifully). The velvet curtain was perfect to block off the second bedroom for bathroom access. The kids loved that bed; both beds were very comfy. I’m sure the courtyard is lovely in season. Spending time hanging out in the living room was comfortable and cozy. Jamie was easy to get ahold of and responsive. Highly recommend and would definitely stay here again!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, spacious and just what we needed. Would definitely recommend. Very much enjoyed the ability to control the lighting and the indoor fireplace.
One note—you need to walk through the second bedroom to get to the bathroom (the bed is separated from the hallway by a curtain. For some groups this could be awkward, luckily we were a laid-back crew."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome place! Enjoyed our visit.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The house was represented perfectly. We had a great time!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for a wonderful stay. I am impressed with the welcoming snacks and your attention to detail.

I couldn't say enough about this awesome find!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the decor and the design of the place! High quality furnishings and appliances, very clean, looked like it was recently updated throughout. Bar located right next door but no trouble with parking or noise. Great small town!"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at Jamie’s place! Everything looked just as pictured, and the place was stocked with everything we could have possibly needed. We were in town visiting family and it felt like we were right at home in this townhouse. It was very comfortable for people to come visit, plenty of sitting room, and so much better than staying in a hotel - having a full kitchen and washer/dryer was SO great! There was a store within walking distance which was also great. The location was central to everywhere we needed to go while in town. The townhouse is located right next to a bar and grill, but the noise level was next to nothing and never bothered us. We will definitely be booking again for our yearly trips to Indiana!!"

2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,Stay was overall pretty good. Location is great and convenient to everything in Covington. You are directly on the town street but noise from surrounding businesses and cars wasn’t bad at all. We stayed for 10 days visiting family and were able to comfortably have everyone over at once. The seating options aren’t great but they did have fold out chairs that worked just fine. It’s probably a great place to host an event.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place! Super clean and quiet! Close to stores and right on the town square. We strongly recommend this property if you staying in the area. We will definitely stay here again in the future.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My daughter and I really enjoyed staying at this Airbnb. It’s fancy like a big city but located in a small town. It was awesome to come back to after hiking in Turkey Run all afternoon. We enjoyed a leisurely morning going to Juli’s coffee shop then drove about 30 minutes to hike in Shades State park. This was hands-down the best place we could find reasonably priced near the parks. The beds are comfortable, the place is stocked very nicely, the back patio is adorable, the parking is perfectly located right out front -very easy to bring your bags in and out. I highly recommend staying here. A+++ 10/10
Get some pizza from Overpass and dine in your fancy Airbnb -it was worth the hour wait to pick it up on a Friday night. Be sure to get country fried steak for carry out from Benjamins for breakfast and enjoy eating on the back patio. Covington wasn’t even on my radar before this trip but now I would definitely go back again. The grocery store was very well stocked and so clean! What a great find ! -small town Indiana with a great Airbnb at a reasonable price. Thanks Jamie!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A fantastic place to stay for a nice getaway. The decor was impeccable with many added welcome features.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Noble Townhouse is easy access, comfortable, clean, and well stocked with a spacious dining area and an adjoining living area to relax & watch TV.
The bed was very comfortable, and a large adjoining closet includes a washer/ dryer; extremely convenient for travelers.
There’s a beautiful small private enclosed patio area behind the townhouse.
Jamie was prompt with her communication, and was very understanding of an inadvertent mixup on our part concerning different time zones due to our travels.
The annual Apple Festival was being held across the street from the townhouse on the weekend of our stay; an added bonus which we really enjoyed!
Thanks for everything, Jamie!

I loved coming back here each evening after I finished my work day to just relax and unwind. It is definitely a place that I would go out of my to stay at. I am almost reluctant to write the good review because that will encourage others to stay and it may not be available when I need it. When I arrived at the Noble Townhouse, I took my husband and family on a FaceTime view of my beautiful accomodations. Thanks Jamie! I will return again and again if I can beat others to the reservation!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place to stay for our trip to Turkey Run State Park. It was amazingly clean and well stocked with anything we would need.

The first is obvious - look at how she transformed this place - it truly is unbelievable how well and uniquely she has decorated this space. Second is the little details that you will find around this rental to make your stay comfortable. One of my favorite rentals thus far! Thanks Jamie!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jaimie has thought of everything to make your stay delightful. The little town has so many quaint places for antiques and interesting historic sites .

I walked to the grocery store for some simple food items. It was very convenient, a 2 minute walk.
I will definitely be back if I’m ever looking for a place anywhere near here again.
Thank you so much for such for sharing this awesome place with us."
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"It’s so cute! The location is ideal and the design and concept are great.
If you have lots of little kids, it may not be ideal for you. For the most part it was clean. The owners are very friendly and accommodating."
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The house itself was wonderful. The beds were comfortable. The washing machine was out of order and since we had traveled 1,200 miles we had laundry we needed to wash. Luckily there was a laundry mat just two doors down next to the bar so we were able to get it done.
The only unsavory part of our stay was that there was a live band playing at the bar the first night (Friday) of our stay. They wrapped up at about 2am so we (2 children included) did not get good sleep that night. I would definitely check with Jamie for live band events that may coincide with your trip."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This place is awesome, clean, great location. I loved it! 10/10"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My first AirBnB experience couldn't gone better.
From our first contact everything with Jamie went smoothly, especially for a last minute booking as I was in the area for work for the night.
The moment I walked in the pictures didn't do justice to the space. Everything was immaculate and felt like home. Being right downtown was great for a quick bite and coffee and the central location to other towns was perfect.
Though I only spent one night, this will be my go to on future work trips or if I ever bring my family down for a festival weekend.
Make this your stay if you are in the area."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Most travelers wouldn't expect such a classy place in such a small town, but the Noble Townhouse is first class! One step into the townhouse and you feel right at home - spacious and comfortable on every level. Well furnished with amenities, and the patio in the back is unbeatable (weather permitting). Anyone who is visiting the Danville area should stay at the Noble Townhouse instead of other options available - far and away the best place to be!"

This place is comfortable and convenient and the host was easy to work with and quick with communications."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jamie is a great host. She responded quickly to texts and check-in/check-out was a breeze. This property is a showcase to the flair she has as an interior designer. Each space is staged beautifully with wonderful lighting and a luxurious feel. I think it would be a wonderful place to live. You are walking distance to a grocery story and several quaint restaurants and taverns.
Besides the visual aspect, Jamie has a well-stocked property. There are thoughtful supplies in the kitchen as well as cookware, utensils and snacks. The bathroom had personal care products with plush towels. The bed was comfortable.
All and all it was a great experience. I would stay there again in a heartbeat."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an excellent experience with this stay. The house had everything we needed, some reasonable precaution measures (we appreciated the small dim lanterns close to the floor for night walks), a fully functional and clean kitchen. I also liked the iron: one of the weirdest looking I've ever met, and at the same time, the most effective (I now want the same model for my home). The mattress is on the softer side, of which I'm not the biggest fan, but it was overall tolerable. The surroundings were tranquil, and we didn't hear any sounds from the outside."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about our stay was top-notch. Missi has put a great deal of thought into what's provided for her guests. As a result, it feels like home -- blankets for watching TV from the couch, cold water waiting for us in the fridge, full ice cube trays, a wonderful/comfortable sleigh bed with great linens, two big dressers, a full size closet with hangers, and so on.
This Airbnb is peaceful and private -- we never heard a single noise.
Missi's guestbook included two restaurant recommendations that were the same as what our friends had provided."

The space is quiet and private, but not far from the main roads that you’ll need to access to travel the area.

The few times I reached out to her with a question, Missi responded immediately. We’ll definitely check out Missi’s space next time we’re in town!"

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"It was small, but I wanted small, however, the TV would not work to bring up any of the programs that I wanted to watch. The drive-in to Missi’s place was ugly to say the least. The neighborhood was disgusting at best until you got to first Street and then there were nice houses but the drive-in was literally gross."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay back off the road. Great place to stop on a road trip or quick weekend back home.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The day before our stay the area was hit hard by a derecho. There were trees down and the power was out. Missi let me know the circumstances while we were on the road in case I wanted to make other arrangements. I opted to go ahead and stay. We arrived late night and left early morning. Even though the power was out and the humidity was at 91% the stay was good. The house stayed comfortably cool throughout the night and I was able to take a hot “combat” shower before we left. Missi left extra flashlights on the table in case we needed them and the battery operated candle lit the hallway to the bathroom. As usual it was a great experience despite Mother Nature’s angry, destructive outburst the previous day. Thank You Missi, for your wonderful hospitality. ❤️"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Spectacular little house surrounded by nature. There is absolute tranquility. Impeccable accommodation with lots of extras by the hosts (including drinks and snacks). I would definitely recommend it, I wish I could have stayed at least one more night!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you Missi for hosting us for an overnight stay. Your place was perfect for our needs. We will reach out should we travel through in the future.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The house was just as advertised and the host was responsive accommodating, and patient. A very spacious place and comfortable. My GPS (G maps) got us a little lost but I was glad for the host's instructions to get us there. Neighborhood is run down and I worried about that, but we had no problems. I was also glad for the food recommendations - The Little Nugget is great."
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Although the property was located in a kinda run-down area of Danville (dotted with Confederate flags), it was pretty easy to find, quiet, and clean. Nothing fancy, but rock solid."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Missi's Little House is very cute and comfortable. Check in was easy. The House is very clean and quiet. It was perfect. Highly Recommend.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Missi's place was really nice. Located on a large lot with woods on one side and very private location, away from other homes. Missi was easy to communicate with. We didn't have any issues with the property. It was just as described, comfortable and quiet. We were only there for one night while passing through town, but it was a great place for us to hang out and we would have stayed longer if we could have."
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"It was a nice space and Missi really is such a kind and responsive host. The only reason we won’t book at this location again is because with one bedroom and a reclining couch (segmented, not comfortable to sleep on) the space doesn’t truly accommodate even a small family of 3. If you are a couple- I would highly recommend it though."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Missi place was vey cute and quaint. Perfect for our quick overnight stay. Directions given by Missi were very helpful as well
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great place. Very spacious for a small house. Super clean and very comfortable.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great on every front. Extremely clean, well equipped. Design of layout and supplies for maximum hospitality. One of the best places I’ve ever stayed!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute place in a quiet location.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks Missi, for another great stay. I always know that I'll be walking into the same clean, comfortable and relaxing Little House. Truly appreciate the switch to fragrance free/allergen free towels and linens. Will be back soon!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We are frequent visitors to the Little House. Our stay there is enjoyable & relaxing. Missi's place is very clean & they go above & beyond. We will not hesitate to book again in the future.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Missi’s place was very lovely!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great option. Everything was fine. Host was responsive
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband & I stayed at the Little House for a second time & it was just as relaxing & wonderful as the first time. It is obvious to us Missi & her husband care about their property & care about their guests. From the water waiting for you in the refrigerator, snacks, pop, even two frozen dinners, she made sure we had what we needed. We will definitely utilize their hospitality again. The Little House is special. Thank you Missi & Kerry."
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very clean and quiet.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Missi’s place was lovely as usual. All was well. The place is very comfortable and cozy!!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I was on a long road trip from NC to WI and needed somewhere safe, quiet, clean and comfortable to stay which wasn't too far off the highway. Missi's place fit the bill! I appreciated that the directions were very detailed to get there. I also liked how this place was on its own larger piece of private land, farther away from the other properties and neighborhoods nearby. There are neighbors, but where this home is located is much nicer and quieter than nearby streets. The house had everything we needed and was very accessible. Missi was responsive and helpful to all communications."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As always, my stay at The Little House was the respite I was looking for. Missi always has The Little House clean, comfortable and welcoming. Will be back!"
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Missi’s place was a quick stopover for us on a 25h+ drive home. Only 3.5 miles from highway, very quiet and private. The cottage was warm, cute, clean and simple (not overly decorated with knick knacks and such - which is our preference). It had everything we needed. Missi has a binder with local places to eat and things to do, which I always appreciate. Our only suggestion would be switching out the fragrance cleaners to “clean and clear” versions (laundry soap, fabric softener, any cleaners, dish soap, hand soap, etc…). We are super sensitive to fragrances/scents and chemicals, I suffer with multiple chemical sensitivities, so that part was not ideal. Other than that, it was a great place!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. Nice and quite neighborhood/dead end. Would definitely stay again
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"WOW. Missi's place is fantastic and we will DEFINITELY be back! The space is so lovely and inviting. Everything is clean and cute. Temperature is easy to control, access to outside is easy, lighting is great, shower is terrific, linens are plenty and very nice... I could go on and on and we seriously look forward to returning!
Missi was so friendly and easy to contact. She gave us lovely recommendations and I felt like a GUEST...not just a random person.
(I really struggled with not giving a full 5 stars b/c they ask specifically about the location because it was completely outside of the control of Missi. However, the number of confederate flags we passed on our drive in can't be ignored and I think visitors should have a heads up)
Missi, thank you so much for a wonderful experience during a time we needed a peaceful getaway. Have a lovely season!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always a great stay at Missy's Little House!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a top tier Airbnb. Everything was great - host, space, cleanliness, and so on. I recommend it completely. To top it off, we had 7-9 deer come out to eat very near us."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We stayed on out outward and return trip. It was so much better than any hotel. It was quiet and a pleasant break. It was very clean and roomy. Next trip we will certainly return.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect little house for a weekend stay! Very close to Kickapoo State Recreation Area if hiking/biking interests you!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a cute place with plenty of room for the 2 of us. It was quiet and the deer walking by us as we sat on the front patio were quite the plus. There was a good restaurant not far although we could certainly have eaten in with the fully equipped kitchen. We will definitely return.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! I would definitely book again.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a neat little place to stay...we were in town for a 200th anniversary celebration of one of our local landmarks about 25 minutes away and it was so nice to have a cozy welcoming place to come back to each night...they even provided a nice welcome basket and a binder with instructions along with some of the names of local places to eat and visit. It was very clean, the bed was comfortable, and they included many basic items like shampoo and shower gel...😊"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Missi & her husband’s little cottage was a welcome sight with that simple home feel that evening & morning to our weary bodies traveling from St. Louis & game the day before!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Little Home was a perfect place to rest and relax. It offered a reprive from our long drive while moving across the mid-west. You will find Missi to be a wondeful host who is responsive and accomidating. We will be returning to this home.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The stay was lovely nice low key spot. Plenty of backyard relax space👍. Lovely view of the deers in the night. Overall comfy small place.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a perfect little place to stay! The space is absolutely adorable, clean, and set up so conveniently. It was so perfect for my boyfriend and I to stay the night after a friend’s wedding. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ All the way around!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thank You Missi, I highly recommend Missi she was awesome!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location and space was just what my husband and I needed! Recommendations for The Little Nugget was spot on and a fun place for us and those with children. It is centrally located so we spent a day in Urbana/Champaign, a day in Crawfordsville and a day in Turkey Run State Park. For closer hiking trails/natural birding areas Kickapoo State Park, Kennekuk County Park, Heron County Park and Wetland Boardwalk (right across the street) are AMAZING! Thank you Missi! We will be back❤️"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our short stay here in this cottage in a peaceful wooded setting. I grew up in neighboring Danville and found this location to be a very pleasant surprise. The hosts are very helpful and friendly.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,N/a
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It worked out well as we needed this spot to stay between North Carolina and Wisconsin. It was very convenient, clean, well furnished and we look forward to staying there again sometime."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"""The Little House” is an accurate choice for this home small in square feet. However, the name does not give any hint to the mansion of subtle and humble character that immediately make you feel at home. It is clearly a modern space yet it's the fusion of rustic, and farmhouse with this updated look that speak to you in a grandma like voice making sure you know you are welcome. We almost hated to lay down from great that we wouldn't have got to enjoy all it character and comfort by morning. But we still woke up refreshed and recharged already making plans to return for more than one night the next time. Five stars, Two thumbs up, and a ear busting woohoo. Reluctantly Highly recommend the little house. We say reluctantly only out of a selfish desire to keep it a personal secret, but it deserves to be enjoyed.
Thank you little house.
See you soon."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved our stay here. Would recommend to others driving through the area. This was a perfect place to rest in between days of driving.
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Quaint and quiet for overnight. Super clean and comfortable. We felt safe but did understand some concerns shared in other reviews about the streets you drive in on and what the neighborhoods look like. The place is newly done with great furniture.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Quiet and secluded place.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One of our favorite stays! A beautifully done space with awesome furniture pieces. It is located on a giant piece of land and has a great outdoor area with grill and table and chairs that we do wished we could have used, but our stay was too short! Missi was so helpful and accommodating. We enjoyed the morning coffee and the the comfy bedding, huge bathroom, and the nicest towels I think I’ve ever used :) I also SO APPRECIATED the waters in the fridge! This is the most helpful thing any Airbnb host can do for us by having water available in fridge and we were so thankful. We hope to be back again for a longer stay."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Do you want a quiet retreat for two, or a refuge to do some personal writing? This beautiful and lovingly appointed gem is hidden in an unexpected place, which makes it that much more remarkable!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A quiet and scenic home by the woods. House is warm inside and has a country feel to it. Everything you need for your stay and would stay again. Easy directions and communication with owners. Definitely worth a look.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always a great place to say with zero complaints!!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Missi was a fabulous host. Communication was great. Her place was wonderful. It was clean, comfortable and homey. It was comfortably furnished. The living room chairs and sofa ere soft and plush. Perfect after a long day of travel. Cable TV and Firestick provides you with every imaginable channel. She also provides a handy handbook of restaurants in the area. The kitchen is fully equipped with everything you need. The bedroom is large and fully furnished with a very comfortable bed. The bathroom is also large and has all of the amenities for showing/bathing.
The cottage is large and suitable for a long stay. It could easily serve as a home away from home. I would recommend Missi and her cottage."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay at Missis’! Still just as clean and homey as the first two times that I’ve stayed!

I wish I could’ve stayed longer to enjoy all the hard work that they have put into making the place comfortable and welcoming. So many little things to make the place feel like home!

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the prefect place to crash after a long day of driving cross country! Close

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Quiet house on the end of a dead end street. Comfortable and clean. It was perfect for me and my dad driving cross country to stay for the night. Same price as a hotel but full kitchen, living room etc. can’t beat that!"

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Missi has to be one of the best hosts. She's got excellent intuition about how to make a place feel welcoming and how to make guests feel welcome and at home. If you're considering becoming a host I would imagine she would be one to emulate.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"For Me this place was perfect. Quiet & comfortable! The little House seems to have a theme, with little notes in the art work throughout the house, saying things like, "" keep it simple"" ""simple living"" just a reminder of a simpler time. Newly renovated, with quality furnishings, like the hardwood bedframe (comfortable), tiffany style floor lamps, faucets, sinks & tub/ shower, all first rate. No skimping! Hospitality is as it should be, a friendly & generous reception. Security is sound, good locks on the doors, & good lighting. I felt very safe. Missi & her Hubby live within a stones throw of the little house, Great if you need anything, and at the same time giving you privacy, and not invading your space. Bonus: Great view of the Deer in the yard munching on acorns. William of Alton, IL"

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,As clean as humanly possible. Why they call it the small house I do not know very spacious and equipped with every thing they know you forgot. 5 star for deer and dear...It is a fantastic value especially compared to a motel/hklpotel by the exit of an interstate. No brainer if your close to Danville IL call here.You won't regret it...thank you super host.M&K.

Great response time and flexibility was an added bonus. Highly recommend."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We recently had the pleasure of staying at this charming lakeside cabin and it was nothing short of amazing. We felt at home in this clean and cozy small retreat. The location is breathtaking, with a beautiful lake, and a spacious patio for outdoor enjoyment, direct access to the lake from the deck, and multiple watercraft to enjoy time on the water. The peaceful surroundings, nestled among trees with no neighbors, created the perfect getaway. Despite the secluded feel, there are plenty of stores within a 10-15 min drive to get all the necessary supplies. Our family had a fantastic time, and we would definitely consider this idyllic place for another vacation.
Thank you to the host for providing such a memorable experience!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,We absolutely loved our stay here! Nothing like privacy and feeling of home away from home. This cabin was comfortable and had everything we needed; and if not nothing a quick message wouldn’t fix. We definitely want to come back for another stay soon.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great secluded getaway spot. My family and I had a great weekend. Plenty to do to pass time and exploring the area was awesome. Definitely recommend, we will be back for another stay!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great stay!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved every minute of our stay! Tha lake was beautiful, clean and for the most part we were the only ones using it! I loved all the windows the natural light was such a great way to wake up, and the views from every place/room you were in were so beautiful!
As a mom of many my only only suggestion is to bring a baby gate with you cuz the deck doesn’t have closures. Oh and if your the cooking type bring your own set of pots and pans cuz there aren’t many to choose from. But over all we had a blast and we will definitely be back again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place for a quiet vacation and fishing. The house was very clean. It was a big plus to have toys and kid’s books for children to play and enjoy.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for a wedding and this was the best place to unplug. Beautiful view, comfortable little place - away from the hustle and bustle. We will absolutely be booking here again! Thank you for a great weekend getaway."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable cabin in a beautiful setting! We appreciated all the amenities that made it ""home"" for a week. It was too cold to get in the water and try the available water toys but enjoyed the deck & view for morning coffee & dining."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great, intimate and peaceful cabin. Beautiful surroundings, well-appointed accommodations. Stayed in the cool part of the year so couldn’t take advantage of the lake activities, but there would be plenty of fun to be had in warm weather. Super host! Great find and highly recommended."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was awesome. Beautiful lake to yourself and had an awesome deck/dock. 5-10 minute drive to any supplies you may need. Brittany was very communicative too. Very peaceful getaway
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a wonderfully relaxing stay. There is a view of the lake from every room. There is no internet but that is perfect if you are looking to unplug, like we were. The state park is right across the road and offers beautiful hiking and biking trails"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed for at Brittany's place for the weekend. It's such a lovely retreat, we were able to relax and enjoy nature and simply disconnect from our daily routine. The place is kept tidy and clean, and Brittany is a great host. We will go back there again."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great getaway! Clean and quiet! Highly recommend!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I want to write bad things because I don't want others to find out about the hidden gem that is THIS AIRBNB. Mostly private, quiet, in a state park!, on a private lake, no wifi, full kitchen, awesome grill and firepit, I COULD GO ON AND ON with all the amazing things here.
It isnt a massive place, but who really wants that anyway? It had PLENTY of room to do anything I needed.
This is a great vacation spot for a family, in the state park with multiple lake options, frisbee golf, hiking, and not far off the beaten path.
Brittany was super responsive and gave clear details on getting in which i really appreciate.
Thank you for offering this place as an option. Sharing it with others allows it to truly shine to more than just you, which we all appreciate!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Another great stay at this private cabin. Brittany is very quick to respond to questions, and the lake is so beautiful!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay! Loved having the kayaks and the deck!
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We booked this for our 38th wedding anniversary. What a great spot to unplug for a few days. Relaxation & tranquility is what awaits at Sparkling Springs. We went hiking, had a bonfire & used the canoe & kayaks for fishing every day. We had the entire lake to ourselves during our stay. Absolutely beautiful!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A beautiful, quiet location with lots to do on site. We definitely hope to visit again."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This AirBnB is THE destination, not just the stop over.
The exclusivity and the seclusion is just what we were looking for. Pictures do not do this place justice, the views are great (no other home in sight, with beautiful sunsets), silence so quiet you hear fish jump across the lake. to be honest, yes there is a road not far away, but it's a country road with rare traffic.
The house is fully ready to relax indoors or out, i enjoyed grilling for our group after enjoying time on the water. .. tip, ask about the sandbar you can get to.
Lastly, I loved the views laying in mstr bdrm, waking up next to mi amore and looking out over the lake. We will be back!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful spot. Very peaceful and well equipped. Loved it and we will be back
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful location. Nice and clean, secluded."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This property is just amazing! The cabin is clean and has everything you need. The view of the lake is beautiful and serene. The water is clear and great for swimming, kayaking and fishing. The location is secluded in the woods but just a few miles from restaurants (and an ice cream shop!) if you don’t want to cook. We enjoyed how calm and quiet the back deck was. We’ll certainly be back."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our 2 night stay at this cabin! The cabin was very clean and as described. Our kids enjoyed the kayaks, paddle board, and floaties. My husband loved that the mountain bike trails were right across from the driveway. Lots of options of things to do at Kickapoo and the surrounding area. Definitely adding an extra night or two next time! Great place for making memories or just relaxing on the deck!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Everything was great. So peaceful and private. The lake is so clear and perfect for swimming, floating kayaking, and fishing. We loved everything about our weekend. Host answered our questions immediately. If you are thinking about staying here you will not be disappointed. We can’t wait to come back!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is amazing! So secluded and private, the lake is beautiful and clean, and the cabin has everything you need. Can't wait to book my next stay here."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is located on such a beautiful property, close to town yet feels so private. The sunsets on the lake were beautiful, and the water like glass reflecting the trees around it. Really lovely. The cabin was clean, comfortable and was perfect for my family of 4."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful location., very secluded. Home was clean and tidy, and stocked with all the essentials."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful views of the lake! Such a peaceful and quite weekend getaway! Loved having the kayaks available to explore the lake. We will be back!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really loved this little cabin. The lake is cool, deep, clear, and very peaceful. It's rare these days to find a lake that's not packed with houses all the way around, but that's exactly what you'll get here. The whole time we were there, we only saw one other person on the lake, and that was only briefly. I think there are maybe 3-4 houses on the whole of the lake, including this cabin. So it's very quiet, and great for paddleboarding, kayaking, fishing, etc., especially if you've got kids and don't want to worry about fighting other boat traffic.
The house itself is pretty small, but it would be great for a small family of 2-5. All the amenities are there, and the hosts even provide kayaks, a paddleboard, and a canoe for your use. You're also very close to Kickapoo State Park which offers even more hiking and water-related activities.
Brittany was very easy to work with, always responded to my questions quickly, and the check-in process was smooth and easy.
All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed our time here. I'm really hoping to make it back, and I'll bring my fishing pole next time!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was the perfect place for our multi-state family to gather for an extended weekend! There was something for everyone: we fished, kayaked, grilled suppers, jumped off the dock, and biked & hiked in the state park. Who cared that there wasn't wifi?!? It was the perfect gathering place for family, and we look forward to coming back again!"
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was clean. Note, the expressway was a little noisy,"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an amazing place for nature lovers. We were able to see wildlife each night, and enjoy fishing from the dock daily. Everything provided was above and beyond. Communication with Brittany was also seamless. Will definitely be staying here again!"
